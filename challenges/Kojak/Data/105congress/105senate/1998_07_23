Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Commerce/Justice/State bill. At 9:15 a.m. the \nSenate will vote in relation to the Craig amendment followed by a vote \nin relation to the underlying Kyl amendment. Following those votes, \nunder a previous consent agreement, the Senate will debate several \namendments to be offered to the C.J.S. bill. At the conclusion of that \ndebate, which is expected by early afternoon, the Senate will proceed \nto a stacked series of votes in relation to those amendments. Following \ndisposition of all amendments in order, it is expected that the Senate \nwill quickly proceed to final passage of the Commerce/Justice/State \nappropriations bill. Upon completion of the C.J.S. bill it is hoped \nthat the Senate will begin consideration of the transportation \nappropriations bill. Therefore Members should expect another late night \nsession with votes as the Senate attempts to make progress on the \nremaining appropriations bills. I thank my colleagues for their \nattention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8815-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill, \nS. 2260, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2260) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary, and related \n     agencies for fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Kyl/Bryan amendment No. 3266, to prohibit Internet \n     gambling.\n       Craig modified amendment No. 3268 (to amendment No. 3266), \n     to clarify that Indian gaming is subject to Federal \n     jurisdiction.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3268\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes for debate, divided in the usual form, on amendment No. 3268, \noffered by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since Senator Craig is not here, without \nimpinging on the time, I ask unanimous consent that the Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Coats, as well as Senators Enzi, Bond, and McConnell, \nbe added as cosponsors of the amendment of the Senator from Nevada and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, perhaps Senator Craig would like to call for \na vote on both his amendment and the underlying amendment. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order to request \nthe yeas and yeas.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join the Senator and ask for the yeas and \nnays on the Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S8816]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I understand each side has 5 minutes. If \nthe desk will notify me when I have used 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, my amendment to the Kyl amendment attempts to clarify \nwhat I think is important that we do. The Indian Affairs Committee has \nthe authority to hold hearings to move legislation, to bring it to the \nfloor as it relates to Indian gaming. We created IGRA, the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act, and the National Indian Gaming Commission for \nthe purpose of regulating Indian gaming. Indian gaming is regulated.\n\n  But the Senator from Arizona, without hearings on this in the \nauthorizing committee, steps in and makes significant changes in the \nIndian gaming law. Now, the Senator from Arizona and I agree that \ngaming ought to be regulated; it ought to be controlled, the access \nought to be controlled. We want it limited. But in this case, it isn't \na matter of limiting, it is a matter of outlawing, stopping something \nthat is already out there, already working, already has stood the test \nof officialdom, and we believe it meets those standards, and that is \nthe National Indian Lottery. So I hope that my colleagues will stand \nwith me in saying we want regulation and control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate that. We don't want this kind of stepping in \nand simply wiping out, with the appropriate committee not holding a \nhearing to understanding what is exactly going on. That is the intent \nof my amendment--to maintain the integrity of the National Indian \nGaming Commission and the recognition of the relationships between the \nIndian Nations and the United States itself and the treaty relationship \nthat is clear and has been well established.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I oppose the Craig amendment, which will \nchange gambling in the United States as we currently know it. It will \ngive legal validity to the claims that the tribes have that they can \nprovide gambling all over the United States. They cannot; it is \nillegal. This amendment would give them a monopoly on the Internet in \nevery home in America, without any age discrimination. That is the \nreason we require it to be on premises, so we can check to see if kids \nare gambling. This will eliminate enforcement in States like mine where \nwe have had a referendum on gambling.\n  It was defeated 2-to-1 in every single county in our State. We do not \nwant gambling in Wyoming. We defeated it soundly. This would allow \ngambling in Wyoming. This would give national legal validity. This will \nreplace lotteries across the State, when they can finally advertise it \nto the extent that they really want to do it. This will provide for \neventual, complete electronic gambling for every home in America, \nwithout any State being able to oppose it.\n  I ask you to oppose the Craig amendment and support the Kyl \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am in support of Senator Kyl, but I \nmust state my objection to Senator Craig's amendment.\n  In my career in the U.S. Congress, representing Atlantic City, I have \nnever risen on the floor to oppose gaming. But this is too much. All of \nour communities have a right to decide when and where we want gaming. \nWe restricted it to one city in New Jersey. Under Senator Craig's \namendment, every living room, every child's bedroom in America will \nbecome a gaming parlor. The Internet will bring gaming to children, and \nit won't be restricted to problem gamers. There will not be any \ncontrol. If we want to have Indian tribes having Indian gaming, let \nthem do it on their reservation. That is their right, their \nsovereignty. But my State has sovereignty, too. We have decided not to \nallow gaming in every community. Some States, like Utah, and many of \nyour States, have decided not to have it at all. Now it will be imposed \nupon you with a monopoly of gaming on the Internet, available to \neveryone. I urge my colleagues to defeat the Craig amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to address some of the statements \nthat were made in our debate last evening on Senator Craig's amendment \non Senator Kyl's amendment on internet gaming.\n  First, Mr. President, I want to make clear that the amendment we \npropose absolutely would not exempt Indian tribal governments and \nIndian gaming from the purview of the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act.\n  Rather, the amendment allows only the conduct of those games with the \napplication of technology--not internet technology--but the application \nof television and satellite-generated technology that we envisioned \ncould be used for the conduct of bingo or games that are subject to a \ntribal-state compact under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  The language on page eleven of Senator Kyl's amendment makes it \nabundantly clear that each person placing or receiving or otherwise \nmaking a bet or wager must be physically located on Indian land and \nthat class III games must be conducted consistent with a tribal-state \ncompact and only in the state to which the compact applies.\n  So we are not proposing to exempt Indian gaming from the internet \ngaming prohibitions outlined in Senator Kyl's amendment.\n  Secondly, I would want my colleague from Arizona to know that as we \nread it, there is an ambiguity in the amendment.\n  States are authorized to enforce the provisions of this amendment, \nshould it become law, for violations by a person.\n  The term ``person'' includes ``any government''--which must refer to \ntribal governments, because all other levels of government are \nspecifically mentioned.\n  Thus, while one section of the bill would restrict state authority to \nwhat is provided in tribal state compacts, another section of the bill \ngives states broad authority to enforce the act as it may relate to the \nconduct of tribal governments.\n  Senator Craig's amendment would simply preserve the status quo and \nmaintain the integrity of the pervasive federal regulatory scheme in \nwhich federal criminal laws are enforced by the United States on Indian \nlands--a framework, which as I said last evening, has been in place for \nover one hundred years.\n  I thank my colleague from Idaho and I wish to assure my colleague \nfrom Arizona that I look forward to continuing to work with him as this \nbill proceeds to conference to address these two matters that I have \noutlined.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I inquire how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. I yield 1 minute 20 seconds to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Craig amendment. Three \nmillion children in America today are on line on the Internet. By the \nyear 2000, 15 million children will be on the Internet.\n  Senator Kyl and I have offered an amendment which takes a public \npolicy which I think every parent in America will support; that is, to \nprohibit gambling on the Internet. There simply is no way to control \naccess to the Internet and to the types of gambling that are offered.\n  If the Craig amendment is adopted, that policy is effectively \nemasculated.\n  I join with the junior Senator from Arizona in asking this body to \ndefeat the amendment because every child and every home in America that \nis on the Internet will have access to gambling on the Internet.\n  My view is that there is no public policy that would support, in \neffect, a carve-out to say that we prohibit gambling on the Internet in \nAmerica for everyone except Indian tribes. That makes no sense, may I \nrespectfully submit to the Presiding Officer and to my colleagues.\n  If you believe, as Senator Kyl and I do, that Internet gambling \nshould be regulated and that we should not have\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\naccess to Internet gambling by children, vote against the Craig \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho wishes to close. \nTherefore, let me reiterate the key points that the Senator from New \nJersey, and also the Senators from Wyoming and Nevada, have made; that \nis, that you cannot have any exceptions to a national prohibition on \nInternet gambling if you want the policy to work, because if anyone can \ndo it, then the gambling can occur in the homes, in the privacy of the \nhomes around this country by children, by problem gamblers, or by \nanyone else if there is any exception because the Internet reaches \nacross interstate boundaries. It knows no boundaries. It reaches into \nany State. And no State can protect its citizens and protect its public \npolicy of outlawing this activity.\n  I want to make it very clear that this activity is not being \nconducted legally today.\n  In a letter written by the State attorneys general, including the \nattorney general of Idaho on this precise point, the attorneys general \nsaid,\n\n       If Internet gaming is allowed to facilitate the remote \n     placing of bets on an Indian gaming activity, the ultimate \n     absurdity would result. The logical consequence of such a \n     position is that any off-reservation telephone, computer with \n     a modum et cetera, would become a gambling device by which \n     the consumer could communicate with the tribe for the purpose \n     of gambling.\n\n  And they specifically refer to the Coeur d'Alene Tribe in Idaho, \nwhich is the tribe that the Senator from Idaho wants to permit to \ngamble.\n  I urge a vote against the Craig amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona quotes a letter \ncrafted in 1992. Since that time, the tribe in the State of Idaho has a \ncompact that has been established. The attorney general of the State of \nIdaho believes this is significant.\n  The topic of children is an interesting item. The Presiding Officer, \nI and everyone else is very concerned with children's access to the \nInternet. We recognize the need to provide legislation to block that, \nand we should.\n  What I am talking about is something that is already official, that \nis already underway, and we have not heard a great hue and cry about \nthe damaging of or the destruction of children.\n  There is something else that is interesting.\n  We heard from New Jersey and we heard from Nevada. They are \nprotecting their big gaming interests. There are already exceptions in \nthis bill.\n  There are five exceptions in this bill to use the Internet system to \ntraffic information about gaming.\n  The Senator is not pure on this. Let's be real, and let's be honest \nabout it. Let's use the committees we have. Let's use the law, the \nrules, and regulations to govern, control, and regulate Indian gaming \nstructured in a certain way to protect it so that children don't have \naccess to it; so that there is an official screening process; that it \nis effectively monitored and controlled.\n  I agree that we ought to control the Internet system, and we ought to \nmake sure that there is not unlimited access. That is exactly what we \nare trying to do here today.\n  But let's not destroy the laws that we have created for Native \nAmericans in this country--the controls, and the regulatory system that \nis established out there.\n  We heard from the former chairman of the committee. We have already \nheard from the chairman of the committee. He is saying no hearings were \nheld. A Senator from outside the committee reaches in and changes \nsubstantially the structure of the IGRA law and the National Indian \nGaming Commission law.\n  What I am telling you this morning is that you have an option to keep \nwhole the law of the land, which we crafted to control Indian gaming, \nwhile at the same time protecting the Internet from open access from \noffshore gaming from the kind of things that the Senator from Arizona \nhas an absolute right to be concerned about. I, too, am concerned, and \nI hope that my colleagues will join with me in voting for the Craig \namendment to protect the integrity of the Indian Gaming Commission, and \nthe national Indian gaming law that we have established.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what is the situation now? Are we prepared \nto go to that vote unless I use leader time at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I give myself such leader time as I might use. I will be \nbrief, because I know Members are expecting to vote right away.\n  But I rise to speak against the Craig amendment. I have a long \nhistory of being interested in and concerned about the rights and \nguarantees that we have given Indian tribes. We have one in my home \nState that has been very industrious. They are really good \nentrepreneurs and good citizens. I enjoy working with them very much. \nBut this is something beyond that. This would give them ability to get \ninto Internet gambling in a way that it could go into every school and \nevery home all across America.\n  This is not about tribal rights on their reservation or within their \ntribal areas. This goes across America. To have a special carve-out for \nIndian tribes on gambling, I think, is just a fundamental mistake.\n  I understand why the Senator from Idaho feels he must do that. I \nunderstand that there have been some court actions about it. But I also \nthink there is a fundamental principle here. And this violates that \nprinciple. They should not be given an opportunity that nobody else in \nAmerica would have. It touches all Americans.\n  I am always hesitant to rise in opposition to my friend and my \ncoleader in the Republican Party. But I think in this instance he is \njust fundamentally wrong.\n  I urge colleagues to vote against the Craig amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Idaho. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 18, nays 82, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 228 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--18\n\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     McCain\n     Moynihan\n     Stevens\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--82\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3268) was rejected.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was rejected.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3266\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate now will have 2 minutes, under the \nprevious agreement, for debate on the Kyl amendment.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I thank everyone for the last vote.\n  The point is, if you are going to ban an activity because the public \npolicy of all 50 States is that their children and\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nthe families in those States should be protected from this activity, if \nyou ever allowed one exception, then because of the nature of the \nInternet, you wouldn't have a bill.\n  I appreciate that, and I think that clears the way for passage of the \nInternet Gambling Prohibition Act. I note for the Record some of the \norganizations that support this legislation: Ralph Nader's Public \nCitizen, the Christian Coalition, the Focus on the Family and Family \nResearch Council, National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling and \nAgainst Gambling Expansion.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Will Members please \ncease all conversations?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, sports organizations, in particular, are \nobviously very much afraid of the adulteration of professional and \namateur sports. As a result, groups like the National Amateur Athletic \nAssociation, Major League Baseball, NFL, NBA, National Hockey League, \nNational Soccer League, and, of course, law enforcement and all 50 \nStates attorneys general support this legislation. In fact, it is \nbecause of them that we are proposing it. We can't protect the citizens \nof our States unless we have legislation of this kind.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend Senator Kyl for his hard work \nand determination in bringing S. 474 to the floor today. I am most \nappreciative that during the process, you have worked closely with \nseveral parimutuel industry groups to make certain that S. 474 does not \nunduly restrict Internet commerce. The bill reflects a clear \nunderstanding of this emerging medium and its potential for both honest \nand unscrupulous purposes.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to engage the Senator from \nArizona in a short colloquy. This is a complicated bill. It addresses \nareas where technology is rapidly evolving. Some of my questions may be \nfairly arcane and will be of interest only to those intimately familiar \nwith the intricacies of the interstate simulcasting of horse racing so \nI ask that my fellow members be patient with us as we work our way \nthrough some of these issues.\n  Senator Kyl, as you are well aware, there are a myriad of federal and \nstate laws and regulations that impact interstate simulcasting. In \nevery instance, I will assume that we are addressing only the \napplication of the language of S. 474 and not the general legality of \nany specific example given. With that understanding, I will proceed \nwith the first of my questions.\n  Senator Kyl, am I correct that S. 474 does not apply to racetracks \nthat may advertise or make past performances, how-to-bet, promotional, \nand other similar kinds of information available whether via a \nracetrack World Wide Web site on the Internet or other technological \nmedia.\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n            information assisting in placing a bet or wager\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, I now want to discuss the impact of S. \n474 on the current practice of the horse racing industry commonly \nreferred to as ``simulcasting and commingling of parimutuel pools.'' \nSimulcasting of horse racing across the country and around the world \nhas grown exponentially in recent years, to the point that simulcasting \nnow accounts for as much as 60 percent of the industry's total \nwagering.\n  To foster growth in the simulcasting market, tracks now routinely \nmerge or commingle the parimutuel pools from several tracks and off \ntrack parimutuel facilities into common parimutuel pools. Current odds \nand winning payoffs are then calculated using a totalizator system. \nCommingling is a practice preferred by bettors because it increases \npool sizes and thus helps to minimize the fluctuation of odds and \npayoffs.\n  Any diminution in its current ability to simulcast or commingle pools \ncould have catastrophic effects on the parimutuel industry.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator McConnell, I assure you S. 474 is not intended to \nlimit the racing industry's activities in the area of simulcasting and \ncommingling of parimutuel pools.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, I appreciate your willingness to consider \nthe parimutuel industry. Now, if I may clarify a few more points.\n  Section 2 of the bill exempts four categories from the definition of \n``information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager.'' My next few \nquestions relate to the applicability of these provisions.\n  First, Senator Kyl, as to the first category of exempt information, \nfound in subsection (8)(C)(i), am I correct in assuming that ``common \npool parimutuel pooling'' and ``commingling of parimutuel pools'' are \ntwo names for the same process--the merging of parimutuel pools from \ntwo or more locations for purposes of calculating the odds and payoffs?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, you are correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, according to subsection (8)(C)(i) in \nsection 2 of the bill, information concerning parimutuel pools that is \nexchanged between certain racetracks or other parimutuel facilities is \nexempted from the prohibition on ``information assisting in the placing \nof a bet or wager'' so long as that information is ``used only to \nconduct common pool parimutuel pooling.'' Does this mean that a \nracetrack or other parimutuel facility may accept wagers on races run \nat another facility (known as the Host Track), whether the Host Track \nis located within the same state or in another state or foreign \ncountry, and commingle its parimutuel pools into the parimutuel pools \nat the Host Track?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, commingling of wagers as you describe is permitted by \nS. 474. However, each facility that participates in the pools must be \nlicensed by the state or approved by the laws of the foreign \njurisdiction in which it operates.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What if the Host Track located in one state utilizes a \ntotalizator system located in a second state or even a foreign \ncountry--could a racetrack or parimutuel facility located in either the \nhost state or a third state commingle wagers on races run at the Host \nTrack into the parimutuel pools at the Host Track without violating S. \n474?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, assuming each facility that participates in the pools \nis duly licensed by the State or approved by the laws of the foreign \njurisdiction in which it operates. Subsection (8)(C)(ii) states that \n``information exchanged between'' certain racetracks or other \nparimutuel facilities and ``a support service located in another State \nor foreign jurisdiction'' is not considered ``information assisting in \nthe placing of a bet or wager'' if ``the information is used only for \nprocessing bets or wagers made by or with that facility under \napplicable law.''\n  The location of the totalizator or other similar system used to \nprocess parimutuel pools is irrelevant if the parimutuel pools are \ntransmitted from and received by facilities each of which is licensed \nby the State or approved by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in \nwhich it operates.\n  Similarly, commingling may require the use of data transmission or \nphone lines that pass through numerous states. In such event, it is \nirrelevant whether parimutuel wagering is legal in all such states. The \nonly relevant inquiry is whether each of which is licensed by the State \nor approved by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which it \noperates.\n  The term ``support system'' should be read broadly to mean any system \nor service necessary to transmit or process information related to the \ncommingling of parimutuel pools, including totalizator systems, \ntelephone lines, and other similar technological devices essential to \nthe commingling process.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What if the host for the wagering pools is in one \nstate or foreign country, the totalizator is in a second state or \nforeign country, and the race is actually contested in a third state or \nforeign country. Could commingling of pools take place under this \narrangement without violating S. 474?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, assuming each facility that participates in the pools \nis duly licensed by the State or approved by the laws of the foreign \njurisdiction in which it operates. As I states earlier, the location of \nthe totalizator or other similar system used to process parimutuel \nwagers is irrelevant if the parimutuel pools are transmitted to or from \nfacilities each of which is licensed by the State or approved by the \nlaws of\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\nthe foreign jurisdiction in which it operates.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, the phrase ``approved by the foreign \njurisdiction in which the facility is located'' is used throughout \nsubsection (8)(C). In some foreign countries, the law may simply permit \nsimulcasting and commingling of pari-mutuel pools without requiring \nformal approval by a regulatory authority. I presume that in such \ncases, S. 474's approval requirement will be satisfied.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator McConnell, you are correct.\n\n\n                    account and interactive wagering\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, I would like to discuss the impact of S. \n474 on account wagering. It is presently legal, and operating to \nvarying degrees, in eight states. Other states are presently \nconsidering this form of wagering on racing. The horse racing industry \nwants to be able to continue account wagering and other similar \nactivities that utilize emerging technologies. A variety of federal and \nstate statutes and regulations now govern this activity and together, \nthey form a capable regulatory system for parimutuel wagering. Again, \nany restriction on the current regulatory structure might unduly hamper \none of racing's most promising areas for growth.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator McConnell, what I stated earlier with respect to \nsimulcasting and commingling of parimutuel pools applies equally to \naccount wagering. This bill is not intended to hamper the future growth \nof horse racing.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, again, I appreciate your willingness to \nconsider the parimutuel industry. Now, if I may clarify a few more \npoints.\n  Section 3 of the bill broadly prohibits both individuals and persons \nengaged in a gambling business from placing, receiving, or otherwise \nmaking a bet or wager through the Internet or any other interactive \ncomputer service. Then, subsection (e) of that section grants two \nexceptions related to racing: one is an exception for wagers placed by \npersons physically present at a racetrack or parimutuel facility; a \nsecond exception is provided for persons placing, making, or receiving \na parimutuel wager on a ``closed-loop subscriber-based service that is \nwholly intrastate.''\n  My first question is this. Am I correct in my analysis that S. 474 \ndoes not prohibit or restrict account wagering by telephone?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, the bill does not address telephone account wagering.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Am I correct that an interactive account wagering \nsystem that uses a variety of communications media and computer \ntechnology to present audio and/or video information about the races to \nthe home and to communicate wagers from the home to a racetrack or \nparimutuel facility constitutes an ``interactive computer service.''\n  Mr. KYL. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will such an interactive account wagering system that \naccepts wagers only from account holders physically located within the \nsame state as the facility where the account wagering system originates \npass muster under section 3 of S. 474?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, assuming the interactive account wagering system meets \nthe requirements for a ``closed loop subscriber-based service'' as \ndefined in section 3 of the bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, does a person have to be physically \npresent at a facility that is open to the public to make a lawful \ninteractive account wager?\n  Mr. KYL. Again, so long as the person placing the wager is doing so \nusing a ``closed-loop subscriber-based service'' the person is not \nrequired to be physically present at a facility that is open to the \npublic to make a lawful wager.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What if the facts are the same as my first interactive \naccount wagering question (i.e., both customer and facility are \nphysically present in the same state) but the race on which the account \nholder is wagering is being contested in another state or foreign \ncountry and the facility where the account wagering system originates \nis commingling its pools, including its account wagering pools, into \nthe pools of the out-of-state host track where the race is being run. \nWill this fit within the exceptions found in Section 3 of S. 474?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, assuming of course that the wagering pools are being \ncommingled in accordance with section 2 of the bill and further \nassuming the account wagering system meets the requirements for a \n``closed loop subscriber-based service.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, just a few more questions and we will be \nfinished.\n  In section 3, Section 1085(e)(2) of the bill, you prohibit the use of \nan agent or proxy to place wagers unless the agent or proxy is acting \non behalf of a licensed parimutuel facility ``in the operation of the \naccount wagering system owned or operated by the parimutuel facility.'' \nWhat if a facility licensed to operate an account wagering system \nengages a separate company to provide the technical expertise necessary \nto implement an interactive account wagering system on its behalf. \nWould such an agency fall within the scope of the permitted agency \nprovisions of the bill referenced above?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, such a system is an allowed agent, assuming, of course, \nthe interactive account wagering system meets the requirements for a \n``closed-loop subscriber-based service that is wholly intrastate.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. thinking back to our earlier discussion of a ``support \nservice,'' what if the facility where the interactive account wagering \nsystem originates chooses to utilize support services such as a \ntotalizator system or an interactive computer system located in a \nsecond state or even a foreign country to service the account holders.\n  Mr. KYL. The use of such support services does not change the result \nassuming the account wagering system meets the requirements for a \n``closed loop subscriber-based service that is wholly intrastate.'' As \nstated previously, the location of the totalizator, path of the phone \nlines, or the site of other similar support systems is irrelevant.\n\n\n                              enforcement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Finally, Senator Kyl, section 4 of the bill spells out \nin great detail the civil remedies available to U.S. Attorneys and \nState Attorneys General to enforce the provisions of S. 474. Section 5 \nlikewise calls for the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \nSecretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General of the United States \nand the Secretary of Commerce, to commence negotiations with foreign \ncountries in order to conclude international agreements that would \nenable the United States to enforce the bill.\n  Nonetheless, many are concerned that this legislation will be \ndifficult to enforce. If the only entities that obey it are the \nlegitimate, state-licensed parimutuel operators, which they will, while \nothers outside the jurisdictions of the federal and state authorities \ndo not, then you still have the potential for consumer fraud while not \nproducing any revenues for the federal government, state governments or \nthe racing industry itself.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator McConnell, I am confident that the Justice \nDepartment and the National Association of Attorneys General will \nvigorously enforce this legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Kyl, once again I thank you and your staff for \nyour hard work and tenacity in bringing this issue before the Senate. I \nalso thank you for your patience in working through these very \ncomplicated issues.\n  Mr. KYL. Senator McConnell, you are welcome. I am very pleased that \nwe have been able to work together to protect legitimate, law abiding \ninterests who make significant contributions to the nation's economy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have long been an advocate for \nlegislation that ensures that existing laws keep pace with developing \ntechnology. It is for this reason that I have sponsored and supported \nover the past few years a host of bills to bring us into the 21st \nCentury. These bills have included the National Information \nInfrastructure (NII) Protection Act of 1995; the Criminal Copyright \nImprovement Act of 1997; the WIPO Copyright and Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty Implementation Act of 1997; the Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act of 1998; and legislation that passed the Senate on June \n26, 1998, to authorize the comprehensive independent study of the \neffects on trademark and intellectual property rights holders of adding \nnew generic top-level domains and related dispute resolution \nprocedures.\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\n  This same impetus underlies my support of legislation to ensure our \nnation's gambling laws keep pace with developing technology, \nparticularly the Internet. The Department of Justice has noted that \n``the Internet may have diminished the effectiveness of current \ngambling statutes, in part because existing laws may relate only to \nsports betting and not the type of interactive gambling (e.g., poker) \nthat the Internet makes possible.'' Vermonters have spoken very clearly \nthat they do not want certain types of gambling permitted in the state, \nand they do not want current laws to be rendered obsolete by the \nInternet. I believe, therefore, that there is considerable value in \nupdating our Federal gambling statutes, and I have been pleased to work \nwith Senator Kyl on his legislation intended to accomplish that goal, \nthe Internet Gambling Prohibition Act of 1998.\n  The legislation has been improved since it eas reported out of \ncommittee.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee reported out the bill on October 23, \n1997. Although I voted in favor of the legislation at that time, I \nnoted that I had several concerns about the bill and that I wished to \nwork with Senator Kyl and others to address these concerns.\n  The bill as originally drafted might have inadvertently outlawed the \ntri-state lottery that is run by the states of Vermont, New Hampshire \nand Maine. Although Vermonters have clearly indicated that they do not \nwant many other forms of gambling, they do want to maintain this tri-\nstate lottery, which has been in operation since 1985.\n  The legislation now under consideration states that the prohibitions \nagainst Internet gambling in the bill shall not apply to any otherwise \nlawful bet or wager that is placed, received, or otherwise made for a \nmulti-state lottery operated jointly between two or more States in \nconjunction with State lotteries, if the lottery or activity is \nexpressly authorized and licensed or regulated under Federal or \napplicable State law.\n  I would like to thank the office of Vermont's Attorney General for \nworking with Senator Kyl and me to craft this language to ensure that \nVermont, New Hampshire and Maine's tri-state lottery remains a \npermissible activity under this bill.\n  As originally introduced, the bill contained Sense of the Senate \nlanguage that the Federal Government should have extraterritorial \njurisdiction over the transmission to or receipt from the United States \nof bets or wagers, information assisting in the placing of bets or \nwagers, and any communication that entitles the transmitter or \nrecipient to the opportunity to receive money or credit as a result of \nbets or wagers.\n  That provision was changed, and when the bill was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee, the Sense of the Senate provision was replaced \nwith a requirement that not later than six months after the date of \nenactment, certain Administration officials would be required to \ncommence negotiations with foreign countries in order to conclude \ninternational agreements that would enable the United States to enforce \nthe bill.\n  I was concerned about the constitutionality of this new requirement \nmandating that the Executive Branch undertake international \nnegotiations, particularly in light of the decision of the 1993 U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Earth Island Institute versus \nChristopher. The court in this case held unconstitutional a portion of \na statute which directed the Secretary of State to initiate \ninternational negotiations regarding the protection and conservation of \na certain species of sea turtles.\n  Specifically, the court held this type of directive to intrude upon \nthe conduct of foreign relations by the Executive Branch on the grounds \nthat the ``Constitution commits the power to make treaties to the \nPresident.''\n  The Department of Justice also recommended the deletion of this \nsection. As Anthony Sutin, Acting Assistant Attorney General, stated in \nhis May 28, 1998, letter to me on this legislation:\n\n       If we request that foreign countries investigate, on our \n     behalf, conduct that is legal in the foreign state, we must \n     be prepared to receive and act upon foreign requests for \n     assistance when the conduct complained of is legal, or even \n     constitutionally protected, in the United States.\n       For example, if we ask a foreign country to investigate an \n     activity (e.g., gambling) that is legal in the foreign state, \n     that country may, for example, ask us to investigate \n     constitutionally protected speech originating on computers \n     based in the United States (e.g., that arguably violates that \n     nation's ``hate speech'' laws). Considering all of the \n     challenges facing law enforcement in the information age, we \n     believe that current efforts should focus on conduct which \n     either is, or should be, universally condemned.\n\n  Senator Kyl agreed to my request that this section of the bill be \ndeleted, and I believe that the legislation is considerably improved \nfor that reason.\n  Another constitutional concern was raised by earlier versions of the \nbill that stated that ``information assisting in the placing of a bet \nor wager''--``(A) means information that is intended by the sender or \nrecipient to be used by a person engaged in the business of betting or \nwagering to accept or place a bet or wager; (B) includes any \ninformation that invites the information described in subparagraph (A) \nto be transmitted;'' and then included some exceptions.\n  I was concerned, as was the Department of Justice, that this language \nwas vague and might raise constitutional concerns as it might be \nconstrued to apply to persons who do not have the intent to participate \nin or assist illegal gambling transactions. Similarly, these earlier \nversions of the legislation could have been interpreted to prohibit \nInternet advertising of activities that are entirely legal. This \nappeared to be an unintentional result of the earlier versions, but one \nthat raised serious constitutional issues.\n  The Department of Justice suggested deleting subsection (B) \naltogether, and inserting the phrase ``in violation of state or Federal \nlaw'' at the end of subsection (A). The addition of this latter phrase \nwould ensure that transmission of information assisting in the placing \nof legal bets or wagers would not be criminalized by this legislation. \nSenator Kyl agreed to delete subsection (B), but he did not add the \nphrase ``in violation of state or Federal law'' at the end of \nsubsection (A). I hope this later suggestion by the Department of \nJustice is accepted as the legislation moves through the legislative \nprocess.\n  In the bill as originally introduced, an individual bettor who was \nfound guilty of Internet gambling would have been subject to a penalty \nof $5,000, one year of prison or both. I thought that penalty was \nextreme. If someone places a $1 bingo bet over the Internet, that might \nnot be activity we want to encourage, but I also do not think we need \nto lock that individual up in prison and charge him or her 5,000 times \nthat amount in penalties. I expressed my view to Senator Kyl, and as a \nresult he softened the penalty for individual bettors.\n  As the bill currently reads, the individual bettor would be subject \nto (A) fines not more than the greater of (i) three times the greater \nof the total amount that the individual is found to have wagered or \nreceived or (ii) $500; (B) 3 months prison; or (C) both. I hope that \nprosecutors and judges will use proper discretion when determining, \neven under this more reasonable regime, whether to expend federal \nresources prosecuting and imprisoning individuals who place de minimis \nbets.\n  The bill as introduced criminalized the activities of those persons \nengaged in the ``business of betting or wagering,'' but the bill did \nnot define what constituted a ``business of betting or wagering.'' I \nbelieve that it is important that if Congress is going to make certain \nactivities illegal, and subject the executor of that activity to hefty \nmonetary fines and imprisonment, we need to be very clear about what \nactivity, exactly, we are making illegal.\n  The version of the bill that is now under consideration makes it \nunlawful for a person engaged in a gambling business for betting or \nwagering to use the Internet or any other interactive computer service. \nThe bill defines the term ``gambling business'' as a gambling business \nthat involves one or more persons who conducts, finances, manages, \nsupervises, directs or owns all or part of such business and has been \nor remains in substantially continuous operation for a period in excess \nof 10 days or has a gross revenue of $2,000 or more during any 24-hour \nperiod.\n  Although I preferred to use the definition of an ``illegal gambling \nbusiness'' found in 18 U.S.C. 1955, I believe\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\nthe bill as it currently reads is an improvement from the original \nversion, and I appreciate Senator Kyl's willingness to work with me on \nthis issue.\n  In addition, language was inserted into the bill which dictates \nspecial rules that would apply in any proceeding instituted under the \nbill in which application is made for a temporary restraining order or \nan injunction against an interactive computer service. I was not party \nto the negotiations on this language, nor am I convinced that this \nlanguage is necessary. Courts, when determining the appropriateness of \nequitable relief, generally consider factors such as the significance \nof the threat of irreparable harm to a plaintiff if the injunction is \nnot granted; the state of the balance between this harm and the injury \nthat granting the injunction would inflict on the defendant; the \nprobability that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits; and the \npublic interest. It has not, to date, been demonstrated to me why these \ntraditional standards are not adequate to address situations involving \ninteractive computer services, and I fear that this new language in the \nbill might cause more mischief than it would cure. I hope that we can \ncontinue to work on this language as the bill advances through the \nlegislative process.\n  Finally, the Senate has accepted an amendment by Senator Bryan to \ninclude a provision addressing Internet games known as ``sports fantasy \nleagues''. I understand that many of the companies that offer these \nsports fantasy league games are concerned about the wording of this \nprovision. I also understand that they will be seeking refinements in \nthe language as we move through the legislative process, and I look \nforward to working with them as well as Senator Bryan and Senator Kyl \nin that regard.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to note that an interactive computer \nservice whose facilities or service are used by another person as a \nmeans of communication to engage in an activity prohibited by section \n1085, and where the interactive computer service does not have the \nintent that such facilities or service be used for such illegal \nactivity, shall not be considered to violate subsection (b)(1)(B).\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to direct a few comments to \nSenator Kyl's amendment adding the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act to \nS. 2260, the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. I join with \nmy colleague in opposing unrestricted gambling on the Internet, and I \nsupport the adoption of his amendment. However, there are often a \nvariety of reasonable approaches to a problem, and we should be careful \nnot to over-legislate. This is true especially with respect to a vital \nnew medium like the Internet which promises to be an engine of growth \nfor our economy and a source of unprecedented benefits to our citizens \nfor years to come. We need to think carefully before government \ncommandeers the electronic network, through online service providers, \nin the pursuit of conduct we don't like. While I do not object to \nasking service providers to cooperate in ways that do not involve \nsignificant expense or retard the growth and flow of Internet traffic, \nI am not convinced that the provisions of the current proposal strike \nthe proper balance. In addition, there is a high risk that we may \ninadvertently sap the vitality of the Internet if we start to require \nservice providers to serve as an arm of our law enforcement agencies. \nIt is my hope that we can address these concerns as we go to conference \nwith the House.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senators Kyl and Bryan with respect to gambling on \nthe Internet. I am an original cosponsor of S. 474, the Internet \nGambling Prohibition Act of 1997, as introduced in March of last year. \nI also sponsored the House version of this legislation in the 104th \nCongress because I am committed to preventing children's access to \ngambling on the Internet and the harm to the American public in general \nthat is sure to follow unregulated gaming.\n  Gambling in this country has always been a very regulated activity no \nmatter where it takes place. Unfortunately, we are now faced with a \npotential explosion of unregulated gambling--gambling on the Internet. \nStates have become so concerned about this problem that state \nattorney's general nationwide have filed suits against gambling \noperators on the Internet. The Kyl-Bryan amendment clearly defines \nobjectionable internet activity and establishes guidelines for law \nenforcement to crack down on those who solicit wagering on-line. The \nbill applies existing laws against telephone betting or wagering to all \nelectronic communications. This Internet gambling ban will be applied \nto those who accept bets and those who do the betting.\n  While the Internet provides our children with many educational \nopportunities, we must closely scrutinize the industry to ensure that \nchildren are not let into the world of unregulated gambling. Preventing \nchildren or addicted gamblers from being able to gamble in an \nunregulated fashion on their home computer must be one of our highest \npriorities as we venture into the new and dynamic area of regulating \nelectronic commerce.\n  However, as important as the Internet gambling ban legislation is to \nprotecting this nation's children, I feel compelled to state my \nconcerns about the impact of several provisions included in the pending \nversion of the Internet gambling ban legislation as they may impact \nIndian tribes. I want to take this opportunity to express my strong \nsupport for Senator Craig's second degree amendment aimed at addressing \nseveral of these provisions. Under the Kyl amendment, the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act (IGRA) would be amended without any involvement or input \nby the committee of jurisdiction, the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, \nor any tribal consultation.\n  Senator Craig's amendment would make certain that currently lawful \nactivities fully regulated by the federal government and permitted \nunder the IGRA are not impacted by the Kyl amendment. I believe the \nCraig amendment is not a carve-out or loophole for Indians, but merely \naims to preserve the IGRA process. The Craig amendment does not allow \nfor any new type of Indian gaming. Our emphasis today ought to focus on \nunregulated internet gaming. To the extent that Congress deals with \nregulated Indian gaming, it should do so in separate legislation with \ntribal input.\n  Like Senator Craig, I do not want to encourage special treatment or \nspecial exemptions for Indian tribes. I just expect equitable treatment \nof currently lawful gaming activities by tribes and, most importantly, \nI expect the Senate to respect the committee of jurisdiction on this \nissue and invite the input of impacted Indian tribes.\n  As the Indian tribes in my state will attest, Indian Gaming is a \nregulated industry. Poverty, unemployment, poor health and welfare \ndominate much of reservation life across the country. With budget cuts \nto the BIA and other federal support programs for Indians, Congress \nmust continue to encourage economic self sufficiency at the tribal \nlevel. If there are shortcomings with the effectiveness of the current \nIGRA, they should be addressed with tribal consultation. I am troubled \nat the prospect of Internet gambling sites opened by any entity, but \nagain, so far as this concern deals with already regulated Indian \ngaming, it ought to be addressed in separate legislation.\n  Nationwide, approximately 98 percent of all tribes use the revenue \ngenerated by casinos and bingo operations to provide housing, health \nservices, and education to tribal members. Federal law requires tribal \ngovernments to use gaming revenue to fund these essential services. It \nis properly up to each tribe to determine for itself whether it wants \nto permit regulated gaming within its boundaries. Frankly, I would \nprefer that other types of economic activity would take hold in Indian \ncountry, but I also recognize that in the eyes of many tribal leaders, \ngaming has proven to be the only successful economic growth option that \nhas worked. Our nation must have tightly regulated Indian gaming, but \nthe ultimate decision whether to permit gaming on a particular \nreservation should be with the tribe itself. I am committed to \nprotecting the interests of tribes in my state and across the country \nas they explore economic development through lawful gaming ventures.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I realize that this debate is clear \nevidence of the pressing need for Congress to revisit\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\nexisting Indian gaming regulations and law. I will urge the Senate \nIndian Affairs Committee to continue moving forward on this matter.\n  Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 474, I am nevertheless \ncommitted to the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act because the bottom \nline of this legislation is protecting our citizens and especially our \nkids. I am aware that the Justice Department believes overall \nenforcement of this law will be difficult, but I feel strongly that the \ntime has come for Congress to push this issue and instruct Justice to \ndevelop the necessary enforcement capabilities and end unlawful \nInternet gambling. I will support the Senators from Arizona and Nevada, \nand will work with the Senators and the conferees on this \nappropriations bill to address the remaining issues of concern to \ntribes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let's get it straight what this does. All \nof you came to me and said, ``I can't vote for the Craig amendment \nbecause it expands gambling on the Internet.'' What the Kyl amendment \ndoes is expands gambling.\n  Right now it is illegal to use the wire to place a bet. U.S. Code 18, \nsection 1084, Transmission of Wagering Information Penalties. Read it. \nI don't have a minute. It is illegal now.\n  What the Kyl amendment does is make what is now illegal legal for \ncertain carved-out exceptions which benefit--and there is nothing wrong \nwith this, depending on your interests--which benefit certain segments \nof the gambling industry. That is what this does.\n  If I had more than a minute, I would explain in more detail. This \nexpands gambling. It does not cut back on gambling. It expands it. What \nis now illegal in certain areas becomes legal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute on this issue.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, only if I have a minute in \nresponse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Objection.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I would \nlike to hear an additional minute----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a minute be \ngranted to the Senator from Delaware and a minute to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me say in response to my good friend, \nthe able Senator from Delaware, every States attorneys general in \nAmerica supports this amendment. Mr. Freeh, the Director of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, supports this amendment.\n  Under the current law, Internet gambling is spreading all over. There \nare 140 web sites, $1 billion. We seek to close that door. The Kyl-\nBryan amendment seeks to prohibit Internet gambling for everyone--for \neveryone--so it is not an expansion of gaming.\n  We want to take gambling off the Internet so kids, libraries, and \neverybody else who can dial up on the Internet these days will not have \naccess to an Internet gambling site. There are currently 140. That is \ntwice as many as the year before. A year from now, there will be 500 if \nwe don't close this hole. The Christian Coalition, everyone from major \nleague sports teams to the attorneys general to the consumer groups all \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator has expired. \nThe Senator from Delaware has 1 minute.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, that is the first part. Read the second \npart. It says, a little phrase says exceptions:\n\n       Exceptions--Otherwise lawful bets or wagers that are \n     placed, received or otherwise made wholly interstate for \n     State lotteries, racing or parimutuel activity.\n\n  Exceptions.\n  Let me point out one other thing. Under current Federal law, it is \nillegal to take a bet using a telephone wire, which means that under \ncurrent law, basically all Internet gambling is illegal because you use \na wire.\n  Under the Kyl amendment, it would become legal to take a bet on the \nInternet if the States where the bettor placed and received authorized \nthe bet and the bettor is a subscriber of a gambling company's network. \nThis is an expansion. Expansion.\n  If you want to do something about the Internet, strike exceptions, \nand I promise you, the sponsors will vote against this. Strike \nexceptions. If you don't want any betting using the wire, strike \n``exceptions.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3266.

Mr. President, I thank the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, especially Attorney General Dan Lungren and Attorney General \nJim Doyle, and Thomas Gede, Traci Sanders, Alan Kesner, and Stephen \nHiggins, of my staff, and Andy Vermilye of Senator Bryan's staff for \ntheir assistance in the bill which we have just passed. I appreciate \ntheir efforts very, very much.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Arizona \nand also Senator Bryan from Nevada for their leadership in and passage \nof their amendment.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COMPENSATION OF ATTORNEYS.\n\n       (a) Controlled Substances Act.--Section 408(q)(10) of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 848(q)(10)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (B) and (C) as \n     subparagraphs (C) and (D), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n       ``(B)(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     amount of compensation paid to each attorney appointed under \n     this subsection shall not exceed, for work performed by that \n     attorney during any calendar month, an amount determined to \n     be the amount of compensation (excluding health and other \n     employee benefits) that the United States Attorney for the \n     district in which the action is to be prosecuted receives for \n     the calendar month that is the subject to a request for \n     compensation made in accordance with this paragraph.\n       ``(ii) The court shall grant an attorney compensation for \n     work performed during any calendar month at a rate authorized \n     under subparagraph (A), except that such compensation may not \n     be granted for any calendar month in an amount that exceeds \n     the maximum amount specified in clause (i).''.\n       (b) Adequate Representation of Defendants.--Section \n     3006A(d)(3) of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Payment'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(A) In general.--Subject to subparagraph (B), payment''; \n     and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Maximum payments.--The payments approved under this \n     paragraph for work performed by an attorney during any \n     calendar month may not exceed a maximum amount determined \n     under section 408(q)(10)(B) of the Controlled Substances Act \n     (21 U.S.C. 848(q)(10)(B)).''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes equally divided on this \namendment. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The amendment I send to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Inhofe, and Senator Sessions would try to bring some balance on \nwhat we pay for court-appointed attorneys in Federal death penalty \ncases. Right now, we find out that in a case conducted in Colorado, the \nso-called McVeigh case, Oklahoma City bombing case, the defense \nattorneys--these are court-appointed, taxpayer-financed attorneys--are \ncompensated at a rate much higher than we pay U.S. attorneys.\n  I wasn't aware of this. I didn't know about it until the U.S. \nattorneys from Oklahoma mentioned to me that in some cases court-\nappointed defenders are paid at rates maybe three, four, or maybe five \ntimes as much as they are paid.\n  Just to give you the figures, the U.S. attorneys in most places \naround the country are paid $118,000.\n  A court-appointed defense attorney is paid $125 an hour. In some of \nthese cases, like the Oklahoma City bombing case, it is not \nunreasonable that they might work 80 hours or more per week. That means \nthey make $10,000 a week. A U.S. attorney makes $10,000 a month--\nactually, a little less than that. So the essence of this amendment is \nthat we should not compensate court-appointed attorneys more than we \npay U.S. attorneys. I might mention that in the Oklahoma City case, we \nhad a court-appointed attorney and I think 13 assistants, all of whom \nwould be eligible to receive these large sums.\n  So I thank my colleague, Senator Sessions, who is a former U.S. \nattorney, and also my colleague, Senator Inhofe. I hope we can adopt \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. I think \nit is an excellent amendment. It is an issue that we have raised a \nnumber of times at the subcommittee level with the judges. We are not \nonly concerned about the reimbursement schedules being skewed, but we \nare especially concerned about the fact that in capital crimes we are \nspending an extraordinary amount of money on defense counsel--over a \nmillion dollars in many instances. That comes right out of the \ntaxpayers' pockets. It is very difficult and it skews the entire \nability to do other defense work because of how much money is pouring \ninto the capital crime area.\n  This specific amendment is right on target. I strongly support it. I \nhope we will not have to go to a vote on it, but if we do, I hope we \ncan agree to this.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Senator Leahy of Vermont is presently \nconducting a hearing, and he is in opposition to this. He is unable to \nbe here to speak at this time.\n  I am persuaded by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I yield whatever time is necessary to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just state my understanding of \nthis. When I was in private practice--and I don't pretend to know the \ndetails of all the circumstances the Senator from Oklahoma is talking \nabout, but when I was court appointed to handle a case, I was expected, \nthrough that hourly fee that was granted to me, to cover all of my \ncosts, which meant the costs of my office, costs of my assistants, the \ncosts of everything.\n  Frankly, the hourly fee I got for court-appointed work was \nsubstantially less than the hourly fee I got for any other work. And I \nassume that is still the case. So I think to make the comparison he is \nmaking and say the U.S. attorney gets $118,000 and the court-appointed \nattorney gets $125 per hour, and that we should try to make a \ncomparison there, I think it is really very much apples to tangerines \nbecause, in fact, the U.S. attorney has a tremendous office \narrangement, with support of all kinds, in addition to his salary, \nwhereas the court-appointed attorney gets none of that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I want to make clear that \nwhat we are talking about is compensation. We are talking about \npayments, not about overhead. The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned \nthat in these Federal cases expenses are allowed. I am talking about \ncompensation. I also might mention that, in Oklahoma, I compared what \nwe pay in Oklahoma for a capital case; there is a $20,000 cap--$20,000 \nto the lead attorney, and for co-counsel, $5,000.\n  I might mention, on other cases on the Federal level--for a felony \ncase, we have caps at $3,500. All I am talking about is having a cap \nequal to the salary. So we are talking salaries, not about other \nbenefits.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, if I could ask the Senator, does his \namendment contain a cap as to each case? Is he saying that each capital \ncase will be limited to a certain amount that can be spent on the \ndefense attorney?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to my colleague, we are talking about so \nmuch, not per case, but per attorney. We didn't limit the number of \nattorneys. We just didn't want to be in a situation where a U.S. \nattorney is hiring additional counsel and to have the defense counsel \nsay, ``Hey, we can pay three or four times more. Come fight on our side \nof the case.''\n  Right now, in the case of the Oklahoma City bombing case, the defense \nattorneys made--I am not talking about expenses--they individually made \nprobably three or four times as much as U.S. attorneys. I think that is \ninequitable. I am talking about what they receive in take-home pay, per \nattorney.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me just clarify. When you are talking about the \ntake-home pay for the court-appointed counsel, you are talking about \nthe amount of funds they take with which to pay for their law firm's \nability to participate in the case. I think that is clearly a figure \nthat bears very little resemblance to what the U.S. attorney gets in \nsalary and the paycheck that he takes home at the end of each month. I \nthink you are trying to put an artificial limit on what the court-\nappointed counsel can get, which I think is a real disservice to the \ncriminal justice system. If we are going to continue with the notion \nthat we are going to have court-appointed counsel for people who are \naccused of crimes and who can't afford their own counsel, we have to \nhave some reasonable way of compensating them and not expect that \ncourt-appointed counsel to work for nothing half of the time, or more, \nduring each month.\n  Mr. President, based on my understanding of the amendment, I oppose \nthe amendment. I understand that Senator Leahy is opposed to the \namendment, but he is not able to be here right now to make a statement. \nI think this will artificially limit the amount\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\nof work that court-appointed counsel are able to do on behalf of \ncriminal defendants. To that extent, I think it subverts the criminal \njustice system. I oppose it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1 minute 48 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, certainly, my colleague has a right to \noppose the amendment. Let me capsulize it again. We have a situation \nwhere Federal death penalty cases--most of them are handled in the \nStates and most States have caps. My State has a cap of $20,000 for the \nlead attorney. We are not doing that. We are not capping what somebody \ncan pay for their private attorneys. They can pay their private \nattorney anything they want to.\n  Since we are talking about court-appointed attorneys, they are going \nto be paid for by the taxpayers, like we pay U.S. attorneys. I am \nsaying that we should not pay that individual--their compensation, not \ntheir overhead or expenses; those are other items--three or four times \nas much as we pay the U.S. attorneys.\n\n  I didn't even say we would limit the number of attorneys. I want \npeople to have an adequate defense. In the McVeigh case, the defense \ncounsel had 13 or 14 attorneys. The expenses are going to come out and \nbe public, and people will be outraged. I am trying to have basic \nequity. I don't think they should make more than a U.S. attorney. I \nthink that is a real outrage. Then when you find out they might have \nmade three or four times as much money as a U.S. attorney--and again, I \nam not talking about expenses, I am talking about what they make--that \nis an injustice. We need equity and balance. That is why I have \nproposed this amendment. I hope my colleagues will vote for it.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from South Carolina says U.S. attorneys \nalmost make as much as U.S. Senators. Most of us work a little more \nthan 40 hours a week. Again, I just urge my colleagues to support the \namendment. I will ask for the yeas and nays if my colleague from New \nMexico wants them.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I don't require the yeas and nays. I would like to be \nreported as voting against the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the order, the amendment will be stacked \nto be voted on later.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3273\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit from trademark the flag, coat of arms or other \n          insignia of any federally recognized Indian tribes)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mew Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 3273.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Notwithstanding any rights already conferred under the \n     Trademark Act, Section 2 of the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     provide for the registration and protection of trademarks \n     used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain \n     international conventions, and for other purposes,'' approved \n     July 5, 1946, commonly referred to as the Trademark Act of \n     1946 (15 U.S.C. 1052(b)), is amended in subsection (b) by \n     inserting ``or of any federally recognized Indian tribe,'' \n     after ``State or municipality,''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the amendment is a simple amendment to \ncorrect a longstanding error in what is known as the Lanham Act, the \nstatute that controls what can and what cannot be trademarked.\n  In doing so, let me indicate my appreciation to Senator Leahy and \nSenator Inouye for their support and, of course, my colleague Senator \nDomenici.\n  Mr. President, the Lanham Act of 1946, the primary statute governing \nwhat can and cannot be trademarked, protects flags, coats of arms, and \nofficial insignia of the United States, States, municipalities, and \nforeign nations.\n  It essentially says those cannot be trademarked. However, the act \nneglects to protect the insignias which belong to American Indian \ntribes. I believe strongly that this was an oversight. It is time we \ncorrected the oversight.\n  Significantly, I want to be clear that in offering this amendment, I \ndo not intend to affect existing trademark rights that may already have \nbeen conferred under this act. This amendment also does not have any \naffect on any current existing, non-trademarked usage of these tribal \ninsignia but only sets out to prohibit the trademarking of tribal \ninsignia in the same way a State's, municipality's, foreign nation's, \nand the United States' insignia currently is protected.\n  A key point that must be made here is that tribal governments are \nrecognized as forms of government listed under the Act and should be \ntreated in the same way that State, municipal, county, and of course \nthe United States governments are considered. The Lanham Act originally \nwas passed in 1946, and at that time, there was not as much recognition \nof the governmental status that federally-recognized Indian tribes \nhold. Today, however, we understand more than ever that tribal \ngovernments are sovereign and should be respected as such. Thus, it is \nan appropriate time to include federally recognized tribes for \nprotection under the Lanham Act.\n  Significantly, tribal insignia often are considered sacred by a \nrespective Indian tribe, and for that reason they should be prohibited \nfrom trademark. The Lanham Act protects from trademark anything that \nwould disparage a belief. For example, if someone wanted to trademark a \ncrucifix, Star of David, or Madonna and Child, in such a way that would \ndisparage any one of those significant symbols, the trademark office is \ndirected by law to deny that application for trademark.\n  However, there are is no similar protections for the many symbols \nthat American Indian people hold very sacred. For example, the Zia \npueblo, which is located in New Mexico, holds very sacred a symbol they \nrefer to as the ``sun symbol.'' This symbol is probably familiar to \nmany people because it appears on the flag of the State of New Mexico. \nIt is a very popular symbol among businesses and artisans. The Pueblo \nof Zia generally does not take particular issue with the use of the \nsymbol unless there is an attempt to have the symbol trademarked, the \nuse of which would disparage their religious beliefs. Clearly they have \na real interest in seeing that someone else does not come along and \ntrademark the insignia that the tribe has always claimed as its \nown. Unless you are a tribal member, you could not appreciate the \nsignificance of the symbol. In fact, Zia Pueblo holds the symbol so \nsacred that it would be against their religious beliefs to disclose to \nanyone outside of the tribe how they use the symbol in their sacred \nrituals.\n\n  Indeed, applications have been submitted to the Office of Patent and \nTrademarks, and each time an application is submitted, the Pueblo must \ncontest the application. This involves substantial legal costs to the \nPueblo, and the Pueblo Tribe is not in a financial circumstance where \nit can take on those legal costs in an indefinite future.\n\n  The Pueblo is located in a very isolated, desolate area of the state \nand has very high unemployment. I admire the Pueblo because they hold \nfast the centuries-old traditions and beliefs in spite of that great \neconomic hardship. They are a non-gaming tribe and have few resources \nfor water treatment facilities, schools or other vital services. \nNonetheless, they are willing to contest the trademarking of a symbol \nthat they hold very sacred. The problem is pervasive among all twenty-\ntwo tribes in New Mexico and among all American Indian tribes \nnationwide.\n  Yet we have a statute in place that protects every form of \ngovernment, even foreign nations, but it does not protect American \nIndian governments.\n\n[[Page S8825]]\n\n  By simply inserting ``federally recognized Indian tribes'' in a list \nthat already includes ``United States,'' ``States,'' ``municipality,'' \nand ``foreign nation,'' my amendment finally will offer protection from \ntrademark to tribes the same protection that already is conferred upon \nany other form of government. My amendment does not affect any existing \ntrademark rights that may already have been conferred under the Lanham \nAct.\n  What we are saying here is that we should take the Lanham Act where \nit provides for exceptions and says that you cannot trademark the \ninsignia of the United States, States, municipalities, and foreign \nnations. We are saying we should assert federally recognized Indian \ntribes as another one of the categories that enjoys this same \nprotection.\n  To me, it is a very straightforward amendment. I see no real basis \nfor anyone opposing the amendment. I hope that it will be agreed to. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would like to clarify that the time \nremaining to the proponents is 5 minutes 58 seconds, and for the \nopponents, 10 minutes.\n  Does anyone seek recognition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nevenly charged against the two sides, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we yield the remainder of our time, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be postponed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are waiting for one or two Senators to \ncome down. I simply advise my colleagues that progress is being made. \nWe now have two votes ordered. We have a number of amendments still \npending under the unanimous consent agreement, and we are trying to \nwork out a number of them. Hopefully, we will soon have the next \namendment in order to be offered.\n  While we are waiting for that, though, I would like to speak on \nanother subject. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8815-6", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ALAN B. SHEPARD, JR.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, last night Alan Shepard died. Alan Shepard \nis a huge figure in the lives of those of us who are in that postwar \nbaby boom generation which went through the Sputnik experience and the \nearly days of our space program. He is a huge figure especially for \nthose of us who come from New Hampshire, because he was born and raised \nin Derry, NH, a small town. In fact, a while after he went into space, \nfor many years, Derry sort of changed its name and called itself Space \nTown in honor of Alan Shepard.\n  He was really an extraordinary American, embodying so much of what \nmakes our country a special place. He came from a small, rural \ncommunity. It has gotten quite big. In fact, it is a city now. But when \nhe grew up, it was still a small, rural community. He committed his \nlife to service of this Nation and, of course, he was one of those \nexceptional people who was in the early test pilot program which \ntransitioned into the early astronaut program. We have the great \nbenefit of having another one of those exceptional people in the Senate \nwith us in Senator Glenn.\n  Alan Shepard was the first to go into space as an American, and his \nimpact on our country was extraordinary because of that. I can recall \nvery vividly--I must have been 9 or 10 years old --that our whole class \nin school met in the evening in order to watch this thing called \nSputnik go through the sky. And it threw a great scare into our Nation \nat the time because we, at that time, having come out of World War II \nand the Korean war, viewed ourselves as a nation of extraordinary \nstrength and really a nation of at least scientific leadership that was \nunparalleled, and suddenly the Soviet Union, which was a clear and \npresent threat of proportions which cannot even be appreciated today, \nhad launched a satellite which made it clear we were not maybe as far \nahead as we thought we were. In fact, in the area of space we were \nbehind.\n  And so the commitment was made to overtake the Soviet lead in space \ntechnology, but, more importantly, to make America the preeminent space \nexplorer of the world. That commitment was made first by President \nEisenhower and followed aggressively by President Kennedy, President \nJohnson and President Nixon. But the personification of the success of \nthat commitment was Alan Shepard, because not only did he go into space \nas the first American, but then after overcoming significant physical \nrestrictions--he had a very severe inner ear problem which he went back \nand had operated on--he went back into space and landed on the Moon. Of \ncourse, who can forget his hitting a golf ball on the Moon. I think he \nused a 6 iron and hit it 300 yards--almost a Tiger Woods drive.\n  Alan Shepard was a person who believed totally in the American dream \nand who lived the American dream. He was an icon of our culture and \nclearly a dominant figure of our time. We will miss him. In New \nHampshire, we will especially miss him because we are very proud of \nhim. We are a small State. At that time we had less than 1 million \npeople, and here it is, with less than 1 million people, we sent the \nfirst person in space and he was from New Hampshire. Great pride.\n  I express my sorrow to his family and join with all Americans in \nthanking him for what he did for our Nation, to restore our pride in \nourselves and to establish once again that we are a nation that is \nunique, filled with people who are unique, who, when we pull together \nto take on a task, no matter how daunting, such as putting a person on \nthe Moon and putting a person in space, will always succeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TEMPORARY PROHIBITION ON IMPLEMENTATION OR \n                   ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM TREATMENT \n                   REQUIREMENTS FOR COPPER ACTION LEVEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds made available by this \n     or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     implement or enforce the national primary drinking water \n     regulations for lead and copper in drinking water promulgated \n     under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), \n     to the extent that the regulations pertain to the public \n     water system treatment requirements related to the copper \n     action level, until--\n       (1) the Administrator and the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention jointly conduct a study to \n     establish a reliable dose-response relationship for the \n     adverse human health effects that may result from exposure to \n     copper in drinking water, that--\n       (A) includes an analysis of the health effects that may be \n     experienced by groups within the general population \n     (including infants) that are potentially at greater risk of \n     adverse health effects as the result of the exposure;\n       (B) is conducted in consultation with interested States;\n       (C) is based on the best available science and supporting \n     studies that are subject to peer review and conducted in \n     accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; and\n       (D) is completed not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) based on the results of the study and, once peer \n     reviewed and published, the 2 studies of copper in drinking \n     water conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention in the State of Nebraska and the State of \n     Delaware, the Administrator establishes an action level for \n     the presence of copper in drinking water that protects the \n     public health against reasonably expected adverse effects due \n     to exposure to copper in drinking water.\n       (b) Current Requirements.--Nothing in this section \n     precludes a State from implementing or enforcing the national \n     primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper in \n     drinking water promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) that are in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, to the extent that the regulations \n     pertain to the public water system treatment requirements \n     related to the copper action level.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this amendment is offered by myself and my \ncolleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel. We intend to talk on it for a \nbrief period of time and then we will withdraw the amendment.\n  I offered this amendment in a similar fashion on the HUD and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill. We, since that time, entered \ninto negotiations with the Environmental Protection Agency and it is \npossible that the problems we have in Nebraska will be resolved. It is \nalso possible that the issue does not get resolved. If that is the \ncase, I want to alert my colleagues that there will be an opportunity \nto vote on this amendment at some point, if Senator Hagel and I and the \nrest of the Nebraska delegation are not able to get satisfaction from \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. As I said, they are attempting to \nwork with us at this point to try to resolve this problem.\n  The problem simply stated is that, under the rulemaking of the Safe \nDrinking Water Act, there was established a lead and copper rule. Under \nthe procedures of the Safe Drinking Water Act, these rules get reviewed \nevery 6 years, so it is an appropriate time--it has been 7 years--an \nappropriate time for us to be reevaluating the science supporting the \nrule itself. That is essentially what we are challenging to begin with.\n  There is not a single city in Nebraska that has copper in excess of \n1.3 milligrams in its water supply. So, you say, what is the problem? \nThe problem is that if water sits in copper pipes overnight, the first \ndraw on that water will produce copper in excess of 1.3 milligrams in \nsome of our systems. Thus, our cities are being asked to invest \nmillions of dollars to take care of the problem by removing the copper \nin a manner that is acceptable to the EPA. That will become a very \ncritical part of this issue, because the EPA tells us what is and is \nnot acceptable to take care of a problem that, as I said, has not \nproduced a public health problem in Nebraska. We don't have a public \nhealth problem in Nebraska. We don't have any public health people \nsaying we believe there is a clear and present problem with copper, a \nproblem such as exists with lead. With lead, there is a public health \nproblem, although not in Nebraska. With copper, we have no public \nhealth problem. What we have, instead, is a scientific evaluation by \nEPA which has caused them to say we should not allow any more than 1.3 \nmilligrams per liter of copper in drinking water. And as a consequence, \nall across the country EPA is asking cities to invest substantial \namounts of money to treat and reduce the concentration of copper below \n1.3 milligrams.\n  I have a chart here. Some statements have been made by other \ninstitutions in regard to what is a safe amount of copper, which I \nwould like to read, just to establish that there is a significant \namount of dispute on the science of this.  Not a small amount of \ndispute, but a significant amount.\n\n  The World Health Organization has established 2 milligrams per liter \nas their standard for copper in drinking water. That is 60 percent \nhigher than 1.3 milligrams per liter.\n  In Canada, they have declared 5.3 milligrams per day as the lowest \noral dose at which local GI irritation was seen.\n  The National Academy of Sciences in 1977 said:\n\n       Limited data are available on the chronic toxicity of \n     copper. The hazard from dietary intakes of up to 5 milligrams \n     per day appear to be quite low.\n\n  A longer statement, made in 1994 by the Centers for Disease Control \nin regards to a study in Nebraska--this study is currently being peer \nreviewed, which EPA needs to have in order to make a final \ndetermination:\n\n       . . . at the time of the survey, people were not \n     experiencing GI related to the level of [copper] in their \n     drinking water, even though 51 of the selected homes had \n     [copper] drinking water levels that were greater than two \n     times the EPA action level the year prior to the study. . .\n\n  There is a significant amount of scientific disagreement as to what \nthe standard ought to be. Again, we are not experiencing a public \nhealth problem. If we are experiencing a public health problem, let's \nget after it and deal with it. That is what the Safe Drinking Water Act \nis all about. If you don't have a public health problem, you should \nnot, in my judgment, be requiring the municipalities to make an \ninvestment that produces no benefit. That is basically what we are \ntalking about here.\n  The municipalities have a limited amount of money. They have to go to \ntheir taxpayers to pay for any treatments to drinking water. We go to \ntaxpayers through the state revolving loan fund. We then provide funds \nto the States and the States and municipalities make the determination: \nHow do we spend our money so as to maximize the public health in our \ncommunity?\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\n The states and the municipalities are telling us that they don't see a \npublic health problem with copper, but they are willing to try to work \nwith the Environmental Protection Agency to solve this problem.\n  Mr. President, first of all, we have asked the Environmental \nProtection Agency to allow the National Academy of Sciences to impanel \na study group to evaluate the science that underlies this standard--a \npeer reviewed evaluation--and come back and say, ``This is our current \nestimate of the situation, our current estimate based upon reviewing \nall the science, particularly the peer-reviewed science that is out \nthere; this is what we see the current situation to be.''\n  Allow EPA, in short, to do what the Safe Drinking Water Act says it \nis supposed to do, which is to review these regulations once every 6 \nyears. It has been 7 years. There is plenty of evidence that would \nindicate it is time for EPA to review this standard, including other \npeople's evaluations, and as I said, the presence of an overwhelming \nfact, which is that we are not experiencing public health problems in \nNebraska.\n  In our negotiations--Senator Hagel, Congressmen Bereuter, Christensen \nand Barrett--we had a meeting yesterday with EPA. We are asking EPA to \nempower and to contract with the National Academy of Sciences to do a \nstudy of the science underlying this rule to determine whether 1.3 \nmilligrams per liter is reasonable. If we get a ``yes'' on that \nrequest, which we don't have at the moment--as I said, my colleagues \nmay be spared the opportunity of coming down here and voting on this \namendment.\n  There is another problem we are experiencing with EPA. Again, we \ntalked with region 7, and we talked, as well, with Administrator \nBrowner, and perhaps we can get true flexibility. We have asked for \nflexibility in dealing with this problem. I will describe for my \ncolleagues one of the things the Nebraska department of health asked \nthe Environmental Protection Agency for, in terms of flexibilities in \nimplementing this rule, and the answer from EPA was no. They asked if \nit would be OK if the State of Nebraska paid for the removal of copper \npiping and copper fixtures, get rid of the copper altogether as a \nsolution to this problem. The answer from EPA was that this is not one \nof the acceptable solutions that is on their list.\n\n  Eliminating the copper was not an acceptable solution to the EPA, Mr. \nPresident, nor was it acceptable to engage in a significant public \nhealth campaign to help people understand--and to ask them to flush, \nonce a day, the water in their systems to remove the copper that \nleached into the water after sitting overnight in the pipes--especially \nin smaller communities where you have a relatively small audience. EPA \nwas saying things like, ``Well, yeah, but somebody could get up in the \nmiddle of the night and have to go to the bathroom and maybe forget and \ntake a drink of water.''\n  This is the sort of reason given to people to support legislation \nlike the Safe Drinking Water Act? We want the Government to be a \npositive force in keeping our people safe, but when we hear rationale \nlike this, we scratch our heads and wonder whether or not it is all \nworthwhile.\n  We seem to frequently run into this sort of inability to bring common \nsense to the process. I am hopeful that Administrator Browner--she was \nvery positive yesterday--I am hoping Administrator Browner will, first \nof all, ask the National Academy of Sciences to do a study of the \nunderlying science, which is overdue given the conflicting analyses we \nhave seen; and, second, to direct region 7 to work with us to get a \nflexible plan that enables us, bottom line, to have our cities and our \nStates saying to us, ``We have identified a solution here; we have a \nmeans of dealing with this; here is what it is going to cost us; we are \nwilling to make this investment.''\n  Understand, at the community level where they are drinking the water, \nthey are saying, ``There are public health problems that are much \nlarger than this. We don't have anyone getting sick from copper. We \nunderstand you all think we ought to be getting sick at these levels, \nbut we are not. We are willing to work with you and willing to make an \ninvestment, but we want that investment to be justified. We want the \ncost to track somehow with the benefit. We want to be able to say here \nis the benefit we are getting with the cost of the expenditure \nitself.''\n  I am pleased to inform my colleagues, at the conclusion of Senator \nHagel's and my remarks on this, we are prepared to withdraw this \namendment and not put you through the process of voting on this at this \ntime. But if we are not able to get a satisfactory answer from \nAdministrator Browner, I inform my colleagues there will be an \nopportunity to vote on this amendment.\n  My guess is that any of you out there who have municipalities that \nare discussing this with the Environmental Protection Agency--I \nguarantee you, all you have to do is talk to your colleagues in \nMinnesota and ask them how it worked. They implemented the EPA plans \nfor copper removal, and it hasn't worked in nearly half of the 130 \nwater systems they were forced to treat. They did everything the EPA \ntold them to do to reduce copper levels and it didn't work. They still \nhave the problem and are now scratching their heads and trying to \nfigure out what they are going to do next.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from New Hampshire and other colleagues. I \nlook forward to coming to the floor and saying that this issue is \nsatisfactorily resolved. Administrator Browner, I believe, is making a \ngood-faith effort, but we have a ways to go before we are certain we \ndon't have to come back and appeal to our colleagues, who are likely \nexperiencing similar things, to give us a change in the law that will \ngive us time to allow these scientific studies to be reviewed, and \npossibly, this rule revised.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine-and-a-half minutes remain for the \nproponents. The Chair recognizes the junior Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment sponsored by my good \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey.\n  As Senator Kerrey has very directly stated, this amendment is an \nattempt to bring some much-needed common sense--common sense, Mr. \nPresident, common sense--to the EPA regulatory process. We are not in \nany way attempting to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  I commend my colleague from Rhode Island, the distinguished chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, for his \nhard work in crafting this bill over the years and having brought it up \nto date and focused on what is important, and that is to protect the \nsafety of our drinking water. It is important that we be clear on this \npoint. We are not attempting to amend the Public Works Committee's hard \nefforts, the Safe Drinking Water Act. No attempt is being made to amend \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  What we are asking here is EPA delay the enforcement of copper \nregulations until the completion of scientific studies that are already \nunderway. Regulations imposed by the EPA on copper levels in drinking \nwater are unrealistic and will impose financial hardships on a number \nof communities in Nebraska. Is it too much to ask--really, is it too \nmuch to ask--that scientific studies be completed before costs are \nimposed? Mr. President, that is just common sense.\n  The town of Hastings, NE, population 23,000, will be forced to pay \nover $1 million in the first year to comply with these onerous \nregulations and $250,000 the year after that. More than 60 Nebraska \nwater systems face similar financial burdens because of the EPA's \nenforcement of these copper regulations.\n  The most incredible part of this issue is that the EPA has not proven \nthat there is a health risk. As my friend, Senator Kerrey, said, they \nwant to prove it; they want to tell us we have it, but they can't make \nthe scientific link. The EPA used case studies to set these copper \nlevels, some of which are over 40 years old, and often included only a \nfew people. One EPA case study from 1957 refers to 15 nurses, 10 of \nwhich got sick after drinking cocktails\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\nwith between 5.3 and 32 milligrams of copper--very strong scientific \nevidence.\n\n  Yet, a 1994 interim study conducted by the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention found that EPA's copper standard seriously \nexaggerated health effects in Nebraska due to water consumption. In \ncomparison, the CDC study conducted in 1994 to examine almost 200 \nhouseholds in Nebraska in a controlled, scientific way, found no \nrelationship between the copper concentrations and illness.\n  One of the problems in Nebraska, Mr. President, is that copper does \nnot come from the city's water system. It comes from copper pipes--\ncopper pipes--in individual homes. Yet only six of the homes tested, in \nHastings, NE, had copper levels above the EPA standards. And for those \nsix homes, the EPA is going to force the people of the entire town in \nNebraska to spend millions of dollars to change the system.\n  This is folly. This is nonsense. This is one of the most clear \nexamples of EPA zealousness that I think I have ever seen.\n  The State of Nebraska has attempted to make its case with the EPA but \nhas been repeatedly dismissed. The State suggested allowing residents \nto let the water run in the taps for a short period of time before \nusing water for drinking. Nebraska's Department of Health and Human \nServices would have used a public education program to ensure that this \n``flushing'' method was done correctly. Residents already did this on \ntheir own and copper levels dropped to nearly zero--copper levels \ndropped to nearly zero--after letting the tap run for a few seconds. \nThe State also said it would pay to replace the copper plumbing for \naffected households.\n  The attorney general of the State of Nebraska has filed a lawsuit to \ntry to block the EPA enforcement of these regulations until we have \nsome sound science. And the Governor, Governor Nelson, is involved.\n  The attitude of the EPA toward the people of Nebraska has been one of \nsupreme arrogance. Some of my colleagues may wonder why this is such a \nproblem in Nebraska. Why haven't they heard about this in their States?\n  Well, Nebraska is unique, not only because we play decent football, \nMr. President, but also because we rely, almost exclusively, on \ngroundwater for our water supplies. Because of this, some towns and \ncities in Nebraska do not have a central water system but a number of \nsystems that feed into the main system.\n  For these towns of Nebraska, treating drinking water means treating \neach individual well, which drastically increases costs. And for what? \nThe people of Nebraska do not want unsafe drinking water; of course \nthey don't. If there was a real health risk, they would pay to have the \nwater treated. But when the scientific evidence shows no health risk, \nwhen the EPA rejects every commonsense alternative--many of what my \ncolleague from Nebraska talked about--what are the people of Nebraska \nto do? They have turned to their congressional delegation. They have \nturned to their Congress and asked for help.\n  The Constitution gives Congress the authority to decide whether or \nnot Federal agencies can spend the money of the American taxpayers, \nwhat they spend it on, and why they spend it. Too often we have \nneglected this authority and let Federal agencies run right over the \ntop of the American people, the very people who pay the bills--the \ntaxpayers. But we don't have a voice. That is why Senator Kerrey and I \nare on the floor today.\n  We are here to bring the case of the people of Nebraska to the \nSenate, as our colleagues are doing in the House. We have no other \nrecourse, Mr. President. Again, we are not attempting to amend the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. We are asking to change the regulations so that we \nhave some ability, some flexibility to wait until we have sound \nscience. What an outrageous request. What an outrageous request.\n  Mr. President, dealing with the EPA is like wandering around in the \nLand of Oz, this mystical land. But we wish to pull back the curtain \nand get to some reality and common sense. It is my hope, as is the hope \nof my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Nebraska, that our \ncolleagues will listen to this plea and will assist us in this effort. \nWe are grateful for an opportunity to tell our story--a real story.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letters in \nsupport for this amendment from the National Governors' Association, \nthe Central Nebraska Mayor's Association, the League of Nebraska \nMunicipalities, the city of Columbus, the city of Hastings, the village \nof Snyder, and the village of Fairmont be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Kerrey,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerrey: We are writing to share our concerns \n     about the lead and copper rule promulgated by the U.S. \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act. Communities in many states, particularly smaller \n     communities, face substantial costs under this rule. We \n     understand that serious questions have been raised about the \n     rule, including the justification for the current action \n     level, the cost effectiveness of the rule, and the \n     replicability of the sampling procedures used under the rule. \n     We understand that the rule may also interfere with the \n     implementation of other pending regulations, such as the \n     Disinfectant/Disinfection Byproducts Rule. Such interference \n     could have serious adverse health consequences.\n       In the face of these uncertainties, we urge you to take \n     steps to ensure that the lead and copper rule is based on the \n     best available, peer-reviewed science and is subject to risk \n     assessment, comparative risk assessment, and risk management \n     techniques that include analyses of costs and benefits. The \n     Governors have recommended that for all regulations with a \n     substantial potential impact on public health or the economy, \n     the regulatory agency should be required to certify that the \n     regulation is likely to produce benefits that justify the \n     costs. In determining that the benefits justify the costs, \n     the agency should consider the full scope of qualitative and \n     quantitative costs and benefits, exercise sound judgment, use \n     realistic assumptions, weigh all reasonable alternatives, and \n     strike an appropriate balance between costs and benefits.\n       We would appreciate your assistance in ensuring that EPA \n     satisfies these recommendations in the case of the lead and \n     copper rule. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     E. Benjamin Nelson,\n       Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n     Marc Racicot,\n       Vice Chair, Committee on Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Central Nebraska\n\n\n                                          Mayor's Association,\n\n                                                     June 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert Kerrey,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerrey: We are writing to convey to you the \n     solid support of four major Nebraska communities for the \n     recent efforts by the Nebraska congressional delegation \n     regarding the lead and copper rule designation in the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act. In an April 24, 1998 letter to USEPA, \n     Nebraska's congressional delegation unanimously urged \n     bringing common sense and good scientific evidence to the \n     copper rule. We support that position and encourage you to \n     continue pressing this issue in our behalf, as well as that \n     of many other Nebraska communities.\n       As you are well aware, epidemiological evidence generated \n     by the Centers for Disease Control indicates that the \n     drinking water standards for copper are arbitrarily \n     established at levels far below those believed to pose any \n     threat to human health. Incredibly, the level established by \n     USEPA is less than the recommended daily minimum amount of \n     cooper for human consumption, established by another federal \n     agency. What is more unnerving, is the fact that cities are \n     being mandated to make significant changes to their water \n     delivery systems, not because of the source of supply, or \n     because of the water systems themselves, but because of the \n     copper water services in private homes. This of course can be \n     solved by running the water for a few seconds each morning \n     before taking any water for drinking purposes, which, we \n     suspect, is a universal practice. Viewed another way, does \n     USEPA have any evidence whatsoever that anyone is consuming \n     water with ``unaccepted levels'' of copper in it?\n       We believe that USEPA has strayed from its original mandate \n     of ensuring a clean environment. Instead, communities \n     throughout the country are confronted with the hypertechnical \n     wanderings of a bureaucratic juggernaut, promulgating \n     unreasonably stringent environmental standards that lack good \n     scientific evidence, ignore practical testing procedures, and \n     are totally devoid of any common sense.\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\n       It is particularly vexing to deal with unreasonable \n     standards which will cost Nebraskans millions of dollars \n     while providing no apparent benefit. Cities are asked by \n     their populations to provide essential services that enhance \n     the quality of life of their citizens. Dollars are tight and \n     public scrutiny is high. The waste of time, effort, and \n     precious dollars on misguided notions like the copper rule \n     for drinking water, is totally unacceptable. Please continue \n     and intensify your efforts to bring good scientific evidence \n     to these and other rules, regulations and standards of USEPA.\n       Thank you again for your interest in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ken Grady,\n       Mayor of Grand Island.\n     James D.

The staff at the League of \n     Nebraska municipalities informed me that you used \n     considerable debating skills and knowledge of procedure to \n     try to amend a measure to give Nebraskans some relief from \n     the EPA Copper Rule. It is not that often anymore that you \n     get to see good debating skills put to use in legislative \n     process, but you apparently made Nebraska look good.\n       Again, I appreciate all the work that you and your staff \n     have put in on this issue. As you know, and very effectively \n     communicated, compliance with this regulation will cost \n     Nebraskans millions of dollars for little or no health \n     benefit. Nebraska municipal officials are not against the \n     protection of public health. They live in the very \n     communities that they serve. But meeting the ``at the tap-\n     first draw'' copper standard seems to be throwing money away.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Jim Van Marter,\n\n                                                 League President,\n     Mayor, Holdrege, Nebraska.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Columbus, NE,\n\n                                                    July 10, 1998.\n     Hon.

If this should be enforced, it will cost \n     our city thousands of dollars.\n       I ask that you give us every consideration in fighting this \n     ruling. We appreciate your leadership in helping us \n     concerning this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gary Giebelhaus,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Hastings, NE,\n\n                                                    July 10, 1998.\n     Re Copper regulations.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Rayburn Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     citizens and water rate payers of the City of Hastings, \n     Nebraska, an agricultural community of 22,000 people located \n     in the south central part of the state. The drinking water \n     system for our community is operated by our local Board of \n     Public Works. Tests of drinking water (taken in private \n     homes) indicate that the levels of copper in the water barely \n     exceeds the action level for copper established pursuant to \n     the 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act. The State of Nebraska has \n     issued an order to the City, directing implementation of \n     costly ``optimal corrosion control treatment''.\n       USEPA's active level for copper in drinking water is based \n     upon two outdated (one is at least 40 years old) and \n     unreliable studies. Recent epidemiological evidence generated \n     by the Centers for Disease Control indicates that the \n     drinking water standards for copper are arbitrarily \n     established at levels far below those believed to pose any \n     threat to human health. It is most noteworthy that the level \n     established by USEPA is less than the federally recommended \n     daily minimum amount of copper for human consumption. In \n     fact, the amount of copper in a multiple vitamin tablet \n     exceeds the USEPA's action level.\n       Senator, we, and many other communities around the country, \n     are being directed by government to expand millions of \n     dollars on our water systems in just a few short years, with \n     literally no reasonable expectation of benefit to public \n     health. This makes absolutely no sense at all. We would hope \n     that you agree that it is foolish to act on poor information, \n     when good information is readily attainable. We need your \n     help. (Our water department, which operates at a loss most \n     years, estimates that installation of the required \n     modifications will cost $1,000,000 initially, with an added \n     operations expense of approximately $250,000 per year.)\n       Nebraska Senator Robert Kerrey and Chuck Hagel have \n     introduced legislation which would prohibit USEPA's \n     implementation or enforcement of this rule until more \n     reliable studies can be completed and evaluated. The expected \n     time frame for obtaining this much more reliable information \n     is less than 30 months.\n       We ask that you join our Nebraska Delegation in its efforts \n     to gain a reprieve which makes eminent sense. In our \n     estimation, there are no risks associated with taking the \n     time to get the facts straight. We do not know of even one \n     copper related illness, belly ache or sniffle in the more \n     than one hundred year history of this county. I can tell you \n     without fear of contradiction, that if we had the one million \n     dollars and more to spend, the public health and quality of \n     life in our community would be much better served by spending \n     that money on fire trucks and police cars.\n       Public health and safety are the top priority of Hastings \n     city government. We, and many other units of local government \n     are on the front line. But we have precious few resources and \n     dollars for this effort. Please help prevent the bureaucratic \n     misdirection of our dollars and resources, so that we can do \n     what is best for our community.\n       You can undoubtedly discern from the tone of this letter, \n     that I am already convinced that further studies will show \n     that the action level for copper is unreasonably low. My \n     limited review of available data, and information provided by \n     those knowledgeable on the matter, unanimously support this \n     conviction. Please rest assured, however, that Hastings will \n     expeditiously comply with whatever standard emanates from the \n     more current studies. We have faith in good science. Recent \n     history shows that Congress shares that faith.\n       Thank you for your interest in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  J.

Snyder also \n     has two (2) wells, according to our engineer our capital \n     expenses would be $30,000.00 for building modification and \n     equipment purchases. The ongoing operational costs including \n     chemicals, training, administrative, and repairs/maintenance \n     would cost $12,000.00. The first year would cost the Village \n     $42,000.00, and require us to budget an additional $12,000.00 \n     per year. If we have to use bonds to pay for the capital \n     costs, there will be additional expenses.\n       This does not include the cost of a corrosion control study \n     as required by the administrative order. Our engineer \n     estimated between $3,000.00 and $3,500.00, or the quarterly \n     notices that we have to publish. There is also the cost of \n     additional water testing that we are required to perform.\n       Although, the easy answer is to raise rates it is not \n     always the best one.\n       I would like to thank you for your efforts to help us.\n       I am enclosing a separate cost breakdown.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Joel D.

In review it \n     would cost the village $45,000 for the capital outlay and \n     approximately $18,000 annually for ongoing operations costs.\n       Our village board believes that the copper action level is \n     excessively stringent, has an excessive safety margin and is \n     not supported by sound scientific data and studies. The \n     ruling requires the village to expend public funds for \n     monitoring and treatment of public water supply system of the \n     Village in order to correct contaminations which occur within \n     the service lines and plumbing systems owned by private \n     persons or entities, and our board does not feel that public \n     funds should be used in this manner.\n       Thank you for your assistance in this matter and if you \n     need additional information, please contact our office or the \n     League of Nebr. Municipalities.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           David R.

In general, most well buildings are not set up to \n     provide adequate space or provide an appropriate environment \n     for use as a chemical feed room. Depending on the building \n     site conditions and the layout, we believe it is likely that \n     the well building will need to be expanded and rough cost for \n     the building modifications would be $10,000 per well (POE).\n       D. The type of chemical treatment that will be necessary \n     for each well will depend on the detailed chemical analyses \n     of the well water. However, for planning purposes, we would \n     estimate that the cost for chemical feed equipment and \n     electrical modifications needed could be approximately \n     $5,000/well (POE) and the raw cost of chemical would be \n     approximately 10 cents/1,000 gallons of water pumped.\n       E. In addition, to the chemical cost, it would be \n     anticipated that considerable additional cost/time will be \n     involved in the daily monitoring of the chemical feed \n     systems, testing, and administrative time involved in \n     maintaining records, etc. It would appear reasonable to \n     assume that the costs could be around $3,000/yr. for the \n     first well, and maybe $2,500 for each added well.\n       F. Also, I would expect that repairs and maintenance costs \n     could be $1,000/well/year to keep pumps and controls updated/\n     operational.\n       In conclusion, we believe that costs for Lead and Copper \n     Rule compliance would be:\n\n     A. Capital Expenditure Costs\n       1. Building Modification: $10,000/well (POE)\n       2. Equipment Costs: $5,000/well (POE)\n       Total: $15,000/well (POE)\n     B. Ongoing Operational Costs\n       1. Chemical Costs: 10 cents/1,000 gal. pumped\n       2. Operational/Administrative Costs: $3,000/yr. 1st well \n         (POE) $2,500/yr. each added well (POE)\n       3. Repairs/Maintenance: $1,000/yr./well (POE)\n\n       If you have any questions regarding this letter or if you \n     need anything further from us, please feel free to advise.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ron Botorff.\n       A.

I ask that reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 96, strike line 23 and all that follows \n     through line 12 on page 100 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 405. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be obligated or expended to pay for \n     any cost incurred for--\n       (1) opening or operating any United States diplomatic or \n     consular post in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam that was \n     not operating on July 11, 1995,\n       (2) expanding any United States diplomatic or consular post \n     in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam that was operating on \n     July 11, 1995, or\n       (3) increasing the total number of personnel assigned to \n     United States diplomatic or consular posts in the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam above the levels existing on July 11, \n     1995,\n\n     unless the President certifies within 60 days the following:\n       (A) Based upon all information available to the United \n     States Government, the Government of the Socialist Republic \n     of Vietnam is fully cooperating in good faith with the United \n     States in the following:\n       (i) Resolving discrepancy cases, live sightings, and field \n     activities.\n       (ii) Recovering and repatriating American remains.\n       (iii) Accelerating efforts to provide documents that will \n     help lead to fullest possible accounting of prisoners of war \n     and missing in action.\n       (iv) Providing further assistance in implementing \n     trilateral investigations with Laos.\n       (B) The remains, artifacts, eyewitness accounts, archival \n     material, and other evidence associated with prisoners of war \n     and missing in action recovered from crash sites, military \n     actions, and other locations in Southeast Asia are being \n     thoroughly analyzed by the appropriate laboratories with the \n     intent of providing surviving relatives with scientifically \n     defensible, legal determinations of death or other \n     accountability that are fully documented and available in \n     unclassified and unredacted form to immediate family members.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, are we operating under a time agreement \non this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes evenly divided.\n  Mr. KERRY. Twenty minutes equally divided.\n  Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may use. I ask that \nthe Chair let me know when I have used 7 minutes.\n  Madam President, for the past 3 years we have had language in the \nappropriations bill that prohibits funding for the expansion of our \ndiplomatic presence in Vietnam unless the President of the United \nStates certifies that Vietnam is cooperating on the POW/MIA issue.\n  The fact is that the standard currently in law requires a tough \ncertification by the President. The President has to certify that \nVietnam is fully cooperating. The President has to certify that in good \nfaith Vietnam is cooperating in four specific areas: resolving \ndiscrepancy cases, live sightings and field activities, remains \nrecovery and repatriation, providing documents, and assisting in the \ntrilateral investigations with Laos.\n  That is a fair and a sensible standard, Madam President. However, \nsection 405\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\nof the pending bill that has been put into the bill creates a whole new \nstandard. It creates a standard of significant increased capacity for \nsubjectivity and for distortion and, frankly, for an unreasonableness, \nwhich, if adopted, would set back our relationship and our capacity to \nbuild the progress and relationship not just on POW/MIA but on human \nrights and other issues where we have been making progress.\n  The amendment that I offer with Senator McCain from Arizona and \nSenator Bob Kerrey from Nebraska would strike section 405, replacing it \nwith the language in the current law that requires a certification from \nthe President, and requires the same standard of certification that we \nhave had over the course of the last years.\n  In our judgment, section 405 will not only undo much of the \ncooperation that we have but could conceivably set back our capacity to \nbe able to find answers on the POW/MIA issue.  We believe it would \nundermine the policy of normalization and it would create an \nunreasonable certification standard in an effort to prevent the \nexpansion of our diplomatic presence and, thus, our relationship.\n\n  Current law requires the President to certify whether or not Vietnam \nis cooperating in good faith. I want the Senate to know that the \nPresident made that certification on March 4 of this year, as he has \nfor the past 2 years.\n  Section 405, however, in the legislation that we seek to strike, \nincorporates a standard that requires the President to somehow say that \nthey are fully forthcoming, fully cooperating in good faith, and the \nwords ``fully forthcoming'' present all kinds of complications about \nwhat is possible to give, what is not possible, what documents somebody \nmay have, whether or not it is possible to give them, and raises issues \nthat the POW/MIA committee and those who have been involved in this \nissue for a long period of time have argued for some period of time and \nresolve with the language that is currently in the law.\n  Over the many years that I have been involved in this issue, we have \nalways had a struggle over this central question of what they have, \nwhat they don't have, who may have it, who has control of it, and if \nyou get caught in the total subjectivity of a standard that no one in \nthe intelligence community or elsewhere believes they can possibly \nmeet, all we do is create a mischief in the process.\n  There is no question that we need to keep pressing for documents. We \nare. We just had a whole new slug of documents turned over that we are \nin the process of translating. We discovered new items from many of \nthese unilateral turnovers of documents. The point is, they are \nhappening because there is a cooperative effort, because we are engaged \nin marching down a road together in order to try to assert the truth \nhere.\n  I think we also have to recognize that just as we deem certain \ndocuments pertaining to the military and to our country's national \nsecurity as being classifiable or sensitive, so do they. We may not \nview it the same way, but clearly they are going to present, and their \nagencies--whether the defense agency, the interior agency--will argue \nthat one document or another represents a security risk. So we have to \nwork through the process of that. If we hold ourselves accountable to a \nstandard where we are subject to some agency or bureaucrat being less \nthan forthcoming in that regard about a document we don't even know \nthey have, it seems to me we are creating an impossible situation and \nan impossible standard.\n  In addition to that, section 405 also adds other new conditions to \nthe process. It requires Vietnam to resolve hearsay reports which \npertain to the possible or confirmed prisoner of war/missing in action. \nApart from the question of how anyone resolves a hearsay report, this \nrequirement would add an enormous burden to both the American and \nVietnamese teams, who are on the ground, who are pursuing nonhearsay \nreports. They are already tasked on a very clear schedule of trying to \ndetermine every single nonhearsay report, absolutely certain evidence \nthey have, which requires them to go out into the field, interview, \ndig, do a whole host of other very time-consuming efforts. To suggest \nthat every single hearsay report has got to be resolved to the \nexclusion of the confirmed reports that they are already pursuing is \nto, again, raise this to a standard of absurdity.\n  The fact is, we have made enormous progress on the POW/MIA issue \nprecisely because of Vietnamese cooperation. In the last 5 years, \nAmerican and Vietnamese teams have concluded 30 joint field activities \nin Vietnam; 233 sets of remains have been repatriated, and 97 have been \nidentified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It is my understanding I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield myself 7 minutes at this point.\n  I rise to support the committee language that is in the bill before \nus with respect to Vietnam. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to listen carefully to the debate between myself and my colleague \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  It seems that we can depend on three things anymore in America--\ndeath, taxes, and the fact that Senators Kerry and McCain will somehow \noppose any language that I try to support in regard to the POW/MIA \nissue.\n  Senator Kerry said that this is not workable, that the term ``fully \nforthcoming'' is not workable. Of course it is workable. It is workable \nbecause the language says that the President's judgment, the \nPresident's own judgment, is based on information available to the U.S. \nGovernment. There is nothing unworkable about that language at all. It \nis very workable. The President has continued to certify the very \nlanguage that the Senator from Massachusetts wants to revert back to, \nwhich was language that I helped to write and put in the bill last \nyear. We are simply upgrading it a little bit. That is not anything to \nbe concerned about. The President still does the certification. It is \nhis judgment. No one is changing that. I might not agree with the \nPresident's judgment from time to time, but he has the right to make \nthat judgment under the law. That is the issue here.\n  I hope the Senators and their staffs who are monitoring this debate \nwill look at section 405 to see what the Senator from Massachusetts is \nstriking--it is found on page 96 of the committee bill--because it is \nreasonable. I think most Senators will resist the effort to strike it. \nIt is reasonable.\n  Senator Gregg and the committee support this language. The committee \nlanguage continues a certification process that was begun in 1995 when \nthe President established full diplomatic relations with Vietnam. It \nhas continued, through this year, when the President issued his latest \ncertification in March. Now, whether or not we agree or disagree with \nthe President's certification is not the issue. I happen to disagree. I \ndidn't believe he should have certified based on the evidence. But he \ndid, and he has the right to do that under the law.\n  What the committee has done is to further modify the language in an \nappropriate manner based on developments and communications from the \nexecutive branch over the last year. Each time, in the end, the \nPresident has complied with the certification process. I have no doubt \nhe will do it this time. In fact, let me refer to the President's own \nwords when he issued the most recent certification in March of this \nyear.\n\n       In making this determination, I wish to reaffirm my \n     continuing personal commitment to the entire POW/MIA \n     community, especially to the immediate families, relatives, \n     friends, and supporters of these brave individuals, and to \n     reconfirm that the central, guiding principle of my Vietnam \n     policy is to achieve the fullest possible accounting of our \n     prisoners of war and missing in action.\n\n  That is the President. I have that document right here, signed by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent this document be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [Presidential Determination No. 98-16]\n\n                 Memorandum for the Secretary of State\n\n     Subject: Vietnamese Cooperation in Accounting for United \n         States Prisoners of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIA).\n       As provided under section 609 of the Departments of \n     Commerce, Justice, and State,\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\n     the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, \n     Public Law 105-119, I hereby determine, based on all \n     information available to the United States Government, that \n     the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is fully \n     cooperating in good faith with the United States in the \n     following four areas related to achieving the fullest \n     possible accounting for Americans unaccounted for as a result \n     of the Vietnam War:\n       (1) resolving discrepancy cases, live sightings, and field \n     activities;\n       (2) recovering and repatriating American remains;\n       (3) accelerating efforts to provide documents that will \n     help lead to the fullest possible accounting of POW/MIAs; and\n       (4) providing further assistance in implementing trilateral \n     investigations with Laos.\n       I further determine that the appropriate laboratories \n     associated with POW/MIA accounting are thoroughly analyzing \n     remains, material, and other information, and fulfilling \n     their responsibilities as set forth in subsection (B) of \n     section 609, and information pertaining to this accounting is \n     being made available to immediate family members in \n     compliance with 50 U.S.C. 435 note.\n       I have been advised by the Department of Justice and \n     believe that section 609 is unconstitutional because it \n     purports to use a condition on appropriations as a means to \n     direct my execution of responsibilities that the Constitution \n     commits exclusively to the President. I am providing this \n     determination as a matter of comity, while reserving the \n     position that the condition enacted in section 609 is \n     unconstitutional.\n       In making this determination I have taken into account all \n     information available to the United States Government as \n     reported to me, the full range of ongoing accounting \n     activities in Vietnam, including joint and unilateral \n     Vietnamese efforts, and the concrete results we have attained \n     as a result.\n       Finally, in making this determination, I wish to reaffirm \n     my continuing personal commitment to the entire POW/MIA \n     community, especially to the immediate families, relatives, \n     friends, and supporters of these brave individuals, and to \n     reconfirm that the central, guiding principle of my Vietnam \n     policy is to achieve the fullest possible accounting of our \n     prisoners of war and missing in action.\n       You are authorized and directed to report this \n     determination to the appropriate committees of the Congress \n     and to publish it in the Federal Register.\n                                               William J. Clinton.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. For the Senator from Massachusetts and \nothers now to basically prevent the committee from updating the \nlanguage based on the President's own words, and based on the words of \nSandy Berger and others, sends a terrible message, a message that I \nsimply do not understand, for the life of me, why we have to fight this \nbattle day in and day out, year in and year out, on the floor of the \nSenate. There is nothing wrong with this language, I say to my \ncolleague, with all respect. The President still has the right to \ncertify. And he does in spite of the fact that I disagree, many times, \nwith his reasoning for the certification.\n  To prevent the committee from updating this language sends, I think, \na terrible message to the Government of Vietnam: It is OK, do whatever \nyou want. Go ahead, provide us documents, don't provide us documents; \nprovide us access, don't provide us access, it doesn't matter. The \nfamilies of 2,000-plus American service personnel still unaccounted \nfor, don't worry about it. Our Nation's veterans, we no longer attach \nthe same priorities to the POW/MIA effort in our development of \nrelations with Vietnam which we had in the last 3 years. Don't worry \nabout that. Let's go ahead, pursue lines of trade, sell oil, buy oil, \nwhatever. Set up a full diplomatic mission. Don't worry about these \nthings. Don't worry about POW/MIA. That is a side issue that is not \nreally important.\n  That is reason alone for the Senators and my colleagues to table this \namendment. Don't send this kind of message to the families. God knows \nthey have been through enough. They support the language in the \ncommittee bill. That should be enough right there. These are the people \nwho have suffered. It hasn't been Senator Smith; it hasn't been others \non the Senate floor--well, in some cases, there has been great \nsuffering by some of my colleagues in the Vietnam war. But it is the \nfamilies of the missing who want this message. We should do it for \nthem, if for no other reason. They have been in touch with me as \nrecently as this morning. They passionately object to what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is trying to do. They have told me that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their statements be printed in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I have statements from the League of \nFamilies, the Alliance of Families, from 70 former POWs, from major \nveterans groups, including the American Legion. And I know that others \nsupport what we are doing, like the National Vietnam Veterans \nCoalition, and many others support the language and support the \ncommittee process.\n  So I hope that we will defeat this effort.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         National League of Families of American Prisoners and \n           Missing in Southeast Asia,\n                                     Washington DC, July 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The POW/MIA families strongly support \n     the language currently in the Commerce, State, Justice \n     appropriations bill as the best way to motivate the Socialist \n     Republic of Vietnam government to account for Americans still \n     missing from the Vietnam War.\n       The League is not surprised that the Clinton \n     Administration, faced with another Congressional \n     certification requirement, prefers broad language that is \n     politically easier to finesse, than specific criteria that \n     must be met. However, at the League's 29th Annual Meeting, \n     U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam, the Honorable Douglas ``Pete'' \n     Peterson, expressed frustration that the language was too \n     broad, requiring either certification of full cooperation or \n     nothing, leaving no room for incremental judgments.\n       The League's position is based upon past and current \n     official assessments of what Vietnam can do unilaterally to \n     account for missing Americans. Unilateral actions do not \n     simply mean support for joint field operations, a necessary \n     process in the longer term, but steps by the government of \n     Vietnam to locate and return identifiable remains and provide \n     relevant documents that are still being withheld.\n       Congress has the ability to stand behind those who serve--\n     past, present and future--by retaining the language in the \n     Committee's bill. Efforts by Senators John Kerry and John \n     McCain to remove this language may be well-intended, but are \n     illogical. There is no risk that Vietnam will halt bilateral \n     POW/MIA cooperation and risk achieving their priority mission \n     of MFN. By retaining the Committee's language, Congress can \n     signal it recognizes that more can and should be done by \n     Vietnam on this issue of stated highest national priority to \n     the Clinton Administration and understandable importance to \n     the American people.\n       Please stand with the POW/MIA families and America's \n     veterans and oppose the Kerry/McCain amendment to remove \n     relevant POW/MIA language.\n           Respectfully,\n                                              Ann Mills Griffiths,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                National Alliance of Families,\n\n                                      Bellevue, WA, July 21, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The membership of the National Alliance \n     of Families strongly opposes any effort to weaken the \n     Committee's language which is already in the Commerce, \n     Justice, and State, the Judiciary Appropriations Bill No. S. \n     2260 for the fiscal year 1999 in respect to the POW/MIA \n     Accounting (Sec. 405).\n       We support your efforts on behalf of our loved ones who \n     still remain Prisoner of War and/or Missing in Action from \n     the Vietnam War.\n       Thank you for your generous and strong dedication to those \n     men who have served their Country these many years.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Dolores Apodaca Alfond,\n     National Chairperson.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       An Open Letter to President Clinton From Former U.S. POWs\n\n\n                                   American Defense Institute,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 10, 1995.\n     The Honorable William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As former U.S. Prisoners of war during \n     the Vietnam Conflict, we are writing to request you not to \n     establish normal diplomatic relations with Vietnam until you \n     can certify that there has been full disclosure and \n     cooperation by Hanoi on the POW/MIA issue. While we \n     appreciate Vietnam's support for U.S. crash site recovery and \n     archival research efforts, we know first-hand Vietnam's \n     ability to withhold critical information while giving the \n     appearance of cooperation. We were all subjected to such \n     propaganda activity during the war, and we would be the least \n     surprised if Hanoi was continuing to use similar tactics in \n     its dealings with the United States.\n       Of particular concern to us are the several hundred POW/MIA \n     cases involving our fellow servicemen who were captured or \n     lost in enemy-controlled areas during the war, yet they still \n     have not been accounted for by Vietnam. We understand that \n     much of the fragmentary information provided by Vietnamese \n     officials to date indicates they could do more to resolve \n     these cases.\n\n[[Page S8833]]\n\n       Some of our fellow servicemen became missing during the \n     same incidents which we survived. They have not been \n     accounted for. Some were captured and never heard from again. \n     They have not been accounted for. Some were known to have \n     been held in captivity for several years and their ultimate \n     fate has still not been satisfactorily resolved. They have \n     not been accounted for. Still others were known to have died \n     in captivity, yet their remains have not been repatriated to \n     the United States. They have not been accounted for.\n       Finally, we remain deeply concerned with reports from U.S. \n     and Russian intelligence sources that maintain several \n     hundred unidentified American POWs were held separately from \n     us during the war, in both Laos and Vietnam, and were not \n     released by Hanoi during Operation Homecoming in 1973. \n     Many of these reports have yet to be fully investigated.\n       America deserves straightforward answers if Vietnam really \n     wants normalized diplomatic and economic relations. If \n     Vietnam truly has nothing to hide on the POW/MIA issue, then \n     why have they not released their wartime politburo and prison \n     records on American POWs and MIAs? Why have they not fully \n     disclosed other military records on POWs and MIAs?\n       We would only be compounding a national tragedy if we \n     normalized relations with Hanoi before you, as Commander in \n     Chief, can tell us Hanoi is being fully forthcoming in \n     accounting for our missing comrades.\n       Perhaps more than any other group of Americans, we want to \n     put the war behind us. But it must be done in an honorable \n     way. We, therefore, ask you to send a clear message to Hanoi \n     that America expects full cooperation and disclosure on \n     American POWs and MIAs before agreeing to establish \n     diplomatic and special trading privileges with Vietnam.\n           Sincerely,\n       John Peter Flynn, Lt Gen, USAF (ret).\n       Robinson Risner, Brig Gen, USAF (ret).\n       Sam Johnson, Member of Congress.\n       Eugene ``Red'' McDaniel, CAPT, USN (ret).\n       John A.

Judd Gregg,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and \n         Judiciary, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gregg: The American Legion urges you and your \n     colleagues to retain in conference the Senate-passed language \n     on the POW/MIA Issue and U.S. relations with Vietnam (Sec. \n     406) in the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \n     Appropriations bill for the Fiscal Year beginning October 1, \n     1997.\n       As you know, Section 406 states no funds will be made \n     available for U.S. diplomacy with Vietnam, beyond what \n     existed prior to July 11, 1995, until President Clinton \n     certifies to Congress that Vietnam is ``fully cooperating'' \n     on the POW/MIA issue based on a ``formal assessment of all \n     information available to the U.S. Government.''\n       This new certification will be critical in view of the \n     Senate's findings this past April, during the debate that \n     took place during Pete Peterson's confirmation hearing as \n     Ambassador to Vietnam. Most importantly, The President's \n     certification last year was ``seriously flawed'' and not the \n     result of a careful and thorough analysis of the facts.\n       Section 406 is vital to letting communist Vietnam know that \n     their full cooperation, which includes unilateral \n     cooperation, in accounting for our missing and captured \n     personnel from the Vietnam War is still a precondition to \n     full normalization of relations.\n       At The American Legion's 79th National Convention earlier \n     this month, our delegates unanimously reaffirmed our policy \n     that insists on the fullest cooperation before any further \n     favorable actions towards Vietnam be taken.\n       Again, we urge you in the strongest possible terms, to \n     retain the Senate-passed language on the POW/MIA issue.\n       Thank you for your continuing cooperation and support.\n                                                Anthony G. Jordan,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 7 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Senator McCain is chairing a committee; otherwise, he would be here. \nSenator Hagel also wanted to speak in favor of my amendment, but he had \nto go away for a moment. I don't know if he will return in time.\n  Let me say to colleagues that for the families and for the legitimate \nconcerns of all those groups that want to make sure that this process \nis working properly, they can look with pride to the fact that we are \nengaged in the most expensive, most thorough, most effective, most \nextraordinary and comprehensive effort to provide for the accounting of \nthe missing in the history of human warfare.\n  No country has ever before, in all of human history, gone to the \nlengths that we have gone to, to try to account for our missing and our \nlost in the course of a war. That is what we are doing today. There is, \nin the current law, a requirement that the President certify that, \nbased upon all information available to the U.S. Government, that \nVietnam is fully cooperating in good faith with the United States in \nresolving discrepancy cases, live sightings, field activities, \nrecovering and repatriating American remains, accelerating efforts to \nhelp provide documents that would lead to the fullest possible \naccounting of prisoners of war and the missing in action, providing \nfurther assistance in implementing trilateral investigations with Laos, \nand recovering all archival eyewitness accounts, and so forth.\n  That is the current law. What the Senator from New Hampshire seeks to \ndo is place a whole lot of new hoops in, some of which can't be met \nbecause the intelligence community itself is divided over it. Then they \nhave a whole new way of arguing, saying that, gee, we are not doing the \njob. There is even a requirement in his section 405 about a specific \ndocument that has to be resolved, the main intelligence directorate and \nministry of defense of the Soviet Union document of 1971. This has been \nanalyzed extensively by our intelligence community. Let me just say \nthat document has been found to be in error, inaccurate. And to have us \nnow argue about it is a waste of the time, I think, of the standard.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, with all due respect of \nmy colleague, on that last point, this is a document entitled the \nComprehensive Report of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POWs/MIAs, \nof which Senator John Kerry is a member, and I am, as well as others. \nIn that document, which Senator Kerry signed, is this phrase:\n\n       There is debate within the U.S. side of the commission as \n     to whether the numbers cited in these reports are plausible. \n     The U.S. Government has concluded that there probably is more \n     information in Vietnamese party and military archives that \n     could shed light on these documents. But, to date, such \n     information has not been provided by the Vietnamese \n     government.\n\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\n\n  That is an absolute statement signed by Senator Kerry, which goes \nexactly in the opposite direction of what the Senator is trying to do \nby striking the language. It says simply that the Vietnamese have not \nprovided all of the information. This commission says so and it was \nsigned by the Senator himself. So I do not understand how the Senator \ncan sign one document and come to the floor and try to strike all the \nlanguage that supports the document that he signed. I think the whole \nmatter is just subject to great criticism in that regard alone.\n  In addition, I have a letter from Sandy Berger, the President's \nNational Security Adviser, that says, ``Vietnam's full faith efforts in \ncooperating on this issue are essential to the development of the \nrelationship.''\n  We have that in our language. In addition, there is another letter \nfrom Mr. Berger, dated April 10, 1997. The previous one was August 15, \n1997. The same point: We will continue efforts already underway to \nrequire additional information on these documents, the 735 document, \nincluding access to this document, and on and on and on--all of these \nrelating directly to the language.\n  In addition, the Senator from Arizona, who I understand is supporting \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, said on the floor of the Senate on \nApril 10, Madam President:\n\n       I thank [the Senator from New Hampshire] because if it had \n     not been for him, this very important letter from the White \n     House would not have come to our leader signed by Sandy \n     Berger, Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs. It lays out a very important set of priorities for \n     further actions that need to be taken by the United States \n     and by the Vietnamese so that we can finally put this \n     difficult chapter behind us.\n\n  That is exactly what we are doing in this language, laying out this \nseries of priorities. It is updating it and laying out the priorities. \nI urge my colleagues to simply look at 405 and respect the wishes of \nthe families and veterans groups and others, and please keep the \nlanguage in there for the sake of those people who have suffered so \nmuch throughout this process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I yield myself the balance of time. My \ncolleagues know there is nobody in the U.S. Senate more committed to \nfinding out what happened than our colleague, Senator John McCain, who \nspent 6 years-plus of his life in a prison in Vietnam. Senator McCain \nunderstands very clearly, as others of us do, that a few years ago, \nthere were 196 individuals on the list of last known alive in Vietnam. \nIn the last few years, because of our efforts, we have determined the \nfate for all but 43 of those 196. The Defense Department is opposed to \nthe language the Senator from New Hampshire has put in the bill because \nthey say it will set back our effort to get the answers on the other \n43. The administration is opposed to it. I believe that, in good \nconscience, the Senate should be opposed to that language because it \nwill set back our efforts and set back our progress.\n  Mr. GREGG. Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to table the Kerry amendment and ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I move to table the Kerry amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will occur in sequence at a later \ntime.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Amendments Nos. 3277, 3278, and 3279, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I send amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), for himself and \n     Mr. Hollings, proposes amendments numbered 3277, 3278, and \n     3279 en bloc.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Whale \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the populations of whales that occur in waters of the \n     United States are resources of substantial ecological, \n     scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value;\n       (2) whale populations--\n       (A) form a significant component of marine ecosystems;\n       (B) are the subject of intense research;\n       (C) provide for a multimillion dollar whale watching \n     tourist industry that provides the public an opportunity to \n     enjoy and learn about great whales and the ecosystems of \n     which the whales are a part; and\n       (D) are of importance to Native Americans for cultural and \n     subsistence purposes;\n       (3) whale populations are in various stages of recovery, \n     and some whale populations, such as the northern right whale \n     (Eubaleana glacialis) remain perilously close to extinction;\n       (4) the interactions that occur between ship traffic, \n     commercial fishing, whale watching vessels, and other \n     recreational vessels and whale populations may affect whale \n     populations adversely;\n       (5) the exploration and development of oil, gas, and hard \n     mineral resources, marine debris, chemical pollutants, noise, \n     and other anthropogenic sources of change in the habitat of \n     whales may affect whale populations adversely;\n       (6) the conservation of whale populations is subject to \n     difficult challenges related to--\n       (A) the migration of whale populations across international \n     boundaries;\n       (B) the size of individual whales, as that size precludes \n     certain conservation research procedures that may be used for \n     other animal species, such as captive research and breeding;\n       (C) the low reproductive rates of whales that require long-\n     term conservation programs to ensure recovery of whale \n     populations; and\n       (D) the occurrence of whale populations in offshore waters \n     where undertaking research, monitoring, and conservation \n     measures is difficult and costly;\n       (7)(A) the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator \n     of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has \n     research and regulatory responsibility for the conservation \n     of whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and\n       (B) the heads of other Federal agencies and the Marine \n     Mammal Commission established\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\n     under section 201 of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1401) have related research and management \n     activities under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 or \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n       (8) the funding available for the activities described in \n     paragraph (8) is insufficient to support all necessary whale \n     conservation and recovery activities; and\n       (9) there is a need to facilitate the use of funds from \n     non-Federal sources to carry out the conservation of whales.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL WHALE CONSERVATION FUND.\n\n       Section 4 of the National Fish and Wildlife Establishment \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 3703) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(f)(1) In carrying out the purposes under section 2(b), \n     the Foundation may establish a national whale conservation \n     endowment fund, to be used by the Foundation to support \n     research, management activities, or educational programs that \n     contribute to the protection, conservation, or recovery of \n     whale populations in waters of the United States.\n       ``(2)(A) In a manner consistent with subsection (c)(1), the \n     Foundation may--\n       ``(i) accept, receive, solicit, hold, administer, and use \n     any gift, devise, or bequest made to the Foundation for the \n     express purpose of supporting whale conservation; and\n       ``(ii) deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph (1) \n     any funds made available to the Foundation under this \n     subparagraph, including any income or interest earned from a \n     gift, devise, or bequest received by the Foundation under \n     this subparagraph.\n       ``(B) To raise funds to be deposited in the endowment fund \n     under paragraph (1), the Foundation may enter into \n     appropriate arrangements to provide for the design, \n     copyright, production, marketing, or licensing, of logos, \n     seals, decals, stamps, or any other item that the Foundation \n     determines to be appropriate.\n       ``(C)(i) The Secretary of Commerce may transfer to the \n     Foundation for deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph \n     (1)--\n       ``(I) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the \n     Secretary under section 105(a)(1) of the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1375(a)(1)) as a civil \n     penalty assessed by the Secretary under that section; or\n       ``(II) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the \n     Secretary as a settlement or award for damages in a civil \n     action or other legal proceeding relating to damage of \n     natural resources.\n       ``(ii) The Directors of the Board shall ensure that any \n     amounts transferred to the Foundation under clause (i) for \n     the endowment fund under paragraph (1) are deposited in that \n     fund in accordance with this subparagraph.\n       ``(3) It is the intent of Congress that in making \n     expenditures from the endowment fund under paragraph (1) to \n     carry out activities specified in that paragraph, the \n     Foundation should give priority to funding projects that \n     address the conservation of populations of whales that the \n     Foundation determines--\n       ``(A) are the most endangered (including the northern right \n     whale (Eubaleana glacialis)); or\n       ``(B) most warrant, and are most likely to benefit from, \n     research managment, or educational activities that may be \n     funded with amounts made available from the fund.\n       ``(g) In carrying out any action on the part of the \n     Foundation under subsection (f), the Directors of the Board \n     shall consult with the Administrator of the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration and the Marine Mammal \n     Commission.''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 6____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING JAPAN'S RECESSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Japan share common goals of \n     peace, stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in East \n     and Southeast Asia and around the world.\n       (2) Japan's economic and financial crisis represents a new \n     challenge to United States-Japanese cooperation to achieve \n     these common goals and threatens the economic stability of \n     East and Southeast Asia and the United States.\n       (3) A strong United States-Japanese alliance is critical to \n     stability in East and Southeast Asia.\n       (4) The importance of the United States-Japanese alliance \n     was reaffirmed by the President of the United States and the \n     Prime Minister of Japan in the April 1996 Joint Security \n     Declaration.\n       (5) United States-Japanese bilateral military cooperation \n     was enhanced with the revision of the United States \n     Guidelines for Defense Cooperation in 1997.\n       (6) The Japanese economy, the second largest in the world \n     and over 2 times larger than the economy in the rest of East \n     Asia, has been growing at a little over 1 percent annually \n     since 1991 and is currently in a recession with some \n     forecasts suggesting that it will contract by 1.5 percent in \n     1998.\n       (7) The estimated $574,000,000,000 of problem loans in \n     Japan's banking sector and other problems associated with an \n     unstable banking sector remain the major roadblock to \n     economic recovery in Japan.\n       (8) The recent weakness in the yen, following a 10 percent \n     depreciation of the yen against the dollar over the last 5 \n     months and a 45 percent depreciation since 1995, has placed \n     competitive price pressures on United States industries and \n     workers and is putting downward pressure on China and the \n     rest of the economies in East and Southeast Asia to begin \n     another round of competitive currency devaluations.\n       (9) Japan's current account surplus has increased by 60 \n     percent over the last 12 months from 71,579,000,000 yen in \n     1996 to 114,357,000,000 yen in 1997.\n       (10) A period of deflation in Japan would lead to lower \n     demand for United States products.\n       (11) The unnecessary and burdensome regulation of the \n     Japanese market constrains Japanese economic growth and \n     raises costs to business and consumers.\n       (12) Deregulating Japan's economy and spurring economic \n     growth would ultimately benefit the Japanese people with a \n     higher standard of living and a more secure future.\n       (13) Japan's economic recession is slowing the growth of \n     the United States gross domestic product and job creation in \n     the United States.\n       (14) Japan has made significant efforts to restore economic \n     growth with a 16,000,000,000,000 yen stimulus package that \n     includes 4,500,000,000,000 yen in tax cuts and \n     11,500,000,000,000 yen in government spending, a Total Plan \n     to restore stability to the private banking sector, and joint \n     intervention with the United States to strengthen the value \n     of the yen in international currency markets.\n       (15) The people of Japan expressed deep concern about \n     economic conditions and government leadership in the Upper \n     House elections held on July 12, 1998.\n       (16) The Prime Minister of Japan tendered his resignation \n     on July 13, 1998, to take responsibility for the Liberal \n     Democratic Party's poor election results and to acknowledge \n     the desire of the people of Japan for new leadership to \n     restore economic stability.\n       (17) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect \n     on the economy of the United States and is now seriously \n     threatening the 9 years of unprecedented economic expansion \n     in the United States.\n       (18) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect \n     on the recovery of the East and Southeast Asian economies.\n       (19) The American people and the countries of East and \n     Southeast Asia are looking for a demonstration of Japanese \n     leadership and\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\n     close United States-Japanese cooperation in resolving Japan's \n     economic crisis.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the \n     United States Trade Representative should emphasize the \n     importance of financial deregulation, including banking \n     reform, market deregulation, and restructuring bad bank debt \n     as fundamental to Japan's economic recovery; and\n       (2) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of \n     Commerce, and the Secretary of State should communicate to \n     the Japanese Government that the first priority of the new \n     Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet should be to restore \n     economic growth in Japan and promote stability in \n     international financial markets.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this bipartisan \namendment, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution expressing our concern \nabout the impact of Japan's recession on the economies of East Asia, \nSoutheast Asia and the United States, and particularly appealing to the \nmembers--our colleagues and friends--of the Liberal Democratic Party in \nJapan, which is meeting tomorrow to choose their new president, who \nwill in turn become the next Prime Minister of Japan--to be mindful of \nthe very profound and friendly concern that we have in the U.S. Senate \nabout the condition of the Japanese economy, about its impact on the \npeople of Japan, of Asia, and indeed, of the United States.\n  I am privileged to offer this bipartisan amendment on behalf of \nSenators Thomas, Graham, Lugar, Bingaman, Brownback, Durbin, Kohl, \nReid, Mack, Breaux and Inhofe.\n  For almost a half century, the United States has worked with Japan \nfor the common goals of peace, stability, democracy and prosperity in \nEast Asia and the world. However, in the face of the deepening Asian \neconomic crisis, this alliance currently faces what may be its toughest \nchallenge yet.\n  So far, the United States has survived the Asian crisis relatively \nunscathed, thanks to our long-lived boom economy. But I fear that good \nfortune may now be ending. By some estimates, worldwide GDP growth will \ndrop from 3.7 percent this year to 2.4 percent next year. Analysts have \nattributed plummeting commodity prices to the Asian crisis in this \ncountry and throughout the world. A major dropoff in demand for U.S. \nproducts in Asia has pushed the trade deficit well beyond expectations \nto a record $15.75 billion--15 and three-quarters billion--this May. \nIndustrial production in OECD countries like the United States has \nfallen from 5 percent to 2 percent and is expected to fall further \nagain to 1 percent.\n  The slide of Asian currencies against the dollar has put serious \ncompetitive pressures on our exports and another round of competitive \ndevaluations would have devastating consequences on our industries and \nour workers.\n  Unquestionably, Mr. President, if the Asian recession continues, its \nimpact on our economy will worsen and millions of Americans will feel \nwhat is happening in Japan and Asia.\n  This bipartisan resolution emphasizes that the strong recovery of the \nJapanese economy, which remains by far the largest in Asia, comprising \nfully two-thirds of the Asian economy, will make or break the region. \nWith every subsequent analysis, the economic picture in Japan darkens.\n  Japan's financial system has fundamental flaws which have only \nrecently been brought to light, but which most everyone now \nacknowledges, and the wide scope of their ramifications continues to \nunsettle and surprise economists. Bad bank loans in Japan account for \n$574 billion in debt in banks in Japan which claimed to be solvent only \nrecently, a problem which is perpetuated by a weak auditing system. \nFormal and informal barriers severely restrict free competition, often \nholding foreign market share in certain sectors down below 5 percent. \nThe yen continues to fall, down 45 percent against the dollar since \n1995. Further devaluation of the yen could lead to a devaluation of the \nChinese yuan, an event which would have significant ramifications, and \nbad ones, for the entire global economy, particularly for us in the \nUnited States.\n  All of these factors have led to substantial and understandable \ndissatisfaction among the Japanese people which they expressed earlier \nthis month, with surprising clarity to many people, in a historic \nelection for the Upper House of Parliament. The ruling Liberal \nDemocratic Party lost 17 of its 61 seats and the primary opposition \nparty, the Democratic Party of Japan, picked up nine members to reach a \ntotal of 47 seats in the Upper House. These election results should be \ntaken very seriously in the United States. The situation is bad in \nJapan, the people of Japan know it, and without change, it will get \nworse.\n  It is today axiomatic that we live and work in a global economy. When \nan economic crisis of this magnitude hits a country as large and \nsignificant as Japan, the entire world feels the impact; particularly \nwe feel it. Japan is, after all, our second largest trading partner. \nJapan imported almost $66 billion of American goods last year. That is \nmore than four times the import of American goods into China, in spite \nof its much larger population. With 40 percent of American total \nagricultural product going abroad, the Asian economic crisis is, of \ncourse, having a very negative impact on American farmers.\n  It is no surprise that we are suffering along with East Asia. Without \na rally by the Asian economies, American growth will fall off. By all \naccounts, a stable Japan is the first significant step to a broader \nAsian recovery.\n  Mr. President, I do want to indicate to my colleagues and the \nmanagers of the bill, I am prepared to yield the floor at any point if \nanyone wishes to proceed. If the managers have other business they want \nto do at this time, I am prepared to put the rest of my statement in \nthe Record. If not, I will be equally prepared to proceed. I thank the \nmanagers, noting the nod from the Democratic floor manager.\n  Japan has taken steps to address its economic troubles. Economic \nstimulus packages and structural reform committees have been set in \nplace. However, both the vast extent of the reforms necessary and the \ncurrent political turnover including the resignation of Prime Minister \nHashimoto after the election returns, which I have just described, make \nit imperative that we in the United States place our full support \nbehind the forces of change, bold change, in Japan, lest they lose \nmomentum.\n  Swift reform hopefully will be a priority in relations between our \ntwo nations. We know, of course, the President has been in touch with \nthe leadership of Japan. Secretary Rubin has done the same.\n  And it seems only proper, and in some sense is necessary, that the \nCongress of the United States make clear its broad-based concern for \nthe current economic condition of Japan--and here on the eve of the \nLiberal Democratic Party elections tomorrow, it is our deep hope, our \nplea, that change be implemented.\n  So today, along with the distinguished group of Members of both \nparties, whose names I mentioned earlier, I am pleased to offer this \nresolution to express to our President and to the Government of Japan \nthat the Senate of the United States is following Japan's economic \nperformance with increasing anxiety and is very concerned about the \npressure that Japan's current economic crisis is putting on our overall \nbilateral relationship.\n  While we applaud efforts in Japan in assessing the damage and \nbeginning the reform, we need to maintain a strong position supporting \nthe implementation of those reforms, even though we know they will be \npainful. The resolution that we submit today cites a number of \nfundamental reforms crucial to recovery in Japan and Asia, including \nderegulation of the Japanese economy, liberating the creative, \ninnovative forces that are there, improvement of market access for \nforeign entities wishing to do business in Japan, enforcement of fair \ntrade, and particularly bold and substantial banking reform.\n  These are all actions which will increase the competitiveness of the \nJapanese market and of Japanese companies, providing greater \nopportunities for foreign investment in Japan and for the success of \nindividual Japanese and foreign entrepreneurs.\n  Mr. President, a more open and healthy Japanese economy is \nfundamental to the recovery of the entire Asian region.\n  Seeing no one else on the floor, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent for 1 more minute to complete this statement.\n\n[[Page S8837]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Long into the foreseeable future, Japan will remain one of our most \nimportant economic trading partners and strategic allies in the world, \nsharing our common goals of regional and worldwide prosperity and \npeace. The importance of our alliance, though, compels us to speak out \nand place our support behind the most innovative reform efforts in \nJapan and push for a swift resolution of the economic crisis there.\n  Earlier this week, the House passed a similar resolution with the \noverwhelming support of 391 Members--only 2 opposed. Given the urgency \nof the issue and the value of a unified congressional position, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Connecticut has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. We yield back all time.\n  Does the Senator wish a vote?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is now \nset aside.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that \nwe now proceed with the four previously ordered votes, two minutes to \ndebate prior to each vote, and that the three succeeding votes be \nlimited to 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3272\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order of business is the Nickles amendment \nnumbered 3272. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time on \nthe Nickles amendment be yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Nickles amendment No. 3272.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 230 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Collins\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n  The amendment (No. 3272) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the next vote on the Bingaman \namendment, No. 3273, be passed over and put at the end of the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3276\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe the next vote will be on my \nmotion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is now the Kerry \namendment, numbered 3276. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Who goes first, proponents or opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has been given 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. All right. Mr. President, this would prevent the opening \nof a consulate in South Vietnam. At least once a year, sometimes more \noften, we have to vote on whether we want to make progress on relations \nwith Vietnam or whether we want to go back to a situation which existed \nfor many years after the war. This would prevent the opening of a \nconsulate in South Vietnam. It would basically prohibit us from being \nable to make progress on the resolution of the POW/MIA issue, which \nevery objective observer in the Pentagon says has been going along \nwell, and it would, frankly, inhibit our ability to reach a full \naccounting.\n  I recommend we vote for the Kerry amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  We have the most extensive effort to account for our service people \nin the history of human warfare, and that effort would be significantly \nset back by the language the Senator from New Hampshire has put in \nplace because the cooperation of the Vietnamese would be affected by \nthe judgments he asks the President to make.\n  We keep in place the current law. The current law has worked \neffectively. Of 196 people we last knew to be alive in Vietnam, we have \nreceived information that has told the families of what happened to all \nbut 43 of them. We want the answers for those other 43. The way to do \nthat is by continuing with the current law, not the new language of the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, there is nothing \ninappropriate at all about continuing the updating of the certification \nprocess. The President of the United States still must certify. This \ndoes not change that. This does not, as the Senator from Arizona said, \nclose down the consulate at all. It simply says the process, ongoing, \nis to continue to have the Vietnamese participate fully and cooperate \nfully with accounting for MIAs. That is all it is.\n  We have had correspondence from Mr. Berger on this matter. We have \nhad comments from Senator Kerry himself, and Senator McCain, on the \nfloor, indicating this is a process that should work--forward. So there \nis absolutely no reason to oppose it.\n  I point out, 70 former POWs have supported what I am doing in a \nletter, as does the American Legion, as does the League of Families, \nthe Alliance of Families, and VVA, and many others.\n  I think the evidence is there to say this does not interrupt \ncertification and the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts \nshould be tabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the motion to lay on the table amendment No. 3276. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered.\n  The Senators are advised this will be a 10-minute vote.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced, yeas 34, nays 66, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8838]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 231 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--34\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Lott\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Thurmond\n\n                                NAYS--66\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3276) was rejected.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, little more than 24 hours from now, the \nmembers of the Liberal Democratic Party will be meeting in Japan to \nchoose their new head, who will in turn become the next Prime Minister \nof Japan. In that sense, this resolution, which I have been privileged \nto introduce with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, the principal \ncosponsor being Senator Thomas of Wyoming, the chairman of the Asian \nSubcommittee of Foreign Relations, this resolution could not come at a \nbetter time. It recognizes the importance of our bilateral relationship \nwith Japan, perhaps the most important bilateral relationship we have. \nIt notes the economic crisis in Japan and the way in which it is \nbeginning to affect our economy. Commodity prices are dropping; our \nimport-export balance is being affected; our trade deficit is going up.\n  It appeals to the leadership of our great ally, Japan, as the Liberal \nDemocratic Party meets tomorrow, to not just choose a new leader but to \nchoose a new bold course which will directly address the economic \ncrisis in that country which is now affecting us. I urge a strong \nbipartisan vote on this as a message to our friends in Japan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I don't doubt the sincerity of our dear \ncolleague, who is one of our more respected Members, in offering a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Japanese ought to promote \neconomic growth. However, I have to say, having been here to almost \nmidnight last night, it makes little sense to me that we are going to \nhave a 100-0--if everybody is here--rollcall vote on this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution when nobody is opposed to Japan having economic \ngrowth.\n  I don't know how we are going to pass the appropriations and adjourn \nand keep the Government running if we are going to continue to do this. \nIt is not just Democrats, it is Republicans as well.\n  We are for the amendment, but why we have to have a rollcall vote on \nit, I don't understand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith], for himself, Mr. \n     Wyden, Mr. Craig, Mr. Graham, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. \n     Hatch, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Santorum, \n     Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. Thurmond, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3258.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators \nWyden, Craig, Graham of Florida, Bumpers, Gorton, Hatch, McConnell, \nMack, Kempthorne, Santorum, Faircloth, and Thurmond to offer the \nAgricultural Jobs, Opportunity, Benefits and Security Act of 1999, also \nknown as AgJOBS. Our bill will create a streamlined guest worker \nprogram to allow a reliable supply of legal, temporary, agricultural \nworkers.\n\n  Why is this necessary? Currently, in this country, we have a process \nfor guest workers that is terribly broken. The H-2A program, if I could \nshow you graphically, has a 6-page application for each worker, with \n325 pages of instructions as to how to fill it out. As a consequence, \nall of the foreign workers who are in this country are here either \nillegally or having been grandfathered in through earlier amnesties.\n  It is estimated by the GAO that 40 percent of those who are here are \nillegal. As a consequence of that, the GAO has said there is not a farm \nlabor supply problem because we have all these illegal aliens here. I \nam simply saying, and I am doing it on a bipartisan basis, we owe this \ncountry something better than a system that relies upon illegal \nimmigration. We ought to give these foreign workers the dignity of \nbeing here under law, with some basic human standards and some benefits \nto which they ought to be entitled when they are here. It is for that \nreason that Senator Wyden and I have approached the farm community and \nasked them to give as much as they can, to help economically to fix \nthis program. I believe they have responded. It is for that reason \nthere are so many Republicans and Democrats on this bill.\n  I know there are still some misgivings. I know my friend from \nMassachusetts has misgivings; the Senators from California do. But what \nwe want to do is get this bill to a conference committee with some \nplace markers so we can provide a forum where this can be further \nrefined. Let me tell you the kinds of features Senator Wyden and I \nshare in a common desire to ultimately change American law in a very \nfundamental way in order to avoid a very large crisis for consumers, \nfor farm employers, and for farm workers.\n  We are proposing in this bill the establishment of a national \nregistry which will replace the current system that so few are able to \nuse, even if they could afford to use it. This is going to be a \nregistry for domestic workers only, in a way that will allow farmers to \nknow where they can go for workers and where they can have legal \nstatus. In exchange for this, there will be added to the current \nsystem--we are going to preserve all the basic rights that are \nguaranteed; all the labor guarantees that are there will remain there. \nWe are going to have a prevailing wage rate, something that reflects a \nlevel that the agricultural community can afford, and also one that \ngives probably in excess of 1.5 million farm workers a pay raise. We \nare not talking about the minimum wage, we are talking about a \nprevailing wage plus 5 percent.\n  In addition to that, we are talking about a transportation allowance \nand a housing allowance. These are things that we owe those who come \nhere to this country to do agricultural work. These are things which my \nfriends on the left have been asking for, for a long, long time. I am \nhere to say the time is now to say yes. We are saying yes to that. We \nare doing it on a basis, though, that recognizes the economics of the \nfarmer also, because the truth is, most of the agricultural employers \nin this country are not big corporate farms, they are mom and pop who \nare trying to make a bottom line. They do not even control, in most \ncases, the price that they get for their commodities.\n  We believe--Senator Wyden and I and Senator Graham of Florida, who \nhas been so helpful on this, and others on the Democrat side--that we \nhave found the middle ground here that wins for consumers but, more \nimportant, wins for agricultural workers and also for farmers.\n  With that, I yield time to my colleague from Oregon, whose help I \nappreciate very much, Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I hope this amendment is just the beginning \nof the debate on agricultural labor. But I believe that the legislation \nbefore the Senate is based on three principles that can last well into \nthe 21st century and be in the interests of both farm workers and farm \nemployers.\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\n  The first principle on which this amendment is based is that the U.S. \nworker must come first--that U.S. workers, for example, when they \nparticipate in the registry, will have the right of first refusal to \nany available farm job in our country, and that the Federal Government \nis required to notify those workers about available positions.\n\n  Second, this amendment brings before the Senate specific changes \nproposed over the years by the Farm Worker Justice Fund to improve \nworking conditions for the farm workers in our country.\n  Third, it will replace the current dysfunctional system for \nadministering this program with one that is modern and is based on the \nuse of computer technology.\n  At every step along the way, this package tries to address specific \nconcerns raised by worker advocates, as well as those advocating for \nthe growers. My colleague, Senator Smith, talked about the registry. If \na U.S. worker participates in the registry, that worker is entitled to \nbenefits that U.S. workers are not entitled to today, such as housing \nand transportation. And the registry also seeks to address the concerns \nof growers, specifically, by saying that when a grower utilizes this \nregistry, the grower can then be certain that there is a presumption \nthat their workers are legal.\n  The last point I would like to raise, because I know many of my \ncolleagues want to speak and have important questions, deals with \nexactly the number of people involved in farm labor in our country. \nThis is the centerpiece of the question. We have heard a lot of talk on \nthe floor of the Senate about a guest worker program. There are very \nfew legal guest workers. There are 1.6 million farm workers in our \ncountry and perhaps 25,000 guest workers who are here legally under the \ncurrent program. The 1.6 million farm workers, who work on those farms, \nhave virtually no legal entitlements other than to the minimum wage. So \nwhat this legislation does is it potentially extends basic worker \nprotections to a far greater share of that 1.6 million pool of workers, \nsave 25,000. It will create a circumstance in which hundreds of \nthousands more farm workers get access to housing and transportation \nand other benefits that they do not have today.\n  I know this is a new concept, but it is an important one because what \nthis amendment seeks to do is to change the nature of the system so we \ncan make sure the bulk of our workers are legal in America. The General \nAccounting Office made the judgment that there was no shortage of \nworkers in America, but they concluded that way because they counted \nillegal workers. Right now, any grower can tell you that their workers \nmay appear to be legal, but that the Social Security Administration \noften rejects more than half of the Social Security numbers filed. So \nwhat we have is a situation with growers caught between being penalized \nbecause they cannot find legal workers or being felons because their \nworkers are not legal.\n  I believe workers deserve better and growers deserve better. That is \nwhat this amendment does. I appreciate Senator Smith giving me this \ntime from the allotment that he has.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues from Oregon, both \nof my colleagues from Oregon, and certainly the Senator from Florida, \nwho have worked with us to craft the legislation that is now before \nyou.\n  For several years, I have tried to deal with the H-2A problem, only \nto be unsuccessful. I must tell you, Mr. President, I have watched the \nproblem grow across America in a most inhumane way because the \nworkforce is needed and the workers come. They come across our borders \nillegally, they are subjected to inhumane environments, in many \ninstances, and, as a result, a great problem has grown, not only for a \nworkforce seeking work, but also for the individual or individuals who \nprovide the work, American agriculture. We have here a rare \nopportunity. It is an opportunity to fix a problem before it truly \nbecomes a crisis on both sides. And in fixing that problem, my \ncolleagues from Oregon and Florida, and myself involved, have attempted \nto approach it in a very commonsense way. That is to avoid the \nconflicts for millions of Americans, and recognizes, as Senator Wyden \njust said, that the American worker should come first, but in a state \nof near full employment where the unemployable, or those who choose not \nto work, are the only ones remaining. Clearly, we are at a point of \ncrisis, and we must offer that opportunity to farm labor, to those who \nare willing to, and under a condition now that I think is much more \npresentable.\n\n  Growers want and need a stable and predictable workforce, a legal \nworkforce. They don't like playing around the edges of illegality. Let \nus make this workforce legal under the conditions that have been \nspelled out in this legislation. I think that provides a good, fair, \nmarket-based compensation. Prevailing wage is the wage issue here, and \nthat is as it should be.\n  Unemployed workers, and those hoping to move from welfare to work, \nwant and need to be matched up with decent jobs. That is what our \nsociety ought to be directed toward. American citizens should have \nfirst claim, as I said, to American jobs, but all workers would rather \nbe working legally and hope for protection of basic labor standards.\n  These goals are not always met. In fact, current Federal law and its \nbureaucratic implementation are hurting growers and workers which have \ncreated a system that has created a monstrous bureaucracy. The Senator \nfrom Oregon talks of the multitude of pages necessary and in an attempt \nto determine who is and who isn't legal, of course, the employer \noftentimes being held liable.\n  This is why I am pleased I can join with my colleagues in proposing \nwhat I think is phenomenally constructive reform in the H-2A \nAgricultural Guest Worker Program. Failure to fix or replace this \nprogram means the Federal Government is completely ignoring the needs \nof a significantly changed agricultural labor market.\n  Many employers who meet legal standards of diligence when they hire a \nworker really have no idea if the next raid by the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service will scare off their workforce and their crops \nwill rot in the field. That is not an exaggeration. Just a few weeks \nago that happened in the State of Georgia, just to our south: One \ncounty, a raid; the rest of the county was cleared out of a workforce \nwhich left crops rotting in the fields. It is an issue in Georgia, in \nFlorida, in Idaho, in Oregon, in New York, in Kentucky--all over the \ncountry where this particular type of work force is necessary.\n  California growers and local officials have made a real effort to \naddress this shortfall with welfare-to-work efforts--which does not \nappear to be helping.\n  The GAO study that has helped prompt the kind of urgency that the \nSenators from Oregon spoke to estimated that as many as 600,000 farm \nworkers, or 37 percent of the 1.6 million, are not legally authorized \nto work in the United States--600,000. That is a problem, a very big \nproblem, a problem created by laws and by a Department of Labor, and I \nam pleased that they have worked with us to resolve this issue.\n  As workers disappear from U.S. fields--and crops stay there, instead \nof moving to stores and consumers--U.S. food will be replaced by \nforeign imported food.\n  This means a mainstay in our economy--the U.S. agriculture industry--\nis threatened with a major breakdown. And our families are threatened \nwith an increased risk to their health and safety because of food-borne \ndiseases.\n  Also, the current H-2A program has been a red-tape nightmare. Even \nwhen growers meet all deadlines, GAO found that DOL misses its \nstatutory deadlines 40 percent of the time.\n  The current H-2A program has been completely ineffective as a means \nof obtaining temporary and seasonal workers--supplying only about \n24,000 out of 1.6 million farm workers.\n  In the 1996 Immigration Law, and in appropriations over recent years, \nCongress has made it a priority to secure our borders and crack down on \nillegal immigration.\n  What is needed is a bipartisan effort to reform the current H-2A \nsystem, having the following components:\n  Creation of a new, voluntary national registry of migrant farmworkers \nto\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nwhich growers can turn for workers they know are legal.\n  If enough domestic workers cannot be supplied through the registry, \ngrowers could apply for legal guest workers through an expedited, \nreformed H-2A program.\n  The new program would resemble current H-2A, but it would have faster \nturnaround, less red tape, and greater certainty for employers.\n  It would also have continued protection for workers, and greater \nflexibility for employers, related to conditions of employment, such as \nhousing, transportation, and market-based wages.\n  I invite my colleagues to support me in this important endeavor.\n  Mr. President, again, I appreciate the bipartisan work that has gone \ninto this initiative and that we were able to bring it promptly to the \nfloor. I hope there is a strong majority, a bipartisan vote in the \nSenate to move it to conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia. How much time does she need?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sixty seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to say that what \nwe have in front of us is a major rewrite of the Guest Worker Program. \nThis particular proposal has had no hearings.\n  I have talked with my colleagues, of whom I am very fond, on both \nsides of the issue, and I am getting different responses. One says it \nwill vastly increase illegal immigration; the other says it will \ncontrol it.\n  One says it will depress agricultural workers' wages; and the other \none says, no, it is going to get better.\n  One says it will take away housing from farm workers; the other says \nit will get better.\n  What is the impact on American workers? We don't know. I say to my \ngood friends on both sides, something like this ought not be rushed \naway. I have 60 seconds to talk. My colleague from California, who has \nbeen a leader on this issue, is going to have 4 minutes or 5 minutes. \nThis is wrong. We really ought to do this in the right way: send it to \nthe committee and have a full hearing.\n  I yield back my time to my colleague. I thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I request up to 10 minutes of time from \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 3\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I have been informed by the managers of the bill \nthat we have now available on both sides until 3 o'clock. Senator \nKennedy and I have agreed we will split it evenly. I believe there is \nmore time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not. As I \nunderstand it, what we were going to do is divide the total time \nevenly, from the time the amendment was laid down until the time of the \nvote; am I correct?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. We are treating it as a \nunanimous consent request, and there is no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, before Senator Graham speaks, I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment that we intended to send \nactually be sent, and that the amendment we will be voting on will be \nthe one with the changes which we all understand are there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be properly informed. There \nare an extra 5 minutes to each side. The Senator from Oregon has 8 \nminutes 39 seconds remaining. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the current system is broken. Let me just give a few \nexamples of that collapse. According to the General Accounting Office \nreport issued the end of 1997, there were 600,000 illegal agricultural \nworkers in the United States--600,000. In my State of Florida, a major \nagricultural production State, in 1997 the number of H-2A visas, the \nvisas that would create a legal status for an alien agricultural \nworker, were four; not 400 or 4,000, but four.\n  Third, the American worker is disadvantaged under the current system. \nAs an example, if an American agricultural worker is employed by an \nAmerican farmer, the American farmer must pay Social Security and other \nemployment taxes on the wages earned by that American farm worker. But \nif the American farmer employs a non-U.S. farm worker, those taxes do \nnot have to be collected and, thus, there is an incentive to employ the \nforeign worker before employing the American worker.\n\n  Farmers are in a sea of complexity. There is a process under the \ncurrent law in which a farmer can make an application for an H-2A \nworker. Supposedly, that application is to be processed within 20 days. \nIn 1996, more than one-third of the applications failed to meet that \n20-day processing period, and so the farmer was not able to get a \nsignal as to whether his request for legal foreign workers would be \nmet.\n  This fails the foreign worker. It fails the foreign workers by \nforcing most of them into an illegal status where they lack the respect \nand protection that a legal program would provide.\n  If I could give one example: In August of 1992, after Hurricane \nAndrew hit south Dade County, FL--a major agricultural production \narea--there was concern about a public health epidemic and therefore \nthere was the desire to have people immunized against a variety of \npotential diseases.\n  The public health officials found it extremely difficult to get the \nagricultural workers to come forward to be immunized for their own \nprotection and the protection of the general public because they knew \nthey were illegal and were afraid that, by presenting themselves for an \nimmunization shot, they would be making themselves subject to \ndeportation. That is the kind of fear and terror in which we have over \n600,000 human beings in the United States, who are harvesting our food, \nlive on a daily basis.\n  Finally, the current system fails the American consumer. We have the \nopportunity in this country and have had historically access to the \nbest food produced under the most sanitary conditions and the most \naffordable food in the world. But if we have many more instances, as \nthe Senator from Idaho talked about occurred recently in Georgia, where \na major crop rots on the field because of the inability to secure a \nlegal workforce, we will be denying the American consumer what we have \ntraditionally assumed is an American birthright.\n  Mr. President, the current system is broken. The Senator from Oregon \nand others, who have joined together in this bipartisan effort, have \nattempted to understand what those problems are that contributed to the \nbrokenness of the current system and to present a series of \nprescriptions to correct that.\n  We look forward to working with our colleagues in a process of \nrefining the proposal that we have made, but we believe this represents \na significant step forward in terms of protecting the rights of \nAmerican workers, of creating a legal workforce for the American \nfarmer, and particularly the interest of the American consumer.\n  Thank you.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3258, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

If the employer requests such a \n     determination, and pays the wage required by paragraph (1) \n     based upon such a determination, such payment shall be \n     considered sufficient to meet the requirement of paragraph \n     (1).\n       (3) Reliance on wage survey.--In lieu of the procedure of \n     paragraph (2), an employer may rely on other information, \n     such as an employer-generated prevailing wage survey and \n     determination that meets criteria specified by the Secretary.\n       (4) Alternative methods of payment permitted.--\n       (A) In general.--A prevailing wage may be expressed as an \n     hourly wage, a piece rate, a task rate, or other incentive \n     payment method, including a group rate. The requirement to \n     pay at least the prevailing wage in the occupation and area \n     of intended employment does not require an employer to pay by \n     the method of pay in which the prevailing rate is expressed, \n     except that, if the employer adopts a method of pay other \n     than the prevailing rate, the burden of proof is on the \n     employer to demonstrate that the employer's method of pay is \n     designed to produce earnings equivalent to the earnings that \n     would result from payment of the prevailing rate.\n       (B) Compliance when paying an incentive rate.--In the case \n     of an employer that pays a piece rate or task rate or uses \n     any other incentive payment method, including a group rate, \n     the employer shall be considered to be in compliance with any \n     applicable hourly wage requirement if the average of the \n     hourly earnings of the workers, taken as a group, the \n     activity for which a piece rate, task rate, or other \n     incentive payment, including a group rate, is paid, for the \n     pay period, is at least equal to the required hourly wage.\n       (C) Task rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``task rate'' means an incentive payment method based on a \n     unit of work performed such that the incentive rate varies \n     with the level of effort required to perform individual units \n     of work.\n       (D) Group rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``group rate'' means an incentive payment method in which the \n     payment is shared among a group of workers working together \n     to perform the task.\n       (b) Requirement To Provide Housing.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section \n     ____04(a) for registered workers shall offer to provide \n     housing at no cost (except for charges permitted by paragraph \n     (5)) to all workers employed in job opportunities to which \n     the employer has applied under that section, and to all other \n     workers in the same occupation at the place of employment, \n     whose permanent place of residence is beyond normal commuting \n     distance.\n       (2) Type of housing.--In complying with paragraph (1), an \n     employer may, at the employer's election, provide housing \n     that meets applicable Federal standards for temporary labor \n     camps or secure housing that meets applicable local standards \n     for rental or public accommodation housing or other \n     substantially similar class of habitation, or, in the absence \n     of applicable local standards, State standards for rental or \n     public accommodation housing or other substantially similar \n     class of habitation.\n       (3) Workers engaged in the range production of livestock.--\n     The Secretary shall issue regulations that address the \n     specific requirements for the provision of housing to workers \n     engaged in the range production of livestock.\n       (4) Limitation.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to require an employer to provide or secure housing \n     for persons who were not entitled to such housing under the \n     temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June \n     1, 1986.\n       (5) Charges for housing.--\n       (A) Utilities and maintenance.--An employer who provides \n     housing to a worker pursuant to paragraph (1) may charge an \n     amount equal to the fair market value (but not greater than \n     the employer's actual cost) for maintenance and utilities, or \n     such lesser amount as permitted by law.\n       (B) Security deposit.--An employer who provides housing to \n     workers pursuant to paragraph (1) may require, as a condition \n     for providing such housing, a deposit not to exceed $50 from \n     workers occupying such housing to protect against gross \n     negligence or willful destruction of property.\n       (C) Damages.--An employer who provides housing to workers \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) may require a worker found to have \n     been responsible for damage to such housing which is not the \n     result of normal wear and tear related to habitation to \n     reimburse the employer for the reasonable cost of repair of \n     such damage.\n       (6) Housing allowance as alternative.--\n       (A) In general.--In lieu of offering housing pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D), the \n     employer may on a case-by-case basis provide a reasonable \n     housing allowance. An employer who offers a housing allowance \n     to a worker pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be deemed \n     to be a housing provider under section 203 of the Migrant and \n     Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1823) \n     solely by virtue of providing such housing allowance.\n       (B) Limitation.--At any time after the date that is 3 years \n     after the effective date of this title, the governor of the \n     State may certify to the Secretary that there is not \n     sufficient housing available in an area of intended \n     employment of migrant farm workers or aliens provided status \n     pursuant to this title who are seeking temporary housing \n     while employed at farm work. Such certification may be \n     canceled by the governor of the State at any time, and shall \n     expire after 5 years unless renewed by the governor of the \n     State.\n       (C) Effect of certification.--If the governor of the State \n     makes the certification of insufficient housing described in \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to an area of employment, \n     employers of workers in that area of employment may not offer \n     the housing allowance described in subparagraph (A) after the \n     date that is 5 years after such certification of insufficient \n     housing for such area, unless the certification has expired \n     or been canceled pursuant to subparagraph (B).\n       (D) Amount of allowance.--The amount of a housing allowance \n     under this paragraph shall be equal to the statewide average \n     fair market rental for existing housing for nonmetropolitan \n     counties for the State in which the employment occurs, as \n     established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     pursuant to section 8(c) of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(c)), based on a 2-bedroom dwelling unit \n     and an assumption of 2 persons per bedroom.\n       (c) Reimbursement of Transportation.--\n       (1) To place of employment.--A worker who is referred to a \n     job opportunity under section ____05(a), or an alien employed \n     pursuant to this title, who completes 50 percent of the \n     period of employment of the job opportunity for which the \n     worker was hired, may apply to the employer for reimbursement \n     of the cost of the worker's transportation and subsistence \n     from the worker's permanent place of residence (or place of \n     last employment, if the worker traveled from such place) to \n     the place of employment to which the worker was referred \n     under section ____05(a).\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\n       (2) From place of employment.--A worker who is referred to \n     a job opportunity under section ____05(a), or an alien \n     employed pursuant to this title, who completes the period of \n     employment for the job opportunity involved, may apply to the \n     employer for reimbursement of the cost of the worker's \n     transportation and subsistence from the place of employment \n     to the worker's permanent place of residence.\n       (3) Limitation.--\n       (A) Amount of reimbursement.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), the amount of reimbursement provided under \n     paragraph (1) or (2) to a worker or alien shall not exceed \n     the lesser of--\n       (i) the actual cost to the worker or alien of the \n     transportation and subsistence involved; or\n       (ii) the most economical and reasonable transportation and \n     subsistence costs that would have been incurred had the \n     worker or alien used an appropriate common carrier, as \n     determined by the Secretary.\n       (B) Distance traveled.--No reimbursement under paragraph \n     (1) or (2) shall be required if the distance traveled is 100 \n     miles or less.\n       (d) Continuing Obligation To Employ United States \n     Workers.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer that applies for registered \n     workers under section ____04(a) shall, as a condition for the \n     approval of such application, continue to offer employment to \n     qualified, eligible United States workers who are referred \n     under section ____05(b) after the employer receives the \n     report described in section ____05(b).\n       (2) Limitation.--An employer shall not be obligated to \n     comply with paragraph (1)--\n       (A) after 50 percent of the anticipated period of \n     employment shown on the employer's application under section \n     ____04(a) has elapsed; or\n       (B) during any period in which the employer is employing no \n     aliens in the occupation for which the United States worker \n     was referred; or\n       (C) during any period when the Secretary is conducting a \n     search of a registry for job opportunities in the occupation \n     and area of intended employment to which the worker has been \n     referred, or other occupations in the area of intended \n     employment for which the worker is qualified that offer \n     substantially similar terms and conditions of employment.\n       (3) Limitation on requirement to provide housing.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an \n     employer to whom a registered worker is referred pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) may provide a reasonable housing allowance to \n     such referred worker in lieu of providing housing if the \n     employer does not have sufficient housing to accommodate the \n     referred worker and all other workers for whom the employer \n     is providing housing or has committed to provide housing.\n       (4) Referral of workers during 50-percent period.--The \n     Secretary shall make all reasonable efforts to place a \n     registered worker in an open job acceptable to the worker, \n     including available jobs not listed on the registry, before \n     referring such worker to an employer for a job opportunity \n     already filled by, or committed to, an alien admitted \n     pursuant to this title.\n\n     SEC. ____08. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Enforcement Authority.--\n       (1) Investigation of complaints.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish a process \n     for the receipt, investigation, and disposition of complaints \n     respecting an employer's failure to meet a condition \n     specified in section ____04 or an employer's \n     misrepresentation of material facts in an application under \n     that section. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person \n     or any organization (including bargaining representatives). \n     No investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint \n     concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the \n     complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the date \n     of the failure or misrepresentation, as the case may be. The \n     Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this paragraph \n     if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure \n     or misrepresentation has occurred.\n       (B) Statutory construction.--Nothing in this title limits \n     the authority of the Secretary of Labor to conduct any \n     compliance investigation under any other labor law, including \n     any law affecting migrant and seasonal agricultural workers \n     or, in the absence of a complaint under this paragraph, under \n     this title.\n       (2) Written notice of finding and opportunity for appeal.--\n     After an investigation has been conducted, the Secretary \n     shall issue a written determination as to whether or not any \n     violation described in subsection (b) has been committed. The \n     Secretary's determination shall be served on the complainant \n     and the employer, and shall provide an opportunity for an \n     appeal of the Secretary's decision to an administrative law \n     judge, who may conduct a de novo hearing.\n       (b) Remedies.--\n       (1) Back wages.--Upon a final determination that the \n     employer has failed to pay wages as required under this \n     section, the Secretary may assess payment of back wages due \n     to any United States worker or alien described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     employed by the employer in the specific employment in \n     question. The back wages shall be equal to the difference \n     between the amount that should have been paid and the amount \n     that actually was paid to such worker.\n       (2) Failure to pay wages.--Upon a final determination that \n     the employer has failed to pay the wages required under this \n     title, the Secretary may assess a civil money penalty up to \n     $1,000 for each failure, and may recommend to the Attorney \n     General the disqualification of the employer from the \n     employment of aliens described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     for a period of time determined by the Secretary not to \n     exceed 1 year.\n       (3) Other violations.--If the Secretary, as a result of an \n     investigation pursuant to a complaint, determines that an \n     employer covered by an application under section ____04(a) \n     has--\n       (A) filed an application that misrepresents a material \n     fact; or\n       (B) failed to meet a condition specified in section ____04,\n\n     the Secretary may assess a civil money penalty not to exceed \n     $1,000 for each violation and may recommend to the Attorney \n     General the disqualification of the employer for substantial \n     violations in the employment of any United States workers or \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of time \n     determined by the Secretary not to exceed 1 year. In \n     determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed \n     or whether to recommend disqualification of the employer, the \n     Secretary shall consider the seriousness of the violation, \n     the good faith of the employer, the size of the business of \n     the employer being charged, the history of previous \n     violations by the employer, whether the employer obtained a \n     financial gain from the violation, whether the violation was \n     willful, and other relevant factors.\n       (4) Program disqualification.--\n       (A) 3 years for second violation.--Upon a second final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this title or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from the employment of \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of 3 years.\n       (B) Permanent for third violation.--Upon a third final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this section or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General, and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from any subsequent \n     employment of aliens described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (c) Role of Associations.--\n       (1) Violation by a member of an association.--An employer \n     on whose behalf an application is filed by an association \n     acting as its agent is fully responsible for such \n     application, and for complying with the terms and conditions \n     of this title, as though the employer had filed the \n     application itself. If such an employer is determined to have \n     violated a requirement of this section, the penalty for such \n     violation shall be assessed against the employer who \n     committed the violation and not against the association or \n     other members of the association.\n       (2) Violation by an association acting as an employer.--If \n     an association filing an application on its own behalf as an \n     employer is determined to have committed a violation under \n     this subsection which results in disqualification from the \n     program under subsection (b), no individual member of such \n     association may be the beneficiary of the services of an \n     alien described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act in an occupation in which \n     such alien was employed by the association during the period \n     such disqualification is in effect, unless such member files \n     an application as an individual employer or such application \n     is filed on the employer's behalf by an association with \n     which the employer has an agreement that the employer will \n     comply with the requirements of this title.\n\n     SEC. ____09.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title and the amendments made by this title shall take \n     effect 180 days after the date of enactment of this title.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. We are going to reserve that for the Senator \nfrom Washington.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in 1960, Edward R. Murrow shocked the Nation with his \nfamous television documentary on the exploitation of farm workers in \nAmerica. His report, ``Harvest of Shame,'' led to the repeal of the \nbracero program in 1964, under which 4.6 million Mexican workers had \nbeen brought to this country to harvest U.S. crops under harsh and \nabusive conditions.\n  I remember very clearly as a junior member on the Human Resources \nCommittee the extensive hearings that we had and the travels that we \ntook to many different parts of this country.\n  Yet here we are today considering an amendment that creates a new \nlarge-scale foreign agricultural worker program. Don't we ever learn? \nHave the special interests no shame.\n  A new bracero program would be harmful to American farmworkers, \nharmful to efforts to control illegal immigration, and harmful to the \nnation.\n  If the Senate votes for this amendment, it is voting for another \n``harvest of shame.'' It is voting to let thousands of poor foreign \nfarmworkers come here and stay permanently. This amendment opens the \nfloodgates to foreign workers. It gives them permanent green cards if \nthey work here for four consecutive harvests.\n  This amendment turns its back on years of efforts to improve \nconditions for America's farmworkers we admit under the current \nimmigration laws.\n  A vast new guest worker program is completely unnecessary. As the \nGeneral Accounting Office said in December: ``Ample supplies of farm \nlabor appear to be available in most areas.''\n  I refer our colleagues to page 6 of the December publication of the \nGAO. It says:\n\n       GAO's own analysis suggests, and many farm labor experts, \n     government officials, and grower and farm labor advocates \n     agree, that a widespread farm labor shortage has not occurred \n     in recent years and does not now appear to exist. . . It \n     found that 13 counties maintained annual double-digit \n     unemployment rates, and 19 percent had rates above the \n     national average.\n\n  The late Barbara Jordan and her Commission on Immigration Reform \nunanimously--unanimously--concluded that creating such a program would \nbe a ``grievous mistake''. Every Federal immigration commission in \nmodern times has concluded that agricultural guestworker programs \nshould not be expanded. The Commission on Immigration Reform, the \nCommission on Agricultural Workers in 1992, and the Hesburgh Commission \nin 1981 all reached that conclusion.\n  The so-called protections in this amendment can be easily \ncircumvented. The Department of Labor does not even have the authority \nto limit the issuance of visas if it finds that the employment of \nforeign labor is hurting U.S. workers. This bill strips all of the \nprotections in the current program.\n  First, this amendment weakens the requirements to hire American \nfarmworkers first. It requires the Department of Labor to set up a new \nhigh-tech registry in which growers post their jobs and American \nworkers who register with the Labor Department can be matched with \nthem. But all a company has to do is check the registry--if it can't \nget a worker right away, it can bring in a foreign worker. A check with \nthe registry is the only recruitment an employer has to do, and we do \nnot know if the registry will even work.\n  Most American farmworkers earn less than $12,000 a year. They don't \nhave computers at home, where they can log onto the Internet and check \nthe registry. In fact, many American farmworkers can't even afford \ntelephones to call the registry. Until we know that a registry really \ncan work, it is nothing but a gimmick that lets growers evade their \nresponsibility to hire U.S. workers first.\n  This amendment also eliminates the requirement that growers must \nprovide housing for the foreign workers they bring in. Even under the \ndiscredited bracero program, employers were required to provide \nhousing.\n  But under this amendment, all growers have to provide is a housing \nvoucher. What foreign worker can negotiate the American housing market? \nHow can a farmworker from Mexico or the Caribbean find an apartment in \nrural America to rent for just a few weeks when he doesn't know his way \naround, can't speak English, and doesn't have a car? You can make the \nhousing as generous as you want. But many of these workers are going to \nbe homeless.\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\n  This amendment also weakens the wage standards and will depress the \nwages of American farmworkers already struggling to make ends meet. \nAmerican farmworkers are the poorest of the working poor. I ask \nunanimous consent that an article from the New York Times be printed at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 19, 1998]\n\n         The Middle Class: Winning in Politics, Losing in Life\n\n                          (By Louis Uchitelle)\n\n       The great American middle class, Politicians of the left \n     and right court it. Policies, liberal and conservative, are \n     proclaimed on its behalf. Health care reform was to have \n     eased its cares. Tuition subsidies educate its children. \n     President Clinton made a ``middle class tax cut'' a \n     centerpiece of his election campaign.\n       Most voters see themselves as members of the middle class, \n     so Newt Gingrich, the House Speaker, picked up the theme. \n     When the Republican-controlled Congress finally passed a tax \n     bill last year, he described it as the Republican \n     ``fulfillment of what President Clinton promised--a middle \n     class tax cut.''\n       But for all its mythic power, the middle class is finishing \n     last in the race for improvement in the current economic \n     boom. At the top and bottom of the economic ladder, wages are \n     rising briskly. In the middle, they are rising slowly. This \n     is unusual. While upper-income people often improve their lot \n     faster than the middle class, lower-income workers hardly \n     ever do.\n       The middle class of political exhortation and national myth \n     isn't the same as the statistical middle of the wage scale, \n     the place where progress is surprisingly slow. Half of the \n     so-called middle class tax cuts enacted last year went to \n     people earning more than $93,000. And while the median \n     household earns almost $40,000 a year, the median individual \n     wage is much lower: $11.13 an hour last month, or about \n     $23,000 a year for a 40-hour work week.\n       It isn't that workers in this statistical middle--people \n     earning roughly $23,000 to $32,000 a year for a 40-hour \n     week--are visibly aggrieved because they are losing ground to \n     their upper- and lower-earning fellow citizens. After all, \n     their pay has gone up faster than the inflation rate over the \n     last two years, even if the increase is not as great as the \n     one experienced by lower- and upper-income workers.\n       ``Everyone seems to be reacting to the favorable \n     improvement in their pay,'' said Richard Curtin, director of \n     consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. ``But the \n     longer the expansion lasts, the more people will turn toward \n     comparisons with other groups. That's when the grumbling and \n     the wage demands begin. When you look across society, you are \n     not really seeing that yet.''\n\n\n                         The Middle-Class Life\n\n       Lots of things can help someone improve his lot in life, of \n     course. A rising stock market, tax breaks, inheritance, \n     government subsidies like Medicare and Social Security, extra \n     hours on the job and overtime pay all pay roles, particularly \n     for those at the top and bottom of the income ladder. The \n     really wealthy often rely not on wages but on earnings from \n     their investments. And many households put together the wages \n     of two or three household members, bringing the median \n     household income to nearly $40,000, which is enough to live a \n     middle-class life in most of the United States.\n       By some estimates, a family of four must bring in at least \n     $27,000 a year from one or more wage earners to maintain what \n     John Schwarz, a political scientist at Arizona State \n     University, describes as ``a minimally adequate standard of \n     living.'' In pursuit of that goal, most people measure their \n     standing in the work force by what they earn individually on \n     the job.\n       The bottom 20 percent on the national wage scale, earning \n     $14,500 a year or less for a 40-hour week, has gained the \n     most ground over the last two years, once wages are adjusted \n     for inflation. Upper-income Americans, those earning north of \n     $75,000 a year, have gained almost us much as the low-income \n     people in the same two-year stretch. The middle group has \n     gained a little ground since 1996, but less than the others.\n\n\n                              Breakthrough\n\n       Viewed over the full eight years of the current economic \n     expansion, the middle has actually lost ground, while the top \n     and the bottom have gained at roughly the same gradual pace. \n     Once wages are adjusted for inflation, the low end, for the \n     first time, has regained all the ground lost in the early \n     1990's and is now earning more than in 1989, when the last \n     economic expansion ended and a recession set in, undercutting \n     wages.\n       Workers earnings slightly more than the poorest group or, \n     at the other extreme, somewhat less than the richest wage \n     earners, also did better than those in the middle, although \n     not as well as those at either extreme.\n       The breakthrough came this year. The low-end wage, a \n     maximum of $6.99 an hour last month for the bottom 20 \n     percent, was 20 cents higher than in 1989, adjusted for \n     inflation, according to the Economic Policy Institute, which \n     calculated the trends from data provided by the Labor \n     Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n       By comparison, the median wage, smack in the middle, was \n     $11.13 an hour in June, or 17 cents lower than in 1989. The \n     upper end, mostly peopled by well educated and skilled \n     workers, seldom loses ground in any year. At the high end, \n     the wage of $24.63 an hour today, adjusted for inflation, is \n     91 cents ahead of the comparable 1989 level.\n       There are reasons, of course, for the slide in the middle. \n     Despite all the rhetorical emphasis on policies that favor \n     the middle class, it is low-income workers who have gotten \n     the extra nod from Washington in this economic expansion--\n     particularly through a 90-cents-an-hour increase in the \n     minimum wage since October 1996. It was an increase that the \n     Democrats proposed and the Republicans in Congress finally \n     favored.\n       The minimum reached $5.15 an hour last September, and the \n     ripple effect has pushed up wages for workers earning as much \n     as 50 cents an hour over the minimum. That is a big portion \n     of the people in the lower 20 percent of the American work \n     force.\n       ``The higher minimum wage is the key factor that has lifted \n     people at the bottom,'' said Edward Wolff, a labor economist \n     at New York University, whose own earnings calculations \n     produced roughly the same results as those of the Economic \n     Policy Institute.\n       The economy has played a big role, too. A surge in growth \n     over the last two years and a falling unemployment rate \n     produced labor shortages that showed up first at the low end \n     of the work force. Meanwhile, middle-level workers, while \n     finding jobs easily enough, had more difficulty raising their \n     wages. Mr. Wolff and other labor economists tick off the \n     reasons.\n       Computers have diluted the demand for clerks, secretaries \n     and other medium-skilled workers. Unions, once the powerful \n     bargaining agents of middle Americans, are weak today. Rising \n     imports have hurt workers who make the same goods in this \n     country. Corporate downsizing spread in the 1990's through \n     white-collar ranks, making middle-income people feel less \n     secure in their jobs and more reluctant to push for raises. \n     And a bigger percentage of the work force now has a college \n     education or at least some college training, diluting the \n     demand for them. The wages of people with only four years of \n     college are no longer rising.\n       ``While middle income people benefit from the tight labor \n     market, they have a harder time digging themselves out of the \n     wage hole,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the \n     Economic Policy Institute.\n\n\n                              hard to help\n\n       They are also harder for government to help, says Edward \n     Montgomery, the Labor Department's chief economist. A huge \n     swath of people who earn roughly $23,000 to $55,000 a year--\n     and pay more than 40 percent of all Federal income taxes--are \n     much more on their own than lower-income workers. There are \n     government-subsidized training programs, for example, to get \n     unemployed people into the low end of the labor force. The \n     minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit (a Republican \n     initiative that rebates tax revenue to low-wage workers) put \n     a floor under their income. But middle-level people depend \n     much more on their own dealings with their employers to \n     determine their situations.\n       ``It is harder for government policies to reach these \n     middle level people,'' Mr. Montgomery said. ``In a free \n     enterprise society, we are hesitant to subsidize an employer \n     for something he would do anyway.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This study shows that despite the extraordinary \nprosperity we have seen in the United States, the farmworkers are on \nthe lowest rung--working the hardest--the lowest rung of the economic \nladder and have moved backward in terms of their real purchasing power. \nThey already suffer double-digit unemployment, and this amendment will \nmake that crisis worse. It eliminates the requirement in current \nimmigration law that foreign workers must be paid a wage that will not \ndepress wages for American farmworkers.\n  Even if an American worker shows up early in a harvest, he will not \nbe guaranteed the job if an employer has foreign workers. In fact, that \nis the way most American migrant farmworkers get their jobs--by just \nshowing up. For years--for decades--they have travelled farm to farm at \nharvest time. They show up for the job, harvest after harvest.\n  Under current law, if an American worker shows up in the first half \nof a harvest, he gets the job, even if a foreign worker is already \nthere. This is called the ``50 percent rule.'' Under this amendment, if \nthat American worker is not on the new computer ``registry,'' he cannot \nget the job.\n  I am also concerned that this amendment will encourage illegal \nimmigration. After spending billions of dollars to strengthen the \nBorder Patrol to keep illegal immigrants out, it makes no sense to \ninstruct the INS to cut a gaping hole in the border fence, and look the \nother way as illegal immigrants pour through.\n  We know from the hard lesson of past experiences that foreign \nagricultural\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\nworker programs create patterns of illegal immigration that can't be \nstopped. The first workers to come here may be legal, have temporary \nwork visas--but they create an endless chain of illegal immigration, as \nrelatives, neighbors, and friends follow them into America.\n  In fact, under this amendment, if you work in this program for four \nyears, you get a green card and can stay in America forever. An \nunlimited number of workers can enter under this reckless program. \nThere is no cap. Hundreds of thousands of workers can come in, work \nfour years, get green cards, and stay forever.\n  As Philip Martin, a leading agricultural labor economist at the \nUniversity of California at Davis, has stated, when it comes to \ntemporary foreign worker programs, ``There is nothing more permanent \nthan a temporary worker.''\n  The original bracero program did not really end in 1964. It \nestablished a permanent, well-traveled path of illegal immigration. And \nthree and a half decades later, we are still paying a price. A \ncomprehensive joint study by the United States and Mexico, completed \nlast year, put it this way:\n\n       History has shown that U.S.-sanctioned bracero recruitment \n     in the 1950s oriented many Mexican workers toward the U.S. \n     labor market instead of toward local jobs and development. \n     This began a tradition of migration, raised expectations, and \n     set into place a baseline of individuals and families who \n     would eventually reside permanently in the U.S. Although \n     meant to be a temporary supply of workers, an unintended \n     consequence was to create a resident population.\n\n  This amendment adds to that problem, Mr. President. I think it will \nhurt America's vulnerable farmworkers and cause permanent damage to our \nimmigration policies. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I am really disappointed that this program is being \nramrodded through on an appropriations bill. This program represents a \nhuge new immigration program and no one should think to the contrary.\n  Fifty percent of all the people that are going to come in from other \ncountries under this program will go to one State--California. \nCalifornia has not been afforded the time to do the analysis to see how \nthis program would affect it. This program is a Trojan horse.\n  When I heard the testimony on a registry program on the Judiciary \nCommittee I thought, ``Great idea; I want to support it.'' When the \nSenators made the announcement, I was a cosponsor. Then I saw that \nattached to the concept of the registry program was also a huge \nimmigration program with no controls whatever, no way of asserting \nwhether individuals go back, and as a matter of fact--and I will \nexplain that shortly--setting up incentives for these people to remain \nin the country in a legal status. In California, this will mean \nliterally tens of thousands of additional immigrants coming into the \nState. We currently have 2 million people in California in illegal \nstatus. This will only add to the number of illegal status.\n  Let me say how this will happen. Under the amendment, if the \nDepartment of Labor cannot find American workers--and there is no \nregistry in place in California--this bill will go into play. The large \nagricultural associations will apply for 20,000, 30,000 permits at a \ntime. The Department of Labor has 7 days to respond to that. If they \ndon't respond to that huge number in that period of time, the permits \nare authorized and the foreign workers come in. There is no way of \nknowing who they are, whether they have any bona fide documents.\n  Additionally, once a worker is in this country for 10 months, they \ncan apply for a 3-year extension. Therefore, you effectively are \ngranting a stay of 3 years to someone who comes in. They then should \nreturn, and if they come back for one more year, they are here for all \ntime. They gain legal status under this program. There are no caps on \nany numbers being brought in.\n  The major part of concern in this bill--and I want this in the \nRecord, is section 6(b)1, the application to the Secretary of State \nthat sets up this 7-day period when the employer submits the \napplication for alien workers directly to the Secretary of State with a \ncopy of the application provided to the Attorney General seeking the \nissuance of visas and the admission of aliens for employment in the job \nopportunities for which the employer has not received referral of \nregistered workers.\n  Then there is an expedited consideration by the Secretary of 5 days.\n  It is physically impossible to consider 20 or 30,000 applications in \n5 days. It is set up to permit the entry of large numbers of people \nabout whom nothing will be known--whether they really will go home, \nwhether they really will stay at the job, work at the job. I think this \nis going to make the Bracero Program look good in retrospect.\n  Now, what I object to is I would like to vote for something that \nwould help what is becoming an increasing problem. That increasing \nproblem is that increasingly farmers cannot find adequate labor to \nharvest their crops. In our State, you have these counties with 20 \npercent and 30 percent unemployment rates. It is amazing, but it is \ntrue. Unemployment rate is high, but the farmer cannot find the help. \nThis is where the registry was supposed to help. But the registry and \nthe importation program go into effect simultaneously. Consequently, if \nthere is nobody on the registry, you have the opening to import 20, 30, \n50, 75,000 workers with no limit. That is what I had hoped we would \nhave the time to work out. We don't know whether the housing allowance \nwill work in California. California isn't Oregon. Costs are much \nhigher. Housing is unavailable.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3282 to Amendment No. 3258, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would suggest that until the time \nhas either been used or yielded back, an amendment is not in order.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. All right.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the proponent of the major \namendment knew that this was going to be offered. I ask unanimous \nconsent it be in order now to be able to offer the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3282 to amendment No. 3258.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, line 19, after the period, insert: \n     ``Independent contractors, agricultural associations and such \n     similar entities shall be subject to a cap on the number of \n     H2-A visas that they may sponsor at the discretion of the \n     Secretary of Labor.''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. What this does, and I quote from the amendment:\n\n       Independent contractors, agricultural associations and such \n     similar entities shall be subject to a cap on the number of \n     H2-A visas that they may sponsor at the discretion of the \n     Secretary of Labor.\n\n  This would give the Secretary of Labor the opportunity to see that \nthere is a reasonable number attached to this limited processing time \nbecause with the limited processing time, if you apply for 50,000 \npeople, as could well be the case in California, you would not be able \nto meet the processing deadline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining; opposing \nhas 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is hard to do justice to the topic \nin 5 minutes.\n  Let me say I think something is happening on the floor of the Senate \nthat takes us backward as a nation. There have been many people that \nhave given their sweat and tears and even blood to try and improve \nconditions for farm workers. There have been Senators in the past that \nhave done that. This amendment really undercuts some of this very \nimportant work.\n  What we are saying in this amendment is essentially this: We are \nsaying\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\nto the growers, listen, you don't have to really worry about the \nmarket. If the growers can't find the workers, pay better wages and \nhave better working conditions. How many more reports do we have to \nhave, from Harvest of Shame, to reports today of working conditions? \nThe wages and uncivilized working conditions of farm workers are a \nnational disgrace. If the growers want to have people working for them, \nthen just have civilized working conditions and decent wages.\n  What this amendment essentially says is that what we are going to do \nis actually add to the exploitation by enabling you growers to \nessentially rely on a new guest worker program. Mr. President, we don't \nneed a new guest worker program. Senator Kennedy talked about the GAO \nreport. I heard the farm worker justice fund mentioned earlier. They \ndon't talk about this as reform; they talk about it as deform. We have \na very strange situation here. We are saying that the growers can't get \nthe workers, and now what we have is a program that cuts payments for \nguest workers. This cuts the payments for the guest workers. So in \norder to attract more workers, we enable growers to rely on people \ncoming in from other countries, and we cut their wages.\n  I don't call this reform. I don't call this a change for the better. \nWhat we are essentially doing is putting the Federal Government at the \nservice of a sector--in this particular case the growers--as a source \nof cheap labor. It is a huge mistake. Now, if we want to do better by \nway of working conditions for legal workers, I am all for it. If we \nwant to reform the Guest Worker Program, I am all for it. But that is \nnot what this is about. This is a huge step backward.\n  I hear about the vouchers. I mean, I did a lot of organizing in rural \ncommunities. The question is whether there is any housing. What good \ndoes it do to have vouchers if there isn't adequate housing there? We \nno longer deal with that protection. Then, in addition, the three-\nfourths minimum work guarantee is eliminated.\n  Workers who used to travel long distances are now promised wages for \nat least three-fourths of the season for which they are being hired. \nThat guarantee is no longer there. This essentially takes the Guest \nWorker Program backwards. It adds to exploitation. It undercuts the \nworking conditions of farm workers, which are already atrocious in this \ncountry. I say to the growers, with all due respect, if you want to \nhave more people working for you, pay decent wages, have civilized \nworking conditions. We ought not to be asking the Federal Government to \nessentially move in and supply these growers with a form of cheap \nlabor, exploited labor. This isn't reform, this is deform. I hope there \nwill be a strong vote against it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I yield the balance of our time \nto the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, these agricultural workers are already \nhere. The Senator from California spoke of 2 million illegal workers \nalready here. But we would think from the remarks of the opponents of \nthis amendment that somehow or another we were spoiling a very good \nsystem that gave high wages, a wonderful set of attractions, and only \nneeded to be strengthened. We aren't, Mr. President.\n  We have a situation that makes a violator of the law out of almost \nevery agricultural employer in the United States of America who needs \nlabor on a seasonal basis. What we propose to do is to say that many of \nthese workers, whatever their conditions, are infinitely superior to \nthe country from which they came, which is the reason they are willing \nto pay good money to be smuggled across our borders, several of whom \ndie in the desert in the attempt to hide during the time that they are \nhere, not to claim any of the rights they might otherwise have.\n  Our proposal would make many of them legally here, with very real \nrights, with the ability to go home legally and to come back again \nlegally, rather than to have to stay because of the difficulty of \ncrossing the border. Mr. President, tens of thousands of words have \nbeen uttered on the floor of this Senate in the last 3 weeks about the \nplight of our farmers, with collapsed Asian markets and lower prices. \nHere, for once, we have an opportunity to do something tangible for our \nfarm community, to give them the labor that they cannot get in any \nlegal fashion from citizens, or others, to allow them to be law-\nabiding, as they wish to do; and instead we have an argument that we \nbetter keep the present system; we better keep a system in which there \nare millions of illegal farm workers here because we don't care to try \nsomething that allows this labor to be provided legally. That is the \ndifference.\n  Do we want the labor that is there now, and will be there tomorrow, \nto be legal labor? Or do we think the present situation with all these \nillegals is perfectly fine? Yes or no; up or down. Let's allow these \npeople to be here legally, to help us to improve their own lives \nlegally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes remain.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague for his patience. It has been \nmentioned that this is in some way a bracero program. My friends, this \nis not. Under the Bracero Program, for example, there was no right of \nfirst refusal for U.S. workers to available jobs in our country. That \nis what is different here--U.S. workers first, first dibs on any \navailable position.\n  Point No. 2: There has been discussion that this amendment would in \nsome way increase illegal immigration. Right now, of the 1.6 million \nfarm workers, perhaps a million of them are illegal. What we are \nadvocating is an above-ground system that guarantees fundamental \nprotections to legal workers. Some of our opponents, it seems to me, \nprefer an underground system that is going to keep thousands of those \nworkers hidden in the back of a U-Haul trailer or the trunk of a car. \nThat is not humane. We don't want those workers in the back of a U-Haul \nor in the trunk of a car. We want them participating in a legal, humane \nsystem that rewards both the workers and the growers. That is why this \nproposal makes sense. I hope it will receive strong support from our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have talked to the managers of the bill \nabout the acceptance of an amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be temporarily set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3283 to Amendment No. 3258\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3283 to amendment No. 3258.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       In implementing this title, the President of the United \n     States shall not implement any provision that he deems to be \n     in violation of any of the following principles: where the \n     procedures for using the program are simple and the least \n     burdensome for growers; which assures an adequate labor \n     supply for growers in a predictable and timely manner; that \n     provides a clear and meaningful first preference for U.S. \n     farm workers and a means for mitigating against the \n     development of a structural dependency on foreign workers in \n     an area or crop; which avoids the transfer of costs and risks \n     from businesses to low wage workers; that encourages longer \n     periods of employment for legal U.S. workers; and which \n     assures decent wages and working conditions for domestic and \n     foreign farm workers, and that normal market forces work to \n     improve wages, benefits, and working conditions.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, as I have expressed, I have serious concerns about the \ndevelopment of this program. Similar kinds of programs have been \nconsidered and rejected by the Hesburgh Commission.\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\n The Barbara Jordan Commission, which really had many thoughtful men \nand women on it, reviewed these kinds of programs and expressed the \nsame kinds of concerns that I have expressed here briefly this \nafternoon. For that reason, as well as the very important adverse \nimpact that I think it will have on wages; and because of its impact in \nterms of opening up some unpredictable, unknown, and uncertain aspects \nof immigration policy that I oppose this.\n  Having said all that, I commend my friends, Senator Smith and Senator \nWyden. They have appeared before our committees on this issue. They \nhave been enormously constructive and positive and responsive to those \nthat had differing views on this. They have, brought a very \nconsiderable amount of thought to this issue and they have impressed \nme, as I know they have all Members, about their willingness to try and \nwork this thing through in a constructive way. I intend to vote in \nopposition for the reasons outlined. But I want to work with them and \nsee if we cannot respond to these kinds of concerns. Both of them have \nexpressed their deep-seated concerns about these issues as well. We do \nhave differences, but they have demonstrated on this issue, as in other \nareas, a willingness to try and find common ground. I thank them for \ntheir courtesies to date and for their willingness to continue to \ndevelop something that is going to be effective. I and others who share \nthis view will look forward to working with them.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield whatever time I have to the \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  I join in the spirit of trying to work on this issue to resolve a \nsituation that I truly believe is broken. If we don't succeed in this, \nwe are frankly not going to say that we are content with the status \nquo. The status quo is not acceptable. These people are here in this \ncountry illegally. There ought to be a way in which they can be here \nlegally to do this work, which they want to do, and which we need them \nto do in order to avoid a serious crisis on the American farm.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It is historic. It is \nimportant. But it is also a work in progress. This bill represents \nprogress.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on the Kennedy second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that the underlying amendment be \nmodified with our amendment. I ask unanimous consent that be done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3282 and 3283) were agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, Mr. President, the proposal of the \nSenators from California and Massachusetts has been included in the \nunderlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. For the information of all of our Members, we will begin \nvoting on this amendment and then proceed to final passage at \napproximately 3:30.\n\n\n Modification to Amendment No. 3261, As Modified, Previously Agreed To\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send to the desk on behalf of Senator \nSpecter a technical modification to the Craig amendment numbered 3261.\n\n       ``(2) Within funds appropriated in this Act for necessary \n     expenses of the Offices of United States Attorneys, \n     $1,500,000 shall be available for the Attorney General to \n     hire additional assistant U.S. attorneys and investigators in \n     the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for a demonstration \n     project to identify and prosecute individuals in possession \n     of firearms in violation of federal law.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, while we are waiting, I would like to take \na moment. We are, hopefully, about to move to final passage after the \nvote on the Smith amendment is taken care of.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank the staff for the \nextraordinarily hard work they put into this. Both the majority staff \nand the minority staff spent countless hours bringing this bill \nforward. It is a complicated bill. They spent the last 3 or 4 days, \nalmost, working on it. We have seen a lot of amendments. More than a \nlittle bit of intricate thought has gone into it. It has a very complex \nmatrix of issues. And it could not possibly have been managed without \nthe strong and professional support that we have received from the \nstaff.\n  I would like to also specifically thank former minority clerk Scott \nGudes, who has moved on but whose work for 12 years on this committee \nwas extraordinary, and whom I very much enjoyed working with. His \nreplacement, Lila Helms, is a great addition and has carried on Scott's \nexceptional work. Emelie East and Dereck Orr have also been great \nassets, I am sure, to the minority and to the majority, as a result of \ntheir efforts.\n  On my own staff, countless hours have been put in, and I especially \nthank Jim Morhard, who is clerk of the committee. I don't think he has \nseen his family, or anyone else, other than the inside of these walls \nfor days and weeks. I very much appreciate his efforts and the \nexpertise he has brought to this.\n  Along with him, the professional staff of Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, \nCarl Truscott, Dana Quam, and Vas Alexopoulos have been extraordinary; \nKris Pickler, and Jackie Cooney of my personal staff, and Virginia \nWilbert, who have been extraordinary also, have not only put their oars \nin but have aggressively rowed this boat toward the shore. We hope it \nwill arrive very soon.\n  It is really a team effort. And we have an extremely strong team, a \nteam made up of Cal Ripkens and Ken Griffeys. We are very lucky to have \nthem, and we thank them for all their time and effort.\n  I have been advised that the Democratic leader is willing to proceed \nwith a vote at 3:15. We will begin voting on the Smith amendment at \n3:15.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank Chairman Gregg in the first \ninstance. I have had the occasion to handle several bills myself. I \nhave watched it for over 30 years. Several Senators on our side of the \naisle have remarked along with me in the back of the cloakroom that \nthey have never seen a bill that was better managed and that Senator \nGregg has done an outstanding job, which I want to note for the Record.\n  As the distinguished Senator stated, the staffs on both sides have \njust done an outstanding job. They worked around the clock. I have \nnever seen this many amendments actually move in this short a time. It \ncouldn't have been done, of course, without the folks here right at the \nfront desk on both sides of the aisle.\n  Let me thank Jim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Carl Truscott, \nDan Quam, and Virginia Wilbert, of the majority staff; and Lila Helms, \nEmelie East, and Dereck Orr. Actually, as Senator Gregg has pointed \nout, Lila has come in now to replace Scott Gudes, which is next to \nimpossible. He was as good as there ever was. But she has already \nbrought that statement into contest. She, Emelie East, and Dereck Orr \nhave been working around the clock and have been doing a great job.\n  I am glad that the Senator from New Hampshire notes this for the \nRecord. Too often we forget that we couldn't handle these bills without \nScott Gudes, and Dereck Orr on our side of the aisle. I can tell you \nthat.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the managers'\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\namendments be in order notwithstanding the fact that they amend \nlanguage already amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3284 through 3321, en bloc\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I now send to the desk a series of amendments cleared by \nboth managers on behalf of myself and Senator Hollings. I further ask \nthey be considered and adopted en bloc and motion to reconsider these \namendments be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself and \n     Mr. Hollings, proposes amendments numbered 3284 through 3321, \n     en bloc.\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment designed \nto give parents a tool to help protect their children from pornography \nand sexual predators on the Internet. According to Wired magazine, \nthere are\n\n[[Page S8853]]\n\ncurrently some 28,000 web sites containing hard- and soft-core \npornography. And that number is growing at an alarming rate, it is \nestimated that 50 pornographic sites are added to the Internet each \nday.\n  Sadly, many of out children are, out of curiosity or by accident, \nexposed to such sites while surfing the web. They type in search terms \nas innocuous as ``toys''--only to find graphic images and language on \ntheir display terminal.\n  Mr. President, the Internet is profoundly changing the way we learn \nand communicate with people. Today, our children have unprecedented \naccess to educational material through the Internet. It provides \nchildren with vast opportunities to learn about art, culture and \nhistory--the possibilities are endless.\n  However, this advanced technology also brings with it a dark side for \nour children. Many children who are browsing the net--often \nunaccompanied by an adult--come across material that is unsuitable for \nthem, and is oftentimes sexually explicit.\n  Mr. President, every parent worries about strangers approaching their \nchildren in their neighborhood or on the playground at school. And they \nteach their children how to avoid these strangers. But, today, these \nstrangers are literally inside our homes. They are only a mouse click \naway from our children. In our libraries and bookstores, we store \nreading material that is harmful to minors in areas accessible only to \nadults. Yet, in cyberspace, these same materials are as accessible to a \nchild as his or her favorite bedtime story.\n  Pornography and predators are now reaching our children, via the \nInternet, in the privacy and safety of their own homes and classrooms. \nThis kind of access to our children is alarming, and this invasion of \nour children's privacy and innocence is unconscionable.\n  We, as a nation, have an obligation to ensure that surfing the web \nremains a safe and viable option for our children. We have a \nresponsibility to make sure that they are able to learn and grow in an \nenvironment free of sexual predators and pornographic images. Clearly, \nthere is no substitute for parental supervision. Yet, I think we can \nall agree that many parents know less about the Internet than their \nchildren. Parents are convinced of the Internet's educational value, \nbut they feel anxious about their ability to supervise children while \nthey use it.\n  In my view, it is important that we encourage parents and children to \nuse the Internet together. But clearly, it is difficult for any adult \nto monitor children online all of the time.\n  Therefore, I believe we need to provide our parents with the tools to \nprotect and guide our children. The amendment I offer today is a modest \nmeasure designed to provide one such tool. It would ensure that \nInternet access providers make screening software available to \ncustomers purchasing Internet access services.\n  The amendment would allow customers to have the opportunity to \nobtain--either for a fee or no charge, as determined by the provider--\nscreening software that permits customers to limit access to material \non the Internet that is harmful to minors. Like going to the pharmacy \nand being asked if you want a child-proof lid for a prescription \nmedication, my bill would require that Internet access providers ask \nparents whether they would like to obtain screening software.\n  It is not a guarantee that children using the Internet would be \nprotected from pornography and predators. And it is not a substitute \nfor parental supervision. But it can be an extension of parental \nsupervision--a tool we put in their hands to help protect their kids--\nmuch as we did when we voted to give parents the v-chip.\n  I hope my colleagues will endorse this amendment, and I urge its \nadoption.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3287\n\n (Purpose: To move Schuylkill County, PA from the Eastern District to \n                  the Middle District of Pennsylvania)\n\n     SEC.   .

REPORT ON KOREAN STEEL SUBSIDIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the United States Trade Representative \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Trade Representative'') \n     shall report to Congress on the Trade Representative's \n     analysis regarding--\n       (1) whether the Korean Government provided subsidies to \n     Hanbo Steel;\n       (2) whether such subsidies had an adverse effect on United \n     States companies;\n       (3) the status of the Trade Representative's contacts with \n     the Korean Government with respect to industry concerns \n     regarding Hanbo Steel and efforts to eliminate subsidies; and\n       (4) the status of the Trade Representative's contacts with \n     other Asian trading partners regarding the adverse effect of \n     Korean steel subsidies on such trading partners.\n       (b) Status of Investigation.--The report described in \n     subsection (a) shall also include information on the status \n     of any investigations initiated as a result of press reports \n     that the Korean Government ordered Pohang Iron and Steel \n     Company, in which the Government owns a controlling interest, \n     to sell steel in Korea at a price that is 30 percent lower \n     than the international market prices.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the continued \nproblem of trade-distorting subsidies given by the Korean Government to \nits domestic steel industry. Unfair trade practices by the Korean \nGovernment are causing the U.S. steel industry--including one of West \nVirginia's largest employers, Weirton Steel Corporation--to lose \nmillions of dollars. These losses impact U.S. communities, which must \ncarry the burden of Korea's unfair practices by contending with a lower \ntax and job base.\n  I joined my colleagues in the Senate Steel Caucus in signing letters \nto U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Charlene Barshefsky and U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce Secretary William Daley regarding violations by \nthe South Korean Government of the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nSubsidy Code. Regrettably, the responses to those letters were not \nsatisfactory.\n  My amendment would simply require the United States Trade \nRepresentative to report on Korean steel subsidies. Accurate \ninformation on unfair trade practices is vital to the future of the \nU.S. steel industry and its workers. This amendment would send the \nKorean Government a clear message that we expect our trading partners \nto adhere to fair trading practices, but, more importantly, it would \nsend a message to American workers that this Congress is prepared to \ndefend our own commercial interests and take action against the Korean \nGovernment's infringement upon U.S. rights under the WTO agreement.\n  U.S. imports of steel from South Korea have increased by nearly \nforty-five percent during the first four months of 1998. These surging \nKorean steel imports are possible due to the Korean government's \ncontinued use of illegal subsidies--subsidies that unfairly \ndisadvantage the U.S. steel industry. The negative impact of these \nKorean subsidies cannot be ignored. Illegal foreign steel sales are \nseverely undermining the economic stability in regions throughout our \ncountry that rely upon steel for jobs--literally taking money out of \nthe pockets of these workers as well as their neighbors, who depend \nupon this industry for their livelihood.\n  For the U.S. steelworkers in the Upper Ohio Valley and throughout our \nnation, we must continue to pursue efforts to end the entry of foreign \nproducts into this country that unfairly place our domestic industries \nat risk. We must restore confidence in our trade laws.\n  I appreciate Members' support of this initiative.\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\n                           amendment no. 3289\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the enforcement in fiscal \nyear 1999 of certain regulations regarding the Global Maritime Distress \n   and Safety System (GMDSS) with respects to United States fishing \n                           industry vessels)\n\n       On page 135, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 620. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     funds appropriated or otherwise made available for fiscal \n     year 1999 by this Act or any other Act may be obligated or \n     expended for purposes of enforcing any rule or regulation \n     requiring the installation or operation aboard United States \n     fishing industry vessels of the Global Maritime Distress and \n     Safety System (GDDSS).\n\n               global maritime distress and safety system\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment will delay for one year \nthe application of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System, \nabbreviated as GMDSS, to fishing industry vessels. The purpose of the \ndelay is to allow the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) the time \nto address a number of serious concerns that have recently come to \nlight involving GMDSS for fishing industry vessels. Also Mr. President, \nlet me make clear that the delay will not affect any other type of \nvessel.\n  GMDSS is a system created by the International Maritime Organization \n(IMO) under the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). It was \nintended to improve safety for large cargo and passenger vessels on \ninternational voyages. It is scheduled to go into effect on February 1 \nof next year. There is no doubt that GMDSS will indeed improve safety \nfor these types of vessels.\n  Fishing vessels are very specifically not covered by SOLAS, but the \nFCC regulation requiring GMDSS for international passenger and cargo \nvessels is also being applied to large domestic fishing industry \nvessels anyway.\n  Because these types of vessels operate very differently, there are \nserious questions as to whether the system should be applied in the \nsame way.\n  The most important of the questions that has been raised for the \nfishing industry involves the safety and well-being not of the fishing \nvessels required to carry GMDSS equipment, but of the smaller vessels \nthat work around them.\n  One of the things that makes GMDSS attractive to large vessels on \ninternational voyages is that it is automated, using a feature called \nDigital Selective Calling (DSC). Because of this, when the large \nvessels switch to GMDSS on February 1, they will no longer be required \nto maintain a continuous watch on the two emergency frequencies used \nunder the current system.\n  In the United States, the watchstanding requirement has been extended \nto the year 2005 for VHF Channel 16, but will cease on February 1 for \n2182 kilohertz. These are the two frequencies used by small vessels, \nincluding the small fishing vessels that operate in and around the \nlarger vessels that will be required to convert to GMDSS.\n  When a fishing vessel is in distress, the vessels closest to it and \nin the best position to render aid are other fishing vessels working in \nthe same area.\n  But, Mr. President, what will happen when the small vessel sends out \na distress call, only to find that the larger and better-equipped \nfishing vessels around it are no longer listening?\n  This is--obviously, and with very good reason--a major concern. Under \nthe theory of GMDSS, contact with other vessels is to be replaced by \ncontact with a shore station. That's all well and good on an \ninternational voyage, where it may eliminate confusion and speed up \nresponse. But for fishing vessels, it may very well slow response \ntime--and believe me, Mr. President, in the frigid waters of the Bering \nSea in the winter, every second counts toward life--or toward death. \nBecause of this, there is a very real danger that shifting the largest \nand most capable vessels of the fleet to GMDSS may actually degrade \nsafety for smaller, but far more numerous vessels operating in the same \nareas.\n  In fact, although the GMDSS system is supposed to replace ship-to-\nship emergency communications with a unified ship-to-shore system \nmaintained by the Coast guard, the fact is that the Coast Guard itself \nis not ready to implement it fully.\n  With the system scheduled to go into effect in just a few months, \nthere are still major shore-based components that have not yet been \ninstalled. In Alaska, for example, the Coast Guard is only this summer \nstarting the installation of medium-frequency receivers. And throughout \nthe country, installation of VHF receivers has been delayed \nindefinitely--it is ``on hold.'' According to the Coast Guard's own \ntask force on GMDSS, the VHF system will probably not be in place \nbefore 2003 at the earliest.\n  The fact that GMDSS was not designed for the fishing fleet is an \nissue itself. Most every mariner of any sort is familiar with SOLAS, \nand knows that it does not apply to fishing vessels. As a result, when \nthe FCC published the proposed GMDSS rule in 1990, and when it made the \nrule final in 1992, the fishing industry was not made aware that it \nwould be applied to fishing industry vessels, which are generally \ntreated as a separate class of vessels under U.S. law.\n  Indeed, when the proposed GMDSS regulation was printed in the Federal \nRegister in 1990, it specified that fishing vessels would not be \nincluded: ``Small ships, such as private fishing vessels and \nrecreational yachts, are not affected by the proposed changes.'' This \nsame statement is still being repeated, in an informational document \nabout GMDSS that is currently offered on the FCC's Internet site.\n  Given this confusion, it is no wonder that the fishing industry's \nconcerns did not surface sooner; most of the industry was unaware of \nthe need to comment. This alone is a huge flaw in the way the \nrulemaking was conducted, but one that can be corrected given a little \nmore time to explore and address the fishing industry's concerns.\n  Mr. President, the affected fishing industry vessels already carry \nall but one feature of the GMDSS system. They have VHF radios and \nsingle-side-band radios, EPIRBS, radars, radar transponders and hand-\nheld VHF radios for their life rafts, and so forth. Each vessel already \ncarries--at a guess--$20,000 to $30,000 worth of sophisticated \ncommunications equipment. The only thing they are lacking is the \nDigital Selective Calling (DSC) feature.\n  In a recent meeting with the Coast Guard and the FCC, we learned that \nthere is no reason DSC could not be added to the existing equipment for \na very reasonable cost--perhaps $5,000. However, the industry has \nindicated that electronics vendors have so far either declined to sell \nDSC as a separate component, or if they do, to offer a component \nwarranty on it. Instead, they are insisting that the fishing industry \npurchase large consoles where all of the GMDSS equipment is pre-\ninstalled--at a cost of $50,000 to $60,000 dollars each. Because of the \nconfined nature of the wheelhouse on the average vessel, significant \nstructural changes may have to be made to fit the console in place, and \nof course, the existing $30,000 of equipment would have to be scrapped. \nThat means, Mr. President, that the cost of outfitting these vessels \nmay reach as much as $100,000--all to get a $5,000 piece of equipment \non board. That, Mr. President, is why people get upset at their \ngovernment. That, Mr. President, is just plain wrong.\n  These are just a few of the very serious issues that justify a delay \nfor fishing industry vessels so that the rule can be re-examined and \nimproved with better input from the industry. No one wants to see \nsafety degraded in any way--including by mandating ``improvements'' \nthat may be no such thing.\n  It may be that GMDSS is the way to go for fishing industry vessels as \nwell as the large international cargo vessels and passenger liners it \nwas designed for. If so, it should be adopted, and I'm sure it will be. \nBut if not, we must take the time to listen first.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Alaska yield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am very happy to yield for a question \nfrom the distinguished manager.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding that this amendment will delay for \none year the application of the GMDSS requirements for fishing industry \nvessels, but not other types of vessels. Is that the understanding of \nthe Senator from Alaska?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the manager is quite correct. This \namendment will apply only to fishing industry vessels such as catcher-\nboats,\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\ncatcher-processors, mothership processors and fish tender vessels. \nOther types of vessels to which the rule applies, such as cargo and \npassenger ships, will not be affected.\n  Mr. GREGG. Is it the Senator's intention that the federal agencies \ninvolved would then use this period of time to further examine the \nissue of applying GMDSS requirements to the fishing industry?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Once again, Mr. President, the distinguished manager \nis correct. Based on discussions with the two agencies directly \ninvolved in this matter, and with the fishing industry, it is evident \nthat the industry has legitimate concerns and questions that have not \nbeen answered. The moratorium will allow the agencies the time to \nrevisit the issue in the detail that it deserves. I hope they will take \nthe opportunity either to reopen the rulemaking with respect to fishing \nindustry vessels or to open a new rulemaking that specifically deals \nwith such vessels, so that the unique characteristics of the fishing \nindustry are considered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator. In my view this is a very legitimate \ngoal and I join the Senator from Alaska in expressing the hope that the \nagencies will revisit this matter.\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3290\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the payment of special masters, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my gratitude to the \nmanagers for including an amendment offered by myself and Senator Harry \nReid. The managers have worked hard to reach consensus on this \nlegislation, and I commend them for their efforts.\n  I believe that this amendment will take another important step toward \nprotecting our nation's elderly and disabled patients from abuse and \nneglect. The vast majority of employees in nursing homes and home \nhealth agencies work hard under stressful conditions to provide the \nhighest quality care. However, there has been too many instances where \npeople with criminal backgrounds and abuse histories have gained \nemployment in long-term care facilities and subsequently abused \npatients in their care. This is inexcusable; Congress should take every \nstep necessary to make sure that these facilities have the tools they \nneed to screen potential employees.\n  During consideration of the Senate Budget Resolution, the Senate \nunanimously adopted my Sense of the Senate amendment, which expressed \nstrong support for the establishment of a national background check \nsystem to weed out known abusers and people with violent criminal \nbackgrounds. The amendment that is included in the manager's package \ntoday takes this one step further. This amendment authorizes nursing \nfacilities and home health care agencies to utilize the FBI fingerprint \nbackground check system to screen potential employees. It is important \nto note that this amendment does not mandate that these facilities \nconduct the checks. It simply allows them to access the FBI system if \nthey choose to do so.\n  Many States, nursing facilities and home care agencies have already \ntaken steps to better screen their long-term care employees. This \namendment will give them another tool to use in their efforts to screen \nout known abusers. However, our job does not end here. I still believe \nthat Congress must act to establish a national registry that will \ncoordinate abuse information between States, and require that all long-\nterm care facilities utilize both the registry and the FBI system. I \nhave been working for passage of such legislation, and I am pleased \nthat the President has recently endorsed my idea as well. I look \nforward to working with the President and all of my colleagues in the \nfuture on this important effort.\n  It is vital that we continue to take steps to protect our most \nvulnerable citizens from abuse, neglect and mistreatment, especially at \nthe hands of those who are charged with their care. I believe that this \namendment is another step in that direction. Again, I\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\nthank the managers for working with me in this effort. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3296\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for foreign travel or foreign \n communications by officers and employees of the Antitrust Division of \n                       the Department of Justice)\n\n       On page 51, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 121. None of the funds made available to the \n     Department of Justice under this Act may be used for any \n     expense relating to, or as reimbursement for any expense \n     incurred in connection with, any foreign travel by an officer \n     or employee of the Antitrust Division of the Department of \n     Justice, if that foreign travel is for the purpose, in whole \n     or in part, of soliciting or otherwise encouraging any \n     antitrust action by a foreign country against a United States \n     company that is a defendant in any antitrust action pending \n     in the United States in which the United States is a \n     plaintiff. Provided, however, That this section shall not: \n     (1) limit the ability of the Department to investigate \n     potential violations of United States antitrust laws; or (2) \n     prohibit assistance authorized pursuant to 15 U.S.C. sections \n     6201-6212, or pursuant to a ratified treaty between the \n     United States and a foreign government, or other \n     international agreement to which the United States is a \n     party.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Justice Department is out of control, \nMr. President. Evidence appears to be mounting that officials at the \nDepartment's Antitrust Division have been traveling around the world \nurging foreign governments to join them in their witch hunt against \nMicrosoft.\n  As far as this Senator is concerned, such action should be \nprohibited.\n  It seems the Administration is reaching out a helping hand to U.S. \ncompetitors overseas. While foreign governments work hard to protect \ntheir most important industries, our Justice Department is assisting \nthose foreign governments in their efforts to keep one of America's \nmost vibrant, innovative, and successful companies out of their \nmarkets.\n  In a letter sent last week to Attorney General Janet Reno, my \ncolleagues Senators Sessions, Abraham, and Kyl raised some provocative \nquestions about the activities of Justice Department officials \noverseas. They have learned that Joel Klein and his staff at the \nDepartment's Antitrust Division are busily recruiting their foreign \ncounterparts in their war against Microsoft.\n  First and foremost, Mr. President, I'd like to know what Justice \nDepartment officials, whose work focuses exclusively on issues here at \nhome, are doing traveling overseas at the taxpayers' expense. According \nto the letter, in the last six months, Joel Klein has traveled to \nJapan, Russell Pittman, Chief of the Competition Policy Section of the \nAntitrust Division has visited Brazil, Dan Rubinfeld, chief economist \nfor the Antitrust Division has gone to Israel, and Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General Douglas Melamed spent a week in Paris in June.\n  At a time when Joel Klein has been complaining that his division does \nnot have enough money or people to do its job effectively, he and his \nstaff are traveling around the world on the Justice Department's dime. \nAnd they are using those foreign visits as a bully pulpit to tout the \nmerits of their case against Microsoft and encouraging foreign \ngovernments to join in the attack.\n  This kind of activity is reprehensible. It is even more egregious \nwhen one notes that it is being financed by the American people--many \nof whom may wind up losing their jobs and their livelihood if Joel \nKlein is successful.\n  Here is the evidence my colleagues have compiled to date:\n  Joel Klein visited Japan to meet with the Japanese Fair Trade \nCommission last December. A month later, the Trade Commission raided \nMicrosoft's Tokyo offices, confiscating thousands of company documents.\n  When Russell Pittman went to Brazil in May, he spoke publicly to \nsenior Brazilian government officials responsible for antitrust \nenforcement in that country, outlining the Justice Department's case \nagainst Microsoft in detail. Nine days later, The Brazilian government \nannounced its intention to begin legal proceedings against the company.\n  A quote from Mr. Pittman at this event is particularly troubling, \nand, I might add, somewhat ironic. He accused Microsoft of behaving \n``like an arrogant monopolist, even acting arrogantly in its relations \nwith the antitrust authorities, it will receive from these agencies \nwhat it deserves.'' Who is calling whom arrogant? A government \nbureaucrat on a taxpayer funded jaunt to Brazil? If the situation were \nnot so serious, I would find this quote to be quite amusing, Mr. \nPresident.\n  In Israel in May, Dan Rubinfeld gave a public speech on the \nDepartment's case against Microsoft to an audience that included \nIsraeli officials responsible for antitrust enforcement. He later met \nprivately along with his sidekicks from the Federal Trade Commission \nwith a group of Israeli government officials to outline the DOJ's \ncomplaint against Microsoft.\n  Not surprisingly, the Israeli government is now in discussions with \nMicrosoft concerning its business practices in that country.\n  And finally, on June 8th, Douglas Melamed briefed the OECD's \nCompetition Law and Policy Committee in Paris on the strengths of the \nDepartment's case against Microsoft. The OECD Committee includes \nofficials from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Brazil.\n  I applaud Senators Sessions, Abraham, and Kyl for bringing this issue \nto light, Mr. President. It is just one in a series of steps by the \nAdministration to tie the hands of successful U.S. companies.\n  Thousands of jobs in my home state of Washington are being put on the \nline by a contemptuous group of bureaucrats over at the Justice \nDepartment.\n  That is why I have decided to offer an amendment today to prohibit \nthe Justice Department from soliciting or encouraging foreign \ngovernments to engage in antitrust against U.S. companies defending \nthemselves against antitrust suits filed by the U.S. government here at \nhome. My amendment is narrow in scope. It was carefully drafted to \nensure that it is not overreaching.\n  It will simply ensure that Joel Klein and his staff at the Antitrust \nDivision do not travel abroad at the expense of U.S. taxpayers for the \npurpose of encouraging foreign governments to attack successful U.S. \nbusinesses.\n  I assure my colleagues that I am very disappointed that this \namendment is necessary at all. That U.S. government officials in this \nAdministration are engaged in practices that serve no other purpose \nthan to harm U.S. companies, their employees, their families of their \nemployees, and the small businesses whose livelihoods depend on the \nsuccess of those companies is truly disheartening.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in condemning the actions of \nAntitrust Division officials and to pass this important amendment \ntoday. Attorney General Reno and Assistant Attorney General Klein need \nto know that their actions will not go unnoticed and that they cannot \ncontinue down their current path of denouncing U.S. businesses \noverseas.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the outset, let me say that I don't \nsupport the Department of Justice divulging confidential information to \nforeign governments in an attempt to encourage them, in any way, to \ntake or threaten legal action against any U.S. company. I don't think \nthe Department has done that. They assure me that they have not done \nthat.\n  I am aware of the letter that was sent to the Department inquiring \nwhether the Department has encouraged any foreign antitrust authority \nto take action against Microsoft. I await the Department's formal \nresponse to the letter sent by my colleagues. If--and I emphasize if--\nthe Department of Justice was encouraging foreign countries to bring a \ncause of action against Microsoft--or any other American company--I \nwould do all I can to put a stop to it. The Department of Justice has a \nresponsibility to enforce U.S. antitrust laws--not Japan's, Brazil's or \nthe European Union's. But having said that, the Department assures me \nthey have done no such thing.\n  I have to say, though, that, if Microsoft's charges prove groundless, \none could reasonably conclude that this appears to be an assault, \nalbeit a faint one, by Microsoft, on the Department of Justice's \nongoing efforts to investigate potential violations of U.S. antitrust \nlaws. When I first heard about this allegation, I was surprised that \nthis is the best ``offensive'' more that their team of lobbyists and \nWashington lawyers could come up with. I was expecting a much more \ninnovative strategy, given the reported offensive\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\nMicrosoft has threatened to launch against the Department of Justice. \nAs I said before, I too oppose efforts by our government to encourage \nor solicit any foreign government to take hostile actions against a \nU.S. company.\n  However, I had a concern that any such amendment not hinder the \nability of the Antitrust Division to investigate violations of our--\nUnited States'--antitrust laws. And also it does not prohibit mutual \nassistance that the Department and its foreign counterparts provide to \neach other under a ratified treaty or as authorized by the \nInternational Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act of 1994.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Gorton and his staff for his \ncooperation and willingness to work with me and ensure that the \namendment does not have any such adverse impact. With this modification \nI am happy to lend my support to this amendment.\n  The International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act passed the \nSenate unanimously in 1994. Let me also say that my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Gorton, did not object to it then. This statute \nprovides the important authority for the Attorney General when a mutual \nassistance agreement is in place, to cooperate with foreign agencies in \nassisting each other's efforts to prevent illegal antitrust activities. \nGiven the increasingly international scope of the antitrust laws, it is \ncrucial that the enforcement agencies have sufficient legal authority \nand the necessary tools to obtain information located abroad that would \nhelp them protect American consumers and businesses from antitrust \nabuses.\n  Finally, I again want to thank Senator Gorton for his cooperation and \nwillingness to work with me and I am happy that we were able to work \nout our concerns with this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3297\n\n  (Purpose: to exempt orphans adopted by United States citizens from \n                          grounds of removal)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.     .

Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues for \nincluding an extension of Temporary Protected Status for Liberians \nuntil September 30, 1999 in the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce, Justice, \nState Appropriations bill.\n  The histories of Liberia and the United States have been intertwined \nsince 1847 when our nation's founding fathers helped freed American \nslaves found the sovereign state of Liberia. The first Liberians \nadopted the U.S. Constitution as a model and named the capital of the \nnew country Monrovia, after President James Madison. Diplomatic, \nmilitary and trade relations flourished between the two countries until \nthe late 1980's.\n  Then, in December 1989, Liberia was engulfed by a civil war that \nwould last for seven years and continue to boil below the surface. Over \n150,000 people died and more than one-half of the population fled the \ncountry or was internally displaced. During the conflict, food \nproduction was halted and the country's infrastructure was destroyed.\n  Several thousand Liberians who were forced from their homes because \nof the civil war sought refuge in the United States. In 1991, the \nAttorney General determined that Liberia was experiencing an ongoing \narmed conflict which prevented Liberian nationals from safely returning \nhome. She granted Liberians who were present in the United States on \nMarch 27, 1991 temporary protected status (TPS), which provides \ntemporary relief from deportation. Because the conflict in Liberia \ncontinued to rage, the Attorney General extended TPS each year for the \nnext six years. Furthermore, conditions in Liberia deteriorated to such \nan extent in 1996, that the Attorney General ``redesignated'' TPS for \nLiberians who arrived after March 27, 1991 but were living in the \nUnited States on June 1, 1996. Never before in history had the Attorney \nGeneral been compelled to redesignate a state for TPS.\n  Recently, however, the Attorney General declared that TPS would end \nfor all Liberians on September 28, 1998. It is true that on July 19, \n1997, Liberians elected former warlord Charles Taylor president and 300 \ninternational observers deemed the election free and fair. It is also \ntrue that this new government has pledged to rebuild the economy and \nreconcile the ethnic factions.\n  However, there are signs which indicate that Liberia is not as safe \nand stable as many would like to believe. In early December 1997, a \nprominent opposition leader was assassinated. Furthermore, a newspaper \nand two radio stations were temporarily shut down by the government.\n  A pastor of a church in my home state of Rhode Island had a \nconversation just yesterday with an individual who just returned from \nLiberia who stated that people in Liberia are afraid to criticize the \ngovernment in any way. The secret police sweep neighborhoods at night, \npeople disappear and bodies mingle with garbage under a bridge in \nMonrovia.\n  I would also like to relay the comments of Bishop Arthur Kulah to my \ncolleagues who may wish to know why TPS is still needed. Bishop Kulah \nis a United Methodist leader who lost his parents and two brothers in \nthe civil war. He recently spoke with Liberians living in Rhode Island \nand when they asked if it would be safe to return when TPS was \nterminated, he replied, ``People who have been fighting for ten years \nwill not suddenly change. It may be quiet and then flare up overnight. \nThe disarmament was not complete. People still have guns.''\n  This weekend the Liberian community in Rhode Island will celebrate \nthe 151st anniversary of Liberia's independence. They will celebrate \nthe history and culture of their country and look forward to the day \nwhen they can safely go home. But that time is not now, Mr. President. \nThey came to this country seeking peace and security. We have an \nobligation to offer them refuge until it is truly safe to go back.\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3301\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the adjustment of status of certain asylees in \n                                 Guam)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I rise to explain a provision included \nin the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill manager's amendment \nand to convey my thanks to Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for \nincluding it. This provision directs funding for the Student Incentive \nPayment (SIP) program for FY99.\n  I am very concerned about language in the Administration's budget \ncalling for a four-year phase-out of SIP, beginning in FY99. These \npayments are used to help students at state maritime schools defray the \ncost of their education. In exchange for an annual stipend while they \nare in school, these students incur a 6 year obligation in the Navy and \nMerchant Marine Reserve. They represent an important element of the \nNavy's professional mariners and a cadre of trained professionals \navailable in the event of a national emergency when activation of the \nReady Reserve Fleet is required.\n  I commend the subcommittee for sharing my concern. The subcommittee \nreport reflects this concern by calling upon MARAD to report on the \nwillingness of the Navy to pay for the program. However, I understand \nthat discussions between the Navy and MARAD are still on-going which, \nwhile encouraging, may mean that the incoming class at state maritime \nacademies may not be able to take advantage of SIP as their classmates \nahead of them have, and those behind them hopefully will. If we are \ngoing to ensure continuity, we have to fund SIP for another year in \nthis bill.\n  This provision restores SIP funding in the FY99 budget, preserving \nthe program in order to allow the Navy to assume the funding \nresponsibility beginning in FY2000. I am pleased that we have bought \nmore time for MARAD and the Navy to negotiate the transfer of financial \nresponsibility for this program. I am very hopeful that we will have a \nnegotiated continuation of SIP under the Navy in FY2000 and beyond. I \nthank the Chairman for working with me to ensure this result.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3306\n\n(Purpose: To require certain new employees in the Office of the United \n States Trade Representative to work exclusively on investigating the \n acts, policies, and practices of the Canadian Wheat Board and whether \n the acts, policies, or practices cause material injury to the United \n             States grain industry, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this amendment \nwith my distinguished colleagues Senators Collins, Jeffords, Reid, \nHarkin, Mikulski, Cleland, and Graham.\n  Unfortunately for some, domestic violence is a life long experience. \nThose who perpetrate violence against their family members do not \ndesist because the family member grows older. In fact, in some cases, \nthe abuse may become more severe as the victim ages becoming more \nisolated from the community with their removal from the workforce. \nOther age-related factors such as increased frailty may increase a \nvictim's vulnerability. it also is true that older victims' ability to \nreport abuse is frequently confounded by their reliance on their abuser \nfor care or housing.\n  Every seven minutes in Illinois, there is an incidence of elder \nabuse. Several research studies have shown that elder abuse is the most \nunder reported familial crime. It is even more under reported than \nchild abuse with only between one in eight and one in fourteen \nincidents estimated to be reported. Seniors who experience abuse worry \nthey will be banished to a nursing home if they report abuse. They also \nmust struggle with the ethical dilemma of reporting abuse by their \nchildren to the authorities and thus increasing their child's \nlikelihood of going to jail. Shame and fear gag them so that they \nremain ``silent victims.''\n  The Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill funds the STOP law \nenforcement state grants program. This program provides funding for \nservices and training for officers and prosecutors for dealing with \ndomestic violence. This training needs to be sensitive to the needs of \nall victims, young and old. However, the images portrayed in the media \nof the victims of domestic violence generally depict a young woman, \nwith small children. Consequently, may people including law enforcement \nofficers may not readily identify older victims as suffering domestic \nabuse. The victims themselves may also be reluctant to report such \nabuse. Many older women were raised to believe that family business is \na private matter. Problems within families were not to be discussed \nwith anyone, especially strangers or counselors. Only a handful of \ndomestic abuse programs throughout the country are reaching out to \nolder women.\n  This amendment seeks to improve the STOP grants program by making it \nmore sensitive to the needs of the nations seniors. We know that great \nimprovements have taken place since the Violence Against Women Act was \nfirst passed. One of the most successful programs is the law \nenforcement and prosecutor training program, which received over $200 \nmillion in FY 1998. This bill would increase that level to $210 \nmillion. Improvement in this program can be made with respect to \nidentifying abuse among all age groups especially seniors who are often \noverlooked. When the abuser is old, there may be a reticence on the \npart of law enforcement to deal with this person in the same way that \nthey might deal with a younger person. Who wants to send an ``old guy'' \nto jail? However, lack of action jeopardizes the victim further because \nthen the abuser has every reason to believe that there are no \nconsequences for their actions. Another common problem is \ndifferentiating between injuries related to abuse and injuries arising \nfrom aging, frailty or illness. too many older women's broken bones \nhave been attributed to disorientation, osteoporosis or other age-\nrelated vulnerabilities without any questions being asked to make sure \nthat they are not the result of abuse.\n  With the greying of America, the problems of elder domestic abuse in \nall its many ugly manifestations, is likely to grow. I believe that we \nneed to take a comprehensive look at our existing family violence \nprograms and ensure that these programs serve seniors and are sensitive \nand knowledgeable of elder domestic abuse.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Reid, Harkin, Cleland, \nMikulski, Graham, Jeffords, and Collins in offering this amendment, \nwhich focuses attention on the needs of the ``forgotten older victims \nof domestic violence.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 \nincluded vital provisions to protect abused immigrant women--so they \nwouldn't have to choose to stay in an abusive marriage or be deported \nfrom America\n  This has helped a relatively small number of battered women--a few \nthousand each year--but it was important that we--on a bipartisan \nbasis--took this moral step.\n  Since 1994, we have found other ways in which we in effect force \nwomen to remain in abusive marriages and rely on their abusive husbands \nfor their immigration status.\n  This amendment restores the protections of the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act in four key ways:\n  By ensuring that battered women are included in the narrow \nimmigration provision already included in this bill.\n  By preventing the roughly 1500 women per year who complete the full \nprocess of proving that they are in fact battered from being deported \nsolely because of some arbitrary limits.\n  By allowing the Immigration and Naturalization Service to permit a \nbattered woman to remain in the U.S. even though she has left the \ncountry for a brief period--provided that she has an understandable \nreason (such as\n\n[[Page S8863]]\n\nin the case of a woman who was literally taken to Mexico against her \nwill).\n  And by requiring the Immigration and Naturalization Service to give a \nbattered woman an opportunity to prove that she was battered and \neligible for Violence Against Women Act relief before deporting her \nunder an order issued without her notice.\n  This is an important amendment--even though it will affect a modest \nnumber of battered women. I am pleased that this amendment is \ncosponsored by Senators Abraham, Kennedy, Leahy, Wellstone and others. \nI am also pleased that this amendment has been accepted and will be \nadopted by the full Senate unanimously.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment \nintroduced by my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nto strengthen the capability of our law enforcement community to \nprotect older women from violence.\n  There is no conduct less consistent with the precepts of a civilized \nsociety than the physical abuse of those unable to defend themselves. \nOur recognition of this has led to an aggressive and ongoing campaign \nagainst child abuse, and it must lead to an equally strong response to \ndomestic violence directed at older Americans.\n  Mr. President, at a 1995 hearing in Portland, Maine, chaired by my \npredecessor, Senator Cohen, elder abuse was aptly described as \n``society's secret shame.'' Family violence, particularly when directed \nat the elderly, was a major concern of Senator Cohen, and I welcome the \nopportunity to continue his efforts to combat this intolerable \nmistreatment of older Americans.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year my home state released its crime \nstatistics for 1997. I was cheered by the wonderful news that crime \nfell by 8.7% from 1996, to the lowest rate in at least 20 years. Hidden \nbehind this positive statistic, however, was one that was very \ndisquieting, namely, that domestic violence increased by 7.8%. \nIronically, at the same time as we are becoming less likely to be \nharmed by strangers, many of our neighbors face an increasing threat \nfrom members of their own households.\n  National data demonstrate that cases of domestic elder abuse, which \nincludes neglect as well as physical abuse, are steadily increasing. \nFrom 1986 to 1996, the number of cases went from 117,000 to 293,000, an \nincrease of 150%. Furthermore, there is widespread agreement that this \ntype of abuse is greatly underreported. For example, although the \nnumber of reported cases in 1994 was 241,000, the National Center on \nElder Abuse estimates that the true number of cases was 818,000.\n  Mr. President, while these numbers indicate a serious and growing \nproblem, all of the statistics in the world do not describe the problem \nas eloquently as the words of a single victim. At the Maine hearing, \none such victim told what happened to her at the hands of her husband \nafter her children left home.\n\n       [T]hings got really bad. I had two broken wrists, cracked \n     ribs, held down with his knee on my chest with a knife at my \n     throat. I was made to crawl across the floor with a gun \n     resting on my head, ready to fire. I've been choked until I \n     was limp, and then he would drop me on the floor with a kick. \n     I've been spit on, thrown through a window, dragged into the \n     lake as he said he was going to drown me.\n\nAstonishingly, but not atypically, the witness was married to her \nhusband for 44 years.\n  Mr. President, this type of treatment cannot be tolerated. As a \ncosponsor of the Durbin amendment, I sincerely hope that my colleagues \nwill take this modest step to enhance the ability of the law \nenforcement community to protect this vulnerable segment of our \nsociety.\n\n\n                           amendment No. 3313\n\n(Purpose: To modify the membership of the Federal-State Joint Board on \n                           universal service)\n\n       On page 72, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 209.

Mr. President, I have offered an amendment that would \nprovide rural States with a stronger representation on the Federal-\nState Joint Board on Universal Service (Joint Board).\n  Such a change is necessary because critical universal telephone \nservice issues have been mishandled by the Joint Board since the \npassage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  The Joint Board was intended to provide the States with an \nopportunity to help craft national universal service policy because the \nStates are more experienced in dealing with these issues than their \nnational counterparts.\n  The Act created the Joint Board and required the Board to make \nrecommendations concerning how the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) should implement the universal service provisions contained in \nthe Act.\n  However, the Joint Board was chaired by former FCC Chairman Reed \nHundt, and the Board made recommendations that undermine rural \ninterests and put upward pressure on rural residential telephone rates.\n  The Joint Board needs greater representation from the States, \nespecially rural States. My amendment would do the following:\n  Add an additional State Utility Commissioner to the Joint Board.\n  Require that two of the five State Utility Commissioners serving on \nthe Board represent rural States.\n  Require that one of the State Commissioners and one of the FCC \nCommissioners serve as Co-Chairmen of the Joint Board.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would ensure that rural interests are \nadequately represented on the Joint Board, and that the recommendations \nmade to the FCC are consistent with the universal service goals of the \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I have been very frustrated with the manner in which \nuniversal service issues have been addressed by the Joint Board and the \nFCC since the passage of the Act. Although it is the most important \npart of universal service, the high-cost piece has been getting the \nshort shrift.\n  The FCC has just referred a number of critical high-cost issues back \nto the Joint Board for its consideration. This amendment is critical \nbecause rural communities across the country need to be effectively \nrepresented on the Board as it reviews these issues. The States, \nespecially rural States, have the most experience dealing with the \nhigh-cost issues, and the recommendations of the Joint Board must \nadequately reflect their input and their expertise.\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3314\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the nonpoint pollution control program of the \nCoastal Zone Management program of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n                            Administration)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2____.

Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Gregg \nand Hollings for accepting this amendment to the Commerce, Justice, \nState and Judiciary Appropriations Bill which directs $3 million to the \nimplementation of nonpoint pollution control plans in the Coastal Zone \nManagement Program.\n  I rise to draw this country's attention to the national significance \nof our coasts as an integral part of our national infrastructure. As we \napproach the next century, we must treat them like our roads, schools, \nand technology, as the foundation of economic development, job \ncreation, and current prosperity. Our coasts are a central element of \nthe tourism industry which nationally employs 14.4 million people and \ncontributes over 10% to our GDP, making it the second-largest sector in \nthe economy.\n  With more than 50% of the nation's population living within 50 miles \nof the shore, our coastal areas are heavily used resources under severe \nenvironmental pressures from land development and associated activities \nas well as seasonal pressures from summer vacationers. For example, \nover 400,000 people live in the immediate vicinity of the Barnegat Bay \nestuary in New Jersey; in the summer that number doubles to 800,000. \nThe popularity of Barnegat Bay has caused non-point source pollution \nfrom runoff and storm water discharges resulting in blooms of brown \ntide algae in 1995, 1997, and as recently as last month. Polluted \nrunoff is the major reason why pfiesteria and hazardous algal blooms \nfrequently close rivers, kill fish and make people sick. Nationwide, \n40% of our waters are not fit for fishing and swimming; 30% of our \nshellfish beds are closed or restricted for harvest; and 2500 beaches \nwere declared unsafe for swimming in 1996.\n  Created in the 1970's, the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program is a \nvoluntary partnership between the federal government and coastal states \nand territories to preserve and restore our coastal areas. The program \nencourages the wise use of land and water resources through the \npreparation of special area management plans to protect natural \nresources while providing for coastal dependent economic growth.\n  Section 6217 of the 1990 Coastal Zone Reauthorization Amendments \nrequires states and territories with approved coastal zone management \nprograms to develop and implement coastal nonpoint pollution plans. \nThrough prior federal assistance, 29 plans (see attachment) have been \nconditionally approved and are ready for implementation. (In addition, \nTexas, Georgia, and Ohio, recently entered the CZM program and will \nalso be working to develop nonpoint runoff plans.) The premise behind \nthis amendment is simple: the federal government must continue to \nsupport those who have developed nonpoint pollution plans and are now \nready to implement them. These funds are an investment in our future, \nan investment that will pay dividends not just for our towns and \nstates, but for the entire country and for generations to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of states with approved plans \nbe entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n States and Territories With Approved Coastal Nonpoint Pollution Plans\n\n     Alabama\n     Alaska\n     American Samoa\n     California\n     Connecticut\n     Delaware\n     Florida\n     Guam\n     Hawaii\n     Louisiana\n     Maine\n     Maryland\n     Massachusetts\n     Michigan\n     Mississippi\n     New Hampshire\n     New Jersey\n     New York\n     North Carolina\n     Northern Mariana Islands\n     Oregon\n     Pennsylvania\n     Puerto Rico\n     Rhode Island\n     South Carolina\n     Virgin Islands\n     Virginia\n     Washington\n     Wisconsin\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3315\n\n       On page 34, line 20, insert the following: Strike \n     ``65,960,000'' and insert ``66,960,000''.\n       On page 34, line 19, insert the following: Strike \n     ``$119,960,000'' and insert ``$120,960,000''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3316\n\n(Purpose: To provide for sentencing enhancements and amendments to the \n Federal Sentencing Guidelines for offenses relating to the abuse and \n           exploitation of children, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

I very much appreciate the kind comments obviously of the\n\n[[Page S8866]]\n\nSenator from South Carolina. This bill has been a fairly complicated \nexercise, but its movement is entirely tied to the fact that the \nSenator from South Carolina brings to this floor extraordinary \nexpertise and professionalism. It is a joy to work with him because his \nknowledge of how to move things around here is second to none and his \nhistory as to where some of the issues lie is equally dramatic, and so \nI greatly appreciate the chance to work with him. I thank him for all \nof his support and effort. This has been a bill that has moved forward \nas a result of the strong support of the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank our chairman. Has our managers' amendment been \nadopted?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Manager's Amendment includes \n$800,000 to hire additional assistant U.S. attorneys and investigators \nin Camden County, New Jersey. This amendment builds on an initiative \nthat was originally proposed by Senator Specter. At his request, the \nbill provides $1.5 million to hire additional assistant U.S. attorneys \nand investigators in Philadelphia to enforce federal laws designed to \nkeep firearms out of the hands of criminals.\n  I appreciate Senator Specter's effort. I think that additional law \nenforcement funding will help stop the gun carnage on our streets. My \namendment would expand this effort into Camden, which neighbors \nPhiladelphia. I want to ensure that the crackdown in Philadelphia does \nnot simply push gun criminals into Camden. Clearly, a cooperative \neffort will provide a more comprehensive solution for the entire \nregion.\n  I want to thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for their help \nwith this amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the distinguished manager of the \nbill, Senator Gregg, yield for a colloquy?\n  Mr. GREGG. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky for a \ncolloguy.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Communications Assistance for Law \nEnforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA) was intended to preserve the ability of \nlaw enforcement agencies to conduct court-approved wiretaps on new \ndigital networks. Implementation of this important legislation is \ncurrently two-and-one-half years behind schedule because industry and \nlaw enforcement have not been able to reach agreement on technical \nstandards required under CALEA. In March of this year, the Department \nof Justice, the FBI, industry, and privacy groups all agreed that the \nFederal Communications Commission (FCC) should resolve the technical \ncapability standards dispute as envisioned under CALEA. The latest \ninformation I have from the FCC is that the Commission does not expect \nto issue a final electronic surveillance capability standard until late \nthis year.\n  Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree that the FCC should make \nthis decision?\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe that the FCC should move expeditiously to \nresolve this matter.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. After the statutory compliance date--October 25, \n1998--telecommunications carriers could be subject to fines of up to \n$10,000 per day for failure to deploy equipment to meet CALEA \ncompliance standards that currently do not exist and will not exist \nuntil the FCC sets the standard. According to industry sources, \ntelecommunications equipment manufacturers will need approximately two \nyears after the FCC sets a final standard to develop technology to meet \nthe new standard.\n  CALEA authorized the Attorney General to reimburse the industry up to \n$500 million for the costs directly associated with modifying equipment \nthat was installed or deployed before January 1, 1995 (the statutory \n``grandfather date''). Since January 1, 1995, a significant portion of \nall wireline switches, a majority of cellular switches, and virtually \nall personal communications services devices have been installed.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that if the FCC sets a new CALEA \ntechnical capability standard and there is no change to the January 1, \n1995 statutory grandfather date, industry may be required to retrofit \nthat equipment at their own expense at a cost that could exceed \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  I do not think that the American people want to pay what could be \nconsidered an electronic surveillance tax running into the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. I know that the people in my state of Kentucky do \nnot. I recognize that this is a complicated controversial issue, but I \nbelieve that Congress must act this year to adjust both the statutory \ncompliance and grandfather dates contained in CALEA to allow the \nstatute to work and avoid the prospect of an electronic surveillance \ntax on consumers.\n  I would like to work with the Chairman and the distinguished Ranking \nMember of the Subcommittee, Mr. Hollings of South Carolina, to see if \ntogether, we can find a way to address this problem this year.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be happy to work with the distinguished Senator \nand Senator Hollings, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nCommerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies on this \nissue.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chairman, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n            Repeal of Section 110 in CJS Appropriations Bill\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Commerce, \nState, Justice Appropriations measure. As a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, I can speak to the importance of this \nlegislation and I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for \nputting this bipartisan product together.\n  I could speak to many important provisions in this bill for my \nconstituents. From fisheries to the cops on the street to export \nassistance, this bill is important to Washington state. But there is \none provision in the bill that I wish to give special attention to \ntoday. And that's the language to repeal Section 110 of the 1996 \nIllegal Immigration Act.\n  The repeal of Section 110 is one of my highest priorities for the \nyear. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I do strongly \nsupport including the repeal in the Commerce, State, Justice \nAppropriations legislation.\n  Section 110 requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to \ndevelop an automated entry and exit system for the purpose of \ndocumenting the entry and departure of ``every alien'' entering and \nleaving the United States. It was not until after Section 110 became \nlaw that Congress became aware of the full impact of this new language.\n  As currently written, Section 110 will have disastrous consequences \nfor U.S. border communities whose economies are dependent on border \ntravel, trade and tourism. For example, more than $1 billion dollars in \neconomic activity is generated each day by legal crossings between the \nU.S. and Canada. More than 116 million people legally crossed the \nborder from Canada in 1996. This travel and economic activity will be \ndiscouraged to the detriment of U.S. interests if we impose new \nrestrictions and create additional bureaucratic delays along our shared \nborders.\n  Section 110 will have dire consequences for my entire state and \nparticularly for the residents of Northwest Washington in Whatcom \nCounty. In my state, Section 110 will create an invisible barrier \nbetween neighbors, families and coworkers who happen to live on \ndifferent sides of the border. More than $250 million dollars of annual \neconomic activity in Washington state will be threatened. Border \ninfrastructure which is already inadequate and overwhelmed at certain \ntimes of the year will be further burdened with new documentation \nrequirements and traffic congestion certain to anger both American \ncitizens and Canadian nationals. It is estimated that Section 110 will \nalmost immediately create a 12 hour backup at the border in Blaine, \nWashington.\n  Section 110 is a ticking time bomb. It's really that simple. The INS \ndoes not have the technology, facilities or trained personnel to \nimplement this language. The real explosive issue here is the cost to \nimplement Section 110. The INS is silent on this issue. That's because \nit will cost billions of dollars to implement the Section 110 time \nbomb. Let's be very clear on this point, without changes this provision \nwill cost billions of dollars not anticipated\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\nby either the Congress or the American people.\n  Many of my constituents in Whatcom County will view the repeal of \nSection 110 as the most significant action taken by the Congress this \nyear. Section 110 is the classic square peg solution for a round hole \nproblem. That's why I've been fighting for more than a year to scrap \nthe disastrous language.\n  Last year, I introduced the first Senate bill on this issue. My bill, \nS. 1205, the U.S.-Canada Economic Friendship Preservation Act of 1997 \nseeks to exempt Canadians from Section 110. The effort to fix the \nSection 110 problem has grown tremendously since the introduction of my \nbill. Communities across Washington state and virtually the entire \nNorthern Border are working to preserve our close ties with our \nCanadian neighbors. Governors from Washington state, Michigan, Texas, \nArizona and others are supporting the effort. Editorials endorsing the \nrepeal of Section 110 have been written all across the country \nincluding The Bellingham Herald, The Seattle Post Intelligencer, The \nLos Angeles Times, The Washington Post, and The San Diego Union Tribune \nhave all criticized Section 110. Numerous Chambers of Commerce and \nother business and community groups from all parts of the country are \nsupporting the repeal Section 110 effort.\n  Various legislative efforts have garnered bipartisan and broad \nsupport. I am also an original cosponsor of Senator Abraham's \nlegislation addressing Section 110 and I compliment him for his \nleadership and advocacy on this issue. Senator Abraham has been a \nchampion in this effort; holding hearings along the border and in \nWashington, D.C. in his capacity as Chairman of the Immigration \nSubcommittee. I continue to believe the Senate in addition to passing \nthe language in this bill should pass Senator Abraham's stand alone \nbill on Section 110.\n  I commend my colleagues at the Appropriations Committee for taking \nthis action to repeal Section 110. And I urge my colleagues to give \nthis language strong and bipartisan support.\n\n\n              NOAA Weather Radio Coverage in South Dakota\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to update the Senate on my \nefforts to enhance statewide emergency warning systems in South Dakota. \nA person only has to open up a newspaper or watch the evening news to \nlearn of the latest plight afflicting some region of the country. In \nrecent years, our nation has been continuously ravaged by natural \ndisasters, ranging from mudslides in California, massive flooding in \nthe Midwest, as well as the annual hurricane and tornado seasons. These \ndisasters have resulted in fatalities, enormous property damage, and \nhas caused lingering disruptions of entire communities. This has never \nbeen more evident then this year, as our nation continues to feel the \neffects of the weather anomaly known as El Nino. Since August 1992, the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has calculated \nthat twenty-one weather-related disasters caused a staggering $90 \nbillion in damages and resulted in over 900 fatalities.\n  South Dakota has by no means escaped Mother Nature's destructive \npath. Last year, South Dakota was plagued by severe weather conditions, \nbeginning with record snowfalls in January and February, and the worst \nflooding in the state's history in April and May. Many residents were \ndisplaced from their homes, and the final cost for clean-up and \nassistance total in the millions of dollars. This year has been no \ndifferent. Heavy rains have once again flooded homes and farmland in \nthe northeast part of the state.\n  Recently, a tornado touched down with very little warning, completely \ndestroying the town of Spencer, South Dakota. The Spencer disaster made \nme realize that additional efforts need to be made in order to provide \ncitizens with the earliest possible warning of imminent danger. In my \nefforts to find new ways to update South Dakota's antiquated early \nwarning system, it was brought to my attention that an immediate \nsolution to upgrading the system would be the use of NOAA Weather \nRadios.\n  NOAA Weather Radios broadcast National Weather Service (NWS) \nwarnings, watches, forecasts and other hazard information 24 hours a \nday. These NOAA Weather Radios automatically sound an alarm and turn \nthemselves on when a severe weather warning or emergency information is \nissued for a specific county. These radios receive a signal that is \nbroadcast from NWS transmitters located throughout the state. Seventy \npercent of South Dakota's population currently can receive these NOAA \nWeather Radio warnings. However, due to the rural nature and dispersed \npopulation of South Dakota, there are not enough NWS radio transmitters \nto provide total NOAA Weather Radio coverage. Many small towns who \nwould be the beneficiaries of this warning system do not reside within \nrange of one of the five NWS transmitters presently in South Dakota.\n  I have been working with NOAA and the South Dakota NWS to examine \nways in which we can increase NOAA Weather Radio coverage so that 95 \npercent of South Dakota's population reside within range of a \ntransmitter. I have met with Department of Commerce Under Secretary Dr. \nJames Baker, who also is the Administrator of NOAA, to inquire about \nthe requirements for attaining almost complete NOAA Weather Radio \ncoverage for South Dakota. Following my discussions with Dr. Baker, I \nheld several meetings throughout South Dakota with NWS representatives, \nemergency managers, and county officials to ascertain opportunities and \nresources already available in our state to augment our existing NOAA \nWeather Radio coverage.\n  The South Dakota NWS expects that eight additional transmitters would \nprovide sufficient coverage. The South Dakota NWS currently is \nexamining locations to position these additional transmitters, and they \nwill be submitting their final report to NOAA and my office forthwith.\n  During consideration of the FY 1999 Commerce, Justice, State, and \nJudiciary Appropriations bill, I have worked with Senator Gregg and \nSenator Hollings in examining all available options to acquire the \nfunding necessary to purchase NOAA Weather Radio transmitters for \ncounties that presently do not receive NOAA Weather Radio coverage, and \nto ensure that 95 percent of South Dakota's population is covered by \nNOAA Weather Radio.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that the modest funding necessary \nto complete this goal would go a long way in augmenting South Dakota's \nNOAA Weather Radio coverage. Although South Dakota is extremely well-\nprepared to deal with the impending tornado season, I believe it is my \nresponsibility to use every resource available to address the \nconsequences of weather-related events and work the losses associated \nwith them.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Gregg, Senator Hollings and \nthe conferees to locate funding for additional NOAA Weather Radio \ntransmitters for South Dakota, and I appreciate their willingness to \nwork with me on this critically important issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a provision contained \nin the Commerce/Justice/State Appropriations bill: ``Grants to Combat \nViolent Crime Against Women on Campuses,'' which provide $10 million a \nyear to the Department of Justice for dissemination to colleges. I want \nto thank Senator Gregg, the Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Commerce, Justice, and State, for working with me to ensure that \nthis provision becomes law.\n  In the 1980s, several high profile violent crimes on campuses raised \nconcern about campus crime and security, resulting in the Student \nRight-to-Know and Campus Security Act (C.S.A.) in 1990. Though overall \ncrime rates are declining, sexual assaults throughout the United \nStates, including on college campuses, are on the rise. Studies tell \nus:\n  Twenty percent of college-aged women will be victims of sexual \nassault at some point during their college careers.\n  According to a 1995 study, 82 percent of rapes or sexual assaults in \n1992-93 involved a person the victim knew.\n  Rape remains the most under reported violent crime in America, with \napproximately 1 in 6 rapes reported to police.\n  I am very concerned about sexual assault on college campuses. A 1991 \nsurvey of more than 6,000 college students\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\nfound that 42 percent of women students reported some form of sexual \nassault, including forcible sexual contact, attempted rape, and \ncompleted rape. This is simply unacceptable and we must do something to \nturn this around.\n  We have already taken an important step in addressing violence on \ncampuses. Already included in the Higher Education Act are efforts to \nstrengthen reporting so that we can get more accurate statistics and a \nnational baseline study has been commissioned to look at the policies \nand procedures regarding sexual assault, and how effective they are.\n  That's a great start, but it's not enough. It's not enough to simply \nget better statistics. It's not enough to look at how sexual assaults \nare dealt with on campuses. We have to go further. We have to combat \nsexual assault on campuses. We have to end the violence. Even one \nvictim of sexual assault is too many.\n  A critical component to addressing violence against women on campus \nis good collaboration among those who work with victims of sexual \nassault--campus police, local law enforcement, campus administrators, \nand victim services. We need to improve the coordinated response to \nviolence on campuses. We need consistent enforcement and implementation \nof policies regarding sexual assault. We need enhanced communication \nbetween the campus and local community.\n  And in turn, this increased communication will result in more \naccurate statistics. According to a GAO report released last March, one \nof the reasons we don't have good statistics is that campuses have had \ntrouble deciding how to include crimes reported to campus officials who \nare not campus police. It's not unusual for crimes on campus to be \nreported to local police and not reported in campus crime reports. \nImproving collaboration within and between campus and off-campus \nagencies will improve the statistics--and therefore give us a more \nrealistic picture of violence on campuses. It will also improve \nservices and care for victims.\n  The grant program we've created--Grants to Combat Violent Crime \nAgainst Women on Campuses--would make $10 million a year available to \ncollege campuses so that campus personnel and student organizations \ncould work with campus administrators and police. The aim is to improve \nsecurity and investigation methods to combat violence against women on \ncampus and to improve victim services. These efforts may include \npartnerships with local criminal justice folks and community victim \nservices organizations. Collaborating with community resources is \nespecially critical when campuses have minimal victim support services \nand students are isolated from community support systems.\n  Some say, ``Why do this federally? Shouldn't schools do this \nthemselves?'' But why should we be surprised that schools have yet to \nproperly initiate these collaborations when communities haven't even \nstarted. We need to hold the line on violence everywhere, in schools \nand in communities. And the only way to overcome violence involves \nsetting up collaborative programs, and that takes funds. That's what \nthe federal government does when it is functioning best--get the ball \nrolling.\n  Campus safety is an educational access issue. Violence on campus is a \nhuge barrier to education for many students who are in fear of being \nattacked because they feel unprotected on their own campuses. Without \nadequate prevention and protection services, many students--women in \nparticular--continue to become victims of attacks, while others remain \nafraid to take night classes or to study late at the library. And \nvictims of sexual assault may choose to leave school because they feel \nunprotected.\n  How are college women supposed to focus on their educations when one \nout of five college women will be a victim of sexual assault? And if \nit's not themselves personally, it will surely be their roommates, \ntheir classmates, their sorority sisters, or their friends. College is \nthe time when many young people begin to break away from the protection \nof their families, a time of learning--both in the classroom and out--a \ntime of freedom. But for many young women, it's also a time of trauma, \na time of victimization, a time of violence. It's time to make campuses \nsafe.\n  During the Higher Education Act Markup in the Senate, I reached a \npublic agreement with Senator Gregg to work together to develop a \nCampus Safety Collaborative Grant Program. On May 6th, Senator Gregg \nagreed to the language I proposed, creating a $10 million grant program \nadministered by the Department of Justice for collaborative grants to \ncolleges in order to combat violence on campus. Consequently, the \nSenate Working Group--Senator Jeffords, Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd--\nadopted the language into the Manager's Substitute of the Higher \nEducation Act. And I am very pleased that Senator Gregg has inserted \nfunding for this program into the Commerce/State/Justice Appropriations \nBill.\n  The Wellstone/Gregg Collaborative Grant Program states: ``enough is \nenough. It's time to end the violence.'' I thank Senator Gregg for all \nof his efforts, and I urge my colleagues to support this important \nprovision.\n\n\n                   iowa communications network (icn)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that the intent of Section \n254(h) of the Communications Act of 1934, commonly referred to as the \nSchools, Libraries and Rural Health Care Providers program or the ``E-\nRate'' program, is to provide schools, libraries and health rural care \nproviders with access to advanced telecommunications services. I \nbelieve that the Iowa Communications Network (ICN), a state run and \nowned communications network, as well as similarly situated entities, \nshould be able to fully participate in the E-rate program. If the ICN \nis denied that opportunity by the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC), Iowa schools will be unfairly and improperly placed at a \ndisadvantage.\n  The FCC has said that an entity must be a common carrier to be a \ntelecommunications carrier, as that term is used in Section 254(h) of \nthe Communications Act of 1934, and to receive payments from the \nuniversal service fund for providing telecommunications service to \nschools, libraries and rural health care providers. The Universal \nService Administrative Company is treating the ICN as a carrier for \npurposes of paying into the universal service fund, and ICN is, in \nfact, paying into the fund. The Iowa Utilities board, the local expert \non this issue, has stated that the ICN functions as a common carrier \nunder Iowa law, since the ICN serves all of its customers on equal \nterms and conditions. In light of these facts, does the center believe \nthe ICN and other systems like it should be fully eligible to receive \nthe benefits of the fund, including those available to \ntelecommunications carriers?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Given the statement of facts that the Senator has \npresented, it is my belief that it was clearly my intent and the intent \nof Congress that a State network organized and operated like the ICN is \neligible to receive universal service fund support as a provider of \ntelecommunications services under Section 254(h) of the Communications \nAct of 1934.\n  In addition to any action taken by the Federal Communications \nCommission, the Commerce Committee intends to further look into this \nissue. This program should treat all involved equally and not give any \nadvantage to some while placing others at a disadvantage. Together, \nwith the Ranking Member, we will do what is necessary and appropriate \nto deal with this matter.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I agree with Senator McCain, the Chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, and Senator Harkin that a State network organized \nand operated like the Iowa Communications Network is eligible to \nreceive universal service fund support as a provider of \ntelecommunications services under Section 254(h) of the Communications \nAct of 1934. I will certainly work with Senator McCain and others if \nthis issue arises in the Commerce Committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate your attention to this important issue.\n\n\n                          itc regional office\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as the Senator from New Hampshire knows, I \nrecently urged the Federal Trade Commission to reconsider their \ndecision to close the Boston Regional Office and move all area activity \nfor consumer protection and antitrust matters to New York City. The \nBoston office has\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\nserved the people of Maine--and the rest of New England--well for over \n40 years and I am concerned that thee may be adverse consequences as \nthe Boston office is uniquely situated in New England to focus on fraud \nand deception issues that target senior citizens, or for \nunsubstantiated advertising claims that affect consumers' pocketbooks.\n  The Boston office has been a leader in coordinating efforts to combat \nconsumer fraud in the New England area, partnering with regional FBI \nand IRS officials in its efforts to detect fraud on the Internet. The \noffice has also worked with Canadian officials on cross-border fraud. \nIn addition, the office has been active in addressing false and \nunsubstantiated advertising claims that affect consumers' health and \nsafety, for instance stopping a company from claiming that their \ncalcium product prevented osteoporosis, or preventing misleading food \nsafety claims for a food thawing tray, or stopping a company from \nselling water treatment devices that did not meet the claims made.\n  The Boston office has also worked with senior citizens to detect and \navoid telemarketing fraud specifically targeted at them, and also \nspends a great deal of its time performing other consumer and business \noutreach and educational services, including educational outreach to \nthe next generation of consumers--the schoolchildren throughout New \nEngland.\n  I hope that the FTC can be urged to first consider the findings of a \nGAO independent evaluation due out in September before they continue \nwith their planned closure of the Boston Office in December.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand your concern about the possible adverse \neffects the closure of the Boston Regional Office could have on the \npeople of New England, and while we have not heard a groundswell of \nprotest from the public for keeping the office open, the situation may \nwell be that the office will not be missed until or if New Englanders \ncan no longer get the response they expected when lodging consumer \ncomplaints. The GAO findings as to the effectiveness of the Boston \noffice should certainly be considered by the FTC Commissioners as they \nplan their restructuring plan to maximize their resources to best serve \nthe consumers of the U.S., and including the residents of New England. \nI thank the lady Senator from Maine for requesting the GAO Study so \nthat the FTC can quantify the best use of their limited resources.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator from new Hampshire for all his \nassistance and fine work as Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State \nand Judiciary Appropriations Subcommittee, and for his effectiveness in \nbringing about the passage of this legislation today.\n\n\n                               Pfiesteria\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Gregg in \norder to emphasize the funding needs of North Carolina in regards to \nPfiesteria and the expertise available to research this toxic microbe \nat N.C. State university.\n  Pfiesteria is a toxic microbe that kills fish and causes widespread \nfish disease. Its toxins are known to affect many species of \ncommercially important finfish and shellfish.\n  Pfiesteria is also highly toxic to people--it causes subtle, but \nserious, impacts on human health. People who are exposed to toxic \noutbreaks of Pfiesteria, where fish are dead or filled with open \nbleeding sores from this creature's toxins, can be seriously hurt as \nwell.\n  Medical studies have shown that fishermen and other people whom have \nbeen exposed to these toxic outbreaks have suffered profound memory \nloss and learning disabilities for months afterward. Laboratory workers \nexposed to airborne toxins from Pfiesteria have had other health \nimpacts that have lingered for years, suggesting the potential for some \nlong-term, lingering health problems for people in estuaries where \ntoxic outbreaks occur.\n  Pfiesteria's toxins are extremely potent--People are hurt from these \ntoxins if they have contact with the water, or even if they breathe the \nair over places where Pfiesteria is attacking fish. These toxins affect \nthe human nervous system. They also strip the skin from fish, make deep \nbleeding sores, and suppress the immune system. Small amounts of the \ntoxins can make fish very sick in three-five seconds and kill them in \nfive minutes.\n  Pfiesteria was first discovered in 1991, as a major cause of fish \nkills in the Albemarle--Pamlico Estuary of North Carolina. This estuary \nis of great importance to the commercial fishing industry of this \ncountry. It is the second largest estuary on the U.S. mainland, and it \nsupplies half of the total area used by fish from Maine to Florida as \nnursery ground. Recently, Pfiesteria also affected small numbers of \nfish in the largest estuary on the U.S. mainland, the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Pfiesteria, and its close relatives, have been confirmed in the mid-\nAtlantic and southeastern U.S. Toxic Pfiesteria and its close relatives \nare believed to be widely distributed in many warm temperate estuaries \nand coastal waters of the country and the world.\n  Pfiesteria thrives in polluted waters that are over-enriched in \nnutrients from sewage and other wastes. With exponential human \npopulation growth a reality for many coastal areas of our country, more \nof our people are living and working near waters where these toxic \noutbreaks occur.\n  Pfiesteria has affected the largest and second largest estuaries on \nthe U.S. mainland with major economic impacts. Its toxic outbreaks have \ncaused millions of dollars of damage to seafood, tourism, and other \nindustries in coastal areas. Thus, Pfiesteria has become a high profile \nnational issue for human health and the coastal economy. Its toxic \noutbreaks are expected to increase in coming years, associated with \nsewage and other wastes.\n  Pfiesteria can have potentially devastating impacts on our fish \nresources. Beyond easily detected fish kills, Pfiesteria affects fish \nat the population level by severely impairing their reproduction, the \nsurvival of their eggs and young, and their ability to fight disease.\n  Pfiesteria's impacts on human health are also serious: Imagine what \nit would be like to appear normal, but to have no idea of where you \nare, to be unable to put words into sentences, or to understand \nEnglish. You have lucid moments in which you realize that something is \nterribly wrong; then you slide back down. As you begin to recover, you \nmust take reading lessons to be able to read again. Imagine life style \nchanges--that even after you are able to test normally for learning and \nmemory, you must compensate because you have lost the ability to \nprocess information as quickly as you could before the illness \noccurred, and you do not recover it. Imagine not being able to \nstrenuously exercise because when you try, you develop severe \nbronchitis or pneumonia. Consider what it would be like to be a fairly \nyoung, energetic person who must be on antibiotics more than a third of \nthe year, five years after being affected . . . what it would be like \nto watch as increasingly potent antibiotics do not help you recover \nfrom the most recent, nearly constant illness, and to fear the prospect \nof reaching the point at which the most potent antibiotics no longer \ncan help. This description characterizes the lives of several \nlaboratory workers five to seven years following Pfiesteria toxin \nexposure.\n  In North Carolina, Pfiesteria has poisoned and killed millions of \nfish nearly every year from 1991, when scientists first discovered it, \nto the present. Last year, its toxic outbreaks also killed about 30,000 \nfish in Chesapeake waters.\n  Thus, the Albemarle-Pamlico, which is of such great importance to \nfisheries along the Atlantic Seaboard, has been hit hardest by \nPfiesteria. North Carolina also has the world's foremost scientific \nexpertise on Pfiesteria.\n  Dr. JoAnn M. Burkholder is a Professor of Aquatic Botany and Marine \nSciences at North Carolina State University, and a Pew Fellow. She \nobtained a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from Iowa State \nUniversity, a Master of Science in aquatic botany from the University \nof Rhode Island, and a Ph.D. in botanical limnology from Michigan State \nUniversity. Dr. Burkholder's research over the past 25 years has \nemphasized the nutritional ecology of algae, dinoflagellates, and \nseagrasses, especially the effects of cultural eutrophication on algal \nblooms and seagrass disappearance. Since co-discovering the toxic \ndinoflagellate,\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n\nPfiesteria piscidia, in 1991, she has worked to characterize its \ncomplex life cycle and behavior, its stimulation by nutrient over-\nenrichment, and its chronic/sublethal as well as lethal impacts on \ncommercially important finfish and shellfish in estuaries and \naquaculture facilities.\n  Howard Glasgow is the Director of North Carolina State University \nAcquatic Botany Laboratories. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree \nin Chemistry and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Marine Biology from the \nUniversity of North Carolina at Wilmington. Mr. Glasgow is now \nfinishing a Ph.D. degree in Marine Sciences from North Carolina State \nUniversity. Before joining the Aquatic Botany Program at NCSU in 1990 \nMr. Glasgow was President and CEO of Glasgow Electronics (North \nCarolina's 2nd largest electronics servicing and engineering \norganization) were in 1989 he was nominated Businessman of the year and \nappointed as a member of Who's Who In U.S. Executives. His scientific \ninterests compliment Dr. Burkholder's, and together they have \ncharacterize Pfiesteria's complex life cycle and behavior. Including \nresearch describing Pfiesteria's responses to stimulation by nutrient \nover-enrichment, and its chronic/sublethal as well as lethal impacts on \ncommercially valuable finfish and shellfish in estuaries and \naquaculture facilities.\n  The researchers who discovered it as a major cause of fish kills in \nestuaries have been working with Pfiesteria at North Carolina State \nUniversity for the past decade. Nearly all of the science articles that \nhave been published on Pfiesteria--that is, nearly all of the \ninformation available about it--has been contributed by that \nlaboratory.\n  Armed with this formidable expertise, these researchers are poised to \nmake the most rapid and significant progress to understand and control \nPfiesteria, so that our people, and our fisheries, do not continue to \nbe seriously hurt by it.\n  Despite the demonstrated expertise of this laboratory on the \nPfiesteria issue, very little federal funding support has reached it.\n  These researchers are well-known for their leadership role in \nproviding information about Pfiesteria that is critically needed by \ncoastal resource managers, policy makers, and fishermen and many other \nfolk who utilize our estuaries. Their research laboratory is located in \nthe heart of the area where toxic Pfiesteria outbreaks have been most \nsevere.\n  The funding would also make it possible for the most experienced \nresearchers to determine the environmental conditions that promote \ntoxic activity by Pfiesteria, so that its toxic production can be \nsignificantly reduced, and so that we can develop effective management \nstrategies to discourage Pfiesteria's growth.\n  This funding would make it possible to achieve rapid progress in \nidentifying the suite of toxins that produced by Pfiesteria, so that \nimproved tools can be developed to diagnose Pfiesteria toxin exposure \nin people, to ensure that seafood is safe for human consumption, and to \ndevelop medicines to reduce the impacts of Pfiesteria's toxins in \npeople and help them recover.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate you bringing this funding issue to my \nattention, and I will work with you on this matter. I agree with you \nthat scientific talent available at N.C. State University should be \nfunded.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the dedication of researchers at the N.C. \nState University. Howevr, this dedication is not limited to that \ninstitution, and we also must recognize the expertise and important \ncontribution of government and academic scientists throughout the \nEastern United States in dealing with this problem. For example, \nresearchers at the National Ocean Service laboratory at Charleston are \nplaying a critical role in developing methods for detecting Pfiesteria \ntoxins. The reduction of toxin outbreaks must rely on bringing our \ncombined federal, state and academic resources to bear on the problem \nin a cooperative and cost effective manner.\n\n\n                 jefferson parish communications system\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nSenator Gregg, the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related \nAgencies, Senator Hollings, the Subcommittee's distinguished Ranking \nMember, and Senator Landrieu, my distinguished colleague from \nLouisiana, concerning an important public safety matter in Jefferson \nParish, Louisiana.\n  As my colleagues know, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office has \ngained attention as one of our nation's most innovative and \naccomplished law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, the Sheriff's \nOffice's has been stymied in the past by a grossly inadequate and \noutdated conventional 450 MHz UHF radio system that has threatened \npublic safety. It simply cannot provide the secure and varied \ncommunications capabilities needed by the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's \nOffice in order for it to communicate with various state and federal \nlaw enforcement agencies.\n  To meet its operational needs, the Sheriff's Department has pursued \nthe purchase of a new 800 MHz communications system. This new system \nwill enable the Sheriff's Office to maintain a high and secure level of \ncommunication with district personnel and others. Through better \ncommunication, each officer can patrol his or her reporting areas more \neffectively. The new system will also enable the Sheriff's Office to \nsuccessfully communicate with residents and other public safety \nofficials during emergency situations, such as natural disasters, which \nrequire coordination of state and federal efforts.\n  I would like to thank the Subcommittee for recognizing the importance \nof this project and for providing partial funding for this initiative \nin last year's appropriations bill. Unfortunately, Congress only \nprovided half of what the Sheriff's Office needs to complete the new \ncommunications system. Now is the time for Congress to finish its \ncommitment to fund this project.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleague in \nthanking the Subcommittee for its action last year in providing funding \nfor this vital initiative. I fully agree with my distinguished \ncolleague that the completion of the new communications system for the \nJefferson Parish Sheriff's Office is a high priority project that \ndeserves funding under the FY 1999 COPS Technology Grant Program. The \nSheriff's Department has committed to at least a 50-50 cost share with \nthe federal government for this initiative which can serve as a \nnational model. Further, the new communications system will help meet a \nclear public safety need by supporting interoperability and thus \nenhancing communication between the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's \nDepartment and a number of other local and national law enforcement and \npublic safety agencies throughout the region. This interoperability \nwill enhance the Sheriff's Department's effectiveness in combating \ncrime and responding to area-wide public safety emergencies.\n  I would also like to add that funding is needed in order for the \nSheriff's Office to meet FCC requirements and the procurement \nimplementation schedule for the new system.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Given the importance of this project, I hope that the \nconferees will agree to provide funding for completion of the enhanced \nradio system for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Department.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I join my colleague from Louisiana in urging my \ndistinguished colleagues to work in conference to finish the federal \ncommitment we have made to this much-needed system.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to thank the Senators from Louisiana for \nunderstanding that the Subcommittee was unable to accommodate the \nentire request for funding in last year's appropriations bill. Funding \nfor the completion of the new communications system for the Jefferson \nParish Sheriff's Office in Jefferson Parish is a project worthy of \nattention in conference this year.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senators from Louisiana have highlighted an \nimportant issue. I agree with the distinguished Chairman that the \ncompletion of the communications system for the Jefferson Parish \nSheriff's Office is a project that deserves consideration and I will \ngive this matter my attention in conference.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The support from the distinguished Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Subcommittee in this matter is greatly appreciated.\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\n                    data survey of narragansett bay\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to engage in a colloquy with the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Gregg.\n  On page 93 of the report accompanying the FY99 Commerce, Justice, \nState and the Judiciary Appropriations Act (S. Rept. 105-235) is a \nprovision appropriating $1 million for a data survey of Narragansett \nBay, to be conducted in conjunction with the Rhode Island Coastal \nResources Management Council (CRMC). I would like to outline to the \nchairman my understanding of the purpose of these funds, and request \nhis concurrence.\n  The $1 million appropriated for this project is to be used by CRMC \nfor a Geographic Information System (GIS) software program to develop \ndigital data on Narragansett Bay's resource conditions, availability \nand use. Advanced sonar technology would be employed to assess the \nBay's bottom sediment types, habitat and use conflicts. A previous EPA \nstudy, the Narragansett Bay Critical Resource mapping project, was \nunable to collect data on bottom habitat, due to the limitations of \nresearch methods used at the time.\n  The data collected by this project would provide CRMC with \ninformation that, combined with input from other sources, would be \nhelpful in determining appropriate sites for aquaculture leases, a \nfunction currently hindered by inadequate data and ongoing disputes \nover use. The data would also be useful in making several other \ndecisions related to marine management issues. In addition, the project \nis intended to provide for studies relating to questions regarding \nenvironmentally sound and economically sustainable forms of aquaculture \nby the University of Rhode Island's Partnership for the Coastal \nEnvironment.\n  It is intended that the data collected and developed under this \nproject not only be utilized by CRMC, but will also be made available \nto other Federal and State agencies as well as private fishery and \nconservation groups. I would like to briefly describe some of the \nentities that could potentially benefit from this data and ought to \nhave access to it.\n  First, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the Rhode \nIsland Department of Environmental Management (DEM) could use the data \nto identify existing essential fish habitats (EFH) not only in \nNarragansett Bay, but also in nearby Rhode Island and Block Island \nsounds. In addition, the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation \n(RIEDC) ought to have access to the data in order to help establish \nsuitable shipping lanes for larger vessels serving the cargo port at \nQuonset Point. Further, the data could be useful to NOAA's National \nEstuary Research Reserve NERR in selecting eelgrass restoration sites, \nidentifying areas impacted by fishing gear, and areas suitable for \nhabitat restoration. Finally, the data should be accessible to \ninterested private fishery and conservation groups, such as the Rhode \nIsland Shellfishermen's Association, the Ocean State Fisherman's \nAssociation and Save the Bay.\n  Let me also point out what this project is not intended for. This \ninitiative is not aimed at giving preference to one group or interest \nover another in the use of, or issuance of permits in, Narragansett Bay \nand other marine resources in Rhode Island. Instead, it is simply \nintended to provide State and Federal authorities with the best \npossible information to assist them in making the most responsible \npublic policy decisions not just on aquaculture permitting, but also on \na variety of matters involving our precious natural resources.\n  I would ask Chairman Gregg if he concurs that the description I have \nprovided on this funding is the Committee's intent?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is correct.\n\n\n               pathogen research related to ballast water\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to thank the Senator from New Hampshire, the \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State \nAppropriations, for his work on this bill. In particular, I appreciate \nhis efforts to maintain funding for the Sea Grant College Program, \nwhich facilitates so much valuable research in the Great Lakes and \nother coastal areas of this country.\n  As this process moves forward, it is my hope that the conferees \nworking on this bill will ultimately support and reiterate the language \nincluded in the House Committee report related to pathogen research and \nthe Sea Grant College Program. Specifically, this language encourages \nthe agency ``to conduct research related to the public health risks \nposed by pathogens released in ballast water discharges in ports around \nthe country.''\n  While we know that pathogens from other regions of the world are \nsometimes present in the ballast tanks of ships that enter our ports, \nwe have very little information about the public health risks posed by \nthose pathogens. It is important that we improve our state of knowledge \nin this regard. The Sea Grant College Program and its network of about \n300 universities are appropriately positioned to undertake this \nresearch. They are in this position due to their ongoing research on \naquatic nuisance species and ballast water, as well as their \naffiliation with human health experts at their network universities.\n  Would the Senator from New Hampshire agree that this research on \npublic health risks posed by pathogens in ballast water is important, \nand efforts should be made through the Sea Grant College Program to \nundertake such human health risk studies?\n  Mr. GREGG. I would concur with the Senator from Wisconsin that it is \nimportant to improve the state of understanding about the potential \nhuman health risks of pathogens that enter U.S. waters via ballast \nwater, and that the Sea Grant College Program is an appropriate agency \nto conduct and facilitate such research.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the Senator's comments, and understanding of \nthese concerns. Will the Senator be willing to support the inclusion of \nlanguage in the conference report with regard to such research?\n  Mr. GREGG. While I can make no promises with regard to the final \noutcome of the conference, I will work with the Senator to address \nthese concerns in the conference report.\n\n\n                        safe schools initiative\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would ask to engage the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Gregg, in a brief colloquy regarding a portion of the \nreport which accompanies the bill, calling on the COPS office to direct \n$175 million to the Safe Schools Initiative, for the hiring of \nadditional police officers to improve the safety of our school \nchildren. I strongly support the Committee's effort, lead by Chairman \nGregg and ranking member Hollings, to meet this highly important duty. \nI just wanted to get a clarification about the Committee's intent--is \nit the Committee's intent that D.A.R.E. police officers would be \neligible to be funded under the Safe Schools Initiative?\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the Senator's concern on this subject. The \nCommittee believes that D.A.R.E. police officers would clearly quality \nunder the Safe Schools Initiative. However, we are not yet ready to \nincrease the D.A.R.E program above the FY 1998 level which has already \nbeen approved by the Office of Justice Programs. Of course, such \ndecisions would be made at the local level--they decide the types of \ncommunity police officers which would best accomplish the goals of the \nSafe Schools Initiative.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for his interest in this matter and \nfor his clarification of the Committee report.\n\n\n                     Western Slope Drug Enforcement\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. I seek recognition to raise an important \nissue with the manager of this bill, Senator Gregg.\n  One area of growing concern in my home state of Colorado is the \nproduction, distribution and use of methamphetamines. To help law \nenforcement address this problem, I pushed for designation and funding \nof the Rocky Mountain HIDTA which is operating in many regions of the \nstate, and secured additional funding in the Treasury subcommittee for \na methamphetamine initiative through the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy. I also have supported budget increases for the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, but believe that agency can do much more, \nespecially to help Western Colorado.\n  The Western Slope of Colorado is becoming a major drug transit point \nbecause of its close proximity to I-70, its easy access to trains, \nbuses and planes,\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\nand the large geographic areas which law enforcement officers have to \npatrol. The scope of the methamphetamine problem in this area recently \nwas underscored by the Grand Junction Chief of Police, Gary Konzak. \nChief Konzak informed me that ``the quality of life of this city and \nthe safety of its citizens are in peril if significant and organized \nlaw enforcement resources are not deployed soon to combat this \nmenace.''\n  Based on his almost 30 years of law enforcement in Chicago before \ncoming to Colorado, Chief Konzak believes neighborhoods and communities \nin Western Colorado are vulnerable to degradation similar to what he \nwitnessed when crack cocaine arrived in the Chicago area in the early \nand mid 1980s.\n  Mr. President, in Colorado the DEA operates a regional office in \nDenver and recently established a field office in Glenwood Springs. \nHowever, I believe the DEA can do much more to assist police chiefs and \nsheriffs in Mesa County, Montrose County and other counties on the \nWestern Slope.\n  The bill we are considering today includes a significant increase in \nthe DEA's budget for the coming fiscal year. The bill also includes \n$24.5 million and 100 agents specifically for the Methamphetamine \nInitiative to target and investigate methamphetamine trafficking, \nproduction and abuse.\n  Chief Konzak and other law enforcement officials throughout the \nWestern Slope believe there is an urgent need for a DEA presence, \nthrough a field office or permanently assigned agents. I strongly \nsupport their request for assistance from the DEA and ask the Chairman \nfor his support.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the senior Senator from Colorado for raising this \nimportant issue and for his work on the Commerce, Justice, State \nsubcommittee to make DEA funding a main priority. I can appreciate his \nconcern for the tragic ways methamphetamines can ravage communities, \nand commit to working with him in urging the DEA to establish a field \noffice on the Western Slope of Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the chairman for his support and look forward \nto working with him to address the methamphetamine problem on \nColorado's Western Slope.\n\n\n                        new jersey state police\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to confirm my understanding of \na provision that will be included in the manager's amendment to the \nCommerce, Justice and State appropriation bill. I had proposed an \namendment that would provide $1 million to equip New Jersey State \nPolice vehicles with video cameras. It is my understanding, and I want \nto confirm this with Mr. Gregg, the distinguished Floor Manager of this \nlegislation, that these funds will be made available by reallocating $1 \nmillion to the COPS Program. That $1 million would then be directed to \nthe New Jersey State Police for video cameras in its vehicles, in the \nsame manner that COPS Technology Program funds are directed to various \nprograms on page 61 of the Committee Report to this legislation, e.g., \n$935,000 for the Missoula County, MT, mobile data terminals. Is my \nunderstanding correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is it also the understanding of the Senator that he \nwill support the $1 million for the New Jersey State Police in a \nConference Committee with the House?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to thank the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, and State for his \nhelp with this matter. I appreciate his cooperation and I commend him \nfor all of his hard work on this legislation. I know that it is \ndifficult to accommodate the various requests from colleagues, and I \nthink he and his excellent staff do it with grace and understanding. I \nalso want to thank Senator Hollings, the Ranking Member on the \nSubcommittee, it is always a pleasure to work with him and his fine \nstaff.\n  The video cameras that will be funded under this provision will help \nthe police document evidence which will assist prosecutors and also \nprotect the innocent. With these cameras in place, people who are \npulled over will think twice before acting violently toward the police. \nAdditionally, the cameras will ensure that the troopers are following \nproper procedures when they make traffic stops.\n  In my home State of New Jersey, we must find ways to help resolve \ndisputes and ease tensions between the police and the public they are \nsworn to protect. These cameras are an important step forward.\n  Again, I thank Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for their help in \nsecuring this critical funding.\n\n\n        organization for international economic and cooperation\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to address one of the \ninternational organizations funded in the Commerce, Justice, State, and \nthe Judiciary Appropriations bill that is currently pending. I speak of \nthe Organization for International Economic and Cooperation, or OECD, \nas it is known.\n  Mr. President, we live in an era where the pubic rightly demands both \nless government and higher quality services. This is an era where \ngovernment downsizing and reform are expected of not just federal, \nstate, and local governments, but also to international organizations.\n  One organization that has understood that less is better when it \ncomes to government is OECD. The OECD was founded in 1961 as a \nsuccessor to the Organization for European Economic Cooperation, which \nwas formed to administer the Marshall Plan. As the situation in Europe \nhas changed, so has the work of the OECD evolved. Its purpose today is \nto contribute to the world economy through economic cooperation among \nits member nations and beyond.\n  The OECD works on issues such as regulatory reform, electronic \ncommerce and tax reform. With its first-rate studies and current \ninformation, OECD helps the United States and its other member nations \nto stay ahead of the curve in the fast-changing global economy. Its \nwork offers policy makers important insight on what the United States \ncan do to benefit from globalization and general economic \nliberalization.\n  At the same time, the OECD has understood that it, too, has to \nchange. On its own initiative, the OECD has undertaken a significant \nprocess of reform, committing to cut its overall spending by ten \npercent. It is well on its way toward achieving this goal.\n  The distinguished Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the \nJudiciary Appropriations Subcommittee has put an emphasis on getting \nall international organizations to cut administrative costs. The \npending bill reflects reductions in funding to those organizations that \nare above 15 percent in total administrative costs. Based on the State \nDepartment data available to the Subcommittee--a 1997 report which \nincludes data only through 1995--the Subcommittee has reduced funding \nfor the OECD. The OECD has indicated to me that its administrative \ncosts are now only about 12.4 percent of its budget.\n  I urge the Department of State to provide the Subcommittee with more \nrecent data so that those international organizations that have reduced \ntheir overall administrative costs can be appropriately reviewed for FY \n1999 funding. For organizations that have pursued reform, such as the \nOECD, I hope the Subcommittee will reconsider the Administration's \nbudget request for inclusion in the final bill.\n\n\n                      waterline extension project\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would first like to thank my \ndistinguished colleagues, the Chairman Senator Gregg and Ranking Member \nSenator Hollings, for their leadership and superb management of this \nbill. I would like to take a moment to express my support for a matter \nof great importance to me, specifically obtaining funding for a \nWaterline Extension Project in Georgia. The project would involve \nproviding $1,000,000 in Economic Development Administration (EDA) \nPublic Works (Title I) funds for construction of an extended 16-inch \nwater line (16,000 L.F.) along Macon Road (U.S. Highway 80) from \nMuscogee County into Talbot County. I understand that a proposal for \nthis project was submitted to the EDA, but the application was denied. \nApparently, the application was rejected because the project did not \nidentify any, or a significant number of, near term new jobs. However, \nI have been assured that, although one industry alone would not fulfill \nthe new job requirement, the waterline would allow several new \nindustries to locate in the area which will\n\n[[Page S8873]]\n\nmore than meet the new job requirement. In fact, there have been \ncommitments in writing from three businesses of their intent to locate \nin the newly developed industrial site. Talbot County is one of the \nmost economically depressed counties in Georgia. In fact, in 1994, \nTalbot County had approximately 25% of its population living below the \npoverty line, ranking near the bottom of the state. If funded, the \nwaterline would provide the vital infrastructure needed to serve \npotential industrial sites located in Talbot County and bring with it \nmuch needed opportunities for employment in well paying jobs. Senator \nHollings, I understand that Committee policy prohibits earmarking EDA \nfunding for individual projects. Is that accurate?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. My colleague is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. I understand that although projects \nare not earmarked, language is provided in the bill about projects \nintended to provide favorable recommendations to the EDA, if the \nproject meets EDA criteria. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Georgia is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. I understand that the EDA has \nstated a willingness to meet with County and City officials to review \nand reconsider the proposal at any time. Given the importance of this \nproject and the apparent discrepancy between the information provided \nby local officials and the information cited by EDA in rejecting the \nproposal, I urge that the EDA give prompt consideration of any such \nrequest for a meeting. Further, assuming that the job-creating \npotential of the waterline Extension Project can be verified, I ask the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member if they would agree that this \nis the kind of project Congress intended for EDA to give favorable \nconsideration to in its public works construction program?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. With the information provided, I believe the Senator's \nunderstanding is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I, along with residents of Talbot and Muscogee Counties, \nthank my colleagues for their understanding and support and believe \nthat this project would provide a critical economic boost to this \nregion.\n\n\n                   swordfish conservation initiative\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Faircloth in \norder to address his concerns about the conservation of swordfish.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service is in the process of \nimplementing several management measures to ensure sustainable use of \nthe Atlantic swordfish resource. The rampant importation of undersized \nAtlantic swordfish harvested by foreign fishing vessels is one of the \nmost serious problems facing domestic and international management of \nthis highly migratory species. The Congress recognizes the significance \nof this effort and, through the leadership of Senator Faircloth, this \nappropriations subcommittee provided $500,000 in this fiscal year for \nNMFS to fully address this specific concern.\n  The Committee intends that NMFS will utilize this particular \nappropriation to implement changes in our current system in order to \nprevent importation of Atlantic swordfish not harvested in a manner \nthat is consistent with recommendations under the International \nConvention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).\n  I ask my colleague from North Carolina to elaborate upon the intent \nof the Committee in its initiative to address Atlantic swordfish \nimportation problems.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The United States has taken a firm conservation \nposition with respect to ICCAT management recommendations. Our domestic \nfishermen comply with a tightly managed quota designed to rebuild this \nstock through international cooperation. Through efforts of the NMFS \nand our fishermen, we harvest only the annual amount specified for the \nAmerican fishery, and we abide by the minimum swordfish size \nrequirement of 33 lbs. Indeed, despite our harvest of less than five \npercent of the total Atlantic swordfish catch, the United States is \nworking within the system to manage this resource in a sustainable \nfashion.\n  Unfortunately, however, not all countries are playing by the rules. \nSeveral foreign nations are allowing the harvest of swordfish smaller \nthan the American minimum legal size. Further, this ``black market'' \nswordfish often time find its way into our restaurants and fish \nmarkets, and we are effectively undermining our resource rebuilding \nprograms and our ability to compete in the marketplace by allowing this \nsituation to continue.\n  I concur with my colleague from New Hampshire that it is time for us \nto reign in this illegal activity--to enforce our fishery regulations \nequally across the board--and protect our domestic fishermen who are \noperating just as we have asked them to. The intent of the Congress in \nthe swordfish conservation initiative is to arm NMFS with the financial \nresources necessary to develop a program to restrict the importation of \nAtlantic swordfish that are below the United States minimum size. I \nunderstand NMFS is examining a number of possible management options, \nincluding dealer permits, country of origin documentation requirements, \nand the designation of restricted ports of entry for Atlantic swordfish \nto facilitate inspections.\n  I encourage them to continue in their deliberations, communicate \nfully with our fishermen, and implement a program to address our \nresource and equitability concerns.\n\n\n                        oecd development center\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the OECD Development Center works to \npromote market-opening reforms in developing nations and has provided \nvaluable research and resources to policy makers and analysts in \ndeveloped nations and developing countries alike. the OECD Development \nCenter was established at the initiative of the United States in 1962, \nand we have played a leadership role in the Center ever since. I \nbelieve it is important to note the OECD Development Center's \ncontribution as a bridge between OECD nations and emerging economies \naround the world.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate and understand the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Texas in support of the OECD Development Center and the important \nrole it performs.\n\n\n                        broadcasting activities\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I would like to briefly discuss the funding \nlevels for international broadcasting in this legislation. I am \ndisappointed by the considerable reductions in the Senate bill in this \naccount. We have important priorities in this account. Radio Free Asia, \nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), and the Voice of America are \ncritical instruments of American foreign policy. For a relatively \nmodest cost, these broadcasting agencies project American values and \npromote American ideals. RFE/RL was of critical importance during the \nCold War in undermining the tight control on information imposed by the \ncommunist states in Eastern Europe and Eurasia. Although the Cold War \nis over, RFE/RL still have an important function in a region where \nindependent media are not yet firmly established, and, in many \ncountries, is barely adequate. I authored the legislation in 1994 which \ncreated Radio Free Asia--which broadcasts news about local events to \nChina and the other dictatorships in the region--and I want to ensure \nthat it has the necessary resources so that it can perform its \nfunction.\n  It is my understanding that Committee has assumed that the bill fully \nfunds Radio Free Asia at the requested level of $19.4 million. Is that \nthe understanding of the Chairman?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I appreciate that clarification. I understand that the \nChairman and Ranking Member have a very tight allocation this year, but \nI hope that they will do what they can to try to restore the funds that \nwere reduced in the Committee mark for broadcasting activities.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will say to the Senator from Delaware that I will do my \nbest, within the allocation, to provide additional resources to this \naccount.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I share the view of the chairman that we will do what \nwe can on this account.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Additionally, I would note that the Committee report makes \nreference to the fact that the statute authorizing Radio Free Asia \nprovides for a sunset a year from now. That is true, but the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire should understand that, in my view, it is quite \nlikely that Radio Free Asia will be reauthorized next year. I plan to \nintroduce such legislation early\n\n[[Page S8874]]\n\nin the next Congress, and I would expect that it would be included as \npart of next year's Foreign Relations Authorization Act.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am grateful for that information from the Senator from \nDelaware. I know that he is a strong advocate of Radio Free Asia as \nwell as the other broadcasting services. I look forward to working with \nhim on this issue as the bill goes to conference and in the coming \nyears.\n\n\n               joint marine aquaculture education project\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Gregg, in a colloquy.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would be pleased to join the Senator from \nMaine in a colloquy.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, S. 2260 provides funding for the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration to support a joint marine \naquaculture education project in Maine. The committee report lists the \nproject sponsor in Maine as the Island Institute, but the actual \nsponsor is the Teel Cove Sea Farm. While Teel Cove is associated with \nthe Island Institute, the two organizations are separate entities. In \nthis case, Teel Cove is the chief sponsor of the project in Maine and \nshould be listed as the recipient in the bill or report. I believe that \nthis was the committee's intention. I would like to ask Senator Gregg \nif his understanding of this matter is consistent with mine, and also \nwhether he would be willing to take appropriate action to ensure that a \ncorrection will be made and Teel Cove will be designated as the project \nsponsor in Maine.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I agree with Senator Snowe on this point. \nTeel Cove is the intended recipient and I will make sure that this \nmatter is clarified before the conference on this legislation is \ncompleted.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gregg for his statement and \nhis agreement to address this matter. I would also like to ask Senator \nGregg if my understanding is correct that the bill before us provides \nthe Administration's full request for funding of the State of Maine's \nAtlantic salmon recovery plan.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this bill does provide the Administration's \nrequested level of funding for the Maine Atlantic salmon recovery plan.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the subcommittee chairman, Senator \nGregg, for his clarifications and assistance.\n\n\n                   fishing capacity reduction program\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Subcommittee Chairman for including $50,000 in \nthe Committee Appropriations report for a potential loan to fund an \ninnovative fishing capacity reduction program on the Pacific Coast. The \nprogram, if it receives the approval of fishermen on the West Coast, \nwould be the first capacity reduction program to be ultimately funded \nby the fishing industry itself.\n  To comply with the requirements of section 504(b) of the Federal \nCredit Reform Act (2 U.S.C. 661c), an appropriation is required to \ncover the potential cost to the government for a debt obligation. My \nrequest assumed that the maximum potential cost to the government \nlikely to be determined for the loan would be one percent, which would \nallow a loan of $5 million based on the $50,000 appropriated by the \nCommittee. It is my understanding that if the Secretary of Commerce \nfinds that the potential default rate for the loan is less than one \npercent, the loan amount would be accordingly higher than the \n$5,000,000 authorized by the report. For example, if the potential \ndefault rate for a future Pacific Coast buyback is determined to be \none-half of one percent, the loan could be as high as $10,000,000 based \non the appropriated $50,000. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, the Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Further, I would like to clarify to the Chairman in my \nrequest, I was seeking credit authority for a maximum loan of $35 \nmillion. Is it the Chairman's understanding that if the Secretary of \nCommerce finds there is a potential default rate low enough for a loan \nof $35 million, that a loan of $35 million could be made?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, this is my understanding.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chairman for this clarification and his \nrecognition of the opportunity presented by the Pacific Coast plan.\n\n\n national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) weather radio \n                        coverage in south dakota\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, recently, a tornado touched down with \nvery little warning, completely destroying the town of Spencer, South \nDakota. The Spencer disaster made me realize that every effort needs to \nbe made in order to provide citizens with the earliest possible warning \nof imminent danger. In my efforts to find new ways to update South \nDakota's antiquated early warning system, it was brought to my \nattention that an immediate solution to upgrading the system would be \nthe use of NOAA Weather Radios.\n  NOAA Weather Radios broadcast National Weather Service (NWS) \nwarnings, watches, forecasts and other hazard information 24 hours a \nday. These NOAA Weather Radios automatically sound an alarm and turn \nthemselves on when a severe weather warning or emergency information is \nissued for a specific county. These radios receive a signal that is \nbroadcast from NWS transmitters located throughout the state. Seventy \npercent of South Dakota's population currently can receive these NOAA \nWeather Radio warnings. However, due to the rural nature and dispersed \npopulation of South Dakota, there are not enough NWS radio transmitters \nto provide total NOAA Weather Radio coverage. Many small towns who \nwould be the beneficiaries of this warning system do not reside within \nrange of one of the five NWS transmitters presently in South Dakota.\n  I have been working with NOAA and the South Dakota NWS to examine \nways in which we can increase NOAA Weather Radio coverage so that 95 \npercent of South Dakota's population reside within range of a \ntransmitter. I have met with Department of Commerce Under Secretary Dr. \nJames Baker, who also is the Administrator of NOAA, to inquire about \nthe requirements for attaining almost complete NOAA Weather Radio \ncoverage for South Dakota. Following my discussions with Dr. Baker, I \nheld several meetings throughout South Dakota with NWS representatives, \nemergency managers, and county officials to ascertain opportunities and \nresources already available in our state to augment our existing NOAA \nWeather Radio coverage.\n  The South Dakota NWS expects that eight additional transmitters would \nprovide sufficient coverage. The South Dakota NWS currently is \nexamining locations to position these additional transmitters, and they \nwill be submitting their final report to NOAA and my office forthwith.\n  I hope I will have an opportunity to work with members of the \nconference committee for the Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary \nAppropriations bill in order to acquire the funding necessary to \npurchase NOAA Weather Radio transmitters for counties that presently do \nnot receive NOAA Weather Radio coverage, and to ensure that 95% \npopulation of South Dakota's population is covered by NOAA Weather \nRadio.\n  Mr. President, I strongly believe that the modest funding necessary \nto complete this goal would go a long way in augmenting South Dakota's \nNOAA Weather Radio coverage. Although South Dakota is extremely well-\nprepared to deal with the impending tornado season, I believe it is my \nresponsibility to use every resource available to address the \nconsequences of weather-related events and work the losses associated \nwith them.\n  I ask Senator Hollings, do you support my efforts to enhance \nstatewide emergency warning systems in South Dakota through the \nacquisition of additional NOAA Weather Radio transmitters?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, I support the efforts of the Senator from South \nDakota, and I appreciate your bringing the situation in South Dakota to \nthe Senate's attention. I will work to locate funding for this \nimportant initiative.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Senator for his support. With the prediction \nof a highly volatile hurricane season expected in your region of the \ncountry, I am sure the Senator is aware of the immediate warning that \nNOAA Weather Radios provide emergency managers\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\nand residents of his state in preparing for an oncoming storm, and how \ninvaluable this early warning is in mitigating the loss of lives and \nproperty. Mr. Chairman, will you support my proposed efforts to \nincrease NOAA Weather Radio coverage in South Dakota?\n  Mr. GREGG. I will work with Senator Hollings and Senator Johnson to \nlocate funding for additional NOAA Weather Radio transmitters for South \nDakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the Chairman for his support, and I deeply \nappreciate your and the Senator from South Carolina's willingness to \nwork with me on this critically important issue.\n\n\n                     shea's performing arts center\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with my \ncolleagues, Senator D'Amato, and the distinguished managers of the \nCommerce, State, and Justice appropriations bill. Mr. President, we \nhave in Buffalo a wonderful old theater, known now as Shea's Performing \nArts Center. It opened in 1926 as motion pictures made their ascendance \nin the nation's entertainment industry, and was also the site of \nnumerous stage productions. As Buffalo's population shifted to the \nsuburbs or elsewhere, Shea's fell on hard times and was almost \ndemolished in the 1970s. But citizens banded together, formed a non-\nprofit group, and began restoration efforts. Today Shea's is on the \nNational Register of Historic Places and is a cornerstone of Buffalo's \ndowntown. I would ask the managers of the bill if they would encourage \nthe Economic Development Administration to consider an application from \nShea's Performing Arts Center and provide a grant if warranted.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I also hope that the Economic Development Administration \nwill see the merit in awarding a grant to Shea's. In addition to \nrestoration and preservation efforts, the theater needs to be expanded \nbackstage so that it can accommodate the large touring musicals and \nother productions that people would flock to downtown Buffalo to see. \nIf Shea's were able to accommodate and present the biggest and best in \nlive entertainment, it would be a tremendous boost for Buffalo's \neconomy. I too hope my colleagues will encourage EDA to give every \nconsideration to an application from Shea's.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I would like to be of assistance to my colleagues from \nNew York, I do encourage the EDA to consider such an application from \nShea's Performing Arts Center within all applicable procedures and \nguidelines, and to fund it if warranted.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I too suggest that EDA consider and fund an application \nfrom Shea's if the application has merit and meets all applicable \nprocedures and guidelines.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I am deeply appreciative of my distinguished colleagues \nfrom New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I also thank my colleagues for their help.\n\n\n               Erie, PA, National Weather Service Office\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee's decision to provide funding to \nreopen the Erie National Weather Service office at least in part \nstarting this Fall. Congressman English and I were in Erie in April for \nmeetings with local officials and residents on this important issue and \nour appropriations success is a direct result of that visit. During \nthat visit, I once again heard the troubling litany of severe weather \nincidents in Erie, which include blizzards and tornadoes which went \nunreported and put thousands of residents at risk.\n  I am pleased that Chairman Gregg was able to fulfill part of my \nrequest regarding the National Weather Service's activities in the Erie \narea and wanted to confirm with him that it is our understanding that \npursuant to the language in this bill, the agency will undertake \nmitigation activities which will include having Weather Service \npersonnel in the Erie office 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, for 6 \nmonths beginning October 1, 1998.\n  I will continue to focus with Congressman English and Senator \nSantorum on our goal of reopening the Erie office permanently and \nensuring that the office is equipped with the most advanced forecasting \nequipment available in the federal government. The six-month reopening \nof the office represents a good interim fix and I thank the Chairman \nfor his help.\n  Mr. GREGG. I concur with my colleague from Pennsylvania as to my \nunderstanding of the agency's intentions. The bill before us provides \nsufficient funds to reopen the Erie office for six months on an around-\nthe-clock staffing basis as part of the effort to mitigate any \ndegradation of service since the Erie office was closed in 1996. I was \npleased to be able to provide at least some of the funds he requested \nand look forward to working with him on this issue as this bill moves \nto conference with the House of Representatives.\n\n\n                         essential fish habitat\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I wish to engage the Senator from New \nHampshire, the Subcommittee chairman of Commerce, Justice, State and \nthe Judiciary and the Senator from South Carolina, the Ranking Member \nof that Subcommittee in a colloquy.\n  As chairman of the Drinking Water Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am concerned that the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service's guidelines on essential fish \nhabitat have exceeded the scope of congressional intent. In 1996, \nCongress amended the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act. The National Marine Fisheries Service's interpretation \nof a provision in that Act concerns me, the States and a diverse range \nof affected businesses and citizens throughout the country.\n  Mr. GREGG. The intent of the original provision was to establish \nprocedures to gather information on essential fish habitat, wherever \npossible encouraging interagency coordination when other administration \nprograms complemented the EFH goal.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As my distinguished colleague points out, the \noriginal provision was limited, focusing on increased efficiency and, \nwherever appropriate, information coordination. Congress did not intend \nto authorize a provision that created a sweeping new regulatory \nprogram.\n  Concerns have been raised about the complexity of the NMFS \n``essential fish habitat'' regulations not add a new level of \nregulation in addition to what is required under the endangered Species \nAct.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the concerns of the Senator. The report \naccompanying this bill raises issues about the essential fish habitat \nprogram.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am aware of the report language accompanying the \nCommerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations bill, and I \ndid not object to the inclusion of that language. The EFH provisions of \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act are intended to address growing concerns over \nthe loss of habitat essential to the health of marine fisheries, \nincluding many commercially and recreationally valuable stocks.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. As envisioned by NMFS, essential fish habitat covers \nmuch of the coastal, marine, and estuarine waters of the United States, \nand it includes some inland habitat for anadromous species. The broad \ndefinition of ``essential fish habitat'' raised concerns that NMFS will \napply the EFH virtually everywhere.\n  In addition, serious concerns have been raised by nonfishing \ninterests regarding their lack of participation in the development of \nthese guidelines. Nonfishing interests were not heavily involved in the \ndevelopment of the guidelines. But when NMFS issued the proposal, a \ncoalition of groups felt that their participation should have been \nsolicited.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding that since the NMFS regulation was \nproposed, that community has offered comments. Given the scope of the \nEFH proposal, and the wide-ranging impacts on nonfishing entities, I \nbelieve the agency should take the view of all entities into \nconsideration.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I agree. They object to the scope of the proposed EFH \nprogram and are concerned that it will subject activities, including \nland development, agriculture, water supply, forestry, and mining, to \nthe jurisdiction of the Fishery Management Councils under the Magnuson-\nStevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Ideally, these \nguidelines, along with the comments submitted by nonfishing interests, \nwill be thoroughly reviewed and, if necessary, republished\n\n[[Page S8876]]\n\nby the NMFS. Congress should carefully watch this situation.\n  Mr. GREGG. The report accompanying this bill directs the General \nAccounting Office to review the National Marine Fishery Service's \nimplementation of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, including the essential \nfish habitat provisions. Congress should receive a thorough report on \nthis matter, and I look forward to receiving the results of the GAO's \nreview.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                        Pharmacy Record Keeping\n\n  Mr. HATCH. For some time, I have been disturbed over reports that the \nDrug Enforcement Administration has been imposing multiple, substantial \nfines for what amount to minor pharmacy record-keeping violations. I am \nreferring to cases in which no unauthorized person obtain control of \ncontrolled substances.\n  Violations of sections 842(a)(5) and (10) of the Controlled \nSubstances Act can result in penalties of $25,000 per violation. I \nunderstand that between 1989 and 1997, $50 million in such fines have \nbeen assessed.\n  These provisions of the law adopt a strict liability standard for all \nrecord-keeping violations, even a minor error such as a mis-recording \nof a zipcode, or the insertion of a ditto mark.\n  While we all favor strong regulation of controlled substances, a rule \nof reason should prevail here.\n  For that reason, I am supportive of the thrust of the language \ncontained in sections 118 and 199 of S. 2260.\n  Section 118 adopts a ``knowingly'' standard, rather than a strict \nliability standard.\n  Section 119 gives the courts discretion in assessing a fine, unlike \ncurrent law which is not permissive. In addition, this section lowers \nthe maximum penalty per occurrence from $25,000 to $500.\n  In combination, sections 118 and 119 may provide more correction than \nis warranted. For example, by adding a scienter requirement, while at \nthe same time lowering the maximum fine, we may be creating an \natmosphere in which sloppy record keeping is encouraged.\n  Overall, however, I am supportive of the work of the Committee in \nthis area of long-standing concern to the Congress, drug wholesalers, \npharmacies and drug stores. We should not be using this part of the \nstatute as a ``cash cow'' to line the government's coffers.\n  I will not offer an amendment to these sections at this time. \nHowever, I am hopeful that I may work with my colleagues in the Senate \nand the House to address these concerns in conference.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the concerns raised by the Senator from Utah. \nAs you know, we inserted this provision after learning of several cases \nin which large fines were imposed for realtively minor violations of \nthe Controlled Substances Act. We will be glad to work with you and our \nHouse colleagues during the conference, and we appreciate your \nforebearance in not offering an amendment at this time.\n\n\n                    courthouse security renovations\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to engage the distinguished Chairman \nof the subcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding the very important \nissue of Federal courthouse security. As I am sure the Chairman is \naware, each day Federal courthouses across the country must temporarily \ndetain thousands of prisoners awaiting trials, hearings and interviews. \nThe facilities must be secure because the courthouses are occupied by \nmembers of the public and the judiciary. For example, the U.S. \nMarshal's Service, which oversees Federal courthouse security, \nrecommends that larger courthouses be equipped with a secure garage \narea referred to as a ``sally port'' where prisoners can be transferred \nto the courthouse by van or bus, a detention facility where prisoners \ncan be temporarily held, secure interview rooms where prisoners can be \nquestioned by Assistant U.S. Attorneys, and if possible some separate \nsecure hall or corridor through which a violent or dangerous prisoner \ncan be transferred to a courtroom apart from the public and the \njudiciary.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the security needs of the various \ncourthouses.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Chairman, it has come to my attention that many of the \nolder Federal courthouses do not have proper facilities to adequately \nsecure prisoners and assure the safety of the public and the judiciary. \nFor example, in my own state of Michigan the U.S. Courthouse in \nDetroit, which is a large older courthouse, is in desperate need of \nsecurity improvements. The building contains no sally ports, and \nprisoners are transferred from vans and buses in the same modern \nventilation systems that control the spread of air bourne diseases such \nas tuberculosis. Also, there are no interview rooms in which defendants \nor prisoners acting as witnesses for the Government can be questioned \nby Assistant U.S. Attorneys or their own counsel. This has led to \ndifficulties for the local U.S. Attorney, and the U.S. Marshal, who has \nbeen forced to use extra members of his staff that are needed elsewhere \nto instead guard meeting rooms while the interviews take place. \nMoreover, the Detroit courthouse has no secure corridor to transfer \nprisoners from the detention cells to the courtrooms so that dangerous \nprisoners must be transferred in the same halls that are used by the \npublic. Finally Mr. Chairman, the Marshal's Service has informed me \nthat there is also a problem with many newly constructed courthouses, \nwhich cannot be opened because insufficient money is available to equip \nthe building with a minimum level of security systems such as security \ncameras and monitors. I want to commend the Chairman and ranking member \nfor appropriating money specifically for courthouses in Detroit and \nGrand Rapids. However, I would ask that more money be made available \nfor courthouse security projects.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the problems you have raised with respect to \ncourthouse security, and you have made a strong argument on behalf of \nincreased funding for courthouse security projects. I would like very \nmuch to fund more courthouse security projects such as those in \nMichigan. Unfortunately, we are operating under tight budgetary \nconstraints. While there are many deserving projects, the Committee \ncould only fund a limited number. I will continue to work with you in \nthe coming year to solve this serious problem of courthouse security.\n\n\n           Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Ranking Democrat on the Committee on \nSmall Business, I wish to express my support for funding the Small \nBusiness Administration's Office of Advocacy at the full requested \nlevel of $1.4 million for FY 1999. The Office of Advocacy plays a vital \nrole in the Federal government by conducting research on issues of \nparticular importance to small business. Recently these issues have \nincluded, among other things, access to capital, procurement policy and \nthe cost of Federal regulations. Small businesses are 99 percent of \nAmerica's businesses; they created more than 90 percent of new jobs in \nrecent years. The research performed by the Office of Advocacy is an \nimportant tool for policy makers and legislators who focus on the \nnation's small businesses. It deserves to be funded at the full $1.4 \nmillion, as requested by the Administration.\n  Since the Office is typically funded from the SBA's general salaries \nand expenses account without specific designation, I ask for \nclarification from my colleagues, Senators Gregg and Hollings, \nCommerce, State, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman and \nRanking Member, respectively. Was it the Subcommittee's intent to fund \nthe Office of Advocacy's economic research function at $1.4 million?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the bill assumes funding of the Economic \nResearch Division of SBA's Office of Advocacy at $1.4 million for FY \n1999. This Subcommittee believes the office has provided good service \nto the small business community. Much of that work is also useful for \nCongress and other policymakers.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I concur with Subcommittee Chairman \nGregg. The work of the Office of Advocacy is important to lawmakers and \npolicymakers alike. It was our intent that the Office of Advocacy \nreceive FY 1999 funding at the full requested amount of $1.4 million.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I see my colleague from New Jersey Senator \nTorricelli, and the distinguished bill manager on the floor. I would \nlike to briefly engage them in a colloquy on\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\nthe amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey, relating to model \nguidelines on bounty hunters to be published by the Attorney General.\n  I understand the concerns of Senator Torricelli in this matter. None \nof us want to see abuses by bounty hunters. I am also sure that he does \nnot wish to do any thing to adversely affect the bail bond industry, \nwhich has served our criminal justice system well in providing release \nof non-dangerous criminal defendants pending trial.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I say to the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee that \nthat is a correct interpretation of my intent.\n  Mr. HATCH. I continue to have some concerns about my colleague's \namendment in this respect. However, I believe that these concerns could \nbe resolved during conference. Would the Senator agree to work with me \nto address this issue?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I would be glad to assure Senator Hatch that I will \nwork with him to ensure that the product that emerges from conference \nresolves both of our concerns.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I, too, would like to say that I am \ncommitted to working during conference with both Senator Hatch and \nSenator Torricelli to address the Judiciary Committee Chairman's \nconcerns.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \nconsideration, and look forward to working with them on this.\n\n\n  HIGH-TECHNOLOGY ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL- TO MEDIUM-SIZED MANUFACTURERS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, my home State of New Hampshire leads the \nnation in the percentage of private sector employees in high technology \njobs. The high technology business in New Hampshire has made the State \neconomy strong and has helped lower the unemployment rate. I am pleased \nwith the investment that high technology companies have made in my \nstate. I am concerned, however, that the benefits to the State from \nthese industries do not reach the more rural areas of New Hampshire. \nMuch of the benefits of the high technology growth have been \nconcentrated in the southern, more urban parts of the State. The more \nrural areas in the north are not growing as quickly or realizing the \nbenefits of new, innovative technology as widely.\n  It recently came to my attention that the University of Hew \nHampshire's Wittemore School of Business Small Development Center (NH \nSBDC) has come up with a plan to help the rural areas in New Hampshire \ntake advantage of New Hampshire's technology industries' growth. The NH \nSBDC proposes to launch a model program to provide technical assistance \nto small-medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) in rural areas, which will \nallow them to benefit from the innovative technology being utilized in \nother parts of the state. New Hampshire's program could serve as a \nmodel for other states that are experiencing similarly slow growth in \nrural areas. Among the services that NH SBDC intends to provide are: \nlinking rural SMMs to high technology companies; identifying SMMs that \nhave the greatest potential for implementing economic development in \nrural areas; and helping SMMs identify critical paths to success in \ntheir areas.\n  The NH SBDC would like to implement this plan with funds from the \nSmall Business Administration (SBA). The SBA often funds projects \nsimilar to this and, in fact, currently has a successful program in \nplace called the SBA 7(j) program that provides funding for training \nand technical assistance to rural areas. If the SBA and the NH SBDC \nwork together to develop the plan outlined by NH SBDC, I believe that \nit could have a significant positive impact on New Hampshire's rural \nmanufacturers. The knowledge gained from this innovative concept can \neventually help all States overcome similar problems in rural areas.\n  I urge the SBA to accommodate the NH SBDC's request for assistance \nwith this project. I look forward to working with the SBA to ensure \nthat this program can be launched to help rural companies all over the \nUnited States benefit from the innovative technologies that are used in \nmore urban areas.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to applaud the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, and the subcommittee's \nRanking Member, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, for their work on \nthe Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations bill. They have crafted a \ngood piece of legislation that will help to meet a variety of needs \nacross the country.\n  One of the important and pressing issues addressed in this \nlegislation is school safety. During the past several months, we have \nseen several tragic incidents of school violence. These acts are not \nlimited to specific geographic regions or family backgrounds, nor do \nthey have a single catalyst. Those who have committed such cowardly \nacts have done so for different reasons, at different times, in \ndifferent schools. But these acts of school violence have at least one \nthing in common--they have spurred all of us to take a closer look at \nwhat can be done to better protect our children at school.\n  In this Commerce-Justice-State legislation, the Senate offers one new \ntool in that effort. We have earmarked $210 million in the bill for a \nnew national safe schools initiative geared to assist community-level \nefforts.\n  Parents should not have to worry, when they put their children on the \nbus to school in the morning, that those children will not return home \nsafely in the afternoon. In an effort to provide local school districts \nwith more resources to reduce the levels of violence in our classrooms, \nI supported this initiative to strengthen local violence prevention and \ntechnology efforts.\n  Within the $210 million, $25 million will assist communities in \ndeveloping and implementing local school safety approaches. Another $10 \nmillion is for the National Institute of Justice to develop new, more \neffective safety technologies and communications systems that can \nprovide communities with quick access to the information they need to \nidentify potentially violent youths.\n  Perhaps most important is the $175 million for the Community Oriented \nPolicing Services Program to increase community policing in and around \nschools. This would be an extension of the COPS program which has been \nwidely hailed as a successful deterrent to crime. In West Virginia, \nsome school districts already partner with the local police department \nto have what they call ``police resource officers'' in the schools. \nOfficers and educators alike believe that having a familiar police \npresence in the hallways and a cruiser in the parking lot helps to \nreduce violence at school.\n  Ensuring that our classrooms are safe demands that we do everything \npossible to find safe places for our children to learn and play and \ngrow. While there is no single answer or solution to this pressing \nproblem, the funding in this bill is an important step toward that \ncommon goal.\n  Mr. President, also in this legislation is an amendment I added on \nbehalf of the thousands of families in West Virginia's Upper Ohio \nValley and throughout the country who rely on the steel industry for \ntheir livelihoods. These are the people who work in the shops and in \nthe mills, and who pay the taxes, and whose sweat keeps America \nrunning. My amendment calls for a report by the United States Trade \nRepresentative on trade subsidies provided by the South Korean \ngovernment to its domestic steel industry. Illegal foreign steel \nsubsidies are severely undermining the economic stability in regions \nthroughout our country--literally taking money out of the pockets of \nAmerican families and putting it into the accounts of foreign \ngovernments.\n  The American steel industry for too long has been forced to compete \nin an international marketplace that was unbalanced by foreign \nsubsidies, especially those of the South Korean government. By offering \nthis amendment, I want to send a clear message: the United States will \nnot allow foreign governments to undercut fair trading practices. This \nCongress is prepared to defend our country's commercial interests and \ntake action when those interests are threatened.\n  West Virginia companies, like Weirton Steel, should not be expected \nto compete in a marketplace that places unfair obstacles in their \npaths. When foreign governments subsidize industries, they tip the \nplaying field, change the rules, and make it unfair. Those overseas \nsubsidies directly impact the jobs and livelihoods of working men and \nwomen and their families\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nhere at home, as we have seen in Weirton.\n\n\n                  funding for gun prosecution projects\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the manager of the bill \naccepting the amendment I filed to the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill, S. 2660, which directs the Attorney General to \nidentify two major metropolitan areas besieged by gun-related crime and \nto initiate vigorous federal gun prosecution projects in those \ndistricts. The amendment directs $3,000,000 in funding for hiring \nadditional prosecutors and investigators to ensure that criminals \nbearing guns are not released due to a lack of prosecutorial resources.\n  The inspiration for this amendment is ``Project Exile,'' an \nextraordinarily successful effort by the United States Attorney for the \nEastern District of Virginia to rid Richmond of armed criminals by \n``exiling'' all those who use firearms to commit a crime to federal \nprison, regardless of the number of weapons or quantities of drugs \nseized. ``Project Exile'' also made use of the media to deliver its \nmessage that ``An illegal gun will get you five years in federal \nprison.'' That message was plastered on billboards, a city bus, TV \ncommercials, and business cards distributed by local police.\n  The results of ``Project Exile'' speak for themselves. In just one \nyear, over 300 individuals were indicated under Project Exile and 363 \nguns were seized. More than 191 armed criminals were removed from \nRichmond's streets, including the members of a violent gang responsible \nfor a number of murders. The average sentence for the individuals that \nhave thus far been convicted and sentenced is 56.1 months. Moreover, \nhomicides for the period from November, 1997 through May, 1998 were \nrunning more than 50% below the same period for the previous year and \nthere was a corresponding reduction in the rate of gun carrying by \ncriminals. ``Project Exile'' has effectively broken the spiral of \nviolent crime in Richmond.\n  My colleague, the senior Senator from Idaho, introduced an amendment \nwhich was passed yesterday which seeks to set up a similar project in \nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The senior \nSenator from Pennsylvania had earlier secured this funding in the \ncommittee report to this bill. It is important, however, that these \nprojects be tested in a number of jurisdictions to ensure that their \neffectiveness can be measured in a wide range of circumstances. By \nsetting up a number of test projects in different locales, we should be \nable to prove beyond any doubt that a truly determined and aggressive \neffort by law enforcement to rigorously enforce existing federal gun \nlaws will have the effect of lowering the incidence of violent crime \nand will create safer communities for our citizens.\n  We don't need tougher gun control laws on abiding citizens to stem \nviolent crime, we need to aggressively use the effective laws we have \nto take violent criminals off the streets. We saw yesterday where the \nSenate stands on issues such as mandatory trigger locks on guns and \nvicarious liability for gunowners, and I am glad that the Senate is \ndevoting even more resources to targeting violent criminals who use \nguns. I urge my colleagues to support me in this effort.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill \nfor their hard work in putting forth annual legislation which provides \nfederal funding for numerous vital programs. The Senate will soon vote \nto adopt the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill for the \nFiscal Year 1999. I intend to support this measure because it provides \nfunding for fighting crime, enhancing drug enforcement, and responding \nto threats of terrorism. This further addresses the shortcomings of the \nimmigration process, continues the operating of the judicial process, \nfacilitates commerce throughout the United States, and fulfills the \nneeds of the State Department and various other agencies.\n  However, I regret that I must again come forward this year to object \nto the millions of unrequested, low-priority, wasteful spending in this \nbill and its accompanying report. This year's bill has $361 million in \npork-barrel spending. This is a slight improvement over last year's FY \n98 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill, which contained $384.2 \nmillion in pork-barrel spending. However, $361 million is still an \nunacceptable amount of money to spend on low-priority, unrequested, \nwasteful projects. In short, Congress must curb its appetite for such \nunbridled spending.\n  The multitude of unrequested earmarks buried in this proposal will \nundoubtedly further burden the American taxpayers.\n  This statement highlighting wasteful and unnecessary spending in \nauthorization and appropriations bills may appear to be a mere \npolitical ploy. This is not the case. $361 million spent on locality-\nspecific, special interests, pork-barrel projects is not mere rhetoric. \nWasteful spending of this amount warrants serious debate. Wasteful \nspending of this magnitude erodes the public's trust in our system of \ngovernment.\n  Sunshine is often the best disinfectant. Congress and the American \npublic must be made aware of the magnitude of wasteful spending \nendorsed by this body. While the amounts associated with each \nindividual earmark may not seem extravagant, taken together, they \nrepresent a serious diversion of taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to low \npriority programs at the expense of numerous programs that have \nundergone the appropriate merit-based selection process. I take very \nstrong exception to a large number of provisions in the bill before us \ntoday.\n  I have compiled a lengthy list of the numerous add-ons, earmarks, and \nspecial exemptions provided to individual projects in this bill. It \nwould take a substantial amount of time to recite this list to you. \nInstead, I request unanimous consent to include this list in the \nRecord. However, I will discuss some of the more troubling provisions \nof the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill in detail.\n  $12 million is earmarked for the Director of the United States \nInformation Agency in the state of Hawaii, in order to provide for \ncarrying out the provisions of the Center for Cultural and Technical \nInterchange Between East and West Act of 1960, and an additional $7 \nmillion dollars is earmarked for the East-West Center in Hawaii.\n  $3 million is earmarked in this bill to carry out the provisions of \nthe North/South Center Act of 1991 in Florida, known as the North/South \nCenter, and, an additional $500,000 is earmarked in this bill for the \nNorth/South Center in Florida.\n  $925,000 is set aside to allow the Utah State Olympic Public Safety \nCommand to continue to develop and support a public safety program for \nthe 2002 Winter Olympics.\n  $5 million is earmarked for the Utah Communication Agency Network for \nupgrades of security and communications infrastructure for law \nenforcement needed for the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n  An earmark of $750,000 to fund Chesapeake oyster research at Texas \nState University.\n  Why are we spending $22.5 million on the East-West and North/South \nCenters alone. What makes these centers so extraordinary that they \nreceive specific earmarks in this Appropriations bill. I am not \ncondemning the North/South or East-West Centers. Nor am I condemning \nthe merits of the purposes they serve. I am simply condemning the \nmanner which they are receiving scarce government funds.\n  I am sure there are other centers throughout the U.S. which serve the \nsame or similar missions as the North-South and East-West Centers. \nOther well-deserving projects of merit and national necessity deserve \nto compete for the scarce funds gobbled up by locality specific \nearmarks such as the North/South and East-West Centers. Unfortunately, \nthese projects will never receive fair deliberation if the \nAppropriations Committee pre-determines their fate by ``recommending'' \nand ``urging'' the Department to give special consideration to certain \nprojects over others. In sum, it is patently unfair to divert scarce \nresources to pork-barrel, special interest projects, at the expense of \nwell-deserving projects which would benefit the public as a whole.\n  The bill also contains language that directs the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to expand the duty station in Grand Junction, \nColorado. Moreover, this language directs the INS to open new duty \nstations in\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\nAlamosa, Glenwood Springs, Craig, Durango, and Greely, Colorado. The \nCommittee does not explain why specific sites are higher in priority \nthan others, or why these sites are more deserving of funding. I fail \nto comprehend why these locations should receive such special attention \nwhile the rest of the nation must compete for funds in the appropriate \nmerit-based selection process.\n  Mr. President, I will not deliberate much longer on this subject, but \nI strongly object to the wasteful spending in this Appropriations bill. \nHow can we combat the American public's cynicism towards our \ngovernmental system when we continue to fund low-priority, wasteful \npork-barrel projects?\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the Capitol and on both sides \nof the aisle to develop a better standard which curbs our habit of \nfunneling hard-earned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special \ninterests. Commitment to the public good must continue to be our \npriority. We can only live up to this challenge by eliminating the \npractice of catering to low-priority special interests, at the expense \nof the average American.\n  As I have said in the past, I look forward to the day when Congress \ncan present to the American people a budget that is both fiscally \nresponsible and ends the practice of wasteful pork-barrel spending in \nAppropriations bills.\n\n\n                        foreign affairs agencies\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we close debate on the Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill, I would like to make a few comments \non the funding for the foreign affairs agencies.\n  I want to express my appreciation to the Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Subcommittee for their efforts to provide adequate funding for \nthe foreign policy agencies within the tight allocation they have. The \nUnited States is a great military and economic power, with extensive \ninterests overseas. To protect those interests, we need both a strong \nmilitary and a strong diplomatic corps. ``Diplomatic readiness'' is \nmore than a slogan; it represents a commitment to ensure that our \ndiplomats, who stand on the front lines of our national defense, have \nthe resources to perform the many tasks we entrust to them.\n  I commend the Committee for providing, in particular, the necessary \nfunding to modernize the Department of State's information technology. \nThe Department made some bad choices in previous years, and is now \nsaddled with antiquated computer and telecommunications technology. \nInformation is central to the task of diplomacy, and we are undermining \nour interests substantially unless we properly equip the Department \nwith modern technology.\n  I'd like to say a few words about the Bureau of Export Administration \nin the Department of Commerce, which performs several functions that \nare vital to the national security of the United States. The managers \nof the bill before us were unable to find $2.5 million for three of \nthose vital functions. I appeal to the managers to make every effort to \nfind those funds in conference, so that we can continue to safeguard \nthe national security as the American people expect us to do.\n  These important Export Administration needs are as follows:\n  Ten new positions (8 full-time equivalents) to fully staff Export \nAdministration field offices, so that they can mount more intensive \nenforcement of U.S. controls over dual-use items that could otherwise \nbe diverted to military or terrorist uses;\n  Three new positions (2 full-time equivalents) to enhance the \nenforcement regarding shipments to Hong Kong, so as to prevent or stop \nany diversion of strategically-controlled goods to China; and\n  Six positions (4 full-time equivalents) to maintain the \nNonproliferation Export Control teams that help countries in the former \nSoviet Union to improve their export control systems.\n  The first two items, which require a total of $2.2 million, are self-\nexplanatory. At a time when we have legitimate concerns regarding the \npossible Chinese diversion to military purposes of machine tools and \nhigh-speed computers, we must give the Bureau of Export Administration \nthe funds and positions it needs to fully enforce U.S. law and \nregulations that control such exports and provide for follow-up \nmonitoring of their overseas use.\n  The Nonproliferation Export Control teams require a word of further \nexplanation. This function--which is part of the Cooperative Threat \nReduction program--has proceeded for some years with funding from the \nDepartment of Defense and the Department of State. The Department of \nCommerce agreed last year, however, to assume the costs of its \nparticipation in that program. The State and Defense budgets no longer \ninclude funding for the Nonproliferation Export Control teams. If \nCommerce Department funds are not found for this purpose, this valuable \nprogram could well be lost.\n  What would we lose if the Nonproliferation Export Control teams were \nto go away? Those teams have performed incredibly well, fostering ties \nat the customs agent level and helping the former Soviet states to \nestablish export control laws and institutions to can prevent the loss \nof sensitive goods and information to rogue states or terrorist groups.\n  For example, the Government of Ukraine wants a team to help brief \nmembers of its parliament on inadequacies in Ukraine's current law. The \nGovernment of Slovakia wants help in developing regulations to \nimplement its new export control law. Export Administration's teams \nsupport these efforts in full cooperation with other U.S. departments \nand agencies.\n  I realize that resources are tight, but it would be a grave mistake, \nin my view, to let this valuable non-proliferation resource slip away \nfrom us. So I urge my colleagues, the managers of this bill, to find \nthe $1.3 million needed to keep the Nonproliferation Export Control \nteams alive and well in Fiscal Year 1999. I also urge them to find the \n$1.2 million needed to improve our own export enforcement regarding \ndual-use goods that we must prevent from being used against U.S. \ninterests. I realize these are small amounts in a bill that funds three \nlarge cabinet departments, but they could go a long way in advancing \nour non-proliferation interests.\n  In closing, I want to again express my appreciation to the managers \nof this bill. They had a very difficult task in balancing all the \ncompeting interests in this bill, and I believe they did an excellent \njob in balancing those interests.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I wanted to make a few comments on a bill \nthat Senator Mikulski and I introduced just yesterday. The bill number \nis S. 2340. It is called the Patient Access to Acupuncture Services Act \nof 1998. It will provide limited coverage for acupuncture under \nMedicare and under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. It is \nan important bill that reflects an appropriate and needed response to \nboth progress in science and to the demand for complementary and \nalternative treatments for pain and illness.\n  I acknowledge Senator Mikulski's strong support for the bill and for \ncosponsoring the bill. She has been a strong supporter of effective \nalternative therapies and has long realized and appreciated the \nimportance and significance of such therapies to our health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, approximately 90 million Americans suffer from chronic \nillnesses, which, each year, cost society roughly $659 billion in \nhealth care expenditures, lost productivity and premature death. \nDespite the high costs of this care, studies published in the Journal \nof the American Medical Association reveal that the health care \ndelivery system is not meeting the needs of the chronically ill in the \nUnited States.\n  Many of these Americans are looking desperately for effective, less \ncostly alternatives therapies to relieve the debilitating pain they \nsuffer. In 1990 alone, Americans spent nearly $14 billion out-of-pocket \non alternative therapies. Harvard University researchers have found \nthat fully one-third of Americans regularly use complementary and \nalternative medicine,\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\nmaking an estimated 425 million visits to complementary and alternative \npractitioners of these therapies--surpassing those made to conventional \nprimary care practitioners!\n  And with good reason. Last November, a consensus conference of the \nNational Institutes of Health approved the use of acupuncture in \nstandard U.S. medical care. It was the first time that the NIH had \nendorsed as effective a major alternative therapy, and it was just the \ntype of medical breakthrough that I had hoped for and envisioned when I \nworked to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine at NIH.\n  The NIH experts cited data showing that acupuncture can effectively \nrelieve certain conditions, such as nausea, vomiting and pain, and \nshows promise in treating chronic conditions such as lower back pain, \nsubstance addictions, osteoarthritis and asthma.\n  In 1993, the FDA reported that Americans spent $500 million for up to \n12 million acupuncture visits. In 1996, after reviewing the science, \nthe FDA removed acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental \nmedical devices'' and now regulates them just as it does other devices, \nsuch as surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes. Acupuncture is \neffectively used by practitioners around the world. The World Health \nOrganization has approved its use to treat a variety of medical \nconditions, including pulmonary problems and rehabilitation from \nneurological damage.\n  It has been reported that more than 1 million Americans currently \nreceive acupuncture each year. Access to qualified acupuncture \nprofessionals for appropriate conditions should be ensured. Including \nthis important therapy under Medicare and FEHBP coverage will promote a \nprogressive health system that integrates treatment from both \nacupuncturists and physicians. and in many cases we see more and more \nwhere physicians are acupuncturists. It will expand patient care \noptions. I also believe it will reduce health care costs because of the \nrelatively low cost of acupuncture compared to conventional pain \nmanagement therapies.\n\n  Research is still needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of other \nalternative therapies. This research is vitally important, but we must \nact now to help the millions of Americans who can benefit from the \nknowledge we have already gained.\n  The 21st century is just around the corner. Less than 50 years ago, \ntreatments that are now considered conventional--organ transplants, \nnitroglycerin for heart patients, immunology, and x-ray and laser \ntechnology--were decried as quackery by the medical establishment. \nEveryday we face new biological and emotional challenges for which \nmodern Western medicine has no remedy. Now science is revealing the \neffectiveness of many complementary and alternative treatments, \nincluding acupuncture, which I might point out is not a new treatment \nbut, indeed, has been practiced in China for the last 2,000 to 3,000 \nyears, and, increasingly, more Americans are choosing these alternative \ntherapies to manage their health and to treat the illness.\n\n  Let us listen to the science, and heed the urgent need for progress. \nMr. President, the nation's leading scientists have demonstrated the \nsafety and effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for a wide range \nof pain and illness. It makes common sense that Medicare and FEHBP \ncover this legitimate course of therapy.\n  I invite other Senators as cosponsors. Hopefully, we can get the bill \npassed during this session.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8880-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8881-S8886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on February 25, 1997, a number of us \nintroduced the Patients' Bill of Rights. Since that time, the \nRepublican leadership has sought to delay and deny action. The \nleadership and Senator Gramm have made it very clear that they are not \nyet willing to allow a free and fair debate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to say to the Senator that we would be glad to \nagree to have this debate and go forward with the Patients' Bill of \nRights issue. I would like to begin thinking in terms of what we could \nwork out as a unanimous consent agreement. Going back to June 18, \noriginally it was suggested that Senator Kennedy's bill be up and we \nhave an alternative, and that we have a good debate and vote. That is \nfine. Let's do that. Then I suggested, well, if we could get some time \nagreements on when we could complete it, with some limited amount of \namendments, we could do that. I don't think 40 would be considered \nreasonable.\n  But I am saying to the Senator that I would like to work something \nout. I am hoping that next week, Wednesday or Thursday, we are going to \nget to this and get it done before we go home for the August recess \nperiod.\n  I just want to say that we are ready. We would like to do this. \nBeginning next week, I am going to start asking unanimous consent \nrequests to actually get it done, because we are ready to go to a vote. \nBut we also have other things. And Senator Kennedy has been \ncooperative. We have been working to get issues done. We need to try to \ndo that and allow time for a full and fair debate on this issue. We \nwould be glad to do that.\n  I just wanted to make sure he was aware that we are willing to do \nthat.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have heard that same explanation, with \nall respect, by the majority leader for some period of time.\n  I want to just review, since the majority leader is on the floor at \nthe present time--we had the budget resolution. We had 7 days of \ndebate. We had 105 amendments. Defense authorization, we had 6 days of \ndebate, 150 amendments; Internal Revenue Service restructuring, 8 days \nof debate, 13 amendments. We had tobacco, 17 days and scores of \namendments; agriculture, 5 days of debate and 55 amendments. The \nSenator now is saying, Well, we will bring it up next week, just before \nwe get out, and have a vote on your amendment or the Daschle bill and/\nor the Republican proposal.\n  Mr. President, I just wonder why we can't have a full debate on the \ncomparison between the emergency room provisions of the Republican \nguarantees and those in the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  I intend to talk about those--now I have the floor. I have the floor. \nI am glad to yield--but when I inquired of the leader on other \noccasions, he gave us that other little answer about, ``We are going to \ncome to this sometime when we are ready to come to it, some other time, \nnext week, and maybe Wednesday, or Thursday, just before we go out we \nwill have some proposal.'' We are just spelling out now what has been \nincluded in these different bills and why it is important to have a \nfull and fair debate on them.\n  We have seen and we know what the leadership's position has been \nuntil the very recent days, and that has been to refuse to permit us to \nhave a markup in our committee, refused us to be able to even have \nscheduling. I have seen the list of the Republican leadership, and it \nnever was on the list of the Republican leadership in terms of \npriorities.\n  Now we are glad that last Friday there was the publication of the \n``Republican Bill of Rights.'' That was last Friday. But I want to just \nreview, since the leader mentioned the proposal that was put forward by \nthe leader. This was, I believe, the June proposal that was put forward \nby the majority leader.\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that prior to the August recess \n     [June 18, that was 4 weeks before, June 18] prior to the \n     August recess, the majority leader, after notification to the \n     minority leader, shall turn to the consideration of a bill to \n     be introduced by the majority leader [no information about \n     what that is] or his designee, regarding health care [and \n     further] I ask the Senate to proceed to its immediate \n     consideration; and that, following the reporting . . . by the \n     clerk, Senator Daschle, or his designee, be recognized to \n     offer a substitute to the text of S. 1891 as introduced on \n     March 31.\n  That isn't our bill.\n  Now, it goes on. It does not include the right to hold the plans \naccountable. It does not include protecting people who buy their own \ninsurance policy.\n  Let me just go on.\n\n       I further ask that during the consideration of the health \n     care issue it be in order for Members to offer health care \n     amendments in\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\n     the first and second degree. I further ask unanimous consent \n     that the Chair not entertain a motion to adjourn or recess \n     for the August recess prior to a vote on or in relation to \n     the majority leader's bill and the minority leader's \n     amendment, and that following those votes it be in order for \n     the majority leader to return the legislation to the \n     calendar.\n\n  Even if we win the vote, the majority leader has the ability to send \nit to the calendar--not send it over to the House of Representatives, \nsend it to the calendar, even if we win that proposal.\n  Now, it continues.\n\n       Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order to \n     offer any legislation, motion or amendment relative to health \n     care prior to the initiation of the agreement and following \n     the execution of the agreement.\n\n  Not be in order to offer any legislation, motion or amendment to \nhealth care.\n  Well, there it is, Mr. President. We are scared in the Senate. After \nwe have some vote, even if we survive, the majority leader can put it \nback on the calendar, and under the consent agreement we can't even \ntalk about health care for the rest of the session; for the rest of the \nsession. That is what it says here, the rest of the session.\n  Now, that is the consent agreement that is referred to. ``I want to \nremind the Senator from Massachusetts we keep asking the Democrats for \nproposals on it.''\n  I don't know how long it took to reject that particular proposal, but \nthere it is. In all the time I have been in the Senate, this is really \nthe most preposterous proposal, consent agreement I have ever heard, \nthat if you are going to be successful and win, instead of sending the \nbill over to the House, you put it right back on the calendar, and you \ncannot have a vote on the legislation. And then after that, you can't \nbring up any issue relating to health for the rest of the session--\nnothing on privacy, nothing on expanding the whole Medicare system in \nterms of purchasing, the possibility for elderly citizens to buy into \nthe Medicare system, no way. Nothing dealing with any of the issues \ndealing with health care. That is the proposal and that is what we are \nsupposed to say, ``Oh, what a fair proposal this is.''\n  And so we have the Republican proposal that was introduced last \nFriday. Now, we have no interest in delay of the legislation. We have \nbeen asking for action for 18 months. We insist on a fair debate on \naccountability. That is what we are asking, fair debate on \naccountability. We have had scores of amendments and days of debate on \nother legislation, and we are entitled to fair debate on accountability \non these measures.\n  There are dramatic differences on these measures. I will take a few \nmoments to get into some of those.\n  Senator Daschle made a series of formal offers on July 16th, asking \nfor a debate beginning on July 21 with 20 amendments on a side. It is \nalmost a week later and all we have is that maybe sometime Wednesday or \nThursday next week we may have time to have a debate on an issue which \nis of paramount importance for the parents and families of the people \nof this country.\n  So this is not an unreasonable request given the importance of this \nbill and the large number of loopholes in the Republican proposal which \nwill be the bill in the Chamber.\n  We had, as I mentioned, days of debate on the budget resolution, 6 \ndays of debate on defense authorization, 150 amendments. We had 8 days \nof debate on the Internal Revenue bill, just concluded 5 days of debate \nand 55 amendments on the agricultural appropriations bill.\n  This is the most important health care bill that this Congress will \nconsider, and we are now told by the majority leader that maybe \nsometime next week he will make a request that we deal with this in 2 \ndays. We had 8 days, as I mentioned, on the Internal Revenue bill, and \n5 days of debate, as I mentioned, on agriculture. Now, the majority \nleader and Senator Gramm are insisting the only way they will debate \nthe issue is up or down on their bill and one vote and that is it.\n  The American people deserve to know where their Members stand on a \nnumber of critical issues that are essential to patient protection. The \nSenate deserves an opportunity to amend and improve the Republican \nbill. It is not unreasonable to ask Members where they stand on whether \nprotections should apply to all 161 million privately ensured Americans \nor leave 100 million out. The Republican proposal leaves out more than \n100 million Americans. Now, maybe they have good reason to do so. Their \nanswer is the States are doing it. Well, we ought to have an \nopportunity to find out and discuss what the States are doing and how \nmuch they are doing and how effective it is, given the kinds of \nconcerns that patients have. Let's have a debate on that. But, oh, no. \nNo, no, we don't have time to get into the fact of whether their \nmeasure will just cover 48 million and exclude 110 million, or cover \nall of them. It is a pretty important issue, it seems to me, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  Is it unreasonable to ask Members where they stand on allowing a sick \nchild with rare cancer access to a specialist to treat that particular \ndisease?\n  We had very powerful testimony this morning from a very outstanding \noncologist, a specialist who has been operating primarily on women with \nbreast cancer, and she was, with tears in her eyes, talking about the \nvarious patients she is treating now who come to her with these various \ntumors in their breasts. And she looks at the first part of the chart \nand finds out what the size of that particular tumor was when it was \nfirst diagnosed and then what it is on the day that she is there called \nupon to operate.\n  She says the time that lapses between the first discovery of those \nbiopsies, which demonstrate that the tumors are cancerous, to the time \nshe gets to see them is often the difference between life and death and \nmore often than not, as she looks over the various files that she gets \nof various women, the ones with the largest gaps are the ones who are \npart of HMOs and the procedures that have been denied.\n  Or listen to the doctor who was talking today about a particular \nprocedure that was going to be necessary for a child who was having \nconstant headaches, and the doctor said, ``What we need is an MRI,'' \nand the HMO turned that down. Under the Republican bill, since the cost \nof that MRI was $750, that decision would not be able to be appealed. \nIt was less than $1,000. This was a family of five, income of $30,000. \nThe difficulty of that family was having the $750.\n  And do you know what the family did? They went down to the county \nhospital--the county hospital. After a period of time, they were able \nto get that MRI in the county hospital to find out about the needs of \nthat particular child. You know something. The taxpayers picked up the \ntab for that. And the bottom line of that HMO looked better and better \nbecause they didn't have to pay for that important service which the \nsubscriber had effectively paid for when they signed on for the health \ncare coverage.\n  Mr. President, we ought to be able to talk and debate about what is \ngoing to happen, what kind of protections are we going to give doctors \nwhen they speak out for their patients in the HMO system. Are they \ngoing to be under the Republican program which still permits doctors to \nbe fired if they object to prescribing certain procedures to patients \nthat are not desired or approved by an HMO? Shouldn't we provide \nprotections for doctors that are looking out for their patients? It is \nnot in the Republican bill. Shouldn't we have a time to debate that \nissue out here to find out about it?\n  What about the independent and timely third party review? Do the \nMembers know that on the independent review, under the Republican \nprogram, those who are going to be paid to review the various \nprocedures which are being reviewed and appealed are going to be paid \nfor by the HMO, the same HMO? Do they know the restrictions in the \nRepublican proposal in terms of the limitations for the types of \nprocedures that can be appealed? We don't want to debate that?\n  I can understand why the Republican leadership doesn't want to debate \nit. Because it is indefensible. It is indefensible. We ought to debate \nit.\n  And access to clinical trials, an enormously important issue, \nparticularly for individuals who have some of the most serious \nillnesses in our society, we are going to say or give assurance to \nthose who may have breast cancer--are we going to exclude them from \nparticipation in those clinical trials? It is an important distinction \nbetween the\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\nRepublican proposal and our Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We have the continuity of care. When a family has a doctor they are \nseeing and that doctor is dropped from a particular program, under our \nproposal we provide that there is going to be a continuity of care. \nPerhaps it is an expectant mother who is going to deliver and, for one \nreason or another, that doctor is dropped from the particular plan. We \ngive assurances.\n  So does the Republican program. Listen to this. If the employer, \nhowever, makes a judgment to change the plans in the middle of the \nyear, and that doctor is treating this same patient, under the \nRepublican program there is no longer continuity of care. Both programs \nshow continuity of care. You have to read the small print; you have to \nunderstand what the small print says. Shouldn't we have an opportunity \nto debate that issue?\n  The whole question of accountability is something that demands an \nopportunity to debate that issue. We are talking about the protection \nthat is given to 23 million Americans, county and State employees; 11 \nmillion Americans who have private insurance companies. There is no \nindication there is any escalation of their costs in their program, \nnothing showing that has been introduced here in the Senate. Some have \ntried to represent these as extraordinary escalations of cost, but \nthere is no indication, nothing has been put in the Record. What has \nbeen put in the Record is these 23 million Americans. In CalPERS, in \nCalifornia, they have this system with accountability and liability \nbuilt in so they can hold the HMOs accountable, and there is no \napparent increase in the cost of those programs.\n  Basically, what we are saying is very simple, a very simple concept \nat the heart of our proposals and which I believe the Republicans have \nto be able to defend, because it is lacking in their proposal and it is \nworthy of debate. That issue alone is worth hours of debate here in the \nU.S. Senate, with the American people watching, because we believe that \nultimately the judgment and decision on medical decisions ought to be \nmade by the doctors and the patients, and not by accountants of \ninsurance companies for the profits of those particular insurance \ncompanies. That is a basic and fundamental core difference. We ensure \nthat is going to be the case with a number of different protections in \nour bill. That kind of assurance is lacking in the Republican bill.\n  There will be those who say, ``No, it is not lacking.'' We ought to \nhave a chance to debate, so the American people can make up their own \nminds and find out whether it is lacking. We can get the legislation \nout and show where it is lacking. But that is something basic and \nfundamental.\n  We also believe we ought to be able to leave it up to the States to \nmake those judgments and decisions on calling the tune on the issues of \naccountability and liability. We hear a great deal around this body \nabout ``one size does not fit all,'' that all knowledge is not in \nWashington, DC, or on the floor of the U.S. Senate; that the States \nhave some awareness and understanding about these issues and problems. \nHow many times have we heard that speech? You have heard the speech, \nbut you will not hear it when we are debating the Patients' Bill of \nRights. You will not hear it because our proposal leaves it up to the \nStates to be able to enforce the issues of accountability. We leave it \nup to the States to be able to do so. Not the Republican leadership \nprogram. They effectively preclude the States from having any voice--\nshut them out, shut out the States.\n  I hope we don't hear that argument about the importance of all \nknowledge failing to be in the U.S. Congress and Senate, so let the \nStates decide. That is not going to be an argument you will hear, \nbecause under the Republican proposal they will not let the States \ndecide.\n  What is the issue we are talking about? We are talking about a \nmedical decision that is made by the doctor and the patient, which is \noverruled by the HMO and causes grievous injury to that individual--\nmaybe life or serious illness; maybe a mother or father, trying to make \nsure those children and the members of the family are not just going to \nbe left homeless, without any kind of compensation for the decision \nthat is being made for the profits of that particular industry \noverriding the clear medical decisions. There has to be accountability. \nThere has to be accountability.\n  We have seen effective programs which we have built into programs on \nappeals, internal appeals and external appeals, that also have \naccountability. It works. We improve and strengthen the quality of \nthose programs. We have 11 million Americans--11 million Americans--who \nhave independent insurance programs that have this kind of \naccountability. It works for them.\n  So we have 34 million Americans who have this kind of protection, but \nwe are asked to exclude it, to deny the States from even letting those \ncitizens who live in that State who want it from having it. That is \npart of the Republican program. Don't we think that is worthy of a \ndebate? Do you want to muzzle us from having some kind of debate and \ndiscussion on that particular issue? That just does not make sense.\n  Mr. President, when the leadership wants to go ahead on these \nappropriations, I am glad to yield the floor so the Senate can move \nahead on Senate business. But I want to just make a final few comments.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Republicans have abandoned their 16-\nmonth-long pattern of stonewalling our Patients' Bill of Rights. Now \nthey have produced a plan that borrows the name of our legislation and \nnothing else. The Senate Republican plan is not a bill of rights, it is \na bill of wrongs. The Senate Republican plan is even weaker than the \nHouse Republican plan. It is a ``Gingrich lite.'' It protects industry \nprofits instead of protecting patients, and it is so riddled with \nloopholes, it is a license for continued abuse. It allows insurance \ncompany accountants to continue to make medical decisions, and not \ndoctors and patients.\n  It is very interesting that 170 organizations that represent doctors, \npatients, and nurses support our program. And who supports the \nRepublican program? The insurance industry and the HMOs. Does that tell \nyou something? Does that tell you something? Mr. President, on this \nissue it tells us a great deal. This is not a question where we have \nsome ideas, and half the doctors in the country and half the patients' \norganizations say this is a better idea, and our colleagues on the \nother side have half of them, and people can say, ``Why don't you get \ntogether?''\n  They don't have them. They don't have them. They don't have the \nprincipal organizations. I will be glad to hear any organizations \nrepresenting health professionals or patients groups that they have.\n  We still haven't heard. I can't believe if you didn't have them, they \nwouldn't have them out there. We have them. They support our program. \nThey support the real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  But they do have the health insurance industry and they have the HMO \norganizations, the trade organizations that represent HMOs--they \nsupport their program.\n  Mr. President, we believe that patients with cancer and heart disease \nand other serious illnesses will not have timely access to specialists \nand the treatment they need. It immunizes managed care plans from \nliability for abuses that injure or even kill a patient. No other \nindustry in America has this immunity from any liability which the \nhealth insurance industry has and which is protected in the Republican \nprogram, and the managed care industry doesn't deserve it either.\n  Most of the minimal protections in the Republican leadership plan do \nnot even apply, as I mentioned, to the majority of Americans. Two-\nthirds of the people with private insurance, more than 100 million \nAmericans, will not benefit from the Senate Republican plan. The HMOs \nare effectively exempt from regulation under their plan because most of \ntheir standards apply only to employer-based, self-funded plans. Let me \nrepeat that. Most of the standards in the legislation do not even apply \nto the HMOs, only to employer-based, self-funded plans covering about a \nthird of privately insured Americans.\n  Even if the Senate Republican leadership plan was passed, 100 million \nAmericans would be left out. This is unacceptable to the American \npeople and should be unacceptable to the Senate.\n  The Senate leadership introduced their legislation on Friday. I \nreviewed\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\nthe print over the weekend, and the sum total of what is not in their \nplan at all is staggering. The fact that these minimal protections only \napply to a third of the people who need help is shocking. But the \ndisinformation campaign does not end there. Even the protections they \nclaim to have provided turn out, in most cases, to be less than half a \nloaf.\n  In my time, I have seen special interest protection programs \nmasquerading as consumer protection programs many times, but I have \nnever seen anything as indefensible as this. The Republican plan does \nnot include many key protections.\n  There is no provision to prevent health plans from arbitrarily \ninterfering with the decisions of the doctors.\n  There is no provision to guarantee access to necessary speciality \ncare.\n  There is no provision to allow individuals killed or injured by plan \nabuse to hold the plans liable.\n  There is no provision to allow participation in clinical trials.\n  There is no provision to allow access to prescription drugs not on a \nplan formulary.\n  There is no provision for continuity of care when an employer \nswitches plans.\n  There is no effective ban on plan practices which gag physicians; no \nlimits on improper incentive arrangements.\n  We were looking to address this issue of gagging the physician. They \nsay, ``Oh, yes, we have that; we have a provision that says we will not \ngag physicians.'' The problem is, unless you address the firing clauses \nof the HMOs that permit the heads of the HMOs to fire doctors whenever \nthey want, then the gag provisions are meaningless, because they can \nsay, ``OK, you can go out and talk all you like, but you're not coming \nin to work tomorrow.'' Let's get real on this, Mr. President. That is \neffectively what the Republican program does.\n  It has no prohibitions against these financial incentives for \ndoctors. It won't publish financial incentives for doctors so that the \npublic, in reviewing a plan, can find out if a doctor has financial \nincentives for providing certain kinds of treatment and not providing \nothers, which is happening today. We have given examples of those types \nof procedures. There are no protections for that.\n  It does not include a requirement for comparative plan quality \ninformation. You cannot find out about the consumers', the patients', \nsatisfaction. You can't find that out. If you ask to find that out, \nthey say, ``Well, that's going to be too bureaucratic; that is going to \nrequire too much paperwork; that is going to be a rule or regulation, \nit is going to be a Federal Government rule or regulation, that is \ngoing to raise costs for these particular programs.''\n  What we are talking about is patient satisfaction, patients staying \nin these programs: Are they satisfied with these programs? Good ones \nprovide that, Mr. President. These are the elements that are left out \nof the Republican plan entirely, but even those essentially included \nare full of loopholes.\n  The Republicans say they protect you if you need emergency room care, \nbut they have included less than half of the protections provided by \nthe Democratic plan or even the protections that are already included \nin Medicare. I wonder how many of our colleagues know that the \nprotection that they have indicated on the prudent layperson, prudent \nlayman standard is an entirely different one from the one that is in \nMedicare. Who would have known that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I know the Senator knows a great deal about this, but I \nwatched the press conference our Republican colleagues held hailing \ntheir Patients' Bill of Rights. You just went through and will continue \nto go through all the things they left out. I find it very curious the \nthings they say are in their bill, which, in fact, are not in their \nbill.\n  One, they say that a woman can pick as a primary care physician an \nob/gyn. Second, they advertise that this means you have access to the \nemergency room. Third, they talk about continuity of doctors so they \nsay you can choose your doctor. And fourth, they say no gag rule. This \nis the party of gag rule, and now they say no gag rule. I kind of \nrespected them when they were just flat out saying they were just \nagainst any of this.\n  Does the Senator have an explanation as to why they would pick the \nfour most often stated complaints of the American public and suggest \nthat their bill covers those things? It just seems strange to me that \nthe party of the gag rule says they want an antigag rule, and yet there \nstill is no antigag rule; that the party that said when they were going \nafter Clinton's health plan, you should be able to choose your own \ndoctor, will not allow you to choose a specialist or choose the doctor \nyou need; that the party that suggested the costs of the Clinton plan \nwere too high and everyone could just go to the emergency room are not, \nin fact, providing access to emergency room care the way in which the \nAmerican public is looking at it. Why did they pick these four things \nto say they were for and not any of the rest? Is there some strategy \nhere I am missing?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Those happen to be the ones that have shown the highest \nin the polls. I am not saying that is the reason they selected them \nnecessarily. As the Senator was going over them, I was writing them \ndown. Those are the ones that are the top in terms of the polls.\n  I say to the Senator, what I would like to ask him is, here the \nRepublicans talk about the market forces, that we ought to let people, \nconsumers, make judgments on the basis of information. Under our \nproposal, we have tried to have information so that people can make the \njudgment and decisions with regard to their health care plan. Patient \nsatisfaction, for example. Patient satisfaction--not very difficult. \nMost of the good ones show that in any event.\n  Absolutely not, they point out, and say: We are not going to provide \nor support any of that additional information because that is a \nbureaucratic ruling; it is going to cost the HMO more to require that; \ntherefore, we cannot support even that particular proposal.\n  But the Senator is quite right. They use these words, ``speciality \ncare,'' ``emergency room,'' and the ``gag rule.''\n  The spokesperson for the College of Emergency Physicians visited with \nus today. I think the Senator was there at the time. She reviewed \ninstance after instance after instance where just the words, ``the \nprotections of access to the emergency room,'' were vacant and empty \nand without the protections that are included in the Patients' Bill of \nRights and resulted, in one instance, in the loss of a leg of a young \nchild, the horrific condition of a young girl who had a serious \ndislocation and her vital signs dropped dramatically and was in real \ndanger of death, and other instances that were taking place in the \nemergency room.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Well, let me say to the Senator that I, quite frankly, \nadmired--disagreed, but admired--my Republican colleagues when they \nmade no bones about the fact that they did not want any interference in \nany way by the Government to do anything about HMOs. At least theirs \nwas a principled stand. They said, ``Look, the insurance companies, in \ndriving down costs, are more important than all these other factors. \nWe're not going to do anything.''\n  What bothers me--and this is me; you are not saying this, I know it, \nbut I am saying it--what bothers me is the apparent cynicism of picking \nfour items which most often my constituency speaks to, to say they are \ncovered, and nothing else. And even when you look into those four \nitems, they are not really covered.\n  They are going to be going around--and the insurance companies are \nspending tens of millions of dollars in ads--saying, ``We want you to \nhave the right to choose a doctor.''\n  Wait a minute. That is what they said before. But under the \nRepublican bill, the American people can't choose their doctor, if the \ndoctor they happen to need is a specialist, if the doctor they happen \nto need is in an emergency room and they don't meet the standard that \nthe HMO sets.\n  I have not been nearly as involved in this debate as my friend from \nMassachusetts. And as the old joke goes: He has forgotten more about \nhealth care than I am going to learn. But I would\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\nfeel better about what is going on here if the Republicans said what \nthey truly believe, ``Hey, look, we're not changing our position. We \ndon't think you should be able to choose your own doctor. We don't \nthink there should be an antigag rule. We don't think you should change \nthe requirements to get emergency room access. We don't think that a \nwoman should be able to choose her gynecologist as her primary \nphysician.''\n  Let me tell you what I think they figured out. I know of no wrath \nlike that of the wrath of a woman who says, ``I can't go to the doctor \nthat I need and trust the most.'' And so they seem to be yielding only \nin places--and only in part--where the loudest cries are coming from. \nBut, there are so many, many, many, many loopholes in what they say \nthey are doing, and so much they leave out.\n  I kind of yearn for the day when they just stood up on the floor like \nthey do on guns and say, ``Hey, look, guns are not bad. You know, guns \ndon't kill people. People kill people.'' I kind of like that. I admire \nit. But this, I don't know.\n  There will be a multimillion-dollar campaign we are all going to \nendure, and you do not have to be a rocket scientist to figure out \nwhere this is going before this is all over. And I expect I am going to \nhear your name mentioned a couple hundred thousand times before this is \nover, too. But at any rate, I thank you for answering my question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his interest and also his strong \nadvocacy in terms of the people in his State on this issue. We want you \nto know that we are still committed to trying to get something worked \nout. This matter is too important for the reasons that the Senator has \noutlined. We still want to try and get something worked out. We had \nbeen taking a long time before we could get even the recognition of a \nbill on the other side. Now we ought to go about what is in the best \ninterest of the patients in this country.\n  I just mention, finally, to the Senator, what I was just talking \nabout: Every doctors organization, every nurses organization, every \nhealth professional and patients organization supports our proposal. We \nhave not got a single one on the other side except the health insurance \ncompanies and the HMO plans on it. So we want to try and work this out. \nWe are going to do the best that we can. But we are not going to yield \nin terms of protecting the interests of the consumers.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I want to take just a few moments to review this very \nmoving testimony in terms of the emergency rooms. These are comments \nmade by Dr. Charlotte Yeh, who is the Chair of the Federal Government \nAffairs Committee for the American College of Emergency Physicians. And \nthese are comments that she made.\n\n       In Boston, a boy's leg was seriously injured in an auto \n     accident. At a nearby hospital, emergency doctors told the \n     parents he would need vascular surgery to save his leg and a \n     surgeon was ready and available in the hospital.\n       Unfortunately, for this young man, his insurer insisted he \n     be transferred to an ``in-network'' hospital for the surgery. \n     His parents were told if they allowed the operation to be \n     done anywhere else, they would be responsible for the bill. \n     They agreed to the move. Surgery was performed three hours \n     after the accident. But by then, it was too late to save his \n     leg.\n       These are not episodes from the TV program, ``ER.'' These \n     are not anecdotes. They are real people with real lives.\n       A bipartisan majority in the Congress has called for \n     enactment of standards that will put an end to episodes like \n     the ones I just described. Last year, the Congress adopted \n     the prudent layperson standard and other protections for \n     Medicare and Medicaid patients seeking emergency care. We \n     thought there was a consensus on this issue!\n\n  There was consensus on this issue, Mr. President.\n\n       Just a few weeks ago, we were delighted to see that \n     Republican Task Forces in both the House and Senate had \n     decided to include the ``prudent layperson'' standard in \n     their respective protection measures.\n       But we are very disturbed about the way in which the \n     emergency services protections were drafted in the Republican \n     ``Patient Protection Act.'' As a physician, it seems that a \n     little unnecessary surgery was performed on the ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard to the point where it is barely \n     recognizable as the consumer protection we envisioned.\n       What is the difference between the real ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard included in the ``Balanced Budget Act'' \n     and the Democratic ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' and the \n     ``imposture'' that has been included in the GOP ``Patient \n     Protection Act''?\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act would establish a weaker \n     coverage standard for privately insured patients than what \n     exists for Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n\n  It gets back to what they are talking about. The name of the \nlegislation--Senator Daschle--they take the various code words going \ndown the line. They took the ``prudent layperson'' definition, and then \nthey altered and changed it. These are the emergency physicians that I \nam reading from.\n  The GOP Patient Protection Act establishes a weaker coverage standard \nfor privately insured patients than for the Medicare and Medicaid \npatients. The Democratic bill will provide the same protections for all \npatients.\n\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act establishes a two-tiered \n     test for coverage of emergency services and guarantees \n     coverage only for a ``screening examination.''\n       The Democratic bill would require that health plans cover \n     all services necessary to evaluate and stabilize the patient \n     to anyone who meets the prudent layperson standard--no \n     questions asked!\n       The GOP Patient Protection Act sets no limits on the amount \n     of cost-sharing the managed care plans would be allowed to \n     charge patients who seek emergency services from a non-\n     network provider.\n\n  You get it? They have a prudent layperson. They further define it to \nmean less in terms of health care protections. And then they include \ncopays. So if they go there, they are going to have to pay up through \nthe nose for it.\n  Don't you think we ought to be able to discuss that on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, to see which way this body wants to go on that \nparticular protection for emergency rooms, for consumers of this \ncountry? No. We can't--evidently, no. No. We haven't got time. We \nhaven't got time to be able to ask our Republican friends, Why did you \ndo it this way? Why did you change it? Why did you change it?\n  Well, I think it is quite clear why they changed it, because the \ninsurance industry wanted them to change it. The GOP Patient Protection \nAct sets no limits on the cost-sharing.\n  The Democratic bill would protect patients who reasonably seek \nemergency services to protect their health from being charged \nunreasonable copays and deductibles.\n  We protect the consumer.\n  The GOP Patient Protection Act sets no guidelines for the \ncoordination of poststabilization care, making it possible for \nemergency physicians to coordinate and obtain authorization for \nnecessary follow-up care with the managed care plans.\n\n       The Democratic bill would require the health plans to \n     adhere to new Federal guidelines that require managed care \n     plans to be available to coordinate poststabilization care, \n     instead of just permitting the managed plan to turn off the \n     phone at 5 o'clock.\n       Obviously--\n\n  And I continue now with her statement:\n\n     we are very troubled by the changes to the ``prudent \n     layperson'' standard in the ``Patient Protection Act.''\n       Our assessment is that this legislation--\n\n  Now, these are the emergency room physicians. There isn't a family in \nthis country that does not have some concern--they have children or \nparents; loved ones--about the importance of having an emergency room \nthat is going to look after an emergency, that is going to affect the \nfamily. And there isn't a person that is listening to this program, \nwatching it, that has not had to spend time in an emergency room \nthemselves or their loved ones in a family.\n  It is very important. And what is happening out there with regard to \nHMOs, in too many instances, is that they are putting the interests of \nthe insurance industry ahead of the emergency needs of the \npatient. That isn't what I am saying, although it is what the emergency \nroom doctors are saying.\n\n  This is their final assessment:\n\n       Our assessment is that this legislation--\n       [1.] Will provide less protection for privately insured \n     patients than for Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n       [2.] Will lead to more coverage disputes, not less. [Do we \n     hear that--will lead to more coverage disputes, not less.]\n       [3.] Will create even more barriers, not fewer.\n       [4.] Will create new loopholes for managed care plans to \n     deny coverage of emergency services.\n\n  These are the doctors who are dedicated and committed to providing\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\nemergency services to the people. That is their assessment, and we are \nnot going to be permitted to debate and discuss the impact of the \nRepublican bill on the patients of this country as compared to our \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We are going to be denied that opportunity, \nMr. President?\n\n       In four years, we have come so far, but we cannot support \n     these provisions in their current form. We will do everything \n     in our power to ensure the ``prudent layperson'' standard \n     that is enacted will be consistent with the meaningful \n     protections that Congress enacted for Medicare and Medicaid \n     beneficiaries. Hard-working Americans who pay their premiums \n     deserve no less.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I will conclude in just a moment. I want to sum \nup where I think we are in this whole experience. During recent years, \nwe have seen a very dramatic shift from the indemnity health care \nprovisions to the HMOs. We have seen the ERISA provisions that were \ndeveloped in the early 1970s which exclude liability protections for \nAmerican consumers. Those particular provisions were developed to \nprotect pensions--it wasn't really thought about in terms of the \napplication of these provisions of the law in terms of health care \nplans. If you go back and read the discussion and the debate, it wasn't \nreally considered. It was there to protect pensions, and it has worked \nreasonably well to protect pensions.\n  It hasn't worked to protect the patients in these programs. \nNonetheless, we have seen the growth of the HMOs. And we have some \noutstanding health maintenance organizations. We have some of the best \nin my own State of Massachusetts. The basic concept behind the HMOs was \nto try to create the financial incentive for keeping people healthier \nso that the various health organizations would encourage the preventive \nhealth care measures, and by keeping people healthier, on what we call \na ``capitation'' program--that is, that the HMO gets a certain payment \nfor an individual; if they keep them healthier, then the HMO's \nfinancial situation improves. That made a good deal of sense.\n  In the better HMOs it works, and it works effectively. The problem is \nyou have many at the lower end that are reflecting the kinds of abuses \nwe have talked about here today. They have to be corrected. They should \nbe corrected.\n  Legislation has been introduced, and we have been excluded from the \nopportunity of having it scheduled. Now we have, finally, the \nRepublican leadership's provisions, which were introduced in the Senate \nlast Friday, and we still have no time that has been set aside.\n  When you look over the range of different provisions in this \nlegislation and the importance of this, we need to have a reasonable \nopportunity to debate and discuss these measures. The best we were able \nto get out of the Republican leadership initially was that, ``We are \nnot going to schedule what we don't want to schedule.'' That is what I \nheard on the floor of the U.S. Senate about 2 weeks ago. Then we heard \nthat, ``We are developing a program and will schedule this when we want \nto schedule it.'' Then we see the legislation that has been introduced. \nNow we are told, ``We may or may not get to that in the day or two \nbefore the designated recess.''\n  There is not a measure that affects families in this country that is \nmore important than the Patients' Bill of Rights. It deserves full \ndebate and discussion and thoughtful consideration. It deserves the \nbest judgment of all of the Members, and it deserves a bipartisan \nresolution at the end to try to see that we do something that is \nmeaningful to provide protections for families. What will be \nunacceptable is some kind of a toothless piece of legislation that \npicks up the buzzwords but fails to provide the protections for the \nAmerican people.\n  I hope we can get about the business of having this debate and having \nthis result. Every day we delay, we fail to protect our fellow \ncitizens. This issue is not one that is getting better; it is one which \ncries out for action. It cries out for action now.

I yield to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8881-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8886-S8887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague yielding for a moment. I sat \nhere and waited for awhile for my colleague from Massachusetts to \nspeak, and then the Senator from Delaware decided to speak. I wanted to \nmake a couple of comments concerning the health care legislation.\n  One, I regret maybe some of the tone of some of the debate that has \nbeen made. I am very interested in trying to come up with a reasonable \ntime agreement to take up this legislation. We have offered to do that. \nWe have offered to give a vote on both the Democrat and the Republican \nproposals. I understand my colleague wants more time. He probably would \nlike to spend a month on it. I heard him say it is the most important \nlegislation we have before the Senate. I think I heard him say the same \nthing about the tobacco legislation. We spent 4 weeks on tobacco \nlegislation, and we are not going to spend 4 weeks on this. The Senate \nis scheduled to be in session about 5 additional weeks, so we don't \nhave the luxury of time that maybe we have had in the past.\n  My colleague from Massachusetts made the comment and said we tried to \nbring this up 18 months ago. That is not correct. His bill was \nintroduced on March 31. Three days later, he was trying to pass a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution, saying we will pass it this year. We \nhave agreed to bring it up this year. We have agreed to give it \nadequate time for debate. We have not agreed to spend an unlimited \namount of time on this.\n  I want to respond to a couple of the statements that were made \nconcerning the Republican proposal. Much to my chagrin, I had hoped my \ncolleague, and colleagues on the other side, would try to find out what \nis good and maybe see where we can move forward, but instead he has \ntrashed our proposal. I resent that, or I regret it--I guess regret \nwould be the more proper terminology.\n  We have 49 cosponsors of this legislation. We had a task force that \nmet for months, 7 months, to formulate positive, constructive health \ncare legislation, legislation that would help alleviate some of the \nproblems in the health care industry, legislation that would help \nprotect those people who don't have protections in health care.\n  I heard my colleague say their plan only affects 48 million Americans \nand exempts two-thirds. That is absolutely not correct. The facts are, \nevery single ERISA-covered plan, every single employer-sponsored health \nplan in America would have an appeal process. It is a different process \nthan our colleagues on the Democrat side have followed, but for a good \nreason. We don't want to drive up health care costs.\n  What we want to do is make sure people who are denied health care \nwill have an appeal to where they can get health care--not that they \nhave to go to court to get a health care decision--so they can have an \nappeal through an outsider who has nothing whatever to do with their \ncase and have it be reviewed immediately or expeditiously if there is a \nserious health care problem. They can even have an outside appeal. We \nput in ``binding decision'' on the outside appeal. The decisions would \nbe binding. The plan would have to pay if someone said, ``Wait a \nminute. We thought we were waiting for coverage and we didn't get it.'' \nThey would have an internal appeal and an external appeal and that \napplies to every single employer-sponsored plan in America. We have \nheard different numbers. It is about 125 million Americans who would be \ncovered under those plans--every single one--unlike my colleagues' \nplan; I looked at his. I just want to say that it is the right to sue \nfor more. Under the Democrat bill, their idea is that we are going to \nget more health care by having more suits. We are going to sue people. \nYou can already sue a health care plan to get a covered service. They \nwant to sue for more.\n\n  In the Democrat proposal, they have 56 new causes of action where you \ncan sue. It would be an invitation for litigation, to not only sue the \nhealth care plan but to sue the employer as well. I have been in the \nprivate sector, I have been an employer, a small employer--maybe a \nlittle larger; I went from a few employees to 100 employees. If you \nmake employers liable for suits on health care plans, they will drop \nhealth\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\ncare plans very quickly and you will have an increase in the number of \nuninsured that will be in the millions. You will also have costs. CBO \nestimated that the Democrat bill would increase health care costs by 4 \npercent over what they are already estimated to cost, at 5.2 percent. \nThat is a 9.2 percent cost increase if we enact the Democrat bill. That \nwould cause millions of people to lose health insurance. I don't think \nthat is smart.\n  So I want to just make sure that our colleagues are aware of the fact \nthat we are willing to have a significant, credible debate. We are \nwilling to consider various alternatives. We are not willing to get an \nunlimited amount of time. Earlier, my colleague had offered his bill on \nan appropriations bill. I said it didn't belong there. Maybe we should \nhave left it there. We could have offered some substitutes.\n  One way or another, we are going to take up this issue. It is our \nintention to take it up prior to the August break. That is the majority \nleader's call. We understand that we have a lot of appropriations bills \nto do, and that must be done. I know my colleagues on the \nTransportation Committee are ready to go to work. I won't delay them \nmuch longer. We will have adequate time to debate the pros and cons of \nthis bill.\n  I heard some other allegations--that they don't do anything. The \nSenator from Delaware said, ``They have all this lip service. They \nprovide for emergency care, gag clauses, and access, direct access to \nOB/GYN and pediatricians, but that doesn't do anything.'' I disagree. \nWe protect the unprotected. We don't have the philosophy that we should \npreempt States who are, in many cases, doing a better job than the \nFederal Government. There is a presumption on the Democrat side that \nthe Federal Government can do it better than State government. Let's \nprotect the unprotected, cover the plans that don't have protections \noften by the State.\n  My State has 24 mandates. They have a lot of things that aren't in \nthe Democrat plan or Republican plan, and they are doing quite well. \nThey are considering many more. Most States are looking at the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, and 36 States have already enacted several \nothers, and 45 States already have a gag clause. Maybe some people \nthink Washington, DC, should decide what kind of communication should \nor should not be made by physicians, and so on.\n  My point is, I think we have tried to craft a very careful, balanced, \ngood proposal that won't escalate costs, that won't have undue \nmandates. The Democrat proposal has 359 mandates. Maybe instead of \ncalling it the Kennedy bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights, they should \ncall it the Kennedy bill of mandates, because it is this idea that the \nGovernment in Washington, DC, should dictate everything.\n  So I look forward to the debate. I look forward to resolving this \nissue and trying to come up with a good, responsible bill that won't \ndrive up health care costs, that won't add layers and layers of \nbureaucracy and regulation and red tape, that won't really deter \nquality health care.\n  Our bill, I might mention, has a lot of things to deal with improving \nquality health care. I compliment Senator Collins, Senator Frist, \nSenator Jeffords, and others who worked to put a lot of quality \nprovisions in this health care, whether you are dealing with women's \nhealth, or dealing with research, trying to get research out to States \nand rural areas that would really improve quality health care--not a \nFederal definition that we know best, but trying to really advance \ntechnology and get that information to patients, to various areas \naround the country that would actually improve the quality of health \ncare in America today.\n  I thank my colleagues who are managing this bill. I hope they will \nhave success in moving this bill forward. I look forward to the debate \nand, hopefully, a debate next week on the so-called Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to share some great news \nand to give thanks to the Members who helped me with respect to this \nvery emotional situation that we have dealt with. I want to share the \ngreat news that three young Vermont girls who were abducted to Egypt \nare now back. I want to thank 56 of my colleagues for their support in \nthis case for signing a letter to urge their return to Vermont. I also \nwant to thank the Egyptian and American Governments for their \ninvaluable assistance.\n  Last October, anticipating a Vermont court order giving his wife sole \ncustody of their three girls, Michael Zaazhoa took Sarah, Maryam and \nLeila under falsified passports and fled to Egypt. Lamis Zaazhoa began \nthe frantic search for her girls, ages 3, 5 and 6, which took 9 months, \nand culminated in a joyful reunion at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo this \npast Friday.\n  Lamis listened to the wise counsel of her family and decided to go \nthe long, anxious route of petitioning the Egyptian courts for sole \ncustody of her children under Egyptian law and getting an Egyptian \ncourt order for the return of her girls. The Vermont delegation quickly \nswung into action in support of her efforts, enlisting the help of the \nU.S. Embassy in Cairo and the Egyptian Embassy in Washington.\n  After the Egyptian courts ruled squarely in Lamis's favor, I walked \naround the Senate floor with a letter from Senator Leahy and me to \nPresident Mubarak of Egypt, asking for his support. Fifty-five of my \nColleagues signed this letter. I am deeply appreciative of my \nColleagues help, which I consider pivotal to the success of our \nefforts. And I am very grateful to the Egyptian Embassy and Egyptian \nGovernment for its help in ensuring that Egyptian law was enforced and \nthe girls were returned to their mother. The staff of the American \nEmbassy was there for us all along, and arranged the swift return to \nthe United States of Lamis and her girls once they were reunited.\n  I wish I could have invited all of my colleagues to the wonderful \nmeeting Senator Leahy and I had with these three sweet girls yesterday! \nTheir beautiful smiles and the joy on Lamis's face deeply touched the \nhearts of all those present. In difficult situations like these, we \nrely on the good offices of our Government, and the cooperation of our \nfriends in foreign governments. And yesterday we saw with our own eyes \nthe beautiful fruits of those efforts!\n  This is an unusual result. Many of these cases occur, but very, very \nfew are reconciled the way this was. I thank Jeff Munger of my staff in \nVermont, whose sister brought to his attention the plight of the \nchildren and spearheaded the results that we got. So, again, I thank \nall the Members for their helpfulness in getting the three little girls \nback to Vermont.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8887-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8887-S8891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2307, the transportation \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2307) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, in putting together the Fiscal Year 1999 \nTransportation Appropriations bill, we were faced with the difficulty \nof trying to adhere to the spending levels in the new highway and \ntransit authorization bill and still provide adequate levels of funding \nfor other transportation priorities. We have done that in this bill, \nand I think it represents a balanced approach to meeting our nation's \ntransportation needs. I want to thank the Chairman of the Committee on \nAppropriations Senator Stevens, for all his assistance and advice as we \nput this bill together and moved it through sub and full committee \nconsideration.\n  We have also worked diligently with the senior Senator from New \nJersey,\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\nSenator Lautenberg, the ranking minority member of the subcommittee on \ntransportation appropriations, and with the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Committee on Appropriations, Senator Byrd, to try to \naccommodate the requests of every Member of the Senate. No one got \neverything they asked for, but I think as Members look at the details \nof the bill, they will see that we did our best, with the limited \nresources we had, to accommodate everyone's request.\n\n  I want to outline just a few highlights of the bill, if I may.\n  The Airport Improvement Program is set at $2.1 billion for 1999, the \nhighest level ever. This funding will expand the capacity of our \nNation's airports, reduce delays and congestion, and, most importantly, \nit will improve aviation safety in America. As the demand for air \ntravel increases, we must ensure that our airports are able to \nefficiently handle traffic that will come with it.\n  Highway spending is also at the highest level in history--more than \n$27 billion. This funding will help States clear out their backlog of \noverdue highway construction and improvement projects. With more than \n40,000 American lives lost each year on our Nation's highways, we must \ndo everything to make them as safe as possible. Highway spending not \nonly improves safety but also will provide good jobs for thousands of \nAmericans.\n  I believe we have adequately funded both the Coast Guard and the \nFederal Aviation Administration operations accounts, and we have \nprovided increased flexibility for the Secretary to manage both \noperations accounts to meet air traffic control and drug interdiction \ndemands.\n  I am pleased that we were able to fully appropriate the authorized \nlevels for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That \nagency's funding in this bill represents an 8 percent increase over \nlast year and will aid in their efforts to conduct airbag research, \ndevelop automatic crash avoidance technologies, and increase seatbelt \nuse, and also reduce drunk driving on our highways.\n  The Federal Transit Administration will receive $5.365 billion, an 11 \npercent increase from 1998. These funds will be used to build new light \nrail transit systems, replace dilapidated public buses, and construct \nintermodal facilities to speed the transfer of people from one \ntransportation mode to another.\n  Regarding Amtrak, the bill provides an additional $555 million on top \nof the $1.1 billion Amtrak will receive from the Taxpayer Relief Act \nthat we passed last year.\n  My concerns about the level of Federal subsidies for Amtrak are well \nknown in this body. Since the railroad was created in 1971, Amtrak has \nreceived $21 billion in Federal support. That is an average of $750 \nmillion a year. Mr. President, that is a disproportionately high level \nof subsidy for a railroad that only serves 20 million intercity \npassengers every year. Mr. President, by way of comparison, 600 million \nAmericans fly every year. This means that more people fly in a 2-week \nperiod than ride Amtrak over the course of the year. The bill before \nyou this evening contains a provision requiring Amtrak to print the \nper-passenger subsidy on each Amtrak ticket sold. According to the GAO, \nAmtrak loses an average of $47 per passenger. I think the American \npeople have a right to know how their tax dollars are being spent.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me comment on the Project Labor agreement \nprovision. At full committee consideration of the transportation \nappropriations bill, the chairman requested that we postpone the debate \non this provision until the floor. I believe that the chairman's \nposition to postpone this debate until the floor made sense. And I know \nthat he has been working to resolve this issue in a fashion that will \nallow the transportation appropriations bill to move expeditiously \nthrough the Senate. I will continue to work with the chairman and with \nMembers on both sides of this issue to see if we can craft--and I \nbelieve we will be able to craft--a solution that is workable for \neveryone involved. The intent of the original language in the bill was \nto prohibit discrimination against any worker in this country simply \nbecause he or she chooses not to join a union.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of what we have been able to accomplish in \nthis bill. I believe it will benefit all Americans by improving \ntransportation services in this country. I look forward to working with \nthe members of the committee and the Members of the Senate to move this \nbill through the Senate.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am obviously pleased that the Senate has now turned \nto the consideration of the transportation appropriations bill. It has \nbeen some time in coming. And action on the transportation bill has \nbeen delayed for several weeks while the committee sought to resolve \nsome of the challenges that arise when there are vital interests needs \nto be met with too few resources to meet them.\n  Mr. President, I first ask unanimous consent that Peter Rogoff, a \nmember of my staff, be permitted privileges of the floor during the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it is always interesting, to me anyway, that when we \nget to something like transportation and we start talking about the \nnumbers and how much we are able to spend on highways and aviation, on \nbuses, and rail, whatever we do, we still fall short on this country's \nneeds for investment in infrastructure.\n  There isn't a Senator here who doesn't come to Senator Shelby or me \nduring the time of the negotiations looking for more opportunities to \ninvest in infrastructure. They want to get rid of the potholes, get rid \nof the obsolete bridges, update our system.\n  I know I speak for the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, \nwith whom I have the pleasure and opportunity to work--Senator Shelby \nand I have known each other for some time. He is a man with specific \nopinions on things. I could be described as a ``pussycat''--I don't \nthink so. But we have our differences out on the table, and we work to \nresolve them. There is one thing in this relationship, and that is \nmutual respect. I want to say today that Senator Shelby has not only \nexhibited patience but also a genuine interest in resolving issues, \ngetting rid of the problems, and getting on with the task. Between us, \nI think we have a pretty good piece of legislation.\n  For me, one of the greatest challenges that we faced in developing \nthis bill was finding the funds for Amtrak. Senator Shelby, as is his \nwont, spoke out about his views on Amtrak. But he has respect for \nothers' views--for those people who see Amtrak as an integral part of \nthe transportation system in this country, an essential part of the \nsystem.\n  While he is concerned about the amount of subsidy that Amtrak is \ngetting from the Federal Government, it is also bidding its way towards \nself-sufficiency. Until we have the proper kind of equipment that \nattracts riders, that can make the trip--and the trips are made in \nfaster times, particularly in the Northeast section, where in just the \nfew States that Amtrak goes through with probably 100 million people, \nit is a significant part of the population in the country. Yes, it \nrequires subsidy, but so does aviation.\n  We go beyond the ticket tax, which is significant. What we are saying \nto the people who ride in aviation is you pay a tax for this. We don't \nreally say that in similar terms with Amtrak. You pay a heavy tax when \nyou fly. The system is totally built by the taxpayer and local \ninterests when it comes to aviation. If Amtrak didn't operate, I would \nlike to point out that we would need 7,500 new flights a year on 757s \nto make up for the numbers of people who are carried on Amtrak.\n  We were able to fashion a compromise which was in this bill reported \nunanimously by the Appropriations Committee on July 14. It includes \n$555 million for Amtrak for the coming year, and as the chairman noted, \nthere is over $1 billion worth of funding; some of that in operating \nexpenses; some of that in capital expense, but it is $66 million less \nthan the level requested by the administration.\n  Now, we are on the verge--1999 is the year--of getting high-speed \nrail equipment in the Northeast corridor. And\n\n[[Page S8889]]\n\nfor the benefit of those who are listening not familiar with it, the \nNortheast corridor is that corridor of traffic between Washington here \nin the South, and Boston on the northern run, with New York and Newark \nas the intermediate points along the way.\n  Well, if we can get that ride down--and I think that we can--to less \nthan 2\\1/2\\ hours, I can tell you, Mr. President, I have been out at \nthe airport many times to take a flight that was advertised to be 40 \nand 45 minutes, and it has taken 3 hours. It is not because the \nairplane is so slow. It is that it's so crowded we can't get off the \nground. And sometimes I find when I land in the Newark area we have to \nwait 30, 40 minutes to get to a gate. We are straining at the seams. \nAnd if anybody rides the highways of America they know there is plenty \nof congestion. I don't care what State it is, you will find a place in \nthose States where highway congestion is unbearable, the air is foul, \nand we are consuming far more fuel than we ought to because we are \nbuilding a further dependence on the countries outside our shores that \nproduce it.\n  And so this investment in Amtrak is one that is going to be made to \nget us to be able to take delivery on the high-speed equipment which is \ndue next year, 1999.\n  I thank Senator Stevens, the chairman of the committee, and Senator \nByrd, the ranking member of the full committee, as well as, again, \nSenator Shelby, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, for \nhelping us to find an acceptable funding level for Amtrak, and I also \nthank them for their patience throughout the process.\n  The Transportation Subcommittee faced a real daunting challenge in \nconstructing a bill that kept faith with the promises included in the \nrecently enacted Transportation Equity Act. That is the transportation \nprogram for the next half dozen years for the 21st century. It is a \nbeginning into the 21st century, and with our infrastructure \ninvestment, as modest as it is, I can't say that it is one of America's \nproudest achievements because we are woefully underfunded, but it is a \ngood start in the 21st century and I am looking forward to building on \nthat.\n  The TEA 21, as it is referred to in acronym fashion, law authorized \nsubstantial increases in our surface transportation programs, and this \nappropriations bill includes a historic 15-percent increase for funding \nfor the Federal Highway Administration, and an 11-percent increase in \nfunding for the Federal Transit Administration. Separate from these \nwell-deserved increases in the surface transportation area, the bill \nseeks to meet, to the best of our ability, the needs of the FAA.\n  You heard me just reciting the fact that crowding in the air is not \nan insignificant factor. If you want to fly into the New York area, or \nyou want to fly into the Chicago area, the significant metropolitan \nhubs across our country, you have to share that space, and if the \nweather turns foul you wait forever. We could upgrade the system. There \nare other countries that have systems where takeoffs and landings are \ndone at zero visibility. It is done mechanically. The pilot has to be \nthere, but that airplane can touch down safely when you can't see the \nground. I know I have been in a couple of flights like that, and it is \nalways a shock when you don't see something and you feel that hard \nground beneath you.\n  That is what we ought to be doing. We have to invest more in all of \nour transportation modes and aviation as well. The Coast Guard is one \nincredible agency. We ask so much of the Coast Guard. We not only have \nthem out doing drug interdiction, which is a very popular part of their \nagenda, but if one looks at the marine system that we have in our \ncountry, the development of boating, fishing, the whole recreational \naspect of marine life is there because the Coast Guard manages it. They \nput out the buoy markers. I know sometimes I get lost out there, so I \ncan tell you that they are there. It is not that they have moved. It is \nthat I haven't been able to find them properly.\n  It is an incredible system. And on top of that, they do pollution \npatrol; they do a patrol to try to intercept illegal immigrants who \nwant to get to this great country of ours and are willing to risk their \nlives to do it, sometimes in tire tubes out in the ocean. The Coast \nGuard is there to provide interdiction, but also humanitarian service \nas well. And when it comes to rescues at sea, boy, there is nobody \nbetter than the Coast Guard. They know how to do it, and they are \ncalled on by everybody on every occasion. We just saw a ship fire, the \nCarnival Cruise Line ship in Florida. The ones I saw right there on the \nspot were the Coast Guard. They are always there. They need constant \ninvestment. I know one of the complaints in some of the northern areas \nis they don't have enough icebreaking equipment, for instance. We get \nit sometimes from the Defense Department.\n\n  So, when you put all these needs together, it is not an easy \nchallenge. I say, once again, Chairman Shelby and his staff, Wally \nBurnett, Reid Cavnar and Joyce Rose, do a terrific job, as well as the \npeople on my staff, Peter Rogoff and Liz O'Donoghue--I mentioned before \nPeter Neffenger--and Carole Geagley, for the job the staff has done.\n  The staff has worked very hard. I don't think it is realized outside \nthat by no means are these 9 to 5 jobs. Yes, they are. I am sorry. They \nare 9 at night to 5 the next morning. That is the kind of jobs they \nare. We give them time off to sleep, go home, meet their families, say \nhello to their newborns, get breakfast--the work requirement is beyond \ncomprehension, in many cases. But it gets done, and I am proud of what \nwe did this year.\n  Mr. President, as Members are aware, and the chairman brought it up, \nthe bill as reported by the Appropriations Committee contains an \nextremely controversial rider. It is something regarding Project Labor \nagreements. The provision effectively wanted to stop labor-management \nagreements that have served successfully for years to hold down \nconstruction costs and improve working conditions. Imagine--on those \noccasions, which are too few, where management and labor shake hands \nacross the table, no longer could they say, ``These are the conditions \nwe are going to be working under. This is what you can expect from us, \nand this is what you can expect from us; we are going to bridge our \ndifferences now, before this job starts. We are going to decide on \nthings like pay scales and work schedules and health care--all of those \nthings. We are going to decide together on the schedule that we want to \nmeet. We want to be proud of this job when it is finished.''\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee used a reference. He \nsaid in the Alaskan pipeline they had an agreement that saved billions \nof dollars, because everybody understood exactly what their \nresponsibilities were and there was no room for work stoppages or \nthings of that nature. It is a system that works. Why some people felt \nit was time to stop it, I don't understand. But I respect the \ndifferences that we have here.\n  The issue was discussed at length during full committee markup of the \nbill. As Senator Shelby noted, Chairman Stevens asked us to defer this \nuntil we get to the floor and get this bill out there so Senators can \nsee it and understand what we are doing. We did just that, and the \nresult is we have a compromise that Senator Stevens sought to develop \nthat would allow the bill to move forward and gain the President's \nsignature.\n  Senator Shelby and others involved, Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, and I, agreed this was a consensus with which we could \nlive. I am delighted that took place so we did not have to wrangle over \nit. We want to get this bill in place so when the new year starts, \nOctober 1, we are ready to go with the new spending levels and new \nprograms.\n  Once we have concluded our opening remarks, we are going to adopt the \nmanagers' amendment that encompasses a compromise on this issue, so all \nparties are agreed they will live with it. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir efforts in reaching this compromise.\n  In closing, I want to express my view that the most important funding \nin this bill is not for any individual project or any individual State. \nThe most important funding in the annual transportation appropriations \nbill is the taxpayers' dollars that we commit to maintaining safety \nthroughout our national transportation network.\n  Safety in the skies--we know we are crowded, we know we are busy, and \nwe\n\n[[Page S8890]]\n\nknow there is a terrific strain on the staff who maintain the aviation \nsystem, the controllers, those in the towers and those in the service \nroutes along the way. They do a terrific job. One need only look at the \naccident record, the number of people. Senator Shelby mentioned there \nare 600 million travelers a year. Look at that and thank the Lord, look \nat the accident record. You will see one of the nearly perfect systems \nthat one could imagine operating in our skies with all that volume.\n  We want the same thing on our roads. We want to reduce drunk, \ncareless driving. We would like to even reduce road rage. I don't know \nhow we do it. Sometimes we get into rage here, but we should be able to \ndo that.\n  Safety on our waterways--again, the Coast Guard is there marking out \nroutes. It is just a terrific facility that we have.\n  So, safety is the No. 1 priority of my agenda. It is the No. 1 \npriority for the Secretary of Transportation, Secretary Slater, and for \nthe President of the United States. He talks about it a lot. And \nSenator Shelby indicated he is interested in safety.\n  I am hoping one day we will be able to shore up our .08 blood alcohol \nlevel bill. We passed a bill that goes part of the way, but we have to \ngo further in order to make it complete. The worst thing that can \nhappen to a family is to lose a youngster, a young person, to an \nautomobile accident when we try so hard to bring them up, to raise them \nand encourage them, and then have somebody get in a car where someone \nhas been drinking too much and end their life.\n  We are focused on safety. We are going to do that. I cannot \noveremphasize the responsibility that every Senator has in ensuring our \ntransportation laws protect the safety of our traveling public to the \nmaximum extent possible. The fate of the traveling public is truly in \nour hands each and every day. During the up and coming debate we are \ngoing to discuss a number of amendments that are critically important \nto the safety of our constituents.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague. We are ready to \nconsider amendments and start with the managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey for his kind remarks, because we do work \ntogether on a lot of issues, not only in the Appropriations Committee \nbut also we both serve on the Intelligence Committee and spend a lot of \ntime generally behind closed doors. He is an active member of that \ncommittee, too.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3324\n\n          (Purpose: An amendment on the part of the managers.)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for himself and Mr. \n     Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 3324.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 19 of the bill in line 2, strike ``: Provided, That \n     $3,000,000 shall be transferred to the Appalachian Regional \n     Commission''.\n       On page 26 of the bill, line 15, insert the following \n     before the period: ``Provided further, That of the funds \n     provided under this heading, $5,000,000 shall be made \n     available for grants authorized under title 49 United States \n     Code section 22301''.\n       On page 20 of the bill, in line 17, after the colon, \n     insert: ``Provided further, That within the $20,000,000 made \n     available for refuge roads in fiscal year 1999 by section 204 \n     of title 23, United States Code, as amended, $700,000 shall \n     be made available to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \n     determine the feasibility of providing reliable access \n     connecting King Cove and Cold Bay, Alaska and $1,500,000 \n     shall be made available for improvements to the Crooked Creek \n     access road in the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife \n     Refuge, Montana:''.\n       On page 28 of the bill, amend the figure in line 5 to read \n     ``7,500,000''.\n       On page 44 of the bill, insert at the beginning of line 1 \n     the following: ``New York City NY Midtown west ferry \n     terminal''.\n       On page 51 of the bill, insert after line 19 the following: \n     ``Whittier, AK intermodal facility and pedestrian overpass''.\n       On pages 86 and 87 of the bill, strike all of section 336 \n     (lines 16-24 and lines 1-10).\n       On page 88 of the bill, in line 18, after the semicolon \n     insert the following:\n       (3) in subsection (d), by inserting ``(including an \n     exemption under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) relating to a bumper \n     standard referred to in subsection (b)(1))'' after \n     ``subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section''; and.\n       And on page 88 of the bill, in line 19, amend the ``(3)'' \n     subsection number to read ``(4)''.\n       On page 90 of the bill, in line 1, after the semicolon \n     insert the following: ``$3,500,000 is provided for the \n     Providence-Boston commuter rail project;''.\n       On page 92 of the bill, after line 25, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 351. Item 1132 in section 1602 of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century (112 Stat. 298), relating to \n     Mississippi, is amended by striking ``Pirate Cove'' and \n     inserting ``Pirates' Cove and 4-lane connector to Mississippi \n     Highway 468''.\n       On page 78 of the bill, strike lines 8-15, and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 322.

Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle. I think it makes sense and will allow us to move \nforward with the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If there is no objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3324) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would just like to tell my colleagues in \nthe Senate, some of them are here on the floor and in their offices, \nSenator Lautenberg and I are ready to move this bill toward third \nreading. We haven't heard from anyone. We will give a few more minutes \nin case somebody wants to get in, or offer an amendment to this bill, \nbut we believe this is a well put together bill, as I said earlier. \nBoth sides have put a lot of work into it. We should not keep Senators \nhere all evening. We will move as soon as we can.\n  If we don't hear from somebody on the floor in just a few minutes, it \nis my idea, if Senator Lautenberg concurs at that time, to move to \nthird reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I might, I knew we constructed a good bill. I \ndidn't realize it was this good. But the fact of the matter is I guess \nwe covered everybody's requests fully. But we should wait to see if any \nof our colleagues want to come down to the floor and commend us for it.\n  Otherwise, I think we are seriously ready to go. I am feeling a \nlittle light-headed because we haven't heard a lot of criticism. But \nthe bill is here. If there are people who want to amend it in any way, \nlet them come down now or forever hold their peace, or something.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BENNETT). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fellow \nin Senator Bingaman's office, Mr. Dan Alpert, be given floor privileges \nduring the pendency of the transportation appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8891]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I rise today to call to the attention \nof colleagues a disturbing set of circumstances and facts which I \nbelieve merit investigation and probably legislative action on the part \nof the Senate. I also believe that the facts I am about to discuss \nwarrant more attention than they have received so far from the Justice \nDepartment.\n  There is evidence of significant violation of Federal law leading to \ngreat harm. I hope that in addition to the Congress responding \nappropriately, the Justice Department might look further into this \nmatter.\n  I am referring to what appears to be a record of widespread \nsystematic cheating on occupational air quality tests by operators of \nmany of our Nation's coal mines. This alleged cheating, of which there \nappears to be nearly incontrovertible evidence, apparently has led to \nmuch unnecessary suffering in thousands of American families. It likely \nalso has led to the unnecessary death from black lung disease of \nthousands of American coal miners.\n\n  Unfortunately, I am not referring to conditions that existed early in \nthis century, or even conditions of the 1950s or 1960s. I'm talking \nabout circumstances of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. I'm talking about \nallegations related to existing conditions and practices in American \ncoal mines today.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have printed in the Record \na series of articles that appeared in April of this year in the \nLouisville Courier-Journal.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            From the Editor\n\n       For years, a quiet but deadly tragedy has been played out \n     in the nation's underground coal mines.\n       Coal mine operators have known about it.\n       The federal government has known about it.\n       And coal miners themselves have known about it.\n       The tragedy is that in 1998 black-lung disease still exists \n     and hundreds of miners nationwide die of the disease each \n     year because of cheating on air-quality tests.\n       Doctors have known for a century that coal dust causes \n     black lung, which can be prevented through underground dust-\n     control measures.\n       But 30 years after Congress placed strict limits on \n     airborne dust and ordered mine operators to take periodic \n     tests inside their mines, almost 1,500 miners die of black \n     lung every year.\n       The Courier-Journal set out to find out why.\n       The answers were shocking.\n       In a year-long investigation that involved interviews with \n     255 working and retired miners and computer analysis of more \n     than 7 million government records, The Courier-Journal found \n     that, among other things:\n       Miners continue to breathe dangerous levels of coal dust \n     because cheating on dust tests is rampant.\n       Most coal mines send the government air samples with so \n     little dust that experts say they must be fraudulent.\n       Many mine operators--non-union mine operators in \n     particular--don't comply because strict adherence to safety \n     regulations is time-consuming, costly and cuts into profits.\n       The federal agency responsible for protecting miners \n     ignored overwhelming evidence of cheating.\n       Nearly every miner interviewed said that cheating on dust \n     tests is common and that many miners help operators falsify \n     tests to protect their jobs.\n       And almost no coal miners qualify for black-lung benefits \n     under Kentucky's new workers' compensation law.\n       Since publication of the series, Kentucky's attorney \n     general has asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to \n     investigate why mine-safety officials have ignored evidence \n     of cheating. And state lawmakers have called for a special \n     session to adopt new legislation on workers' compensation.\n       This reprint includes the entire five-day series, \n     supporting editorials, followups and a guest column by the \n     top mine-safety official.\n       We think this piece of work represents outstanding public \n     service journalism in the finest tradition of The Courier-\n     Journal.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is the newspaper of Louisville, KY.\n  This remarkable series of five articles, principally by a reporter \nnamed Gardiner Harris, is titled ``Dust, Deception and Death.'' The \nseries documents an apparent pattern of falsification of coal dust \nsampling tests by coal mine operators and it details the consequences \nof that dishonesty: unnecessary suffering and early death for American \ncoal miners.\n  It is an extraordinary report. I do not believe it has received \nenough attention, although hearings have been taking place at the state \nlevel in Kentucky to look into the charges.\n  The paper conducted a year-long investigation. Hundreds of current \nand former miners were interviewed. More than 7 million government \nrecords were examined. Based on that research, the Courier-Journal's \nreporters concluded that cheating on air-quality tests in coal mines \nhas contributed to great suffering and to a large number of deaths from \nblack lung disease among American coal miners. Their reporting reveals \nthat the Federal Government, at least until very recently, largely \nignored readily observable indications of that cheating.\n  I do not draw absolute conclusions at this time from what is reported \nin the Courier-Journal. But I can say that what is reported in this \nseries is consistent with what I saw and heard when I visited with \nminers in Eastern Kentucky a year ago. I was told then that cheating \ngoes on in the dust sampling program in American coal mines. And I \nheard from sick and dying miners and their families about the \nconnection between coal-mine conditions and black lung disease--\nespecially in non-union mines.\n  We in the Federal Government have a responsibility to these workers \nand their families. At the end of my statement, I will make some \nsuggestions regarding actions I believe we should take in the Senate. \nAnd I hope that colleagues, as they become more aware of this \nsituation, might add to those suggestions and help determine the most \nappropriate response to what I believe is a national shame.\n  The initial shame is that the suffering and death of thousands of \nAmericans appears to be the direct result of systematic cheating on a \ngovernment-monitored health-protection program. The deeper shame is \nthat we in the Federal Government have had the opportunity to know it, \nyet so far we haven't done very much about it. Dedicated people in the \nappropriate Federal agency, the Mine Safety and Health Administration \n(MSHA), are beginning to address this problem. J. Davitt McAteer, who \nis the Assistant Secretary for MSHA, has begun during recent years to \ntake a number of steps, and he has called for further steps beyond \nthose he has taken. But we still are not doing enough.\n  Before I cite some details from the series, I would like to read a \nportion of the newspaper's editorial on this subject into the Record. \nThis Louisville Courier-Journal editorial, printed on Sunday, April 19, \nis headlined, ``Death and Denial.'' It begins as follows:\n\n       Coal is an outlaw industry. It is now, and it always has \n     been. Coal is the closest thing to brute, unrepentant late \n     19th Century capitalism that we have left in American life. \n     If you don't believe that, just consider the fact that ranks \n     of miners choke to death every year because coal operators \n     routinely cheat. They cheat on air-quality tests which could \n     save lives. When they do that, they cheat workers of the \n     years they would be able to spend with families and friends \n     but for an early death from black lung. And this grotesque \n     disease continues as the principal killer of coal miners, \n     just as it has been for a half-century.\n\n  That is not the conclusion of some outside group of hostile critics \nof the coal industry. It is the editorial position of a major newspaper \nin the state of Kentucky, where that industry remains important to the \neconomy. Let me recite the conclusion of that same editorial: ``One-\nthird of all the nation's underground mines get cited for excessive \ndust. And those are just the operations that are caught in the flawed, \nsporadic dust tests. Miners are more than exhausted with this \ncontinuing outrage. They're dying.''\n  Mr. President, every article in this series warrants reading in its \nentirety. There are some sad and shocking quotes from former foremen in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\nmines, as well as from miners themselves about their own roles in test \nfalsification. There are heartbreaking profiles that illustrate the \nhuman consequences of this reality. Men who are suffocating to death, \nwhose lungs are destroyed, who cannot even crawl up two steps at their \nhome without stopping and gasping for breath. I hope Senators will read \nthe story of Leslie Blevins, 45-year old former coal miner who is dying \nof silicosis, a form of black lung. I hope Senators will read the story \nof Terry Howard and his family. Terry died in 1995 of black lung \ndisease. He was 45.\n  Let me try to summarize some of the series' important findings.\n  The first and most important conclusion of the series is that coal \nminers today continue to breathe hazardous amounts of coal dust because \nfalsification of dust sampling is still widespread. In 1972, strict \ndust limits in coal mines went into effect. That was a result of the \n1969 Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act. Today, under that Act, \nevery two months, operators of underground coal mines have to test the \nair in the mines for dust. They use air pump machines attached to \ncertain of the miners' belts to collect air samples. Then government \nlaboratories weigh the amount of dust collected in those machines' \nplastic cassettes. Also, in addition to weighing the dust cassettes \nonce they have been turned in, Federal government supervisors actually \noversee the company-conducted testing on one occasion per year.\n  How is the Federal dust-sampling program working? Not very well. In \nfact, the dust-sampling program, crucial as it is, today is a big part \nof the problem. Numerous miners, former mine owners and managers told \nthe Courier-Journal that the sampling is routinely falsified. ``Most of \nthe time, we just turn them off,'' one miner said of the machines. Many \nminers described how the pumps often were hung where the air was clear \nof dust, or placed in lunch buckets. Some are run outside the mines or \nnot at all.\n  According to the newspaper's reporting, in 1997, at about half the \nnation's underground coal mines, at least 15 percent of the air samples \ntaken were almost completely dust-free. It is virtually impossible for \nthose tests to have been accurate, according to experts. Assistant \nSecretary McAteer, who I believe is an honorable man and is moving in \nthe right direction in addressing the problem, told the paper that \nthese samples are ``inaccurate,'' ``unfathomable,'' and ``statistically \nimpossible.'' In other words, Assistant Secretary McAteer was saying \nthat those results were not accurate. They could not have been \naccurate. They indicated cheating. That was in 1997.\n  Cheating is reprehensible, of course. But what matters even more is \nthe reason for the cheating. The paper's reporting provides compelling \nevidence that this widespread cheating is for the purpose of covering \nup the existence of severely hazardous conditions--dusty conditions \nwhich exceed federally allowable levels and which are still causing \nblack lung disease today. How can that be, one might ask? We put the \nlaw in place. We have an agency devoted to enforcing it. Surely the \nmine operating companies are not interested in endangering their \nworkers. And yet they do.\n  It appears from the evidence that mine operators don't comply with \nthe Federal dust-sampling program mainly because it would cost them \ntime and money to do so. It is a sad and maddening observation, but it \nappears to be true. Furthermore, it apparently also is the case that \nthe coal mine operating companies do not comply with the Federal dust \nsampling program today because up to this point they have had little to \nfear from the Federal Government when they cheat. Even when convictions \nhave been obtained in cases of falsification of dust tests, penalties \nseem to have been light.\n\n  So far, the Federal Government has not been up to the job of \nprotecting miners' health. MSHA appears over a period of years to have \nlargely ignored readily available evidence that cheating was occurring. \nThey are not ignoring it now, although I believe we need to make sure \nthey are doing everything that is possible to do. Penalties for \nviolations, as well as investigations and prosecutions, have been a \nlargely ineffective deterrent. One-third of the mines are cited for \ndust-level violations, but the fines are generally small. For years \naverage fines were about $100, and even now the average fine is just a \nfew hundred dollars. Those are for the violations which are caught--\ninstances where the measurable dust exceeded allowable levels. The kind \nof cheating which is documented in the Louisville series, which is a \nseparate issue, has gone largely unpunished because it has gone largely \nuncaught. Furthermore, even after miners have contracted one or more of \nthe diseases which are known collectively as black lung disease, few \nare able to qualify for government benefits intended to relieve their \nplight.\n  The most important information in this series of articles is not only \nthat American miners continue to suffer and die from black lung disease \ntoday. Many Senators are aware that, whereas we pledged as a nation to \neliminate black lung disease 28 years ago, we still have not \naccomplished that goal. The Federal Government pays approximately $1 \nbillion annually for programs directly related to black lung diseases. \nStates pay worker's compensation health benefits to miners with black \nlung disease. So we know that thousands of Americans suffer from black \nlung disease. The important information in this series, however, which \nwould have been new and surprising to me had I not visited with coal \nminers in Eastern Kentucky last year, is information which I think \nshould shock Members of the Senate. That information is that it appears \nthat the cheating on air-quality testing by coal mine operators, the \nfalsification of coal dust sampling tests, continues to go on today on \na widespread scale. That--if true, and it appears to be--is what we \nmust acknowledge is a national disgrace.\n  What does this mean? It means that the cause of future suffering and \ndying is going on, unabated, in today's coal mines. Right now, today. \nWe can talk about responsibility and accountability for dishonesty in \nthe past, which has led to today's suffering. We should. We should \ninvestigate it thoroughly, and if federal laws have been broken, then \nwe should prosecute. But if false sampling continues today, and if we \nallow it to go on, then we in the Senate are failing in our \nresponsibility to protect thousands of American coal miners from \nserious health hazards while they are on the job. We literally would be \nencouraging through our inaction the continued exposure of miners to \nconditions and practices that we have every indication will condemn \nthousands of them to suffering and early death. We are responsible. We \ncannot allow coal operators to cause avoidable suffering and death. I \nsay avoidable because suffering and death from black lung disease is \navoidable. Coal can be mined profitably without subjecting miners to \ndirty conditions that will give them black lung disease.\n  Mr. President, we may not solve this problem during the remainder of \nthis Congress. It will probably not be a simple matter, and we have \nonly a few remaining legislative weeks. It cannot be solved overnight, \neven though every day that cheating occurs American miners are exposed \nto deadly levels of black-lung-causing coal dust. Nonetheless, we can \ndo some things immediately. We should.\n  We should hold at least an initial hearing on the subject of the \neffectiveness, or the lack of effectiveness, of current Federal \nmeasures to eliminate black lung disease. Such a hearing should include \ntestimony regarding the voluminous evidence presented in the Louisville \nCourier-Journal series indicating widespread cheating on dust sampling \ntests. It might take more than one hearing to get to the bottom of the \nproblem, not to mention the best solutions to it. But there should be a \nhearing, and I have directed a request for such a hearing to the \nChairman of the Labor Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety, Senator \nFrist, as well as to that Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Senator \nKennedy. We need to call attention to the issue, and we need to send a \nsignal to American miners and their families that we will meet our \nresponsibility to learn the truth and protect their health and safety.\n  Second, we need to ensure that MSHA has sufficient resources to carry \nout more of their own dust sampling, as well as more monitoring of \ntests conducted by the coal mine operators. I hope when we consider the \nLabor-\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\nHHS Appropriations bill that we will provide adequate funding to MSHA \nto do more testing. The companies have shown that they will not carry \nout accurate tests. At the same time, I do not believe that we should \nsimply increase our own Federal spending and testing, and meanwhile \ntake the companies off the hook. The companies should continue to test, \nas well, and they must be held thoroughly accountable for their \nresults. A more rigorous testing and monitoring program by MSHA would \nboth improve the reliability of the test results, and it would also \nhelp us identify more of the individuals and companies that are \ncheating on the tests and endangering the health of miners.\n  MSHA already has increased its spot-inspections of mines that have \nturned in tests with suspiciously low dust levels. The agency should go \nfurther, and they should have the resources to ensure they are able to \ngo further. I believe Federal enforcement agencies should consider \nwhether increased criminal and civil prosecution is warranted for what \nappears to be the systematic circumvention of the Mine Safety Act. By \nenforcement agencies I am referring to MSHA and the Department of \nJustice.\n  The number of criminal prosecutions has been low if the claims \nasserted in the Louisville newspaper series are correct. Between 1980 \nand early 1997, there were only 96 cases in which criminal charges were \nsuccessfully brought by the Federal government for violations in the \narea of coal mine safety and health. That is 96 cases over a 16 year \nperiod, or about six a year. It is my understanding that very few, if \nany, even of that small number of successful prosecutions were for the \nkind of cheating documented in the newspaper series. If cheating on \ndust sampling, which endangers people's lives, is as widespread as has \nbeen alleged, then I believe current Justice Department prosecution has \nbeen less than it should be. I do not know if the problem has been at \nMSHA, or if the problem has been at the Department of Justice. It may \nbe difficult to prove this cheating. It may be difficult to get miners \nto testify. But if what the series portrays is true, then we are simply \nnot doing a good job of deterring these illegal practices--practices \nwhich are causing illness and death.\n  Finally, the Secretary of Labor last year proposed new rules \ngoverning implementation of the Black Lung Benefits Act--rules which to \nmy knowledge still have not taken effect. This set of proposed \nrevisions to the Black Lung Benefits Act is sound, justified and \nneeded. It should be implemented. Only about 7.5 percent of Black Lung \nclaims have been granted since the early 1980s, with nearly one-third \nof claims tied up in lengthy hearing and appeals processes. Litigation \nconsumes almost half of the Black Lung Trust Fund's administrative \nexpenses. The Department of Labor's new rules were published in the \nFederal Register in January of last year, and they should be put into \neffect.\n  Mr. President, I will return to the floor to speak further about this \nissue before the year is over. I hope we can conduct a hearing in the \nLabor Committee. I hope we will provide adequate appropriations for the \nMines Safety and Health Administration. And I hope we will do right for \nthe safety and health of American miners. I intend to do all I can as a \nUnited States Senator to see that we do so. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8891-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8893-S8909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have notified all Members that we would \nlike to complete action on the transportation appropriations bill. I \nbelieve our managers are ready to move in that direction.\n  We have a list of amendments now that have been identified.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be the only \nfirst-degree amendments in order to the pending transportation bill, \nand subject to relevant second-degree amendments:\n  Managers' amendments; Senator Lott, three relevant amendments; \nSenator Shelby, three relevant amendments; Senator Frist, regarding \ncemeteries; Senator Abraham, regarding name change, ITS; Senator \nSpecter, regarding bond issue; Senator DeWine, regarding Coast Guard; \nSenator McConnell, regarding expedited review; Senator McCain, \nregarding Amtrak bookkeeping; Senator Leahy, regarding helicopters; \nSenator Byrd, two relevant amendments; Senator Levin, regarding \ncommuter rail; Senator Bumpers, relevant; Senator Lautenberg, relevant \nin three instances; Senator Daschle, three relevant amendments; Senator \nKerry, one amendment on Amtrak; Senator Feingold, relevant amendment; \nSenator Johnson, two relevant amendments; and Senator Durbin, regarding \nsmoking on international flights.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And Gramm on drugs.\n  Mr. LOTT. And one last, Senator Gramm possibly, one amendment \nregarding Coast Guard.\n  Mr. President, we deleted the Feingold relevant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, while we have leadership on the floor, \nwe have heard the list. That is now confined. I think we ought to get \non with the business of getting it done. We could wrap this bill up in \nshort order. There is a full agenda. The majority leader holds out a \nplum at the end of the ladder. The plum swings a week from Friday. This \nhelps reach that goal.\n  I ask my colleagues if they want to get out of here on Friday--I know \nmost of them would like to stay, but you will have to put up with us in \ngetting out early.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the managers of this legislation. Senators Shelby \nand Lautenberg are on the verge of setting a very commendable record. I \nask that they quickly go through this list of amendments and dispose of \nthem and, as soon as possible, identify any needed votes, get a time \nagreement on those votes, and get it done as quickly as possible. It \nwould help us be prepared to move on to other appropriations bills and \nbe able to get out of here as scheduled next Friday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know the hour is beginning to get late and Members would \nlike to know what they can expect tonight. We do have a list of \namendments that the managers are working on right now. I believe most \nof those are going to be resolved without the necessity of extended \ndebate, or even a vote. We should know in another 15 minutes or so \nexactly what that would be. I hope there won't be more than one or two \namendments that require some time.\n  Our intent would be to do those amendments that are necessary and \nfinal passage, and then Senator Daschle and I would like to go to the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill. Senator Coats and Senator \nLieberman have an amendment that they are prepared to debate tonight, \ndiscuss tonight, and we hope to have all debate on that and other \namendments, but the vote on the amendments and final passage we would \npropose would be done then Monday night at 5 o'clock in order to \naccommodate one of the managers.\n  Tomorrow, while we will have a vote or two early in the morning, we \nwill go to the credit union bill early in the morning. There are not \nexpected to be\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nany recorded votes on the credit union bill in the morning.\n  So in summation, if we could get cooperation on the transportation \nbill, we could wrap that up here relatively shortly and that would be \nthe final vote tonight, if the Members would cooperate with us.\n  Senator Daschle has been working to get this amendment list \nidentified. He agrees that this would be a good approach. The Members \nwould have a decent night tonight, and we would be able to wrap up \nearly in the morning and then go to the credit union bill.\n  I ask Senator Daschle if that is his thinking on this process at this \ntime.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senators on both sides for \nthe cooperation that they have given on transportation, as well as on \nthe District of Columbia. I think we can accommodate Senators' \nschedules and the need to pass these two bills in an appropriate time \nby taking the actions the majority leader has outlined.\n  So I think this is a plan that will still require some cooperation \nand support on both sides of the aisle, but I think we can do it. I \nthink it is the best way with which to accommodate schedules as well as \nthe need to address these issues soon. So I certainly commend the \nmajority leader for the recommendations and the proposal, and I hope we \ncan complete our work.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor. I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we are working together, Senator \nLautenberg and I, and our staffs. We are close to resolving a number of \namendments here, but there are some amendments that will require votes. \nI just ask the sponsors to come on down to the floor because we are \nprobably going to have to have some votes on them: The McConnell \namendment regarding expedited review, the McCain amendment regarding \nAmtrak bookkeeping, the Leahy amendment regarding helicopters, the \nKerry amendment regarding Amtrak, and the Durbin amendment, smoking on \ninternational flights.\n  It is just a few minutes before 7. Senator Lautenberg and I are ready \nto move. If Members who are sponsoring those amendments would come on \ndown and help us, I think it would expedite the bill tonight.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I understand that the majority leader, \nthe leadership has agreed we are going to finish this bill tonight?\n  Mr. SHELBY. That is right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It becomes a matter of Members' choice; you either \nfinish it late or you finish it early. I am not dismissing the \nimportance of anybody's amendment, but now is the time to do it. If it \nis not important enough to get over here and do it, I think we will try \nto expedite things, if the majority leader and minority leader agree, \nto get to a third reading. We have a couple of things we can do. We \nshould do them. We are now looking at the possibility of clearing some.\n  So until then, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3326.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 92, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3____. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) Expedited Consideration.--It shall be the duty of a \n     district court of the United States and the Supreme Court of \n     the United States to advance on the docket and to expedite to \n     the maximum extent practicable the disposition of any claim \n     challenging the constitutionality of section 1101(b) of the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (23 U.S.C. 101 \n     note; 112 Stat. 113), whether on its face or as applied.\n       (b) Appeal to Supreme Court.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, any order of a district court of the United States \n     disposing of a claim described in subsection (a) shall be \n     reviewable by appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the \n     United States.\n       (2) Deadlines for appeal.--\n       (A) Notice of appeal.--Any appeal under paragraph (1) shall \n     be taken by a notice of appeal filed within 10 calendar days \n     after the date on which the order of the district court is \n     entered.\n       (B) Jurisdictional statement.--The jurisdictional statement \n     shall be filed within 30 calendar days after the date on \n     which the order of the district court is entered.\n       (3) Stays.--No stay of an order described in paragraph (1) \n     shall be issued by a single Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       (c) Applicability.--Subsections (a) and (b) shall apply \n     with respect to any claim filed after June 9, 1998, but \n     before June 10, 1999.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I have sent to the desk \nsimply says that the courts should tell us once and for all whether the \nDBE Program in the new ISTEA law is constitutional.\n  The new ISTEA law, now referred to as the Transportation Equity Act \nfor the 21st Century, or TEA 21 for short, contains the much debated \nand long discussed DBE Program.\n  As every Senator knows, and as the Supreme Court has made clear, this \nGovernment-mandated program requires States and private contractors to \ntreat persons differently based on race. The DBE Program, at a minimum, \ngrants benefits and presumptions to some persons based on race and \nethnicity but denies the same benefits and presumptions to others based \non race and ethnicity.\n  Now, some say that the preferences are vast and pervasive, while \nothers say preferences are only slight and incremental. Some say that \npreferences are unfair. Others say that any burdens placed on persons \nof the wrong race are far outweighed by the benefits for the citizens \nof the ``officially preferred'' race.\n  Mr. President, my views on this issue are well known and well \ndocumented in the Congressional Record. But the policy debate over TEA \n21 and the DBE Program is over for now. We have moved beyond that \npolicy debate for the moment. The only thing that the Senate can do \ntoday is to ensure the constitutionality of the DBE Program mandated in \nTEA 21. That is precisely what my amendment does.\n  Mr. President, when the topic is racial preferences, it is rare that \nboth parties can find any agreement. But I think today is that rare \nmoment. I think there are several areas of agreement today that should \nlead to unanimous approval of my amendment.\n  First, I think we all agree that the Supreme Court has acknowledged \nthat racial preference programs subject persons to unequal treatment \nunder the law.\n  In landmark Supreme Court cases, like Adarand v. Pena, and City of \nRichmond v. Croson, the Court made it clear that programs doling out \ndifferent presumptions, benefits, and burdens based on race, in fact, \nsubject Americans to unequal treatment under the law.\n  In the words of the Supreme Court:\n\n       Whenever the government treats any person unequally because \n     of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that \n     falls squarely within the language and the spirit of the \n     Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.\n\n  Moreover, the Court explained:\n\n       We deal here with a classification based upon the race of \n     the participants, which must be viewed in light of the \n     historical fact that the central purpose of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating \n     from official sources in the States. This strong policy \n     renders racial classifications ``constitutionally suspect,'' \n     and subject to the ``most rigid scrutiny,'' and ``in most \n     circumstances irrelevant'' to any constitutionally acceptable \n     legislative purpose.\n\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\n\n  So, Mr. President, out of the mouth of the highest court in the land \nwe hear our first undisputed fact: Programs like the DBE Program \nsubject Americans to unequal treatment under the law.\n  Our second undisputed fact is that the Supreme Court will only \ntolerate such unequal treatment if the program can survive the test of \nstrict scrutiny. That is, is the program, first, narrowly tailored; \nsecond, to remedy past discrimination?\n  Let me again quote the Supreme Court in Adarand. The Court said:\n\n       We hold today that all racial classifications, imposed by \n     whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be \n     analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny.\n\n  This leads me to the third undisputed fact: Strict scrutiny is an \nextremely high constitutional hurdle. The administration has conceded \nthe height and depth of the constitutional challenge following Adarand. \nIt has spent a considerable amount of resources over the last 3 years \ntrying to respond to Adarand.\n  Let me count the ways. First, the administration was forced to launch \na governmentwide review of all racial preference programs; second, the \nPresident even promised to ``mend'' those programs that were broken; \nthird, the Justice Department and the Commerce Department joined forces \nto embark upon an unprecedented national benchmark survey to help \nfigure out whether various racial preference programs could survive the \nstrict scrutiny test after the Adarand case; and finally, several media \nreports have indicated that the President has been forced to make good \non the part of his promise, and that he has attempted to end or curtail \nseveral programs.\n  Mr. President, I think it is clear to all of us that strict scrutiny \nis an extremely high constitutional hurdle. Let me quote our colleague, \nSenator Byrd, on this point. My typically astute and always \ndistinguished colleague from West Virginia explained in the \nCongressional Record that the Supreme Court's decision in Adarand \n``makes it exceedingly difficult for any affirmative action program to \npass constitutional muster.'' And as the Senate's unofficial historian, \nSenator Byrd dutifully noted that ``the last time the Supreme Court \nupheld a statute based on a racial or national origin classification \nunder the strict scrutiny test was in 1944.''\n  Undisputed fact No. 4: Upon remand, the district court in Adarand \nfollowed the Supreme Court's lead and found that the DBE Program could \nnot meet the test of strict scrutiny. Let me read the relevant portion \nof the district court's opinion and order:\n\n       It is ordered that section 1003(b) of ISTEA, [that is, the \n     Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program] and . . . the \n     regulations promulgated thereunder . . . are \n     unconstitutional.\n\n  In fact, the district court, like many of us in the Senate, expressly \nquestioned whether any race-based statute could be upheld as \nconstitutional.\n  The Federal judge concluded, ``I find it difficult to envision a \nrace-based classification that is narrowly tailored.''\n  The district court's ruling was not exactly a surprise to many of the \nNation's constitutional scholars. As the Congressional Research Service \nhas explained, the district court's decision in Adarand ``largely \nconforms to a pattern of Federal rulings which have invalidated State \nand local government programs to promote minority contracting in the \nfollowing places: Richmond, San Francisco, San Diego, Dade County, \nFlorida, Atlanta, New Orleans, Columbus, [the State of] Louisiana, and \n[the State of] Michigan, among others. . . .''\n  So let me repeat undisputed fact No. 4. The DBE Program was declared \nunconstitutional by the Federal court in Colorado.\n  Undisputed fact No. 5: The attempt to respond to Adarand did not \ninvolve any statutory reform whatsoever. The administration's reform of \nthe law came in the form of a maze of complex and lengthy new \nregulations to try to fix the ISTEA program.\n  Undisputed fact No. 6: Members of both parties expressed concern \nabout the constitutionality of the program, and many of those who voted \nto support it relied upon the administration's promises and proposed \nregulations. I am sure that my colleagues will remember that in March \nof this year, 1998, a divided Senate spent several hours over the \ncourse of 2 days debating whether a ``mended'' transportation program \nthat continues to treat persons differently based on race would now be \nupheld as constitutional. Ultimately, 58 Senators took the \nadministration at its word and reauthorized the program, but with a \nvery watchful eye.\n  I think that my good friend from New Mexico summed up the feeling of \nthose Senators who supported the new DBE Program, but had the following \nadmonition. Senator Domenici said:\n\n       I say to the administration very clearly right now: You \n     have now put the signature of the Attorney General of the \n     United States and the Secretary of [Transportation] on the \n     answer to . . . seven questions [about the constitutionality \n     of this program]. And this Senator [Senator Domenici, \n     referring to himself] and I think a number of other Senators, \n     is going to be voting to keep the provisions in the bill \n     based on these kinds of assurances. . . . If, in fact, it \n     comes out in a few months that the regulations are not being \n     interpreted in a way suggested here, then I assure you that \n     we will change them. . . . This better come as a very, very, \n     serious challenge to the administration as they finally \n     implement this program.\n\n  This candor and concern was also expressed by other Members on both \nsides of the aisle. Let me share an insightful colloquy pointing out \nthe constitutional concerns. This colloquy involved the distinguished \nEnvironment and Public Works committee chairman, Senator Chafee; the \nranking member, Senator Baucus; the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, Senator Warner; and Senators \nDomenici and Durbin.\n  Let me read those statements from the Congressional Record of March 5 \nof this year.\n  Senator Durbin said:\n\n       I believe the DBE program must be implemented in a manner \n     that is constitutional. I believe that it is critical to the \n     integrity of the program, and to the Senate's support of that \n     program. Therefore, I would like to ask the chairman and \n     ranking member--whose committee has oversight of the DBE \n     program--is it their intention to press the Department to \n     ensure that the new regulations pass constitutional muster?\n\n  That was a question being asked by the Senator from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin.\n  Senator Chafee, the chairman of the committee responding:\n\n       Yes, it is. We have made it clear to the Secretary that \n     while one can never predict with 100 percent certainty what \n     language may pass constitutional muster, the Committee \n     expects the Secretary and his legal staff to do their utmost \n     to make sure that the new regulations closely follow the \n     guidance set forth by the Court in Adarand.\n\n  Senator Baucus, the ranking minority member of the committee says:\n\n       I concur. It is the committee's intention that this program \n     be carried out in a manner that is consistent with the \n     Constitution. We expect no less. Secretary Slater is aware \n     of, and I am assured agrees with, our views on this \n     matter.\n       Senator Warner. As chair of the subcommittee that sponsored \n     this bill, I have a particular interest in this matter and \n     want to assure the Senator that adherence to Adarand is our \n     intent.\n       Senator Domenici. I appreciate the Senator's confirmation \n     on this point. Let me ask further: Will the committee \n     continue to be in touch with Department officials as the \n     regulations are ready for release? And will the committee \n     scrutinize the new regulations to ensure that the Department \n     did in fact follow the Court's guidance under Adarand?\n       Senator Chafee. Yes, we will.\n       Senator Baucus. I can assure the Senator, and the Senate, \n     that we will indeed.\n       Senator Warner. We certainly intend to.\n       Senator Domenici. I am pleased to hear it, and I want to \n     thank the Senators for taking the time to respond to my \n     concerns.\n\n  Mr. President, I could stand here on the floor and read statement \nafter statement made by Members of both parties during the ISTEA debate \nin March of this year that spell out the Senate's serious \nconstitutional concerns about the DBE Program. But I think it is \nabundantly clear that every Member of the Senate understands the \nconstitutional guarantees and obstacles that stand in the way of a \nFederal highway program that treats Americans differently based on the \nimmutable trait of race.\n  Let me say that I wholeheartedly agree with and appreciate the \nconstitutional concerns set forth by Senators Chafee, Baucus, Warner, \nDurbin, and Domenici. We must ensure that the new DBE Program is \nconstitutional.\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\n  My amendment is perfectly consistent with these constitutional \nconcerns, and I hope all Senators will fully support my amendment.\n  Undisputed fact No. 7: The proposed regulations were not final prior \nto our vote back in March on the DBE Program. In fact, the proposed \nregulations are still not final, even though the Congressional Record \nis filled with statements promising that the new DBE regs would be \nfinal in April or May of this year.\n  Well, Mr. President, we are now headed into August, and it is my \nunderstanding that the States and contractors still have no guidance \nfrom DOT on how to run this multibillion-dollar DBE Program in \ncompliance with the Constitution, with Adarand, with the Supreme Court \nand the law of the land.\n  So as the statements that I read earlier from Senators Chafee, \nBaucus, and others made clear, we do not know for sure whether the \nregulations make the DBE Program more constitutional or less \nconstitutional. We do not know for sure whether the proposed \nregulations will help or hurt, whether the regs alter the statute to \nallow the program to pass the stringent test of strict scrutiny, or \nwhether the Federal courts will follow the district court in Adarand \nand continue to strike down the program as unconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, undisputed fact No. 8: The Senate should take its oath \nto uphold the Constitution seriously. Mr. President, let me say that \nall of us, when we come into the Senate, solemnly swear that we will \nsupport and defend the Constitution of the United States. I think we \ncan all agree that this is a constitutional oath that should be taken \nseriously. In fact, for a good portion of our history, the Congress \nmandated an expedited Supreme Court review of any and all \nconstitutional questions.\n  In more recent years, the Congress has focused the expedited review \napproach on those important laws that are surrounded by legitimate \nquestions of constitutional validity. A quick search by the \nCongressional Research Service has documented several recent laws and \nbills that have included expedited Supreme Court review provisions. I \nthink my colleagues will remember each of these. Let me name just a \nfew: the Line-Item Veto Act; the Communications Decency Act; the census \nsampling in last year's Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill; the \nDistrict of Columbia Schools Opportunity Scholarships Act; and the \nGramm-Rudman-Hollings Act. All of those rather well-known measures had \nan expedited review provision. These are only a few of the bills that \nhave included expedited review provisions. These were generally \nsupported and passed in both Houses of Congress for the simple reason \nthat there were legitimate questions of constitutionality surrounding \nkey provisions of the bills.\n  Mr. President, this leads me to undisputed fact No. 9: I think we can \nall agree that, at a minimum, there are legitimate questions of \nconstitutional validity regarding the DBE Program. Both the Senate and \nthe House acknowledged these questions when we had extended debate and \na divided vote back in March on whether the program was constitutional.\n  Moreover, the TEA 21 law is direct evidence that both the Senate and \nthe House feel that there are legitimate constitutional questions \nsurrounding the DBE Program. Specifically, TEA 21 contains a provision \nthat prohibits the Department of Transportation from cutting off \nFederal transportation funds whenever a State discontinues its \nfederally mandated DBE Program in compliance with a court order \nstriking down the program as unconstitutional. So, Mr. President, the \nvery law we passed makes it perfectly clear that there are valid \nquestions of constitutionality about the DBE Program.\n  The courts have also made it clear that the DBE Program raises \ngenuine questions of constitutionality. Case law is replete with courts \nstriking down programs that mandate different rules and different \ntreatment for citizens of different races. The Congressional Research \nService, as I noted earlier, has found that the recent Adarand decision \nby the district court conforms to a pattern of Federal rulings striking \ndown racial preference programs across the country. I have here a long \nlist of cases in the last few years where courts have declared programs \nlike the DBE Program to be unconstitutional. This list shows court \ndecisions by the Supreme Court, D.C. circuit, the third circuit, the \nfourth circuit, the fifth circuit, the sixth circuit, the seventh \ncircuit, the ninth circuit, the eleventh circuit--all striking down \nrace-based programs. The list also shows other unambiguous rulings of \nlower courts in Georgia, Connecticut, Ohio, Louisiana, Michigan, \nColorado, and the city of Houston--again, all striking down race-based \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Race-Based Contracting Programs Are Routinely Struck Down\n\n       The Congressional Research Service has explained that the \n     recent district court decision in Adarand conforms to a \n     pattern of federal rulings across the country striking down \n     race-based contracting programs as unconstitutional.\n       See City of Richmond v. Croson, 488 U.S. 469 (1989); \n     Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, 141 F.3d 344 (D.C. \n     Cir. 1998); Monterey Mechanical v.

Finally, Mr. President, undisputed fact No. 10: If we \nare willing to grant expedited review to ensure the constitutionality \nof everything from census sampling to vouchers to vetoes to balanced \nbudget laws to Internet restrictions, then surely we would all agree \nthat Americans deserve to know whether an important law involving race, \ncivil rights, the 5th and 14th amendments, is constitutional.\n  We all know that there are many more cases striking down racial \npreference programs than there are cases striking down vouchers, or \nline-item vetoes, or balanced budget laws, or Internet restrictions. In \nfact, I will bet that you could combine and add up all of the cases \nstriking down vouchers, line-item vetoes, balanced budget laws, and \nInternet restrictions, and that amount still would be less than the \nnumber of court cases striking down racial preference programs. Surely, \nif we have given expedited review to all of those other issues, then we \nare going to give expedited review to the critical issue of civil \nrights and the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the \nlaws.\n  Mr. President, I have spelled out 10 undisputed facts which serve as \nthe common ground for the amendment I have offered. I think these facts \nare more than reason enough to immediately pass this expedited review \namendment.\n  Let me simply close by pointing out that the time for debating the \nconstitutionality of the DBE Program has passed. Now the courts must \ndecide. My proposed amendment simply just says that the Supreme Court \nshould tell us once and for all whether a transportation program that \ntreats contractors and subcontractors differently based on race can \nsurvive strict scrutiny.\n  We must ensure the constitutionality of the DBE Program. We owe it to \nthe States and localities that are receiving the billions of dollars in \nTEA 21 funds.\n  We owe it to the contractors who are threatened with the loss of jobs \nand contracts if they do not comply with the constitutionally suspect \nmandate of TEA 21.\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\n  We owe it to the minority-owned businesses who are forced to hang in \nthe balance and twist in the constitutional winds wondering if the \ncurrent program will survive a court challenge.\n  And, finally, we owe it to every American who sent us to the U.S. \nSenate to faithfully uphold the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, that is all this amendment would do. Regardless of how \nSenators may have voted on this measure back in March, this would quite \nsimply just provide expedited Supreme Court review in this field. This \nis something we have frequently done, as I indicated in my prepared \nremarks.\n  I hope that this amendment will be cleared and accepted on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to respond to the \namendment by the Senator from Kentucky. But at the outset, I want to \npoint out that inasmuch as this amendment came, we haven't had a chance \nto go back and check citations and check the references that he made in \nthe speech. However, I would point out that at the outset, the simple \nand obvious undisputed fact is that the Governor of Kentucky does not \nlike the idea of there being any disadvantaged business enterprise law \nin this great country, and wants very much to see it repealed. This \namendment is no more and no less than a subterfuge for that. Frankly, \nas far as I can determine, it will effectively tie up the consideration \nof this legislation.\n  I tried to listen as closely as I could to the Senator from Kentucky \nin his argument with regard to the reasons for the expedited \nconsideration.\n  I would point out that our Constitution provides a process, a \nprocedure, for judicial review of legislation passed by this Congress, \nnot the least of which requires the handling of a case in controversy. \nThose constitutional requirements and those procedures have been in \nplace really since, I would say, the founding of this country. But that \nprobably is not true. Marbury v. Madison was probably the first case in \nwhich the ability of the judiciary to determine the constitutionality \nof an act of Congress was upheld. And I think the precedent goes back \nto that.\n  The Senator from Kentucky wants to have this Senate say that the \nprocedure that has stood in very good stead for the consideration of \nall the legislation that we have passed over the last couple hundred \nyears is not good enough when the issue is race; that it is not good \nenough when the issue is gender; and, that is not good enough when the \nissue is providing some avenue for bringing people into the main stream \nof our American economy who had heretofore been excluded from it.\n  I point out that the DBE is shorthand for Disadvantaged Business \nEnterprise. It is in the first instance a business enterprise. It says \nthat of the contracting that takes place in transportation, it is only \nright, it is only fair, that women, that minorities--and minorities \nmeaning a whole range of people--have an opportunity to participate as \nequal partners in the conduct of business for the development of the \nNation's transportation system. This is not anything, or this should \nnot be anything dramatic. This shouldn't, frankly, rattle any cages, \nparticularly when one considers that the amount of contracting the last \ntime I looked was less than 5 percent for women and for minorities.\n  When you think about that, you are talking about women being roughly \nhalf the population of this country and minorities as roughly another \n40 percent or 30 percent of this country. So the majority of the \npopulation is allowed an opportunity to participate at a minority level \nin contracting under the Department of Transportation by virtue of this \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise Act. It has obviously been a matter \nof controversy precisely because it speaks to open the door to women, \nit speaks to open the door to minorities, it speaks to Federal \ncontracting activity under the auspices of, again, the Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise section of ISTEA, which is the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation and Efficiency Act.\n\n  This has been a controversy to the extent that the Supreme Court has \nalready taken the issue up in another context at least with regard to a \nState court law in the Adarand v. Pena case.\n  In the Adarand v. Pena case, the Supreme Court said that the Federal \nGovernment must subject affirmative action programs to ``strict \nscrutiny,'' meaning that the programs must be ``narrowly tailored'' to \nmeet a ``compelling government interest.''\n  The Court explicitly in that case stated that affirmative action is, \nin fact, still necessary. It wrote, and I want to quote from the \nAdarand case:\n\n       The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the \n     lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority \n     groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and the \n     government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.\n\n  I will even take issue with that part of the dicta in the case in \nthat the DBE law, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise law, applies \nnot just to racial minorities; it applies not just to ethnic \nminorities, but applies to women as well.\n  So we have a situation in which individuals who, because of their \nsituation, their status, their station in society, had not been \npreviously able to do business, start out with something of a \ndisadvantage, and it is for that reason that the program was initiated \nto correct that imbalance to bring some fairness, to bring some equity, \nto bring some fair share of the spending of Federal contracting dollars \nwith the majority-minority community.\n  I say again, ``majority-minority'' community, because when you add \nwomen and African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, \nAsian Americans, all of the different groups included in the \ndefinition, the last time I looked, when you add all of the minority \ngroups, when you add women, you are really talking about a majority of \nthe population of this country. The DBE, Disadvantaged Business \nEnterprise, section of the law allows them to participate in the \ntransportation equity, in the Department of Transportation funding.\n  The question is, Why are we here to talk about this amendment? What \ndoes this amendment do, and why does it seek to do it? Well, what this \namendment says is that the minute someone comes in and says, ``Oh, my \ngoodness, I don't think that this is constitutional,'' that the case \nhas to be expedited; that the district court advance, expedite over \neverything else.\n  That means, then, that if you are a district court judge, and someone \ncomes in with a case that says, ``Ah-ha. I think that the program that \nis giving this female contractor the asphalt paving contract in my \nState, I think that is illegal.'' Then your case goes ahead of the \nmurder cases on the docket; your case goes ahead of the drug cases on \nthe docket; your case goes ahead of the antitrust cases on the docket; \nyour case goes ahead of the civil rights cases on the docket; and your \ncase goes ahead of everybody.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Does this make any sense at all? Why is \nthere such an egregious harm? What devastating occurrence has taken \nplace that would give this claim a right to overcome everything else on \na court's docket and make it go directly to the Supreme Court? Do not \npass go, do not take advantage of the procedures that have been placed \nliterally, in many instances, since the founding of this Republic.\n  The Senator from Kentucky apparently thinks that opening up the door \nand allowing women and allowing minorities to have some part of the \nbusiness enterprise of this country is just that egregious an \noccurrence that it ought to take precedence in its ability to be \nchallenged in the courts; that we ought to throw aside hundreds of \nyears of precedents in court, hundreds of years of procedure in order \nto make certain that a claim of this magnitude goes directly to the \nSupreme Court, and has an opportunity to be heard immediately before \nanybody else has the right to get protected.\n  I submit to my colleagues that the logic of this amendment is what \nfails it the most. It is simply not logical to put aside everything \nelse on a court's docket to avoid the court of appeals altogether, to \ntake this dramatic move\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\nto redress what injury. What injury? I think the Senator from Kentucky \nfails to demonstrate the injury. The Senator from Kentucky also fails \nto talk about what standing, what case or controversy, what issue would \ngive rise again to the need to undo all of the procedures associated \nwith the challenging of the constitutionality of cases in the courts of \nthis country.\n  So what this amendment really is about is attacking the legality of \nthe DBE set-aside program through the side door. Would that it be \nthrough the back door, it would be even more direct. But this goes \nthrough a side door and takes with it the integrity of the court's \nprocedures. This goes through a door that says, ``Whenever we don't \nlike something in this Congress, we can just change the law and change \nthe relationship between the courts and the executive branch and the \nlegislative branch willy-nilly as we see fit and come up with a brand \nnew procedure that we create out of whole cloth.''\n  That is what this amendment does. It creates from whole cloth a \nprocess of appeal for a set of circumstances, again, the injury of \nwhich, frankly, escapes me, and I think escapes a number of our \ncolleagues.\n  I would point out that the front-door attack on the DBE Program \nfailed, failed by 58 votes during the ISTEA debate, and it was, \nfrankly, a very good thing, in my opinion. I understand the Senator \nfrom Kentucky and I see these things differently, but in my opinion it \nwas a very good thing that a number of our colleagues recognized they \nwould have to go home and explain to all of the women who had wanted to \ndo business with the Department of Transportation the door was slammed \nin their face, and that wasn't a good thing. Then they would have to go \nhome and explain to all of their minorities, be they racial minority or \nethnic minority, why the door was slammed in their face. And that would \nnot be a good thing.\n  The amendment was defeated in the front-door attack, and so now the \nSenator from Kentucky has developed a way to come at it sideways by \nsaying, We are not going to ourselves repeal it, or attempt to repeal \nit, because we cannot repeal it; we are not ourselves going to take on \nstraight forward the legality or the propriety of the Disadvantaged \nBusiness Enterprise Program, and we are not going to go in the back \ndoor, either. We are going to get in the side door. We are going to let \nanybody out there who might want to take up this cudgel for us, who \nmight want to play politics in the courts for us, we are going to give \nthem an opportunity to do it, and we are going to let them do it in an \nexpedited way.\n  Well, let me suggest that this is not a place where new judicial \nprocedures ought to be supported. There is no reason for this new set \nof procedures or for this new expedited appeals process. This \ncontroversial amendment does not belong on this bill because, quite \nfrankly, I believe this amendment in and of itself would be enough to \nbring down this bill. I don't think the Senator from Kentucky or \nanybody else wants to see something as important as this legislation go \ndown over this novel, creative, innovative, imaginative, interesting \nbut bizarre, legal procedure that is being suggested by the Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  I have just received a note from the ranking member, and I don't know \nif he wants to say something or not, but, in any event, I certainly \nwill defer to him and his leadership in this area. He has been \nexemplary over time.\n  Mr. President, I plead with the Senator from Kentucky to refrain from \nthe controversy that is about to be visited on this very important \nlegislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is not a complicated amendment. We \nhad the debate back in March on the DBE Program and the Senate spoke. \nThe Senate decided that it wanted to accept on faith that the \nadministration would issue regulations that complied with the Adarand \ndecision and the subsequent district court decision ruling the DBE \nProgram to be unconstitutional. All the amendment of the Senator from \nKentucky does is provide for an expedited review of those regs once \nthey are promulgated and litigated as they will certainly be litigated.\n  It is not unusual on matters of extraordinary and constitutional \nsignificance for the Congress to say, ``We would like to get an \nexpedited review, an answer to the issue.'' So that is all this \namendment is about. It does not deal with the merits of the debate at \nall. The Senator from Kentucky did not support the program and did \nthink the Senate ought to follow the Adarand case, but the Senator from \nKentucky lost that debate, cheerfully, I might say, and all we are \nasking for here in this proposal is to get an expedited Supreme Court \nreview of the new regs after they are promulgated.\n  I, frankly, thought this amendment would be accepted and am somewhat \nsurprised that we are having a debate about it. But that is all this \namendment does. Regardless of how Senators may have voted on the DBE \nProgram back in March, this is not about that. All this amendment does \nis obtain an expedited decision by the Supreme Court once some \nregulations are, at long last, promulgated.\n  I see my friend from Alabama in the Chamber. Let me just mention a \nfew other bills in which we did this. This is not unusual. We did it \nwith the line-item veto, which the Supreme Court recently struck down. \nWe had such a provision in the Communications Decency Act. We had it in \nthe census sampling measure in last year's Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. We had a similar provision in the D.C. Schools \nOpportunity Scholarships Act and the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act.\n  Mr. President, this is not in any way extraordinary or unusual to \nhope that the Supreme Court might give us some expedited guidance is a \nmatter of great importance.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Alabama in the Chamber. I am \nhappy to yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had occasion to study this issue \npreviously, and there is a serious question this country is facing. I \nbelieve the Supreme Court has given attention and careful review to it. \nI believe they are very, very sensitive to the national interest in \nhaving minority citizens, minority groups be able to rise and succeed \nin our Nation. At the same time, I think the Supreme Court is troubled \nby a policy that, in effect, says you have a preference simply because \nof the color of your skin. In fact, I think that they have said Adarand \ncould violate the Constitution of the United States. That is a serious \nmatter. I believe the Adarand decision is well decided. I believe in my \njudgment, and I don't claim to be a Supreme Court Justice, but in my \njudgment the present statute that we passed is in violation of Adarand. \nBut, regardless of that, the President has said that he can cure the \nproblems of Adarand through regulations and they intend to issue \nregulations that would avoid this conflict. I am not sure that is \npossible. It may be. But what I hear the Senator from Kentucky to say \nis we are not here to debate that issue again. We are simply saying \nthat if this law, and the regulations imposed by it, violate the \nConstitution of the United States, before we pass it we ought to set up \na system in which there can be a prompt review by the courts to judge \non that.\n\n  That is all this does, it seems to me. I salute him for suggesting at \nleast one small step that will reach a final conclusion of this matter.\n  Before the Senate Judiciary Committee we had hearings on this matter. \nWe had the lady who was married to the president of Adarand \nCorporation. She testified how they had suffered because of the set-\nasides in the transportation law. I think it is a serious question. If \nit is outside the Constitution, they ought to have an expedited review.\n  I think the Senator from Kentucky has proposed a reasonable, fair \namendment. I think any of us ought to be able to support that. I thank \nhim for doing so, and I look forward to continuing this healthy debate \nabout how we ought to disperse the benefits in\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\nthis country, what standards should be applied, and how our goods and \nservices ought to be dispersed. I suggest they should not be dispersed \non the basis of the color of one's skin.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator from Alabama yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to. I have yielded the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is the Senator from Alabama aware that the program \napplies not just to people based on the color of their skin, but also \nto women, as well as other ethnic groups who have not historically done \nbusiness with the Department of Transportation?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, the Senator is quite correct. It does apply to a \nnumber of different circumstances. Some of those circumstances, I \nsuggest, probably are constitutional. Many of those things may be \nrequired. Certain parts of it may not be. I suggest, with regard to \nthose that may not be, let's go on and not have it take 3 years to get \nup through the court system. Let's have a review so there can be a \nprompt determination of what would be legitimate and what would not be.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Is there further debate on the \namendment?\n  If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3326.\n  The amendment (No. 3326) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Shelby and the \nentire Senate Transportation Appropriations Committee for their work \nputting together this legislation. I would like to briefly engage my \ncolleagues in a colloquy on an issue important to me and my \nconstituents in Vermont; preservation of our nation's historic covered \nbridges. The recently passed federal transportation legislation, ISTEA-\n2, contains language authorizing funding to protect historic wooden \ncovered bridges. The National Historic Covered Bridge Preservation Act \nasks the Secretary of Transportation to study the appropriate \ntechniques to protect and preserve covered bridges, distribute this \ninformation to states and towns across the country and grant funds to \nfully repair and protect these beautiful old historic structures. The \nbill, that is now law, authorizes $10 million for these activities. I \nunderstand the difficulty my colleagues had in distributing funds in \nthis legislation. Although no funds were directly appropriated for \nthese activities, I would ask the Chairman of the Senate Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee if he would agree that preservation of \nhistoric covered bridges should be a priority?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Vermont that \npreserving our nation's historic covered bridges should be a priority \nfor the U.S. Department of Transportation and transportation \ndepartments across the nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Would the Senator agree that from available funds \nincluded in this legislation for the Federal Highway Administration \nthat priority should be given to funding the collection and \ndissemination of information concerning historic covered bridges, \nconduct research on the history of historic covered bridges, and study \nthe techniques for protecting historic covered bridges from rot, fire, \nnatural disasters or weight related damage? Would the Senator agree \nthat the Federal Highway Administration should use available funds to \ndevelop and publish guidance for implementation of the National \nHistoric Covered Bridge Preservation Act?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Vermont that \nthe Federal Highway Administration should make this a priority and move \nto publish guidance as soon as possible.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Would the Chairman of the Senate Transportation \nAppropriations Committee agree that funding for the repair and \nreconstruction of covered bridges should be given priority within the \nBridge Discretionary Program?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Vermont that \nevery effort should be made by the Secretary of Transportation to use \nfunds from within the Bridge Discretionary Program to repair and \nrehabilitate covered bridges across the nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to thank both Chairman Chafee and Chairman \nShelby for their commitment to covered bridges and for working with me \nto ensure that the program is fully funded within available funds at \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nTransportation Appropriations measure crafted by Senator Shelby. This \nbill takes a significant step forward in addressing the transportation \nneeds of the nation, and more specifically of Washington state.\n  As the Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, I am especially pleased with \nthe generous increase in funding for the Airport Improvement Program. \nThe Airport Improvement Program provides valuable grants to fund the \ncapital needs of the nation's commercial airports and general aviation \nfacilities. It allows the Secretary of Transportation and the FAA \nAdministrator to fund planning, design, and construction of airport \nprojects directly affecting aircraft operations, including runways, \naprons, and taxiways, with the purpose of maintaining a safe and \nefficient nationwide system of public use airports.\n  Adequate funding for AIP is integral to addressing the infrastructure \nneeds of our national aviation system. The GAO estimates that the gap \nbetween available funds and projected maintenance and construction \ncosts for airports is almost $3 billion. The $2.1 billion included in \nthis measure for AIP is a significant step toward bridging this gap. As \nthe Aviation Subcommittee Chairman, I will continue to look for the \nbest possible way to assist the Appropriations Committee in meeting the \ninfrastructure needs of our aviation system.\n  Chairman Shelby also included several aviation related items that \nwill have a positive impact on Washington state's airports. Inclusion \nof $6 million for the Contract Tower Cost-Sharing Pilot Program is \ncertainly a positive development for my state. This new program, which \nI am also working on in the context of the FAA reauthorization measure, \nwill allow local airports that fall below the eligibility criteria for \nthe existing program to cost-share with the FAA. The $6 million \nincluded by Chairman Shelby will cover cost-sharing arrangements for \napproximately 30 contract towers across the country. Olympia and Felts \nField are the two affected airports in Washington state that will be \nable to maintain their contract towers and, therefore, not diminish the \ncurrent level of safety.\n  I am pleased that the Chairman included $3 million for the Tactical \n(Transponder) Landing System. This system was recently certified by the \nFAA and could provide immense benefit to airports that are surrounded \nby geographical barriers such as mountainous terrain or approaches over \nwater that render the current Instrument Landing System useless. With \nthe installation of a TLS, Boeing field, whose current approach \npatterns cause significant noise problems for local residents, will be \nable to structure much more agreeable landing patterns. Moscow/Pullman \nairport, which is also named in the bill, should be an excellent test \nof the effectiveness of a TLS in mountainous terrain.\n  I would also like to commend Chairman Shelby for giving priority \nconsideration to Felts Field, Pangborn Field, Paine Field, and Spokane \nInternational airports, which all face unique problems that I look \nforward to working with the FAA to resolve in a safe and timely manner.\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\n  This bill is not only positive for aviation. The Chairman has \nrealized that innovative thinking and problem solving in the \ntransportation field deserves priority consideration. This is \ndemonstrated in the Transportation Planning, Research, and Development \naccount, where the Chairman included two projects in Washington state \nthat will serve as models for communities across the nation. The first \nis a freight mobility study instigated by the Kent, Washington Chamber \nof Commerce that will bring together representatives from federal, \nstate, and local governments, as well as the shipping, trucking, and \nrail industries, along with organized labor, to brainstorm on ways we \ncan make the existing system work better, realizing that we have finite \nresources with which to improve our aging infrastructure.\n  The other Washington state project included in the Transportation \nPlanning, Research and Development account is the Chehalis Basin/I-5 \nFlooding project. Currently, flooding in the Interstate 5 corridor near \nCentralia/Chehalis in Washington state seriously compromises freight \nmobility, with damage and impact estimates of $50-80 million per day. \nThe Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) is currently \nplanning to solve the problem by elevating the freeway for almost three \nmiles. This would be a typical transportation project, but it would \nalso exacerbate the flooding problem in the Chehalis River Basin and \nhave extensive environmental impacts. The plan is estimated to cost $98 \nmillion, with funding anticipated from the federal roads allocation to \nthe states. As an alternative, Lewis County is leading a consortium of \nthree counties (with Grays Harbor and Thurston), two cities (Centralia \nand Chehalis) and the Chebalis Tribe to eliminate the I-5 flooding \nproblem by solving the flooding problem in the upper Chehalis River \nBasin. Work on this project is well-advanced, and cost estimates range \nbetween $60-80 million. I look forward to working with the Chairman to \nensure a significant federal contribution to assist in the costly \npermitting process that will make this common sense alternative \nsolution a reality.\n  The Chairman was also very generous in his support for the Regional \nTransit Authority, which was recently renamed Sound Move. On November \n5, 1996, the voters of the Puget Sound region approved this $3.91 \nbillion transportation proposal. Sound Move will increase the capacity \nof the region's transportation system through a fix of light rail, \ncommuter rail, High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) expressways, regional \nexpress bus routes and ``community connections'' (such as park-and-ride \nlots and transit centers). Once completed, transit customers will be \nable to travel throughout a densely populated tri-county region in the \nstate--Pierce, King and Snohomish counties--by local bus, regional bus, \nlight rail and commuter rail, using a single ticket.\n  By passing the Sound Move ballot measure, voters in the Puget Sound \nregion agreed to provide the local funding portion of the plan through \na .4 percent increase in the local sales tax and a .3 percent increase \nin the motor vehicle excise tax. These tax revenues will provide a \nstable, dependable, dedicated source of local revenue for building, \nmaintaining and operating the system. Coupled with revenue collected \nfrom bonds and fareboxes, this funding will provide a 62 percent local \nmatch for the light rail and commuter rail portions of the project and \nover 80 percent of the total $3.91 billion project.\n  Despite the voters' clear willingness to pay for an improved \ntransportation system, the Regional Transit Authority needs federal \nfinancial assistance to successfully implement the light rail and \ncommuter rail portions of this plan. The rail segment of the Sound Move \nproposal includes: a 25-mile light rail line with 26 stations between \nSeattle's University District and the City of SeaTac via downtown \nSeattle and the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport; a 1.6-mile light \nrail line between downtown Tacoma and the Tacoma Dome train station; \nand an 81-mile commuter line using existing freight track between \nEverett and Lakewood with at least 14 stations.\n  Mr. President, Sound Move is one of the most cost-effective projects \nin the nation, with one of the strongest local commitments. In fact, \nSound Move ranked Medium/High in all categories in the recently \nreleased Department of Transportation FY `99 Report on Funding Levels \nand Allocation of Funds for Transit Major Capital Investments. These \nrankings demonstrate the overall strength of the project, which boasts \nridership and cost effectiveness estimates that unquestionably rank it \namong the top new starts in the country. The voters around Puget Sound \nare eager to join the federal government in making this project a \nreality and it is my hope that the $60 million included in this measure \nfor the rail component of Sound Move will be supplemented by the full \n$18 million which was included in the House bill for buses.\n  Mr. President, once again, I would like to thank the chairman for \ncrafting a fair measure that adequately funds our national priorities \nwhile realizing and addressing the unique transportation problems \nfacing Washington state.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate has completed action on several \nof the annual appropriations bills that fund the federal government and \nits many programs.\n  The appropriations bills that have cleared the Senate to date contain \nmany good provisions and generally provide appropriate levels of \nfunding to continue the necessary functions of the federal government. \nBut, Mr. President, these bills regretfully continue the practice of \nearmarking billions of taxpayers dollars for pork-barrel projects.\n  Over my tenure in Congress, I have consistently fought Congressional \nearmarks that direct money to particular projects or recipients, \nbelieving that such decisions are far better made through competitive, \nmerit-based guidelines and procedures.\n  Traditionally, earmarking has been more geared to political interests \nrather than public needs and priorities. Highway demonstration \nprojects, earmarked by Congress, have been a classic case-in-point. \nMost of these projects, which totals more than $9 billion in the \nTransportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), don't even \nappear on state priority lists.\n  The same is true for many other Congressional earmarks. I find this \nan appalling waste of taxpayer dollars. And, S. 2307 is typical of the \ntypes of earmarks and set-asides that Members add to the multi-billion \ndollar appropriations bills we annually consider.\n  This bill and report earmark more than $1.1 billion for site-specific \nbridge repairs and airport projects, research activities at selected \nuniversities, intelligent transportation projects, ferry systems, road \nimprovements in ski areas, state-specific snow removal activities, bus \npurchases and transit projects.\n  Mr. President, S. 2307 continues Amtrak's subsidies yet goes so far \nto concoct yet a new spending scheme to pay for its operating costs. I \nwill be proposing an amendment to ensure Amtrak's financial situation \nis not a moving target and that the integrity of the reform legislation \nenacted just over six months ago is not jeopardized by the proposals in \nthis measure.\n  This bill further earmarks several million dollars of Amtrak's \ncapital funds for new projects associated with Amtrak. The Committee \nreport earmarks $1.4 million to relocate an Amtrak passenger station in \nPennsylvania, $2.5 million to refurbish two turbo trainsets for \nAmtrak's empire corridor, and $1 million to install a speed monitoring \nsystem on locomotives operating between New Haven, CT and Boston, MA. \nThe report also directs that $800,000 be used to restore the historic \nSouthern Pines, NC, railroad station, which is owned by the State of \nNorth Carolina and served by Amtrak's Silver Star route.\n  Didn't the Congress agree last year that Amtrak needs to operate like \na legitimate business? Isn't that why we approved legislation which \nplaced Amtrak on a glidepath to free itself of operating subsidies? How \nis directing Amtrak to carry out these projects or requiring it to \nspend its resources on certain stations going to help Amtrak ever \nachieve its financial goals? Amtrak should be permitted to expend its \nfunds on those projects it deems most critical, not on projects \nrequired by the whims of Congress.\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to the types of earmarking I have \nmentioned, the Appropriators have taken a number of actions that fall \nsquarely under the authorizers' duties. For example, the bill would \nprohibit the Coast Guard from implementing any new navigation user \nfees. This means the Administration would be prevented from \nimplementing even reasonable new user fees. I understand the concerns \nthat the user fee proposed by the Administration are discriminatory in \nthat they would target only certain users of the navigation system, but \nthe language in the bill is overly restrictive.\n  Mr. President, there are some small earmarks in this year's \ntransportation appropriations bill as well as some very large earmarks. \nFor example:\n  More than 80 percent of the total funding provided for Intelligent \nTransportation Systems deployment projects are earmarked. The bill \nspecifically sets aside more than $84 million for projects in 20 cities \nand counties, and in 13 states.\n  Although no dollar amounts are set for individual bus projects, the \nbill prohibits the Federal Transit Administration from using any of the \n$393,550,000 provided in the bill for any project not designated in S. \n2307. All of the 150 TEA-21 authorized bus projects are included in the \nbill, and more than 150 new projects are named. Some of these projects \nhave been earmarked in the past and others are new additions to the bus \nearmark parade.\n  The appropriators have earmarked all of the $902,800,000 provided for \nthe new transit and transit system extensions program. Many of the \nprojects are unauthorized and were not requested by the Administration.\n  Examples of the earmarks for unauthorized projects include $2.5 \nmillion for multimodal transportation in Albuquerque/Santa Fe, New \nMexico; $8 million for a transitway corridor in North Miami; and \n$250,000 for a micro rail trolley system in Sioux City, IA.\n  Why are the appropriators so reluctant to permit projects to be \nawarded based on a competitive and meritorious process that would be \nfair for all the states and local communities? I suspect it is due to \nthe fact they doubt the merits and worth of the very projects they are \nearmarking.\n  The bill contains a legislative amendment to section 1110 of the \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 (ANILCA). By \nmaking a simple definitional change, the provision would modify ANILCA \nto permit helicopters to land in all conservation system units in \nAlaska, including National Forests, National Wildlife Refuges, National \nParks, and National Wilderness Areas. The legislative changes could \nresult in large-scale helicopter tourism in these sensitive \nconservation system units. The transportation appropriations bill is \nnot the appropriate forum to address a controversial environmental \nissue. A helicopter's ability to hover over an area is disruptive to \nwildlife, including large game species and nesting birds. In addition, \nthe capability of a helicopter to land in areas where airplanes cannot \ncauses concern for the integrity of the habitat.\n  I have only mentioned a few of the examples of earmarks and special \nprojects contained in this measure and I will not waste the time of the \nSenate going over each and every earmark.\n  Mr. President, I also want to express the critical need for Congress \nto send a very clear message to Secretary Slater regarding the \nDepartment of Transportation's treatment of the committee report \naccompanying this bill. Earlier this week, I chaired a hearing on the \nDepartment's actions regarding discretionary funding decisions. Believe \nit or not, some of the DOT modal administrations do not even understand \nthe clear delineation regarding statutory bill language and a committee \nreport. While I did my best to impress upon these modes--particularly \nthe Federal Transit Administration--that report language does not have \nthe effect of law, I am still not sure they get it.\n  Therefore, I urge Secretary Slater to take immediate action to \neducate his Department on the very clear and significant differences \nbetween the bill language and report language. Report language is not \nlaw. Report language does not have the effect of law. Report language \nis advisory. It's as simple as that.\n\n\n                      contract tower cost-sharing\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I would like to ask the distinguished chairman of the \nTransportation appropriations subcommittee about the provision in the \nbill that includes $6 million for an FAA contract tower cost-sharing \nprogram. I have several contract towers in my stat that would benefit \ngreatly from such a program. What is the intention of this provision?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The FAA contract tower program has been proven to be a \nvery cost-effective way for the FAA and local airports to work as \npartners to improve air traffic safety in many smaller communities. In \nfact, the Department of Transportation Inspector General recently \ndetermined that the program provides quality air traffic control \nservices at a lower cost compared to the FAA. This cost-sharing program \nwould enable some airports that fall just below the eligibility \ncriteria for a contract tower to retain their air traffic control \nservices by paying for a share of the costs. The Committee believes \nthat this program will improve aviation safety in small communities at \na minimal expense to the FAA.\n\n\n   highway research and development, bridge structures and the utah \n                         transportation center\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to enter a colloquy with the \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Appropriations, Senator \nShelby. The topic of my colloquy addresses the ongoing design/build \nwork on Interstate 15 through the Salt Lake Valley and the unique \nopportunity this project presents to conduct seismic and other bridge \nstructure research on existing overpasses that will soon be replaced.\n  I would like to thank the Transportation Appropriations Chairman for \nhis interest and support of research on Interstate 15 bridge structures \nduring the reconstruction of this important segment of highway. The \nSubcommittee on Transportation Appropriations included language in its \nreport (105-249, page 96) which provides $2,000,000 for research on \nInterstate 15 bridge structures. This report language directs the \nFederal Highway Administration to make this money available to the Utah \nDepartment of Transportation (UDOT) and the Utah Transportation Center \n(UTC), Chairman Shelby, am I correct in understanding that UDOT was \nincluded in this language primarily to facilitate the flow of these \nfederal funds to the Utah Transportation Center which will administer \nthe research done by Utah State University, University of Utah and \nBrigham Young University?\n  Mr. SHELBY. My colleague from Utah is correct in his understanding of \nthis situation. Since the Federal Highway Administration already has a \nrelationship developed with UDOT, the Committee included the state \nagency to facilitate the flow of these research funds to the Utah \nTransportation Center made up by the universities mentioned. The \nCommittee believes that these funds should be made available to the UTC \nexpeditiously so that this opportunity for bridge structure research is \nnot lost.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee for his \nclarification and I thank the Chair for its time and attention on the \nSenate Floor.\n\n\n  Southwest Florida International Airport Application for a Letter of \n                                 Intent\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, southwest Florida is one of the fastest \ngrowing areas in the country. Not surprisingly it is also my \nunderstanding that RSW is the third fastest growing airport in the \nUnited States. Additionally, I am told RSW has experienced an average \nannual growth of 9.2 percent over the past ten years.\n  Due to this unprecedented growth, RSW has embarked upon a major \nexpansion program which includes construction of a new terminal and \nrunway. This project is one of the State of Florida's most important \nairport projects and it has received substantial funding from the \nState. Moreover, the Federal Aviation Administration has provided \ndiscretionary funding for this worthy project due, in no small part, to \nthe support of the distinguished Chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Shelby, and his subcommittee over \nthe past two years through the prior Transportation Appropriations \nbills. I very much appreciate the support of the Senator for RSW and \nits expansion project.\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\n  Additionally, as the Senator may be aware, earlier this year RSW \nsubmitted a request for a Letter of Intent to the FAA in order to \nsupport their expansion project from the agency. Over the course of the \nlast several years, recognizing the budget constraints which the FAA \nmust operate under, RSW officials have worked hard to significantly \nreduce the federal share of this project by more than 30 percent.\n  I believe the Chairman of the Subcommittee can appreciate the efforts \nof RSW, in working with the FAA, to craft a plan which meets the needs \nof the airport yet substantially cuts costs in an effort to remain \nwithin the FAA's anticipated budget constraints. I feel confident this \nis the type of cooperation from a project which the FAA should consider \nfor priority LOI consideration.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for his \ncomments regarding our subcommittee's past support of the Southwest \nFlorida International Airport. The Senator has been very active in \nkeeping the subcommittee informed on the progress of the expansion at \nRSW. Because of this, I am well aware of the intense growth that this \nairport has experienced over the past several years.\n  Likewise, I am aware of the efforts of RSW to work with the FAA in \ndeveloping an LOI request, and that this effort has resulted in a \nsubstantial reduction in their request, making it reasonable within \ntoday's budget environment. I believe the behavior and efforts \nexhibited by RSW in working with the FAA, as well as their established \nneed, are exactly the sorts of things the FAA should be looking for \nwhen considering LOI requests. Accordingly, I encourage the FAA to give \npriority consideration to RSW's request for a Letter of Intent.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague from Alabama for his past commitment \nand support of the Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) and \nlook forward to continue working with him in the future.\n\n\n                   Keep Helicopters Out of Wilderness\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there are maybe thirty-five legislative \ndays left this Congress. We have passed six out of thirteen \nappropriations--and those have been the easier ones. Now--we are facing \nthe appropriations bills that are bogged down with legislative riders \nand have already invoked Presidential veto threats.\n  The Transportation Appropriations bill though is fairly clean and we \nmight be able to pass it tonight. Unfortunately, the temptation to put \nenvironmental riders on this bill could not be resisted. Section 342 of \nthis bill will overturn eighteen years of national environmental \npolicy, open some of the most pristine wilderness in the country to \nhelicopter landings.\n  Mr. President, I was here when the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act was passed by Congress. I remember the careful balance \nthat was crafted to pass this landmark legislation. The question of \nallowing helicopters was raised at that time and the answer we came up \nwith was to not allow them in wilderness areas except for emergency \nsituations. If you look at the legislative history included in the \nSenate Report for ANILCA it specifically lists what transportation was \nallowed in wilderness areas and helicopters are not one of them.\n  Instead, it directed the Secretary of the Interior to allow airplanes \nto be used in wilderness areas for traditional activities. Mr. \nPresident, I understand why this exception to the national Wilderness \nAct was made for Alaska and I supported it at the time. But I supported \nit as part of a larger compromise. One that this language will now \nundo.\n  Two years ago, the Forest Service conducted an Environmental Impact \nStatement on this same proposal and concluded that helicopters were not \nairplanes and were not a traditional means of access to the wilderness \nareas. Obviously, some of my colleagues do not like this conclusion and \nfelt that tacking an environmental rider onto the transportation \nappropriation bill was the best way to get around it.\n  The Interior Department has also objected to this language due to the \nimpact on wildlife in these wilderness areas. Mr. President, I think we \nall know that a helicopter flying overhead is much louder than a small \nairplane flying overhead. Helicopters blast the adjacent area with a \nminimum of 100 decibels or more.\n  But this language is not about just sheer noise. It is also about \nallowing helicopters to hover and land anywhere in these areas--the \nremote reaches of the Tongass National Forest, the glaciers of Kenai \nFjords National Park and even the inlets of Glacier Bay.\n  Although it may seem like it now, I am not the only person speaking \nout against this language. I have over thirty five letters from \noutfitters, bush pilots and tour guides in Alaska who oppose this \nlanguage.\n  So, Mr. President, I simply ask: What is the rush? Why are we \nincluding language in a transportation appropriations bill that \nrewrites legislation that has been on the books for eighteen years, on \nwhich no hearings have been held and that has been recommended for a \nveto?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my concern about \nSection 342 of the Senate FY 99 Transportation Appropriations Bill. \nThat section creates an exception in the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act allowing helicopter landings by the general public on \nfederally-designated wilderness and other protected lands within \nAlaska.\n  Federal wilderness lands in Alaska are covered by two federal laws: \nthe Wilderness Act of 1964 and the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act, known as ANILCA. To describe the interaction of these \nstatutes in more detail, Mr. President, the Wilderness Act establishes \na federal definition of wilderness, and governs the use and \nadministration of land within the various states that have been \ndesignated by Congress as federal wilderness. ANILCA, which passed in \n1980, is the statute which designated various lands within the state of \nAlaska as federal wilderness. It also conferred other federal land use \ndesignations, creating parks, monuments and other protected status \nlands in Alaska.\n  The reason I am concerned about Section 342 of the bill before us is \nthat it replaces the word ``airplane'' with ``aircraft'' within ANILCA. \nThough such a change would appear benign to those who do not know the \nstatute well. However, that is not the case. The practical effect of \nthe proposed amendment would be to permit helicopter landings by the \ngeneral public in federal wilderness areas and other protected lands in \nAlaska.\n  Why is this such a concern, Mr. President? There are two major \nreasons why I find this one-word switch troubling. First, expanding the \ntype of aircraft allowed in federal wilderness areas violates the \nWilderness Act and sets an alarming precedent.\n  Section 1110 of ANILCA presently permits the general public use, on \nlands protected under the act, of ``snow machines, motorboats, \nairplanes, and nonmotorized surface transportation methods for \ntraditional activities.'' Although airplane use is specifically \npermitted in Alaska under ANILCA, helicopter landings by the general \npublic are prohibited in all federal wilderness. However, helicopter \nlandings are permitted on a discretionary basis by the federal land \nmanagement agencies for emergency situations. All public lands in \nAlaska allow helicopters to land for that purpose.\n  I strongly support allowing helicopters in wilderness areas to rescue \ninjured or lost visitors. And those uses are already allowed. However, \nI have concerns about allowing helicopter landings in wilderness for \nother than emergency reasons, for purely recreational purposes.\n  In my home state of Wisconsin, people love the wilderness areas they \nvisit such as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and the \nwilderness areas in the Nicolet and Chequamegon National Forests. The \nreason they love those places, Mr. President, is not only because they \nare among the most beautiful spots in the Upper Midwest, but also \nprecisely because they are remote and are challenging to reach. \nNational Parks are beautiful places. I support them, and I visit them \nwith my family. However, National Parks, which have roads and \nrestaurants and maintained campsites, are not the same as the lands \nprotected under the Wilderness Act. National Parks are maintained for \npublic access, wilderness areas by contrast, are areas where one can \nbring one's canoe and tent and hike in, or fly to in a float plane, as \npermitted today\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\nunder ANILCA. By these means of transportation visitors can enter \nwilderness areas in a relatively low impact manner.\n  Allowing helicopters into wilderness areas would mean managing lands, \nthat according to the Wilderness Act are supposed to remain undisturbed \nby human access, in a contradictory manner. Imagine being in a remote \nspot surrounded by nature on a nice getaway and having a helicopter \nland right next to you to drop people off for an afternoon of wandering \naround? I believe we should not sacrifice the very reasons we have \nprotected wilderness in an effort to increase access to the wilderness. \nIf it's easy to get to, it's not a wilderness.\n  Second, Congress and federal land management agencies have already \nconsidered the issue of helicopter use on wilderness lands in Alaska \nand have found it to be inappropriate and incompatible. The Forest \nService has explicitly considered and rejected helicopters in Alaska's \nwilderness. In 1997, the Forest Service completed an EIS specifically \naddressing helicopter landings in more limited circumstances than the \nlanguage in this bill. At that time, the proposal was to allow \nhelicopters in areas other than specifically designated wildlife, \ncultural resource, and research areas. Section 342 would allow \nhelicopters in all areas.\n  The legislative history of ANILCA also specifically excluded \nhelicopters from lands designated under that Act. The Senate Energy \nCommittee considered special access to lands subject to ANILCA, and the \nCommittee Report stated ``the transportation modes covered by this \nsection are float and ski planes, snowmachines, motor boats, and \ndogsleds.''\n  Congress has already considered this issue, Mr. President, and we \nhave found that helicopters for general public access do not have a \nplace in Alaska's wilderness areas. I would urge that we not go back on \nthis sound judgment. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                                 AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very concerned over this bill's \nproposal concerning Amtrak's funding and will offer an amendment to \nensure the proposed scheme does not jeopardize the integrity of the \nAmtrak Reform and Accountability Act, P.L. 105-134, enacted on December \n2, 1997.\n  Congress worked for a number of years in a bipartisan manner and each \nside accepted compromises in order to provide Amtrak with the statutory \nreforms it said it needed to allow it a real chance to meet its \nfinancial goals. The reform bill was based on both Amtrak's Strategic \nBusiness Plan, a plan charting Amtrak's financial operating and capital \nneeds, and its federal grant request. And of course, its ultimate \napproval was the key to releasing the $2.2 billion ``tax credit'' for \ncapital investment.\n  As my colleagues well know, I am not a proponent of a system that was \nintended to be privatized two years after it was created in 1971, but \ninstead today has racked up more than $21 billion in taxpayer support \neven though it serves less than one percent of the traveling public. \nHowever, I worked in good faith with my colleagues and compromised to \nenable enactment of a legitimate reform bill.\n  I have been standing by the deal I cut. I have done nothing to hinder \nAmtrak nor have I offered proposals to prevent it from having the \nopportunity to fulfill its goals. But am I the only one who believes a \ndeal is a deal?\n  Mr. President, I am sick and tired of the Administration and Amtrak \nseeking to change the agreement which is law.\n  First the law required the establishment of an 11-member Amtrak \nReform Council (ARC) comprised of individuals appointed by the House, \nSenate, and the President. The ARC is responsible for evaluating \nAmtrak's performance and make recommendations to Amtrak for further \ncost containment, productivity improvements, and financial reforms. The \nARC is required to submit annual reports to Congress and it is \nresponsible for determining if Amtrak is meeting its financial goals.\n  While the House and Senate fulfilled its duties to appoint its \nmembers, the President has yet to make all of his appointments. As \nsuch, Senator Lott, myself, and Congressman Shuster encouraged the \nappointed members to meet and begin carrying out its duties.\n  It seems the Administration thought they could hold up the ARC from \ndoing its work if it dragged its feet long enough but that is not the \ncase. In fact, the Department of Transportation even resisted \nfulfilling its administrative duties associated with the ARC in an \nattempt to hinder the ARC. But the ARC members have not let DOT hold \nthem back and they have begun a steady meeting schedule.\n  Next the law called for a new Reform Board to replace the Amtrak \nBoard of Directors serving at the time of enactment. Since we expect \nAmtrak to try to reinvent itself and to operate like a real business, \nwe included a provision to allow a new leadership to guide Amtrak and \ninstill a ``new culture'' among Amtrak employees and management.\n  Mr. President, several provisions concerning the establishment of the \nnew Board were included in the reform bill in an attempt to prompt \ntimely action by the Administration and Congress. Unfortunately, the \nspirit of these provisions was met with little regard.\n  The law required the new Board to be in place by March 31, 1998. Yet, \nthe Senate did not receive even a single nomination from the President \nuntil the eve of the Memorial Day Recess. Due to concerns that the \nAdministration may drag its feet indefinitely, Amtrak's authorization \nwas linked to the nomination and confirmation of a new Board. \nSpecifically, the law provides that if the new Reform Board has not \nassumed the responsibilities of the Amtrak Board of Directors before \nJuly 1st, Amtrak's authorization would lapse. The law also \nautomatically discharged pending Board nominations from the Senate \nCommerce Committee if the Committee had failed to act by June 1st.\n  Presidential nominations require Senate confirmation, with hearings \nand review by the appropriate Senate Committees accompanying \nnominations. Yet due to the lack of timely action by the \nAdministration, the Commerce Committee had no opportunity to carry out \nits duties prior to the statutory automatic June 1st discharge. It is \nmy view the Administration's timing was a direct attempt to circumvent \nthe Commerce Committee's authority in this regard.\n  Mr. President, my position regarding the new Board was made clear \nfrom day one. I repeatedly voiced my concerns to the Administration \neach time I heard rumors of its plans to reappoint current members. I \nwas very clear that the Commerce Committee would not report favorably \nany Board hold-overs and I remained firm on that position. I truly \nbelieved even the Administration would acknowledge we didn't create a \nnew Board only to reappoint the same members.\n  So what happened? The Administration sent up the nominations as \nCongress headed into a recess. Two of the six nominations needing \nconfirmation were Board holdovers--that is, one-third. As I have said \nbefore, the Administration must have known that the Commerce Committee \nwould be unable to fulfill its hearings and review prior to the \nstatutory discharge date, given the Administration's stealth nomination \nsubmission.\n  However, in an effort to ensure Amtrak's authorization remained \nintact, I again worked in good faith with the Majority Leader and \nothers to confirm some of the nominations in order to meet the \ndeadline. The Commerce Committee now has an opportunity to consider \nwhether the pending Board nominees should be approved and sent to the \nfull Senate for a vote.\n  The law further provides for Amtrak to be free of operating subsidies \nwithin five years. If the ARC determines Amtrak is not meeting its \nfiscal goals, the ARC is to develop a plan for an alternative system. \nAt the same time, Amtrak is to develop a plan for its liquidation. If \nat such time this occurs, the Congress will then need to approve a \nrestructuring plan, or the liquidation proceeds.\n  As I've mentioned, the sunset trigger is contingent upon Amtrak \nmeeting its fiscal goals and being free of operating subsidies by \nfiscal year 2002. Yet the Administration is again attempting to get \naround the law. And this time, the Appropriators are helping. .\n  The Appropriation bill proposes to permit Amtrak to pay for its \noperating expenses with its capital funds. I am told this proposal is \nstrictly due to budgetary scoring concerns. However, I am not sold.\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\n  With the stroke of a pen, this bill jeopardizes the integrity of the \nreform bill--specifically the sunset trigger. Amtrak's proponents could \njust waive this bill as a demonstration that Amtrak is free of \noperating subsidies, since the bill does not include a line item for \noperating expenses as historically has been the case.\n  As I see it, Amtrak and the Administration are simply attempting to \nshift operating expenses into its capital budget, thereby backing away \nfrom agreements reached last year during the hard-fought \nreauthorization process. While the reauthorization placed a cap on the \namount of money that may be appropriated in any one year for \noperational expenses or capital investments, the authorized levels were \nbased on Amtrak's own projected financial needs.\n  Mr. President, during the last days of negotiations on the reform \nlegislation, you may recall certain members of the Amtrak Board of \nDirectors negotiated a new labor agreement which raised salaries for \nunion employees, thereby incurring a substantial increase in its \noperational costs. Amtrak's projected net loss for FY 1998 is greater \nthan the previous year's in part due to the Board's own actions. Yet, \nthe Board assured us at the time that the labor agreement would require \nno action by Congress--nor more importantly, would the labor agreement \nplace any additional obligations on the American taxpayers. However, \nshifting labor costs into the ``capital'' account could clearly result \nin the taxpayers once again being forced to cover expenses due to \nAmtrak's poor management decisions.\n  We authorized Amtrak at funding levels based on its own projected \nneeds. Further, we directed an independent financial assessment of \nAmtrak be carried out under the direction of the Inspector General of \nthe Department of Transportation. That audit will be based in part on \nAmtrak's Strategic Business Plan, including its projected operating and \ncapital costs. Should Amtrak be permitted to significantly change the \nway it accounts for operating and capital expenses, an accurate \naccounting could be next to impossible. The proposed change in the use \nof capital funds raises legitimate concerns whether Amtrak and the \nAdministration may be attempting to keep Amtrak's financial situation \nand Strategic Business Plan projections a moving target.\n  Further, we have continually been told Amtrak has critical capital \ninvestment needs. Yet, I am told that more than $500 million of the \n$621 million for capital would likely go to cover labor and other \noperational costs under this latest proposed scheme. If Amtrak is \npermitted to shift capital funds to cover what traditionally have been \nconsidered operating costs, how will Amtrak make up for the \ncorresponding loss in funding for its capital improvements? Time and \nagain we have been told Amtrak faces critical infrastructure investment \nneeds which must be met if Amtrak is to have any chance of becoming a \nviable operation. Time and again we have been told Amtrak needed a \ndedicated source of capital. As I see it, the change has the very real \npotential for jeopardizing Amtrak's abilities to meet its capital needs \nwhich it has sought so long to accomplish.\n  Therefore, the amendment I will offer is intended to retain some \nsemblance of legitimacy to P.L. 105-134.\n\n\n           bus funding for northern new mexico park and ride\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I know the Chairman and Ranking Member are aware of the \nproposal in the state of New Mexico to start up a new park and ride \ntransit system that would serve the cities of Los Alamos, Pojoaque, \nEspanola, and Santa Fe. I first brought this exciting proposal to the \nsenators' attention last September. Is the Chairman also aware that \nlast August the State of New Mexico ran a two-week trial run of the \nproposed transit system and that the demonstration was an enormous \nsuccess, with over 1500 riders per day and an estimated reduction of \n750 vehicles?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, Senator, I am aware of the success of the state of \nNew Mexico's initial two-week demonstration of the Northern New Mexico \nPark and Ride.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I know the Senators are aware that, at my request, last \nyear the subcommittee provided $1.5 million to the state to begin full-\ntime transit service in Northern New Mexico this fall using leased \nbuses and borrowed facilities. Is the Ranking Member also aware that \nthe commitment of the local governments to the program has also been \ndemonstrated by individual contributions of $100,000 each from the City \nof Santa Fe, Santa Fe County, Los Alamos County, and the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, Senator Bingaman, I am aware of the funding \ncommitments from the local governments and Los Alamos Lab for the \nNorthern New Mexico Park and Ride.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Is my understanding correct that for fiscal year 1999 \nthe Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee did not identify \nindividual programs and funding amounts for discretionary grants for \nbus and bus facilities, but that the conference with the other body may \npresent an opportunity to identify individual projects and funding \namounts? If that is indeed the case, can the citizens of Northern New \nMexico count on the Senators' efforts to identify $10 million to \npurchase the needed buses and bus facilities to allow the Park and Ride \nprogram to continue beyond the first year?\n  Mr. SHELBY. The Senator can be assured we will give the project our \nfull consideration in the conference.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate knowing of the Senator from New Mexico's \ninterest in the Northern new Mexico Park and Ride.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senators for their consideration.\n\n\n      construction of the new castle county airport control tower\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise this evening on behalf of myself and \nmy distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Bill Roth, to note \nthe importance of a project at the New Castle County Airport in \nDelaware that involves the Federal Aviation Administration, and to ask \nthe help of the managers of this bill.\n  In an extraordinary--and what is believed to be the first-of-its-kind \noffer--the owners of the New Castle County Airport--a bi-state compact \nknown as the Delaware River and Bay Authority--has agreed to pay the \napproximately $5 million it will cost to construct and equip a new \ncontrol tower. This facility will replace the 43-year old existing \ntower which does not meet federally-mandated safety and environmental \nstandards.\n  The FAA, however, has now taken the position that not only should the \nDelaware River and Bay Authority finance the cost to design and \nconstruct a new control tower, but also pay $2.3 million for the FAA's \noverhead, equipment and administrative costs to oversee the project.\n  In addition, the FAA wants the sponsor to reimburse the agency $1 \nmillion for costs related to the relocation of the FAA's Very High \nFrequency radar system (VOR) at the Airport--even though the FAA's \ncurrent lease indicates the FAA should bear such costs.\n  With the Airport sponsor willing to finance the significant cost of \nconstructing a new control tower for the FAA, the agency should not \nimpose additional overhead costs on that sponsor.\n  The owners of the Airport have worked diligently and cooperatively \nwith the FAA for the past three years on this project, but continue to \nencounter further financial demands and bureaucratic delays.\n  Clearly, this new control tower will help the FAA. Not only will the \nFAA get a new, state-of-the-art tower at no cost, if the New Castle \nCounty Airport is able to expand, it will help the FAA solve the \ngrowing problem of air traffic congestion at major commercial airports \nin Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York.\n  We believe it is in the best safety interests of all parties--the \nFAA, the Delaware River and Bay Authority, and most importantly the \nflying public--that this critical airport in Delaware be allowed to \nconstruct a new control tower facility for the FAA, without additional \nfinancial demands and delays.\n  It's our understanding that the House Appropriations Committee Report \naccompanying the FY'99 Transportation Appropriations bill specifically \ndirects the FAA to assume the approximate $3.3 million in overhead \ncosts. I rise today to bring this important issue to the attention of \nthe Chairman and\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\nRanking Member and to seek your help in working to include this House \nlanguage in the Conference Report.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes, we appreciate the concerns raised by the Senators \nfrom Delaware. We agree with the House Report language and want to \nassure you that we will work with you to ensure that these additional \noverhead costs are not imposed on the airport sponsor willing to \nconstruct the new control tower.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to commend \nthe Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, \nSenator Shelby, for the work he has done on this bill. It is not easy \nto balance the competing interests in any appropriations bill, but I \nthink it is even more difficult on transportation appropriations. I \nwould also like to call attention to one area of the Senate's bill \nwhich is very different than the House version.\n  The Federal Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) Program, which \nbegan in the late 1980's, is sponsored by the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA), the National Weather Service (NWS), and the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) and currently includes over 860 ASOS units. \nFor its part, as of December 2, 1997, the FAA had procured 569 ASOS \nunits. Yet only 297 of these units had been commissioned as of June 16, \n1998.\n  The current Senate bill provides $20.97 million for the Automated \nSurface Observing System (ASOS). This amount is $11 million more than \nthe Administration request. According to the Committee report, $9.9 \nmillion is to be used to commission systems that have already been \npurchased. This only makes sense. After all, the Federal government \npurchased these systems. They might as well be used.\n  Last year, Congress appropriated $10 million more than the \nAdministration request to procure nearly 30 more ASOS units. If the \npast is an accurate indicator, these units will sit idle until FAA \nfinds the funds to commission them. In essence, what we are doing is \npurchasing technology with great potential but fraught with high \nmaintenance costs and are going to be unusable for a number of years \nwhen, it is my understanding that there are other alternatives that \ncost less and can be used immediately. In fact, I understand that one \nof these alternatives, the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) is \nvery popular in many states, including the Chairman's home state of \nAlabama.\n  I would draw my colleague's attention to the action taken yesterday \nby the House Committee on Appropriations. In its companion to the bill \nbefore us, that panel declined to fund any of these systems for the \ncoming fiscal year but noted the Senate Committee's action. The House \nreport language says that both systems (AWOS and ASOS) are \n``meritorious'' and takes the strong position that if additional \nfunding beyond the Administration's request is provided in the final \nconference action, that ``an equitable distribution'' of the additional \nfunding should be provided for both systems.\n  I strongly support the action taken by our House colleagues and urge \nmy good friend, the Chairman of the Subcommittee to join me to inject \nfairness, cost-effectiveness and competition into this program.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his statement. I have \nlistened with interest to his remarks and recognize his concerns. The \nSenator from Ohio has raised very compelling arguments and I will \ncarefully consider his request during the conference committee's \ndeliberations.\n  Mr. KOHL. I would like to engage Senator Shelby in a colloquy with \nrespect to an issue of importance to my State of Wisconsin and the \nentire Midwest Region. As you may know, Wisconsin and eight other \nMidwestern states, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, \nMissouri, Nebraska and Ohio, working with Amtrak, have undertaken \nplanning studies of a Midwest regional rail system to be hubbed in \nChicago. The regional rail system would provide modern service on all \nexisting rail corridors as well as several new corridors within the \nnine-state region. By connecting major Midwestern metropolitan areas, \nridership and revenue projections have revealed that the rail network \nwould operate without subsidy, enhance regional economic development \nand increase mobility in corridors with congested highway systems. To \ndate, the states and Amtrak have contributed $468,500. The Federal \nRailroad Administration has also contributed $200,000 to this endeavor. \nI understand that the Committee grappled with unique constraints this \nyear due to the firewalls created by the Transportation Equity Act, the \nso-called TEA-21. Implementation planning funds are needed, however, to \nmove this important project forward. For this reason, I do hope that I \ncan count on your assistance if additional resources become available \nin conference and as this process moves forward.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I know this initiative was of interest to the senior \nSenator from Wisconsin and that you had requested funds so that your \nState and the other Midwestern states could complete detailed \nimplementation planning. As you know, we were unable to fund high speed \nrail corridor planning studies in the Senate Transportation \nAppropriations bill due to budget constraints. However, I will work \nwith you and if we revisit this issue in conference and take another \nlook at corridor planning studies, I assure you that the Midwest Rail \ninitiative will receive every consideration.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss a provision in \nthis legislation which I was pleased to sponsor. The interstate network \nof railroads faces several problems. As you are aware, several areas in \nthe United States currently experience serious rail freight congestion. \nWe frequently hear of delays on the delivery of goods for two to three \nweeks because of rail congestion. With more train traffic, there has \nalso been an increase in rail related accidents. There is no \ncomprehensive system which manages the interface between trains and \ncars at the huge number of highway crossings in the United States. In \nSouth Carolina alone, there are 32,000 crossings. This situation is \ncompounded in many parts of the country. Congestion is worsened and \nsafety is jeopardized because passenger trains, high-speed trains, and \nfreight trains all use the same track.\n  Unlike the national tracking of air traffic that assures millions of \nsafe passenger air miles each year, comprehensive automated management \nand control of movement and location in the rail industry does not \nexist. The Transportation Safety Research Alliance, a non-profit \npublic/private partnership which includes industry and research \ninstitutions, is seeking to develop an advanced, integrated technology \nsystem that would provide direction, movement, and highway crossing \ncontrol for the rail freight industry. Without such a system, we are \ngoing to experience more accidents endangering the public safety and \nmore delays to shippers and consumers that harm the Nation's commerce. \nThis bill includes language directing the Federal Railroad \nAdministration to provide $500,000 towards the development of this \nproject. I want to thank the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Shelby, and \nthe Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, for including this language. I \nappreciate your leadership in the Conference to ensure that this \nprovision is included in the Conference Report.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I also wish to express my support for this provision. \nOne of the key industry members of the Transportation Safety Alliance, \nUnion Switch and Signal, is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \nThey manufacture signaling automation and control systems for \nrailroads, and are at the cutting edge of an industry which can help \nour country achieve greater rail safety in the 21st century.\n  Senator LAUTENBERG. The issue of rail safety in this country is of \ngreat importance to me. I appreciate your comments, and will work to \nkeep this provision in the Conference Report.\n\n\n            advanced civil speed enforcement systems upgrade\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my good friend and colleague, the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee, that I note with \ninterest that the report on the bill before us provides funds in the \namount of $1 million for the upgrade of safety systems on all \nlocomotives operating between New Haven, CT, and Boston, MA.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. We have a question for the distinguished Ranking Member of \nthe Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Is it the intent of \nthis legislation that installation of the advanced civil enforcement \nsystems be performed at the facility that has the expertise, \ncapability, and prior experience to assemble and test cab signal \nequipment?\n  Mr. BIDEN. These new speed monitoring systems are important to the \noperation of the Northeast Corridor and we want to ensure that the \ninstallation is done at a facility where the workers have the skills \nand experience to do the job right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is our intent; that is the facility that should \ndo the job.\n\n\n                      portland light rail funding\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee in a \ncolloquy to clarify the funding provided for Portland Light Rail. The \nCommittee Report on the Transportation Appropriations Bill has a single \nline item for the Portland Westside and South-North Light Rail \nprojects. However, the Committee report description is ambiguous as to \nhow the funding provided may be used. The description reads:\n\n       Portland Westside and south-north LRT projects.--The \n     Committee recommends $26,700,000 for the Portland Westside \n     LRT project. . . .\n\n  The report then goes on to describe both projects. It is the \nCommittee's intention to provide this funding for both the Westside and \nsouth-north project?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Yes. The Committee intends the funding to be available \nfor both projects.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chairman for this clarification. I would also \nask whether the Committee intends to allow the $26.7 million amount \nprovided for Portland light rail to be utilized either for completion \nof the Westside project or final design and right-of-way acquisition \nfor the south-north project?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. The Committee intends this funding to be \navailable for either of these purposes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member for \ntheir assistance in providing funding for both of these important \ntransit projects.\n\n\n                   chehalis I-5 Flood Control Project\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to bring to your attention a \nproject that is of utmost importance to Southwest Washington state, the \nChehalis I-5 Flood Control Project. You were gracious enough to include \n$250,000 for this project in the manager's amendment in full committee, \nand I would like to thank you for your attention to this matter. \nUnfortunately, this project, which will ultimately cost taxpayers $18 \nmillion less than the initial option proposed by the Washington State \nDepartment of Transportation, will require $2.5 million in FY 1999 to \nwade through the myriad of permits that must be completed before this \nproject can move forward. I would like to work with you in conference \nto ensure that this project has the Federal support to become a \nreality.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I appreciate your bringing this matter to my attention. I \nlook forward to working with you in conference to ensure that an \ninnovative project such as the Chehalis I-5 Flood Control Project \nreceives the federal commitment that it deserves.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3327\n\n (Purpose: To provide additional resources for the United States Coast \n                  Guard for drug interdiction efforts)\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. DeWine], for himself, Mr. \n     Coverdell, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bond, Mr. Grassley and Mr. \n     Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 3327.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 8 of the bill, in line 17 after the colon \n     insert: Provided further, That not less than $2,000,000 shall \n     be available to support restoration of enhanced counter-\n     narcotics operations around the island of Hispaniola.\n       On page 5 of the bill, in line 4, strike ``$165,215,000'' \n     and insert ``$158,468,000'';\n       On page 9 of the bill, in line 2, strike $388,693,000'' and \n     insert ``$426,173,000'';\n       On page 9 of the bill, in line 4, strike $215,473,000'' and \n     insert ``$234,553,000'';\n       On page 9 of the bill, in line 7, strike ``$46,131,000'' \n     and insert ``$55,131,000'';\n       On page 9 of the bill, in line 9 strike ``$35,389,000'' and \n     insert ``$44,789,000'';\n       On page 77 of the bill, in line 15, strike ``$10,500,000'' \n     and insert ``$17,247,000''.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, yesterday 15 of my colleagues and I \nintroduced the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act, legislation \nthat would restore balance to our comprehensive antidrug strategy. My \nfriend from Florida, Congressman Bill McCollum, is leading a similar \neffort in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation is a $2.6 billion effort--$2.6 billion over the next \n3 years. This is an outline. It is a blueprint to really restore \nbalance to our antidrug effort. Unfortunately, over the years, the \neffort that we are putting in in regard to interdiction has gone down \nsignificantly as a percentage of our total budget. And we need to \nrestore that balance.\n  This legislation is a $2.6 billion, 3-year investment to reduce the \namount of drugs coming into this country and to drive up the cost of \ndrug trafficking. Taken together, this strategy will drive up the price \nof drugs and, most importantly, then drive down the incidence of the \nuse of drugs in our country. This is an important investment in the \nfuture of America and the future of our children.\n  Today, one day later, after having introduced this bill, the Senate \nwill, I hope, take the first step towards realizing that investment. I \nam pleased to have just sent to the desk an amendment offered along \nwith Senator Coverdell, Senator Graham of Florida, Senator Bond, and \nSenator Grassley, an amendment that will provide much needed resources \nfor the U.S. Coast Guard, resources that will increase their drug \ninterdiction capability.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, our amendment would accomplish two \ngoals. One, it would increase the funds available for equipment devoted \nto drug interdiction by approximately $37.5 million. Second, the \namendment would set aside resources needed to restore a much needed \ndrug interdiction operation in the Caribbean.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the Transportation \nSubcommittee, Senator Shelby, on the floor. I would like to engage in a \ncolloquy with him to go over the particulars of the bipartisan \namendment that I have offered.\n  First, I would like, before I do that, to discuss the $37.5 million \nsecured for additional resources.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, with respect to sea-based resources, our \namendment would enable the Coast Guard to reactivate one T-AGOS vessel \nand acquire two additional T-AGOS vessels. These vessels, originally \nNavy submarine hunters, have proved to be quite valuable for \ncounterdrug operations because they have the room needed for command \nand control equipment, such as sensors and communications equipment.\n  In addition, the amendment also would enable the Coast Guard to \nacquire a maritime interdiction patrol boat and satellite \ncommunications equipment for patrol boats.\n  With respect to Coast Guard air operations, our amendment would allow \nfor the reactivation of three maritime control aircraft. These are jet \naircraft that would be used by the Coast Guard to track and pursue drug \ntraffickers.\n  Finally, our amendment would allow for the acquisition of forward-\nlooking infrared systems. This technology enables the Coast Guard to \ntrack heat signatures in the water.\n  Why is this important? Well, drug traffickers, drug runners in the \nCaribbean, use what we call, and they call, ``go-fast'' boats, boats \nthat are too fast for detection in tracking using conventional radar. \nThe infrared systems can\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\ndetect ``go-fast'' boats and thus allow for more effective aerial \nsurveillance.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I appreciate the effort of the Senator \nfrom Ohio, first, in offering this very important amendment and, \nsecond, in briefly tonight explaining to the Senate the kinds of \nresources that are to be acquired with the additional assistance he has \nbeen talking about. I also commend him for his diligence in seeking \nadditional funds for the Coast Guard dealing with interdiction.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my friend from Alabama very much for his very \nkind words and for his leadership in assisting with this amendment.\n  There is one additional component, Mr. President, of this amendment \nthat I would like to discuss briefly this evening, and that is the set-\naside that will enable the Coast Guard to restore a very effective drug \ninterdiction program in the Caribbean.\n  My interest in drug interdiction activities in the Caribbean stems, \nin part, from my interest in the island nation of Haiti. The hard \nreality is that the Caribbean--from Haiti to the Bahamas--is fast \nbecoming once again a major illegal drug transit route.\n  On one of my recent trips, Mr. President, I saw that, in particular, \nHaiti is becoming an attractive rest-stop on the cocaine highway. It is \nstrategically located about halfway between the source country, \nColombia, and the destination country, the United States. Haiti law \nenforcement, though slowly getting better, is, at this point, utterly \nunequipped, unprepared to put a dent in this drug trade.\n  What is more, the Coast Guard fleet consists of a handful of boats. \nThey are making progress. They have certainly a long way to go. As the \npoorest country in the hemisphere, Haiti is extremely vulnerable to the \nkind of bribery and corruption that the drug trade needs in order to \nflourish. Not surprisingly, the level of drugs moving now through Haiti \nhas dramatically increased.\n  According to a U.S. Government interagency assessment on cocaine \nmovement, in 1996 between 5 and 8 percent of the cocaine coming into \nthe United States passed through Haiti. By the third quarter of 1997, \nthe percentage jumped to 12 percent, and increased yet again to 19 \npercent by the end of that year.\n  Accordingly, we responded to this crisis with an interdiction \nstrategy called Operation Frontier Lance--Operation Frontier Lance--\nwhich utilized Coast Guard cutters, speedboats, and helicopters, all to \ndetect and capture drug dealers on a 24-hour-per-day basis.\n  Incidentally, this operation was modeled after another successful \ninterdiction effort that took place off the coast of Puerto Rico called \nOperation Frontier Shield.\n  Mr. President, last May I boarded the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Dallas \nand observed Operation Frontier Lance and observed the men and women \nwho are on the front line--and were on the front line--carrying out our \nantidrug operation. And I came away thinking that this is the kind of \neffort, the kind of coordination of resources, that we need not just \noff the coast of Haiti and the Dominican Republic but also throughout \nthe drug trafficking routes throughout the entire Caribbean.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately--unfortunately--funding for Frontier \nLance ran out last month. This once effective roadblock on the cocaine \nhighway is no more. With our amendment, we can get that operation and/\nor similar operations in the region back up and running.\n  Specifically, our amendment secures operations funding that will \nallow Operation Frontier Lance or similar operations to resume. And \nwith the additional resources I described earlier, the Coast Guard has \nan even greater ability to flex its drug interdiction muscle in the \nentire region.\n  Mr. President, I express my thanks again to the chairman and the \nranking member of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Shelby and \nSenator Lautenberg, for their very effective efforts to assist me and \nthe distinguished list of cosponsors of this amendment. I also send my \nthanks to the staff of the subcommittee for their effort. Their effort \nwas great and it was first rate. This would not have happened without \nthem.\n  As I said at the beginning of my statement, Mr. President, this \namendment today is a first step. I expect that there will be many more \nsteps in the future, steps that are needed if we are going to restore a \ntruly balanced, truly effective drug control strategy.\n  This amendment represents a bipartisan effort to make a targeted and \nvery specific investment, an investment in stopping drugs before--\nbefore--they reach America. It will take similar efforts over the \ncourse of the next 3 years to bring our drug strategy back into balance \nand, most important, back on the course of reducing drug use in our \nhomes, our schools, and our communities.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from Ohio presents, I \nthink, very effectively the case for continuing the efforts that we \nhave had in the past--some quite successful--to intercept the drug \ntrafficking, and to make sure that we do not let down our guard, and to \nmaintain the facilities and personnel that we need to do it.\n  The thing I am concerned about--and I commend the Senator from Ohio \nfor bringing this to our attention; we will be looking at this over the \nnext period of time--the offset for this amendment, if I am not \nmistaken, is proposed to come out of the administrative costs at DOT; \nam I correct in that?\n  Mr. DeWINE. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That account has been severly tested. We will look \nclosely to see if we can put together the package that the Senator from \nOhio is recommending.\n  I do send up a note of caution as we look at it. We have been warned \nthat we could face a RIF, reduction in force, at DOT at the levels \ncurrently in the bill for administrative expenses.\n  The chairman and I have been very careful to try to make sure that \nthe dollars we expend are those that are most effective in providing \ntransportation facilities, helping the Coast Guard, helping FAA, and we \nhave been all along trying to reduce the administrative side, the \ntravel side, all of those things. We are both staunch supporters of the \nCoast Guard with our coastal States and in deep appreciation for what \nthe Coast Guard has done.\n  The drug interdiction mission I talked about earlier today, and I am \nprepared on this side to accept the DeWine-Graham amendment, but I have \nto know that the chairman and I are going to take a fresh look at DOT's \nadministrative costs in conference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to state to my colleagues tonight \nthat I believe myself, as I said earlier, that what Senator DeWine is \noffering to do makes a lot of sense. I will work with Senator DeWine \nand Senator Lautenberg in the conference when we get into the \nseriousness of what we can do with money. Interdiction here dealing \nwith drugs should be and will be one of our No. 1 priorities.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me thank both of my colleagues, the \nranking member and the chairman, for their great cooperation. I \nunderstand my colleague has expressed his concerns about the money \nsituation. I look forward to working with both Members in regard to \nthat.\n  I appreciate your concern for the Coast Guard. I believe this is \nmoney very well spent. I think the Coast Guard knows what to do with \nits money. They know how to get the job done. I have been out literally \nin the field or on the sea with them to see what they can do. They do a \ngood job getting it done.\n  I understand the concerns with regard to the money.\n  I don't know if there is any further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3327) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3328 and 3329, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

I sought these funds at the request of the Delaware \nRiver Port Authority, which is implementing electronic toll and traffic \nmanagement systems for the Ben Franklin, Walt Whitman, Commodore Barry, \nand Betsy Ross Bridges in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Delaware region, \nwhich are operated and maintained by the Authority and serve thousands \nof drivers each day, including substantial commercial traffic.\n  I believe that it is critical that we do all that is possible to \nalleviate traffic congestion on these important river crossings, for \nthe sake of improving the quality of life of area residents and others \nwho drive on the bridges and to reduce air pollution in Philadelphia \nand its suburbs.\n  I thank the Chairman for including funds for deployment of an ITS \nsystem over the Delaware River, which will benefit both Pennsylvania \nand New Jersey.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my shock and utter \namazement regarding the cover story in the June 15 issue of Time \nmagazine. It is entitled ``Everything your kids already know about \nsex.''\n  Now, I know that any octogenarian like myself is going to be \nimmediately viewed as a dinosaur and a prude on a\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\nsubject such as this, but I tell you that this article should alarm \nevery parent and shake up every community in America.\n  The piece opens up with an account of a 14-year-old couple, who walk \ninto a Teen Center in Salt Lake City, Utah (of all places) and inquire \nabout steps which they might take to heighten their arousal during sex. \nThis is a 14-year-old couple, I remind Senators. It continues with \nexample after example of youngsters as young as 9 years of age who are \nexperienced sexually, and who have had multiple sexual partners before \never reaching the legal age of consent. Here we are talking about \nyoungsters as young as 9 years of age. Many of these sexually new-age \nbabies (and that's what they are, babies) claim that they get all the \ninformation they need to be proficient in the sexual world through such \nprime time TV shows as ``Dawson Creek,'' which boasts of a character, \nJen, who loses her virginity at 12, while drunk, or another favorite \nshow, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', in which Angel, a male vampire, \n``turned bad'' after having sex with the 17-year-old Buffy.\n  What, in the name of common sense, I ask, is going on in this Nation? \nWhy are we letting our kids watch this morally degrading, thoroughly \ndemeaning, junk on the airwaves? Why in heaven's name don't the \npurveyors of such trash feel any sense of responsibility toward the \nyouth of our nation?\n  Have the parents of these kids just given up trying to guide and \nprotect them and teach them some sense of moral responsibility about \ntheir own bodies? I am afraid I have no answers, only legions of \nquestions about what sort of a society is going to evolve from all of \nthis unhealthy glorification of sex.\n  I know this much. We have got to find a way to inject some measure of \nspirituality into our culture, some sort of reverence for something \nbesides erotica, and we have got to find some kind of counterpoint to \nthe cheap, amoral, directionless, thoroughly disgusting popular mores \nwhich are blasted daily at our kids over the airwaves.\n  I believe one thing we could do in this Congress is to find an \nacceptable way to return prayer to our schools and to encourage \nreligious values in the life of this nation.\n  A lot of people who believe this have been driven into a closet. They \nwon't say these things probably because they will be viewed as old \nfuddy-duddies and as being behind the times and old-fashioned and all \nthat. I know of no other course which might provide a strong \ncounterpoint to the hedonistic viewpoint which so dominates everyday \nAmerican life.\n  All of our poor children face the prospect of growing up, do they \nnot, with no appreciation of anything but the seamy side of life and no \nunderstanding of the spiritual values that so enrich and refine human \nexistence and have played such a vital and important and prominent part \nin the history of our country, history of our Nation since its \nbeginning?\n  Does no one worry about the steady diet of crass perversion we are \nfeeding to our youngsters? Surely the American people expect us to \naddress the moral bankruptcy that is eating away at common decency in \nthis Nation. We have spent weeks publicly gnashing our teeth about our \nchildren's health. We hear these speeches all the time here about our \nchildren's health, and rightly so. Rightly so. And the evils of \nsmoking, and again rightly so. We should. But what about their mental \nhealth? What about their spiritual health? I hear little said on these \nsubjects. What about the sexually transmitted diseases which such \ncasual sexual behavior fosters? I tell you, I am worried, and I believe \nwe need to come to grips with the ugly reality of a society that is \nsliding further into decadence and decay right before our very eyes.\n  On February 6, of last year, I introduced a constitutional amendment \nthat could foster voluntary prayer in our schools and in public \nassemblies. I believe that it may do so without doing violence to the \nprerogatives of those who, as is their right, do not wish to pray. The \namendment is simple, and I read it: ``Nothing in this Constitution, or \namendments thereto, shall be construed to prohibit or require voluntary \nprayer in public schools, or to prohibit or require voluntary prayer at \npublic school extracurricular activities.''\n  I hope that the Judiciary Committee of the Senate--and I urge the \nJudiciary Committee of the Senate--will at least hold hearings on this \nmatter. I am sure they could find some time on the calendar to hold \nhearings on this important subject, if not this year, certainly next \nyear.\n  We have reached a point of crisis in our land, and to continue to \nignore the mounting evidence is blatantly irresponsible on the part of \nthose of us who claim to be leaders.\n  I know that there are concerns about the first amendment, and I \nhesitate to offer an amendment that would, in effect, amend the first \namendment in some respect, but I am worried a great deal more about the \ndestruction of our Nation. As far as I am concerned, if something about \nthe first amendment needed to be modified or changed to save this very \nNation, then I am willing to at least discuss it and debate it and make \na determination on whether we should. I do not view the first amendment \nas being absolutely sacrosanct. I am becoming very concerned about the \ntrend that we see happening in this country and about the direction in \nwhich the Nation is going and in considerable measure because of some \nof the interpretations of the Constitution, some of the interpretations \nof the first amendment that we have seen emanating from our courts.\n  I urge all Members of the Senate and all parents to read the Time \nmagazine piece and wake up and smell the coffee. The alarm bells are \nringing all over America, and we have got to come to grips with what is \nhappening and try to answer the call.\n  Now, I will not be around on this globe many more years perhaps, but \nI do have children and I have grandchildren. Incidentally, I have a \ngrandson who acquired his Ph.D. in physics yesterday at the University \nof Virginia. And he has a brother just 3 years older than himself who \nsecured his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Virginia 3 years \nago. So these are outstanding examples of the fine young people we have \nin this country, wholesome young people. They are not all bad, by any \nmeans. Most of them are not. But we do not often enough hear about the \ngood things our young people are doing. They are in the laboratories. \nThey are in the libraries. They are studying, trying to get ahead, and \nwe are not as aware of what they are doing as we are of those who make \nmistakes, and we all make mistakes, but of those who perhaps are not \ndoing as well.\n  I am concerned about the future of the Nation. I am concerned for my \nown posterity's sake, as I say. I do not have the answers. A blind man \ncan see that something bad is happening to our society. One does not \nhave to travel far to find out what is causing a large part of it. One \nhas only to go to the living room and turn on that tube and watch for a \nday the junk that has been programmed. They will see from what source \nmany of our problems are emanating.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article entitled ``Where'd You Learn \nThat?'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [From Time Magazine]\n\n Where'd You Learn That?--American Kids Are in the Midst of Their Own \n   Sexual Revolution, One Leaving Many Parents Feeling Confused and \n                          Virtually Powerless\n\n                         (By Ron Stodghill II)\n\n       The cute little couple looked as if they should be \n     sauntering through Great Adventure or waiting in line for \n     tokens at the local arcade. Instead, the 14-year-olds walked \n     purposefully into the Teen Center in suburban Salt Lake City, \n     Utah. They didn't mince words about their reason for stopping \n     in. For quite some time, usually after school and on \n     weekends, the boy and girl had tried to heighten their \n     arousal during sex. Flustered yet determined, the pair wanted \n     advice on the necessary steps that might lead them to a more \n     fulfilling orgasm. His face showing all the desperation of a \n     lost tourist, the boy spoke for both of them when he asked \n     frankly, ``How do we get to the G-spot?''\n       Whoa. Teen Center nurse Patti Towle admits she was taken \n     aback by the inquiry. She couldn't exactly provide a road \n     map. Even more, the destination was a bit scandalous for a \n     couple of ninth-graders in the heart of Mormon country. But \n     these kids had clearly already gone further sexually than \n     many adults, so Towle didn't waste time preaching the gospel \n     of abstinence. She gave her young adventurers some reading \n     material on the subject, including the classic\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\n     women's health book Our Bodies, Ourselves, to help bring them \n     closer in bed. She also brought up the question of whether a \n     G-spot even exists. As her visitors were leaving. Towle \n     offered them more freebies: ``I sent them out the door with a \n     billion condoms.''\n       G-spots. Orgasms. Condoms. We all know kids say and do the \n     darndest things, but how they have changed! One teacher \n     recalls a 10-year-old raising his hand to ask her to define \n     oral sex. He was quickly followed by an 8-year-old girl \n     behind him who asked, ``Oh, yeah, and what's anal sex?'' \n     These are the easy questions. Ronda Sheared, who teaches sex \n     education in Pinellas County, Fla., was asked by middle \n     school students about the second kweif, which the kids say is \n     the noise a vagina makes during or after sex. ``And how do \n     you keep it from making this noise?''\n       There is more troubling behavior in Denver. School \n     officials were forced to institute a sexual-harassment policy \n     owing to a sharp rise in lewd language, groping, pinching and \n     bra-snapping incidents among sixth-, seventh- and eighth-\n     graders. Sex among kids in Pensacola, Fla., became so \n     pervasive that students of a private Christian junior high \n     school are now asked to sign cards vowing not to have sex \n     until they marry. But the cards don't mean anything, says a \n     14-year-old boy at the school. ``It's broken promises.''\n       It's easy enough to blame everything on television and \n     entertainment, even the news. At a Denver middle school, boys \n     rationalize their actions this way: ``If the President can do \n     it, why can't we?'' White House sex scandals are one thing, \n     but how can anyone avoid Viagra and virility? Or public \n     discussions of sexually transmitted diseases like AIDS and \n     herpes? Young girls have lip-synched often enough to Alanis \n     Morissette's big hit of a couple of years ago, You Oughta \n     Know, to have found the sex nestled in the lyric. But it's \n     more than just movies and television and news. Adolescent \n     curiosity about sex is fed by a pandemic openness about it--\n     in the school-yard, on the bus, at home when no adult is \n     watching. Just eavesdrop at the mall one afternoon, and \n     you'll hear enough pubescent sexcapades to pen the next few \n     episodes of Dawson's Creek, the most explicit show on teen \n     sexuality, on the WB network, Parents, always the last to \n     keep up, are now almost totally pre-empted. Chris (not his \n     real name), 13, says his parents talked to him about sex when \n     he was 12 but he had been indoctrinated earlier by a 17-year-\n     old cousin.\n       In any case, he gets his full share of information from the \n     tube. ``You name the show, and I've heard about it. Jerry \n     Springer, MTV, Dawson's Creek, HBO After Midnight . . .'' \n     Stephanie (not her real name), 16, of North Lauderdale, Fla., \n     who first had sex when she was 14, claims to have slept with \n     five boyfriends and is considered a sex expert by her \n     friends. She says, ``You can learn a lot about sex from \n     cable. It's all mad-sex stuff.'' She sees nothing to condemn. \n     ``If you're feeling steamy and hot, there's only one thing \n     you want to do. As long as you're using a condom, what's \n     wrong with it? Kids have hormones too.''\n       In these steamy times, it is becoming largely irrelevant \n     whether adults approve of kids' sowing their oats--or knowing \n     so much about the technicalities of the dissemination. \n     American adolescents are in the midst of their own kind of \n     sexual revolution--one that has left many parents feeling \n     confused, frightened and almost powerless. Parents can search \n     all they want for common ground with today's kids, trying to \n     draw parallels between contemporary carnal knowledge and an \n     earlier generation's free-love crusades, but the two \n     movements are quite different. A desire to break out of the \n     old-fashioned strictures fueled the '60s movement, and its \n     participants made sexual freedom a kind of new religion. That \n     sort of reverence has been replaced by a more consumerist \n     attitude. In a 1972 cover story, Time declared, ``Teenagers \n     generally are woefully ignorant about sex.'' Ignorance is no \n     longer the rule. As a weary junior high counselor in Salt \n     Lake City puts it, ``Teens today are almost nonchalant about \n     sex. It's like we've been to the moon too many times.''\n       The good news about their precocious knowledge of the \n     mechanics of sex is that a growing number of teens know how \n     to protect themselves, at least physically. But what about \n     their emotional health and social behavior? That's a more \n     troublesome picture. Many parents and teachers--as well as \n     some thoughtful teenagers--worry about the desecration of \n     love and the subversion of mature relationships. Says Debra \n     Haffner, president of the Sexuality Information and Education \n     Council of the United States: ``We should not confuse kids' \n     pseudo-sophistication about sexuality and their ability to \n     use the language with their understanding of who they are as \n     sexual young people or their ability to make good \n     decisions.''\n       One ugly side effect is a presumption among many adolescent \n     boys that sex is an entitlement--an attitude that fosters a \n     breakdown of respect for oneself and others. Says a seventh-\n     grade girl: ``The guy will ask you up front. If you turn him \n     down, you're a bitch. But if you do it, you're a ho. The guys \n     are after us all the time, in the halls, everywhere. You \n     scream, `Don't touch me!'' but it doesn't do any good.'' A \n     Rhode Island Rape Center study of 1,700 sixth- and ninth-\n     graders found 65% boys and 57% of girls believing it \n     acceptable for a male to force a female to have sex if \n     they've been dating for six months.\n       Parents who are aware of this cultural revolution seem \n     mostly torn between two approaches: preaching abstinence or \n     suggesting prophylactics--and thus condoning sex. Says Cory \n     Hollis, 37, a father of three in the Salt Lake City area: ``I \n     don't want to see my teenage son ruin his life. But if he's \n     going to do it, I told him that I'd go out and get him the \n     condoms myself.'' Most parents seem too squeamish to get into \n     the subtleties of instilling sexual ethics. Nor are schools \n     up to the job of moralizing. Kids say they accept their \n     teachers' admonitions to have safe sex but tune out other \n     stuff. ``The personal-development classes are a joke,'' says \n     Sarah, 16, of Pensacola. ``Even the teacher looks \n     uncomfortable. There is no way anybody is going to ask a \n     serious question.'' Says Shana, a 13-year-old from Denver: \n     ``A lot of it is old and boring. They'll talk about not \n     having sex before marriage, but no one listens. I use that \n     class for study hall.''\n       Shana says she is glad ``sex isn't so taboo now, I mean \n     with all the teenage pregnancies.'' But she also says that \n     ``it's creepy and kind of scary that it seems to be happening \n     so early, and all this talk about it.'' She adds, ``Girls are \n     jumping too quickly. They figure if they can fall in love in \n     a month, then they can have sex in a month too.'' When she \n     tried discouraging a classmate from having sex for the first \n     time, the friend turned to her and said, ``My God, Shana. \n     It's just sex.''\n       Three powerful forces have shaped today's child prodigies: \n     a prosperous information age that increasingly promotes  \n     proudcts and entertains audiences by titillation; \n     aggressive public-policy initiatives that loudly preach \n     sexual responsibility, further desensitizing kids to the \n     subject; and the decline of two-parent households, which \n     leaves adolescents with little supervision. Thus kids are \n     not only bombarded with messages about sex--many of them \n     contradictory--but also have more private time to engage \n     in it than did previous generations. Today more than half \n     of the females and three-quarters of the males ages 15 to \n     19 have experienced sexual intercourse, according to the \n     Commission on Adolescent Sexual Health. And while the \n     average age at first intercourse has come down only a year \n     since 1970 (currently it's 17 for girls and 16 for boys), \n     speed is of the essence for the new generation. Says \n     Haffner: ``If kids today are going to do more than kiss, \n     they tend to move very quickly toward sexual \n     intercourse.''\n       The remarkable--and in ways lamentable--product of youthful \n     promiscuity and higher sexual IQ is the degree to which kids \n     learn to navigate the complex hypersexual world that reaches \n     our seductively to them at every turn. One of the most \n     positive results: the incidence of sexually transmitted \n     diseases and of teen age pregnancy is declining. Over the \n     past few years, kids have managed to chip away at the teenage \n     birthrate, which in 1991 peaked at 62.1 births per 1,000 \n     females. Since then the birthrate has dropped 12%, to 54.7. \n     Surveys suggest that as many as two-thirds of teenagers now \n     use condoms, a proportion that is three times as high as \n     reported in the 1970s. ``We're clearly starting to make \n     progress,'' says Dr. John Santelli, a physician with the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of \n     adolescent and school health. ``And the key statistics bear \n     that out.'' Even if they've had sex, many kinds are learning \n     to put off having more till later; they are also making \n     condom use during intercourse nonnegotiable; and, remarkably, \n     the fleeting pleasures of lust may even be wising up some of \n     them to a greater appreciation of love.\n       For better or worse, sex-filled television helps shape \n     young opinion. In Chicago, Ryan, an 11-year-old girl, \n     intently watches a scene from one of her favorite TV dramas, \n     Dawson's Creek. She listens as the character Jen, who lost \n     her virginity at 12 while drunk, confesses to her new love, \n     Dawson, ``Sex doesn't equal happiness. I can't apologize for \n     my past.'' Ryan is quick to defend Jen. ``I think she was \n     young, but if I were Dawson, I would believe she had changed. \n     She acts totally different now.'' But Ryan is shocked by an \n     episode of her other favorite show, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, \n     in which Angel, a male vampire, ``turned bad'' after \n     having sex with the 17-year-old Buffy. ``That kinda \n     annoyed me,'' says Ryan. ``What would have happened if she \n     had had a baby? Her whole life would have been thrown out \n     the window.'' As for the fallen Angel: ``I am so mad! I'm \n     going to take all my pictures of him down now.''\n       Pressed by critics and lobbies, television has begun to \n     include more realistic story lines about sex and its possible \n     consequences. TV writers and producers are turning to groups \n     like the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent health-\n     policy think tank, for help in adding more depth and accuracy \n     to stories involving sex. Kaiser has consulted on daytime \n     soaps General Hospital and One Life to Live as well as the \n     prime time drama ER on subjects ranging from teen pregnancy \n     to coming to terms with a gay high school athlete. Says Matt \n     James, a Kaiser senior vice president: ``We're trying to work \n     with them to improve the public-health content of their \n     shows.''\n       And then there's real-life television. MTV's Loveline, an \n     hour-long Q.-and-A. show featuring sex guru Drew Pinsky (see \n     accompanying story), in drawing raves among teens for its \n     informative sexual content. Pinsky seems to be almost \n     idolized by some youths. ``Dr. Drew has some excellent \n     advice,'' says Keri, an eighth-grader in Denver. ``It's not \n     just sex, it's real life. Society makes you say you've got to \n     look at shows like Baywatch, but I'm sick of blond bimbos. \n     They're so fake. Screenwriters ought to get a life.''\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\n       With so much talk of sex in the air, the extinction of the \n     hapless, sexually naive kid seems an inevitability. Indeed, \n     kids today as young as seven to 10 are picking up the first \n     details of sex even in Saturday-morning cartoons. Brett, a \n     14-year-old in Denver, says it doesn't matter to him whether \n     his parents chat with him about sex or not because he gets so \n     much from TV. Whenever he's curious about something sexual, \n     he channel-surfs his way to certainty. ``If you watch TV, \n     they've got everything you want to know,'' he says. ``That's \n     how I learned to kiss, when I was eight. And the girl told \n     me, `Oh, you sure know how to do it.' ''\n       Even if kids don't watch certain television shows, they \n     know the programs exist and are bedazzled by the forbidden. \n     From schoolyard word of mouth, eight-year-old Jeff in Chicago \n     has heard all about the foul-mouthed kids in the raunchily \n     plotted South Park, and even though he has never seen the \n     show, he can describe certain episodes in detail. (He is also \n     familiar with the AIDS theme of the musical Rent because he's \n     heard the CD over and over.) Argentina, 16, in Detroit, says, \n     ``TV makes sex look like this big game.'' Her friend Michael, \n     17, adds, `They make sex look like Monopoly or something. You \n     have to do it in order to get to the next level.''\n       Child experts say that by the time many kids hit \n     adolescence, they have reached a point where they aren't \n     particularly obsessed with sex but have grown to accept the \n     notion that solid courtships--or at least strong physical \n     attractions--potentially lead to sexual intercourse. Instead \n     of denying it, they get an early start preparing for it--and \n     playing and perceiving the roles prescribed for them. In \n     Nashville, 10-year-old Brantley whispers about a classmate, \n     ``There's this girl I know, she's nine years old, and she \n     already shaves her legs and plucks her eyebrows, and I've \n     heard she's had sex. She even has bigger boobs than my mom!''\n       The playacting can eventually lead to discipline problems \n     at school. Alan Skriloff, assistant superintendent of \n     personnel and curriculum for New Jersey's North Brunswick \n     school system, notes that there has been an increase in mock-\n     sexual behavior in buses carrying students to school. He \n     insists there have been no incidents of sexual assault but, \n     he says, ``we've deal with kids simulating sexual intercourse \n     and simulating masturbation. It's very disturbing to the \n     other children and to the parents, obviously.'' Though \n     Skriloff says that girls are often the initiators of such \n     conduct, in most school districts the aggressors are usually \n     boys.\n       Nan Stein, a senior researcher at the Wesley College Center \n     for Research on Women, believes sexual violence and \n     harassment is on the rise in schools, and she says, ``It's \n     happening between kids who are dating or want to be dating or \n     used to date.'' Linda Osmundson, executive director of the \n     Center Against Spouse Abuse in St. Petersburg, Fla., notes \n     that ``it seems to be coming down to younger and younger \n     girls who feel that if they don't pair up with these guys, \n     they'll have no position in their lives. They are pressured \n     into lots of sexual activity.'' In this process of \n     socialization, ``no'' is becoming less and less an option.\n       In such a world, schools focus on teaching scientific \n     realism rather than virginity. Sex-Ed teachers tread lightly \n     on the moral questions of sexual intimacy while going heavy \n     on the risk of pregnancy or a sexually transmitted disease. \n     Indeed, health educators in some school districts complain \n     that teaching abstinence to kids today is getting to be a \n     futile exercise. Using less final terms like ``postpone'' or \n     ``delay'' helps draw some kids in, but semantics often \n     isn't the problem. In a Florida survey, the state found \n     that 75% of kids had experienced sexual intercourse by the \n     time they reached 12th grade, with some 20% of the kids \n     having had six or more sexual partners. Rick Colonno, \n     father of a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter in \n     Arvada, Colo., views sex ed in schools as a necessary evil \n     to fill the void that exists in many homes. Still, he's \n     bothered by what he sees as a subliminal endorsement of \n     sex by authorities. ``What they're doing,'' he says, ``is \n     preparing you for sex and then saying, `But don't have \n     it.' ''\n       With breathtaking pragmatism, kids look for ways to pursue \n     their sex life while avoiding pregnancy or disease. Rhonda \n     Sheared, the Florida sex-ed teacher, says a growing number of \n     kids are asking questions about oral and anal sex because \n     they've discovered that it allows them to be sexually active \n     without risking pregnancy. As part of the Pinellas County \n     program, students in middle and high school write questions \n     anonymously, and, as Sheared says, ``they're always looking \n     for the loophole.''\n       A verbatim sampling of some questions:\n       ``Can you get AIDS from fingering a girl it you have no \n     cuts? Through your fingernails?''\n       ``Can you get AIDS from `69'?''\n       ``If you shave your vagina or penis, can that get rid of \n     crabs?''\n       ``If yellowish stuff comes out of a girl, does it mean you \n     have herpes, or can it just happen if your period is due, \n     along with abdominal pains?''\n       ``When sperm hits the air, does it die or stay alive for 10 \n     days?''\n       Ideally, most kids say, they would prefer their parents do \n     the tutoring, but they realize that's unlikely. For years \n     psychologists and sociologists have warned about a new \n     generation gap, one created not so much by different morals \n     and social outlooks as by career-driven parents, the economic \n     necessity of two incomes leaving parents little time for \n     talks with their children. Recent studies indicate that many \n     teens think parents are the most accurate source of \n     information and would like to talk to them more about sex and \n     sexual ethics but can't get their attention long enough. \n     Shana sees the conundrum this way: ``Parents haven't set \n     boundaries, but they are expecting them.''\n       Yet some parents are working harder to counsel their kids \n     on sex. Cathy Wolf, 29, of North Wales, Pa., says she grew up \n     learning about sex largely from her friends and from reading \n     controversial books. Open-minded and proactive, she says she \n     has returned to a book she once sought out for advice, Judy \n     Blume's novel Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret, and is \n     reading it to her two boys, 8 and 11. The novel discusses the \n     awkwardness of adolescence, including sexual stirrings. \n     ``That book was forbidden to me as a kid,'' Wolf says. ``I'm \n     hoping to give them a different perspective about sex, to \n     expose them to this kind of subject matter before they find \n     out about it themselves.'' Movies and television are a prod \n     and a challenge to Wolf. In Grease, which is rated PG and was \n     recently re-released, the character Rizzo ``says something \n     about `sloppy seconds,' you know, the fact that a guy \n     wouldn't want to do it with a girl who had just done it with \n     another guy. There's also another point where they talk about \n     condoms. Both Jacob and Joel wanted an explanation, so I \n     provided it for them.''\n       Most kids, though, lament that their parents aren't much \n     help at all on sexual matters. They either avoid the subject, \n     miss the mark by starting the discussion too long before or \n     after the sexual encounter, or just plain stonewall them. ``I \n     was nine when I asked my mother the Big Question,'' says \n     Michael, in Detroit. ``I'll never forget. She took out her \n     driver's license and pointed to the line about male or \n     female. `That is sex,' she said.'' Laurel, a 17-year-old in \n     Murfreesboro, Tenn., wishes her parents had taken more time \n     with her to shed light on the subject. When she was six and \n     her sister was nine, ``my mom sat us down, and we had the sex \n     talk,'' Laurel says. ``But when I was 10, we moved in with my \n     dad, and he never talked about it. He would leave the room if \n     a commercial for a feminine product came on TV.'' And when \n     her sister finally had sex, at 16, even her mother's vaunted \n     openness crumbled. ``She talked to my mom about it and ended \n     up feeling like a whore because even though my mom always \n     said we could talk to her about anything, she didn't want to \n     hear that her daughter had slept with a boy.''\n       Part of the problem for many adults is that they aren't \n     quite sure how they feel about teenage sex. A third of adults \n     think adolescent sexual activity is wrong, while a majority \n     of adults think it's O.K. and, under certain conditions, \n     normal, healthy behavior, according to the Alan Guttmacher \n     Institute, a nonprofit, reproductive-health research group. \n     In one breath, parents say they perceive it as a public-\n     health issue and want more information about sexual behavior \n     and its consequences, easier access to contraceptives and \n     more material in the media about responsible human and sexual \n     interaction. And in the next breath, they claim it's a moral \n     issue to be resolved through preaching abstinence and the \n     virtues of virginity and getting the trash off TV. ``You \n     start out talking about condoms in this country, and you end \n     up fighting about the future of the American family,'' say \n     Sarah Brown, director of the Campaign Against Teen Pregnancy. \n     ``Teens just end up frozen like a deer in headlights.''\n       Not all kids are happy with television's usurping the role \n     of village griot. Many say they've become bored by--and \n     even sent--sexual themes that seem pointless and even a \n     distraction from the information or entertainment they're \n     seeking. ``It's like everywhere,'' says Ryan, a 13-year-\n     old seventh-grader in Denver, ``even in Skateboarding \n     [magazine]. It's become so normal it doesn't even affect \n     you. On TV, out of nowhere, they'll begin talking about \n     masturbation.'' Another Ryan, 13, in the eighth grade at \n     the same school, agrees: ``There's sex in the cartoons and \n     messed-up people on the talk shows--`My lover sleeping \n     with my best friend,' I can remember the jumping-condom \n     ads. There's just too much of it all.''\n       Many kids are torn between living up to a moral code \n     espoused by their church and parents and trying to stay true \n     to the swirling laissez-faire. Experience is making many \n     sadder but wiser. The shame, anger or even indifference \n     stirred by early sex an lead to prolonged abstinence. \n     Chandra, a 17-year-old in Detroit, says she had sex with a \n     boyfriend of two years for the first time at 15 despite her \n     mother's constant pleas against it. She says she wishes she \n     had heeded her mother's advice ``One day I just decided to do \n     it,'' she says. ``Afterward, I was kind of mad that I let it \n     happen. And I was sad because I knew my mother wouldn't have \n     approved.'' Chandra stopped dating the boy more than a year \n     ago and hasn't had sex since. ``It would have to be someone I \n     really cared about,'' she says. ``I've had sex before, but \n     I'm not a slut.''\n       With little guidance from grownups, teens have had to \n     discover for themselves that the ubiquitous sexual messages \n     must be tempered with caution and responsibility. It is quite \n     clear, even to the most sexually experienced youngsters, just \n     how dangerous a little information can be. Stephanie in North \n     Lauderdale, who lost her virginity two years ago, watches \n     with concern as her seven-year-\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\n     old sister moves beyond fuzzy thoughts of romance inspired by \n     Cinderella or Aladdin into sexual curiosity. ``She's always \n     talking about pee-pees, she sees somebody on TV kissing and \n     hugging or something, and she says, `Oh, they had sex,' I \n     think she's going to find out about this stuff before I \n     did.'' She pauses. ``We don't tell my sister anything,'' she \n     says, ``but she's not a naive child.''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8909-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I begin my statement today describing a \npowerful and emotional sight that moves us to the core of our faith and \nbeliefs about America and about those who have served in the Armed \nForces of our nation.\n  Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that \ntrain our future military leaders. These academies have varied missions \nand yet all of them share in the critical task of developing leaders \nfor their particular service and our country. On the grounds of each \nacademy is a chapel, a spectacular place that at once identifies itself \nas a place of worship.\n  In each chapel, a place has been reserved for the Prisoners of War \nand the Missing in Action from their particular branch of service. A \npew has been set aside and marked by a candle, a powerful, symbolic \nreminder that not all have returned from battle. This hallowed place \nhas been set aside so that all POWs and MIAs are remembered with the \ndignity and honor they deserve. It is a moving and emotional moment to \npause at this reserved pew, to be encouraged by the burning candle, to \nrecall the valor and sacrifice of those soldiers, sailors or pilots, \nand to be inspired today by what they have done.\n  Back in 1970, a wife of a soldier missing in action made a simple \nrequest to have a flag designed for a small group of families whose \nloved ones were prisoners or missing in action in Southeast Asia. As a \nmember of the National League of Families she felt the organization \nneeded a symbol. This symbol, a black and white flag, with a silhouette \nof a bowed head set against a guard tower and a single strand of barb \nwire, was designed by Newt Heisley.\n  Congress has officially recognized the National League of Families \nPOW/MIA flag. This flag has become a powerful symbol to all Americans \nthat we have not forgotten--and will not forget. Since its creation, \nthe flag has flown over numerous state and federal buildings, and has \neven been adopted by similar organizations in Kuwait, Chechnya, Bosnia, \nand other countries.\n  Newt Heisley made the sketch of this symbol over a couple of days in \na New Jersey advertising studio, never imagining the impact the design \nhe created almost 27 years ago would have. Mr. Heisley used the \ninspiration of his ill son returning from Marine training at Quantico, \nVirginia for the silhouette. Otherwise the flag was just a quick sketch \nthat wasn't even supposed to be black and white. Mr. Heisley planned on \nadding colors but the black and white motif remained.\n  Mr. Heisley, first realized how popular the symbol had become when he \nmoved to Colorado Springs in 1972. Only two years after he made the \ndesign he was touring the Air Force Academy when he saw the flag on \ndisplay at the visitors center. Today, the flag is a national symbol \nthat is seen on everything from ball caps to bumper stickers.\n  A veteran of World War II, Mr. Heisley knows of the importance of his \ndesign. We must never forget those who gave their lives for our \ncountry. Mr. Heisley never felt the need to profit from the POW/MIA \nflag design. The image was never copyrighted and today is used by many \ncompanies and organizations. Mr. Heisley was simply glad to create a \nsymbol that honors veterans and the sacrifices they made for our \ncountry and freedom.\n  Mr. President, the United States has fought in many wars and \nthousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by the \nenemy or listed as missing in action. In 20th Century wars alone, more \nthan 147,000 Americans were captured and became Prisoners of War; of \nthat number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to \nthis number those who are still missing in action, we realize the \ntremendous importance of their presence through the POW/MIA flag. The \nPOW/MIA flag is a forceful reminder that we care not only for them, but \nalso for their families who personally carry with them the burden of \nsacrifice. We want them to know that they do not stand alone, that we \nstand with them and beside them, and remember the loyalty and devotion \nof those who served.\n  As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the \nremembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and \nmost noble acts we can offer. Newt Heisley has inspired this \nremembrance and honor and I thank him, personally, for this tremendous \nsymbol that shall endure forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8913-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8913-S8914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:32 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, with an amendment, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       S. 1260.

A bill to amend section 2681 of title 18, United States \nCode, relating to the special forfeiture of collateral profits of a \ncrime; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     federal son of sam legislation\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to correct \nproblems with the Federal ``Son of Sam'' law, as those problems were \nperceived by the United States Supreme Court. The New York statute \nanalyzed by the Supreme Court, as well as the Federal statute which I \nseek to amend, forfeited the proceeds from any expressive work of a \ncriminal, and dedicated those proceeds to the victims of the \nperpetrator's crime. Because of constitutional deficiencies cited by \nthe Court, the Federal statute has never been applied, and without \nchanges, it is highly unlikely that it ever will be. Without this bill, \ncriminals can become wealthy from the fruits of their crimes, while \nvictims and their families are exploited.\n  The bill I now introduce attempts to correct constitutional \ndeficiencies cited by the Supreme Court in striking down New York's Son \nof Sam law. In its decision striking down New York's law, the Court \nfound the statute to be both over inclusive and under inclusive: Over \ninclusive because the statute included all expressive works, no matter \nhow tangentially related to the crime; under inclusive because the \nstatute only included expressive works, not other forms of property.\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\n  To correct the deficiencies perceived by the Court, this bill changes \nsignificantly the concepts of the Federal statute. Because the Court \ncriticized the statute for singling out speech, this bill is all \nencompassing: It includes various types of property related to the \ncrime from which a criminal might profit. Because the Court criticized \nthe statute for being over inclusive, including the proceeds from all \nworks, no matter how remotely connected to the crime, this bill limits \nthe property to be forfeited to the enhanced value of property \nattributable to the offense. Because the Court found fault with the \nstatute for not requiring a conviction, this bill requires a \nconviction.\n  The bill also attempts to take advantage of the long legal history of \nforfeiture. Pirate ships and their contents were once forfeited to the \ngovernment. More recent case law addresses the concept of forfeiting \nany property used in the commission of drug related crimes, or proceeds \nfrom those crimes. Hopefully, courts interpreting this statute will \nlook to this legal history and find it binding or persuasive.\n  The bill utilizes the Commerce Clause authority of Congress to \nforfeit property associated with State crimes. This means that if funds \nare transferred through banking channels, if UPS or FedEx are used, if \nthe airwaves are utilized, or if the telephone is used to transfer the \nproperty, to transfer funds, or to make a profit, the property can be \nforfeited. In State cases, this bill allows the State attorney general \nto proceed first. We do not seek to preempt State law, only to see that \nthere is a law in place which will ensure that criminals do not profit \nat the expense of their victims and the families of victims.\n  One last improvement which this bill makes over the former statutes: \nThe old statute included only crimes which resulted in physical harm to \nanother; this bill includes other crimes. Examples of crimes probably \nnot included under the old statute, but included here are terrorizing, \nkidnaping, bank robbery, and embezzlement.\n  Mr. President, our Federal statute, enacted to ensure that criminals \nnot profit at the expense of their victims and victim's families, is \nnot used today because it is perceived to be unconstitutional. I \nbelieve victims of crime deserve quick action on this bill, drafted to \nensure that they are not the source of profits to those who committed \ncrimes against them. I ask for your support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Mack, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. \n        Grams):\n  S. 2346. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nS corporation eligibility for banks, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n  the small business and financial institutions tax relief act of 1998\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that will expand and improve Subchapter S of the Internal \nRevenue Code. I am joined in this effort by Senators D'Amato, \nFaircloth, Hagel, Enzi, Bennett, Mack, Shelby, and Grams.\n  The Subchapter S provisions of the Internal Revenue Code reflect the \ndesire of Congress to eliminate the double tax burden on small business \ncorporations. Pursuant to that desire, Subchapter S has been \nliberalized a number of times, most recently in 1996. This legislation \ncontains several provisions that will make the Subchapter S election \nmore widely available to small businesses in all sectors. It also \ncontains several provisions of particular benefit to community banks \nthat may be contemplating a conversion to Subchapter S. Financial \ninstitutions were first made eligible for the Subchapter S election in \n1996. This legislation builds on and clarifies the Subchapter S \nprovisions applicable to financial institutions.\n  Mr. President, as Congress considers credit union legislation and \nfinancial modernization legislation, it is important that we explore \nways in which we can ensure that the tax and regulatory burden on our \ncommunity bankers remains reasonable. This legislation is reflective of \nthat desire.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthe attached explanation of the provisions of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business and Financial \n     Institutions Tax Relief Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The Subchapter S provisions have been \n     liberalized a number of times over the last two decades, most \n     significantly in 1982, and again in 1996. This liberalization \n     reflects a desire on the part of Congress to relieve the tax \n     burden on small business.

By contrast, \n     Subchapter C corporations pay corporate level income taxes on \n     earnings, and shareholders pay income taxes again on those \n     same earnings when they are passed through as dividends.\n       This proposed S corporation improvement legislation would \n     be helpful to many small\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\n     businesses, but a number of its provisions are particularly \n     applicable to banks.\n       Congress made S corporation status available to small banks \n     for the first time in the 1996 ``Small Business Job \n     Protection Act'' but many small banks are having trouble \n     qualifying under the current rules.

A bill to provide for a coordinated effort to combat \nmethamphetamine abuse, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           COMPREHENSIVE METHAMPHETAMINE CONTROL ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, methamphetamine is fast becoming \nthe leading illegal addictive drug in this nation. From quiet suburbs, \nto city streets, to the corn rows of Iowa, meth is destroying thousands \nof lives every year. A majority of those lives, unfortunately, are our \nchildren's.\n  Methamphetamine is now commonly referred to as Iowa's illegal drug of \nchoice. This drug is reaching epidemic proportions as it sweeps from \nthe west coast, ravages through the Midwest, and is now beginning to \nreach the east. The trail of destruction of human life as a result of \nmethamphetamine addiction is running across America from coast to \ncoast. To illustrate the violence it elicits in people, methamphetamine \nis cited as a contributing factor in 80 percent of domestic violence \ncases in Iowa and a leading factor in a majority of violent crimes.\n  In 1996, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the \nMethamphetamine Control Act which has done some good. However, in \ntalking to local law enforcement and concerned citizens across Iowa, it \nis obvious that the methamphetamine problem has exploded beyond \nanything we envisioned in 1996.\n  The number of meth arrests, court cases, and confiscation of labs \ncontinues to escalate. In the Midwest alone, the number of clandestine \nmeth labs confiscated and destroyed for 1998 is on pace to triple the \nnumber confiscated and destroyed in 1997. The cost of clean-up for each \nlab ranges from $5,000 to $90,000. This cost is being absorbed by \ncommunities who are not prepared, or experienced with the dangers of \ndrug trafficking.\n  Additionally, these clandestine meth labs create an enormous amount \nof hazardous waste. For every 1 pound of methamphetamine produced, \nthere are 5 to 6 pounds of hazardous waste as a by-product. This waste \nis highly toxic and often seeps into the ground where eventually it \nends up in our drinking water supply.\n  The dangers posed to law enforcement officers also are greatly \nincreased by these labs. Many peddlers of meth are now what they call \n``kitchen'' labs. Meth pushers are now simply using mobile homes or \neven pick-up trucks to produce their drugs. Combining many volatile \nchemicals in an uncontrolled environment, meth labs are time bombs to \npolice officers and communities everywhere.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing the Comprehensive \nMethamphetamine Control Act of 1998. My legislation takes a \ncomprehensive, common sense approach in battling this growing epidemic. \nIt calls for an increase in resources to law enforcement working \nthrough the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program and \nestablishes swift and certain penalties for those producing and \npeddling meth.\n  Also, my legislation expands school and community-based prevention \nefforts at the local level--targeting those areas that need it the \nmost. Finally, this proposal calls on the National Institute on Drug \nAbuse to find exactly what makes methamphetamine so very addictive--\nespecially to our young people--and the best methods for beating the \naddiction.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we have a window of opportunity as a \nnation to take a stand right now to defeat this scourge. Everyday, meth \ninfiltrates our city streets and suburbs, leading more and more people \ndown a path of personal destruction. Families are being devastated and \ncommunities are fighting an uphill battle against this powerful drug. \nThe time is now to make a stand to protect our communities and schools \nby passing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2347\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Two years ago, \n     Senator Harkin and other members of the Iowa Congressional \n     delegation worked to provide Iowa law enforcement with \n     enhanced support to fight the rise in methamphetamine abuse. \n     Iowa (along with Missouri, Kansas, and Nebraska) was \n     designated as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). \n     As a HIDTA, Iowa law enforcement has received funding to \n     increase the number of federal prosecutors and state and \n     local police available to crack down on meth. This \n     legislation would expand HIDTA funding to combat \n     methamphetamine abuse from $8 million to $25 million, \n     allowing law enforcement officials to significantly expand \n     their efforts and make our communities safer.\n       Swift and Certain Punishment of Meth Lab Operators. \n     Federal, state and local law enforcement officials have been \n     working hard to prosecute those found to be making \n     methamphetamine. However, because of the great number of \n     cases in Iowa and other states and the inflexibility of \n     current laws, there are often long delays in prosecution. \n     Therefore, this legislation includes a recommendation by the \n     Midwest HIDTA to provide for swifter and more certain \n     punishment of these offenders. It would direct the U.S. \n     Sentencing Commission to increase the penalties for those \n     convicted of manufacturing, attempting to manufacture or \n     conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine. It would also \n     increase jail time for meth lab cases where the offense \n     created a substantial danger to the health and safety to \n     others, including law enforcement personnel.\n       Stepping Up Community-Based Prevention Efforts. Critical to \n     any successful comprehensive effort to combat methamphetamine \n     is a strong school and community-based prevention program. \n     This legislation authorizes an additional $20 million to fund \n     expanding school and community-based prevention efforts at \n     the state and local level. Funds are to be targeted to rural \n     and other areas, like Iowa, that are experiencing high or \n     rapid increases in methamphetamine abuse. Funds would be used \n     for education of children, parents, local law enforcement,\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\n     businesses and others about the dangers of methamphetamine \n     and on how to identify likely users and producers of the \n     drug.\n       Expanded Treatment to Fight Meth Addiction. Also critical \n     to a successful effort to combat methamphetamine abuse is a \n     well-designed, adequately funded treatment program for those \n     who become addicted to the drug. Once again, funds would be \n     targeted to rural and other areas, like Iowa, that are \n     experiencing high or rapid increases in methamphetamine \n     abuse. Funds would be used to develop and evaluate effective \n     treatment methods for methamphetamine abusers, to train \n     health professionals about effective treatment methods and to \n     help individuals quit their use of the drug. The bill would \n     encourage targeted pilot programs to develop new and \n     innovative treatment methods.\n       Expanded Research to Develop Improved Prevention and \n     Treatment Strategies. While there are a number of local \n     programs and strategies that are working to combat meth, \n     additional research is needed to develop improved approaches. \n     Our legislation calls on the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n     (NIDA) to fund research to identify and evaluate the most \n     effective methods of treatment and prevention, as well as the \n     biomedical, neurological and physiological causes and effects \n     of methamphetamine abuse and addiction. In addition, NIDA \n     would be required to promptly disseminate their research \n     results to Federal, State and local organizations involved in \n     combating meth abuse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 2349. A bill to authorize appropriations for the hazardous \nmaterials transportation program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n     HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nHazardous Materials Transportation Reauthorization Act of 1998. This \nlegislation is identical to the reauthorizing provisions approved by \nthe Senate earlier this year under Subtitle B of Title III of S. 1173, \nthe Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1998.\n  Mr. President, the Commerce Committee spent considerable time and \neffort developing and debating the safety provisions that were \nincorporated into the ISTEA reauthorization bill, ultimately entitled \nthe Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century--TEA--21 (P.L. 105-\n178). Once in conference with our House counterparts, we were faced \nwith many difficult decisions and compromises. The one area that we did \nnot reach agreement regarded the provisions associated with the \nHazardous Materials Transportation programs administered by the \nResearch and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) of the Department \nof Transportation.\n  Since the House had not acted to reauthorize this program in its \nversion of ISTEA reauthorizing legislation, we found ourselves unable \nto reach agreement on including it in the conference report. Therefore, \nthe Senate must again take action to reauthorize the Hazardous \nMaterials Transportation Act.\n  Mr. President, I want to stress that this bill I am introducing today \nis identical to the hazardous materials reauthorization the Senate \npassed earlier this year. The legislation proposing reauthorizes \nfunding for programs that ensure the safe transportation of hazardous \nmaterials. It also includes a number of provisions requested by the \nAdministration that are intended to strengthen and improve the \nhazardous materials transportation program. And again Mr. President, I \nwill reiterate, this bill is identical to the proposal passed by the \nSenate on March 12, 1998.\n  Mr. President, it is very important for the Congress to complete its \nwork and reauthorize all of our nation's critical transportation safety \nprograms. Therefore, I will be seeking to move this legislation through \nthe Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in the very near \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 2350. A bill to clarify the application of toll restrictions to \nDelaware River Port Authority bridges; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n          delaware river port authority compact clarification\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I introduce noncontroversial \nlegislation which is essential to the ability of the Delaware River \nPort Authority to raise funds in the bond markets. Specifically, this \nbill clarifies that the 1987 law which repealed the thirty-year limit \non bridge toll collection set by the General Bridge Act of 1946 also \napplies to the Delaware River Port Authority's bridges in Southeastern \nPennsylvania and Southern New Jersey. It is arguable that this \nlegislation is not necessary and that a court would construe the 1987 \nlaw in the Port Authority's favor. However, to assure certainty for the \nfinancial markets and entities considering purchasing bonds issued by \nthe Port Authority, I believe it is worthwhile for Congress to adopt \nlegislation making this technical clarification.\n  By way of background, for many years, federal regulations governed \nthe collection of tolls on bridges throughout the nation. Then, in the \n1987 highway bill, congress repealed section 506 of the 1946 General \nBridge Act which imposed a 30-year time limit on the collection of \ntolls. The bridges owned and operated by the Delaware River Port \nAuthority, however, are governed by a 1952 public law by which Congress \nratified the Pennsylvania-New Jersey compact establishing the Port \nAuthority. Section 3 of that public law provided that the Port \nAuthority's bridges were expressly exempt from the 30-year limit of the \nGeneral Bridge Act and were instead subject to a 50-year limit on the \ncollection of tolls.\n  A strong case could be made that any existing statutory limit on the \nPort Authority was implicitly repealed by the 1987 highway bill because \nthe limit in the 1952 compact legislation was drafted as an exception \nto a law that is no longer in effect (i.e., Section 506 of the General \nBridge Act of 1946). However, since the 1952 Port Authority provision \nhas not been technically repealed, I am proposing legislation to \ncorrect this oversight.\n  The legislative history of the Section 3 of the Port Authority \ncompact legislation also suggests that the 50-year toll-collection \nlimit should no longer apply. Instead of having a lesser restriction \nthan the 30-year limit, as was intended by Congress, if the 50-year \nlimit were enforced, the Port Authority would be subject to a more \nstringent limitation on toll collection than all other American \nbridges. Accordingly, I believe that my legislation is consistent with \nthe intent behind the 1987 highway law to deregulate the collection of \ntolls nationwide.\n  The Port Authority is authorized to pledge its revenue, including \nthat from tolls, to secure debts. To obtain financing for future \neconomic development and to preserve the bridges it owns and operates, \nthe Port Authority must have a guaranteed revenue stream. Although a \ncourt very likely would rule that the fifty-year limit on toll \ncollection was implicitly repealed by the Highway Act of 1987, without \ndirect legislation to that effect, the Port Authority's bond counsel \nsuggests it will be unable to borrow in the financial markets.\n  The importance of ensuring this borrowing ability is reflected in the \nPort Authority's essential role in the economic development of \nSoutheastern Pennsylvania and Southern New Jersey. The Port Authority \nowns and operates the Benjamin Franklin, Betsy Ross, Commodore Barry, \nand Walt Whitman bridges as well as the mass transit PATCO High Speed \nLine. The Port Authority is involved in port unification through \nanother of its subsidiaries, the Port of Philadelphia and Camden. \nFinally, the Port Authority has been instrumental in regional \ndevelopment and the commercial revitalization of the Philadelphia-\nCamden waterfront. Its programs include the addition of public \nattractions at Penns Landing and the Camden Aquarium as well as low-\ninterest loans to expand Philadelphia's American Street Enterprise \nZone.\n  Given the importance of revitalizing the Delaware River region, I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

RESOLUTION 109--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \nRELATIVE TO EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES, NATIONAL POLICIES, AND \n                               FEDERALISM\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Enzi) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\nwas referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 109\n\n       Whereas federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our \n     political liberties are best assured by limiting the size and \n     scope of the national government;\n       Whereas the people of the States created the national \n     government when they delegated to it those enumerated \n     governmental powers relating to matters beyond the competence \n     of the individual States;\n       Whereas all other sovereign powers, save those expressly \n     prohibited the States by the Constitution, are reserved to \n     the States or to the people as the tenth amendment to the \n     Constitution requires;\n       Whereas the people of the States are free, subject only to \n     restrictions in the Constitution itself or in \n     constitutionally authorized Act of Congress, to define the \n     moral, political, and legal character of their lives;\n       Whereas in most areas of governmental concern, the States \n     uniquely possess the constitutional authority, resources, and \n     the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to \n     govern accordingly;\n       Whereas the nature of our constitutional system encourages \n     a healthy diversity in the public policies adopted by the \n     people of the several States according to their own \n     conditions, needs, and desires;\n       Whereas acts of the national government, whether executive, \n     legislative, or judicial in nature, that exceed the \n     enumerated powers of that government under the Constitution \n     violate the principle of federalism established by the \n     framers;\n       Whereas policies of the national government should \n     recognize the responsibility of, and should encourage \n     opportunities for, individuals, families, neighborhoods, \n     local governments, and private associations to achieve their \n     personal, social, and economic objectives through cooperative \n     effort; and\n       Whereas in the absence of clear constitutional or statutory \n     authority, the presumption of sovereignty should rest with \n     the individual States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That executive departments and agencies should \n     adhere, to the extent permitted by law, to the following \n     criteria when formulating and implementing policies that have \n     federalism implications:\n       (1) There should be strict adherence to constitutional \n     principles. Executive departments and agencies should closely \n     examine the constitutional and statutory authority supporting \n     any Federal action that would limit the policymaking \n     discretion of the States, and should carefully assess the \n     necessity for such action. To the extent practicable, the \n     States should be consulted before any such action is \n     implemented.\n       (2) Federal action limiting the policymaking discretion of \n     the States should be taken only where constitutional \n     authority for the action is clear and certain, and the \n     national activity is necessitated by the presence of a \n     problem of national scope.\n       (3) It is important to recognize the distinction between \n     problems of national scope (which may justify Federal action) \n     and problems that are merely common to the States (which will \n     not justify Federal action because individual States, acting \n     individually or together, can effectively manage such \n     issues).\n       (4) Constitutional authority for Federal action is clear \n     and certain only when authority for the action may be found \n     in a specific provision of the Constitution, when there is no \n     provision in the Constitution prohibiting Federal action, and \n     when the action does not encroach upon authority reserved to \n     the States.\n       (5) With respect to national policies administered by the \n     States, the national government should grant the States the \n     maximum administrative discretion possible. Intrusive Federal \n     oversight of State administration is neither necessary nor \n     desirable.\n       (6) When undertaking to formulate and implement policies \n     that have federalism implications, executive departments and \n     agencies should--\n       (A) encourage States to develop their own policies to \n     achieve program objectives and to work with appropriate \n     officials in other States;\n       (B) refrain, to the maximum extent possible, from \n     establishing uniform, national standards for programs and, \n     when possible, defer to the States to establish standards; \n     and\n       (C) when national standards are required, consult with \n     appropriate officials and organizations representing the \n     States in developing those standards.\n       (7) The following special requirements for preemption of \n     State law should be observed:\n       (A) To the extent permitted by law, executive departments \n     and agencies should construe, in regulations and otherwise, a \n     Federal statute to preempt a State law only when the statute \n     contains an express preemption provision, when there is some \n     other firm and palpable evidence compelling the conclusion \n     that the Congress intended preemption of State law, or when \n     the exercise of State authority directly conflicts with the \n     exercise of Federal authority under the Federal statute.\n       (B) If a Federal statute does not preempt State law, \n     executive departments and agencies should construe any \n     authorization in the statute for the issuance of regulations \n     as authorizing preemption of State law by rulemaking only \n     when the statute expressly authorizes issuance of preemptive \n     regulations or when there is some other firm and palpable \n     evidence compelling the conclusion that the Congress intended \n     to delegate to the department or agency the authority to \n     issue regulations preempting State law.\n       (C) Any regulatory preemption of State law should be \n     restricted to the minimum level necessary to achieve the \n     objectives of the statute pursuant to which the regulations \n     are promulgated.\n       (D) When an executive department or agency foresees the \n     possibility of a conflict between State law and federally \n     protected interests within its area of regulatory \n     responsibility, the department or agency should consult, to \n     the extent practicable, with appropriate officials and \n     organizations representing the States in an effort to avoid \n     such a conflict.\n       (E) When an executive department or agency proposes to act \n     through adjudication or rulemaking to preempt State law, the \n     department or agency should provide all affected States \n     notice and an opportunity for appropriate participation in \n     the proceedings.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a concurrent \nresolution I have submitted, the subject of which is important not only \nto my constituents, but to anyone who stands by the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Ironically, while in England last May President Clinton, \nwith little fanfare or media attention, issued Executive Order (EO) \n13083. EO 13083 in both its letter and intent seeks to give executive \ndepartments and agencies greater preemptive authority over State and \nlocal law in the administration of Executive Branch policies. \nUltimately this action is an attempt by the President to promote an \nagenda by circumventing Congress while subverting the Constitution and \nthe principles of a limited federal government that the Framers were so \ncareful to express in writing this document.\n  Mr. President, as members of Congress we have each taken an oath to \nuphold the Constitution. The President has done the same. And as we all \nknow, the Constitution is our nation's most important document. It \nestablishes the way our government works; it establishes the freedoms \nAmerican citizens enjoy; and it provides for protections of those \nfreedoms.\n  The Framers understood that individual freedom and centralized power \nare incompatible. Thus they set out not only to decentralize our \nfederal government, but also to balance the power held at the national \nlevel with the power held by individual states. The Tenth Amendment to \nthe Constitution explicitly expresses this intent. It states ``The \npowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor \nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States \nrespectively, or to the people.'' I believe that sentence is perfectly \nclear, yet our Federal Government continues to grow in size and scope. \nAll three branches of the government are to blame.\n  Is this a reason, however, to allow continued federal infringement \ninto state matters? Must we not at some point ask ourselves where we \ndraw the line? I believe we must if we hope to preserve the meaning of \nthe Constitution.\n  EO 13083 sacrifice states rights and Constitutional principles to \nempower further the Federal Government. It does so by broadly defining \n``matters of national or multi-state scope that justify Federal \naction.'' These loosely defined ``matters'' include any matter of \nconcern that is not confined by a single state's boundaries; any matter \ninvolving a ``need for national standards;'' any matter in which \n``decentralization increases the costs of government;'' any matter in \nwhich ``States would be reluctant to impose necessary regulations \nbecause of fears that regulated business activity will relocate to \nother states;'' and any matter related to ``Federally owned or managed \nproperty or natural resources, trust obligation or international \norganizations.'' Such ambiguous terms give this Administration \ntremendous leeway to implement policies through executive order that \nmight meet resistance in Congress--policies that deserve full \nconsideration by Congress before becoming law. Indeed, a number of \nrecent newspaper articles demonstrate the President's desires to move \nan agenda without Congressional approval. The President's EO would \nallow circumvention of Congress while trampling the Tenth Amendment. \nMr. President, we should be wary of this.\n  This is why I submit today a concurrent resolution expressing the \nsense of\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\nCongress that the intent of the Framers must guide federal executive \ndepartments and agencies when carrying out policies with federalism \nimplications. Through this concurrent resolution Congress would \nreaffirm the principles of federalism the Framers used in writing the \nConstitution and express its sense regarding the criteria federal \nagencies should use in formulating and implementing policies that have \nfederalism implications. Mr. President, I find it difficult when one \nlooks at this resolution in a constitutional context, which is the \ncontext in which we must evaluate this issue, to disagree with its \nfindings and the criteria it establishes. I believe this Congress must \nmake a statement on where it stands with the Executive Branch's \nattempts to encroach, through executive order, on states rights. This \nresolution is an opportunity for Congress to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask through this resolution that each of us reaffirm \nthe pledges we made when we first entered office. I ask that we \nrecognize the importance of local and state governments, their \nabilities to solve their problems on their own terms and the powers \ngiven the states by the Constitution. I ask that we honor the Framers' \nintent to limit the power of the Federal government.\n  A number of organizations representing elected officials in all \nlevels of local government have voiced objections to EO 13083. These \ninclude the National Governors' Association, the National Conference of \nState Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National \nLeague of Cities and the International City/County Management \nAssociation. These groups are opposed to this order not only because of \nits content but because no official from state or local government was \nconsulted in the drafting of the order. Mr. President, I submit for the \nRecord a July 16, 1998, Washington Post article that describes the \nfrustration these groups have with the Administration's lack of \nconsultation. I find it strange that the Administration did not consult \nwith the very groups this Executive Order would most affect.\n  This is not a political issue. This resolution seeks to address an \nexecutive action that strikes at the very foundation of our government \nand of our Constitutional values. The means by which the Clinton \nAdministration hopes to achieve its objectives are an affront to the \nConstitution, the Congress, and the American people at large. It is the \nintent of this Executive Order issued by the President to subvert the \nwill of Congress and the will of the people through executive decree. I \ncannot imagine this is how the Framers intended our Federal democracy \nto work and I urge Congress to remind the executive branch that it is \nmore important to return to the principles established in our \nConstitution than to continue the trend of increasing federal \nauthority.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Los Angeles Times \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Los Angeles Times, Sat., July 4, 1998]\n\n        Clinton to Bypass Congress in Blitz of Executive Orders\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Shogren)\n\n Policy: President will use strategy to move his domestic agenda past \nGOP resistance. He starts today with announcement of warning labels for \n                          unpasteurized juices\n\n       Washington.--Frustrated by a GOP--controlled Congress that \n     lately has rebuffed him on almost every front, President \n     Clinton plans a blitz of executive orders during the next few \n     weeks, part of a White House strategy to make progress on \n     Clinton's domestic agenda with or without congressional help.\n       His first unilateral strike will come today. According to a \n     draft of Clinton's weekly radio address obtained by The \n     Times, he plans to announce a few federal regulation \n     requiring warning labels on containers of fruit and vegetable \n     juices that have not been pasteurized. Congress has not fully \n     funded Clinton's $101-million food safety initiative, which \n     among other things would pay for inspectors to ensure that \n     tainted foods from other countries do not reach American \n     consumers.\n       After that initiative, Clinton will take executive actions \n     later in the week that are intended to improve health care \n     and cut juvenile crime, according to a senior White House \n     official. While not far-reaching, Clinton's proposals are \n     intended to make gradual progress on largely popular social \n     reforms until Republicans in Congress start to cooperate--or \n     lose power after the November elections.\n       ``He's ready to work with Congress if they will work with \n     him. But if they choose partisanship, he will choose \n     progress,'' said Rahm Emanuel, senior policy advisor to the \n     president. The power to issue executive orders originally was \n     intended to give presidents rule-making authority over the \n     executive branch. But many have used it instead for sweeping \n     public policy decisions.\n       Fresh from what aides view as a triumphant trip to China, \n     Clinton is reportedly eager to exercise his executive powers \n     to the hilt.\n       ``He always comes back from these trips with a big head of \n     steam, and this trip has been especially remarkable,'' said \n     Paul Begala, another senior advisor. ``This president has a \n     very strong sense of the powers of the presidency, and is \n     willing to use all of them.''\n       Mindful of the recent Supreme Court decision striking down \n     the line-item veto authority Clinton won last term, the \n     president also hopes his executive-order offensive will \n     pressure Congress to enact his legislative priorities, \n     Emanuel said. ``I am doing what I can to protect our families \n     from contaminated food,'' Clinton says in the draft of \n     today's radio address. ``But Congress must do its part.''\n       The latest series of executive orders is illustrative of a \n     president who has used his unilateral authority more robustly \n     and frequently than most of his predecessors.\n       Just last month, after the Senate rejected sweeping anti-\n     smoking legislation, Clinton announced a survey on what \n     cigarette brands teenagers smoke--in hopes of shaming the \n     tobacco companies into getting serious about cutting teen \n     smoking.\n       On the same day, eager to make health care fixes that \n     Congress has not, he announced new coverage under the \n     Medicare health insurance program for the elderly and charged \n     federal agencies with signing up millions more poor children \n     for Medicaid.\n       Some in Congress have argued that Clinton's use of \n     executive authority has gone too far, and several outside \n     critics agree. ``Clinton is pushing the envelope,'' says \n     David Schoenbrod, a professor at New York Law School who is \n     an expert in the field. ``He's consistently trying to take \n     more power than Congress gives him.''.\n       With most of his executive orders, no matter how \n     incremental, Clinton hopes to prod Congress to pass more \n     ambitious versions. For instance, last year he extended \n     broader family leave provisions for federal employees while \n     pushing Congress to pass legislation to provide similar \n     opportunities for all other workers.\n       Clinton forewarned the country about his zeal for \n     exercising executive powers in his 1992 acceptance speech at \n     the Democratic National Convention, saying: ``President Bush: \n     If you won't use your power to help people, step aside, I \n     will.'' Of course, other presidents have used executive \n     authority to meet their policy goals. Abraham Lincoln used it \n     to declare the slaves free. Franklin D. Roosevelt used it to \n     help set up the New Deal. Harry S. Truman used it to \n     integrate the armed forces. But Clinton has rewritten the \n     manual on how to use executive powers with gusto, some \n     professors and analysts argue. His formula includes pressing \n     the limits of his regulatory authority, signing executive \n     orders and using other unilateral means to obtain his policy \n     priorities when Congress fails to embrace them.\n       Clearly, the growing antagonism between the president and \n     Congress makes it likely that Clinton will continue to govern \n     by fiat.\n       ``It depends on the political environment whether \n     presidents push their limits or not,'' said Marci Hamilton, \n     professor of constitutional law at Cardozo Law School in New \n     York. ``Clinton has more incentive to do it because he's \n     stuck with a Congress that is not politically aligned with \n     him.'' This is all the more true this year, since Congress \n     feels empowered to ignore the president as a result of the \n     legal crisis he faces because of independent counsel Kenneth \n     W. Starr's investigation.\n       ``This president has extraordinary lame-duck status,'' \n     Hamilton added. ``There is very little incentive for Congress \n     to go along with him. A president who has a strong working \n     relationship and looks powerful to Congress is less likely to \n     push the limits.'' But analysts charge that Congress \n     continues to create the problem by ceding so much authority \n     to the president. In one recent example, Congress directed \n     the Federal Communications Commission to subsidize the wiring \n     of schools, libraries and rural health care facilities for \n     high-speed Internet access, but did not provide the money to \n     do so. Now it blames the FCC for passing on costs to \n     telephone companies, which are in turn passing on costs to \n     consumers.\n       ``The bottom line is the Congress gave the administration \n     power to do this. But they'd like to have it both ways,'' \n     said Jeremy Taylor, ``They want to say: `I voted for \n     universal Internet service, but I did not vote for a tax hike \n     to pay for it.' It's this lack of responsibility on the part \n     of Congress that has transformed American politics.''\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8924-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8927-S8944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                NICKLES (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3272\n\n  Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Sessions) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 2260) making appropriations for the \nDepartments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related \nagencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2____.

Any amounts remaining in such designated \n     fund after 5 years following the date of enactment of this \n     Act shall be applied to the Federal deficit or, if there is \n     no Federal deficit, to reducing the Federal debt.\n       (g) Nonsupplanting Requirement.--Funds made available under \n     this Act to units of local government shall not be used to \n     supplant State or local funds, but shall be used to increase \n     the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds made \n     available under this Act, be made available from State or \n     local sources.\n       (h) Matching Funds.--The Federal share of a grant received \n     under this Act may not exceed 90 percent of the costs of a \n     program or proposal funded under this Act.

To be eligible to \n     receive a grant with amounts set aside under this subsection, \n     an Indian tribal government shall submit to the Attorney \n     General an application in such form and containing such \n     information as the Attorney General may by regulation \n     require.\n       (d) Unavailability and Inaccuracy of Information.--\n       (1) Data for states.--For purposes of this section, if data \n     regarding part 1 violent crimes in any State for the 3 most \n     recent calendar years is unavailable, insufficient, or \n     substantially inaccurate, the Director shall utilize the best \n     available comparable data regarding the number of violent \n     crimes for such years for such State for the purposes of \n     allocation of any funds under this Act.\n       (2) Possible inaccuracy of data for units of local \n     government.--In addition to the provisions of paragraph (1), \n     if the Director believes that the reported rate of part 1 \n     violent crimes or legal expenditure information for a unit of \n     local government is insufficient or inaccurate, the Director \n     shall--\n       (A) investigate the methodology used by such unit to \n     determine the accuracy of the submitted data; and\n       (B) when necessary, use the best available comparable data \n     regarding the number of violent crimes or legal expenditure \n     information for such years for such unit of local government.\n\n     SEC. 6. UTILIZATION OF PRIVATE SECTOR.\n\n       Funds or a portion of funds allocated under this Act may be \n     utilized to contract with private, nonprofit entities or \n     community-based organizations to carry out the purposes \n     specified under section 2(a)(2).\n\n     SEC. 7.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the populations of whales that occur in waters of the \n     United States are resources of substantial ecological, \n     scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value;\n       (2) whale populations--\n       (A) form a significant component of marine ecosystems;\n       (B) are the subject of intense research;\n       (C) provide for a multimillion dollar whale watching \n     tourist industry that provides the public an opportunity to \n     enjoy and learn about great whales and the ecosystems of \n     which the whales are a part; and\n       (D) are of importance to Native Americans for cultural and \n     subsistence purposes;\n       (3) whale populations are in various stages of recovery, \n     and some whale populations, such as the northern right whale \n     (Eubaleana glacialis) remain perilously close to extinction;\n       (4) the interactions that occur between ship traffic, \n     commercial fishing, whale watching vessels, and other \n     recreational vessels and whale populations may affect whale \n     populations adversely;\n       (5) the exploration and development of oil, gas, and hard \n     mineral resources, marine debris, chemical pollutants, noise, \n     and other anthropogenic sources of change in the habitat of \n     whales may affect whale populations adversely;\n       (6) the conservation of whale populations is subject to \n     difficult challenges related to--\n       (A) the migration of whale populations across international \n     boundaries;\n       (B) the size of individual whales, as that size precludes \n     certain conservation research procedures that may be used for \n     other animal species, such as captive research and breeding;\n       (C) the low reproductive rates of whales that require long-\n     term conservation programs to ensure recovery of whale \n     populations; and\n       (D) the occurrence of whale populations in offshore waters \n     where undertaking research, monitoring, and conservation \n     measures is difficult and costly;\n       (7)(A) the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator \n     of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has \n     research and regulatory responsibility for the conservation \n     of whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and\n       (B) the heads of other Federal agencies and the Marine \n     Mammal Commission established under section 201 of the Marine \n     Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1401) have related \n     research and management activities under the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);\n       (8) the funding available for the activities described in \n     paragraph (8) is insufficient to support all necessary whale \n     conservation and recovery activities; and\n       (9) there is a need to facilitate the use of funds from \n     non-Federal sources to carry out the conservation of whales.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL WHALE CONSERVATION FUND.\n\n       Section 4 of the National Fish and Wildlife Establishment \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 3703) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(f)(1) In carrying out the purposes under section 2(b), \n     the Foundation may establish a national whale conservation \n     endowment fund, to be used by the Foundation to support \n     research, management activities, or educational programs that \n     contribute to the protection, conservation, or recovery of \n     whale populations in waters of the United States.\n       ``(2)(A) In a manner consistent with subsection (c)(1), the \n     Foundation may--\n       ``(i) accept, receive, solicit, hold, administer, and use \n     any gift, devise, or bequest made to the Foundation for the \n     express purpose of supporting whale conservation; and\n       ``(ii) deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph (1) \n     any funds made available to the Foundation under this \n     subparagraph, including any income or interest earned from a \n     gift, devise, or bequest received by the Foundation under \n     this subparagraph.\n       ``(B) To raise funds to be deposited in the endowment fund \n     under paragraph (1), the Foundation may enter into \n     appropriate arrangements to provide for the design, \n     copyright, production, marketing, or licensing, of logos, \n     seals, decals, stamps, or any other item that the Foundation \n     determines to be appropriate.\n       ``(C)(i) The Secretary of Commerce may transfer to the \n     Foundation for deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph \n     (1)--\n       ``(I) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the \n     Secretary under section 105(a)(1) of the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1375(a)(1)) as a civil \n     penalty assessed by the Secretary under that section; or\n       ``(II) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the \n     Secretary as a settlement or award for damages in a civil \n     action or other legal proceeding relating to damage of \n     natural resources.\n       ``(ii) The Directors of the Board shall ensure that any \n     amounts transferred to the Foundation under clause (i) for \n     the endowment fund under paragraph (1) are deposited in that \n     fund in accordance with this subparagraph.\n       ``(3) It is the intent of Congress that in making \n     expenditures from the endowment fund under paragraph (1) to \n     carry out activities specified in that paragraph, the \n     Foundation should give priority to funding projects that \n     address the conservation of populations of whales that the \n     Foundation determines--\n       ``(A) are the most endangered (including the northern right \n     whale (Eubaleana glacialis)); or\n       ``(B) most warrant, and are most likely to benefit from, \n     research managment, or educational activities that may be \n     funded with amounts made available from the fund.\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\n       ``(g) In carrying out any action on the part of the \n     Foundation under subsection (f), the Directors of the Board \n     shall consult with the Administrator of the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration and the Marine Mammal \n     Commission.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                LIEBERMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMNT NO. 3280\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Mack, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nBreaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Smith of Oregon) proposed an \namendment to the bill, S. 2260, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 6____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING JAPAN'S RECESSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Japan share common goals of \n     peace, stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in East \n     and Southeast Asia and around the world.\n       (2) Japan's economic and financial crisis represents a new \n     challenge to United States-Japanese cooperation to achieve \n     these common goals and threatens the economic stability of \n     East and Southeast Asia and the United States.\n       (3) A strong United States-Japanese alliance is critical to \n     stability in East and Southeast Asia.\n       (4) The importance of the United States-Japanese alliance \n     was reaffirmed by the President of the United States and the \n     Prime Minister of Japan in the April 1996 Joint Security \n     Declaration.\n       (5) United States-Japanese bilateral military cooperation \n     was enhanced with the revision of the United States \n     Guidelines for Defense Cooperation in 1997.\n       (6) The Japanese economy, the second largest in the world \n     and over 2 times larger than the economy in the rest of East \n     Asia, has been growing at a little over 1 percent annually \n     since 1991 and is currently in a recession with some \n     forecasts suggesting that it will contract by 1.5 percent in \n     1998.\n       (7) The estimated $574,000,000,000 of problem loans in \n     Japan's banking sector and other problems associated with an \n     unstable banking sector remain the major roadblock to \n     economic recovery in Japan.\n       (8) The recent weakness in the yen, following a 10 percent \n     depreciation of the yen against the dollar over the last 5 \n     months and a 45 percent depreciation since 1995, has placed \n     competitive price pressures on United States industries and \n     workers and is putting downward pressure on China and the \n     rest of the economies in East and Southeast Asia to begin \n     another round of competitive currency devaluations.\n       (9) Japan's current account surplus has increased by 60 \n     percent over the last 12 months from 71,579,000,000 yen in \n     1996 to 114,357,000,000 yen in 1997.\n       (10) A period of deflation in Japan would lead to lower \n     demand for United States products.\n       (11) The unnecessary and burdensome regulation of the \n     Japanese market constrains Japanese economic growth and \n     raises costs to business and consumers.\n       (12) Deregulating Japan's economy and spurring economic \n     growth would ultimately benefit the Japanese people with a \n     higher standard of living and a more secure future.\n       (13) Japan's economic recession is slowing the growth of \n     the United States gross domestic product and job creation in \n     the United States.\n       (14) Japan has made significant efforts to restore economic \n     growth with a 16,000,000,000,000 yen stimulus package that \n     includes 4,500,000,000,000 yen in tax cuts and \n     11,500,000,000,000 yen in government spending, a Total Plan \n     to restore stability to the private banking sector, and joint \n     intervention with the United States to strengthen the value \n     of the yen in international currency markets.\n       (15) The people of Japan expressed deep concern about \n     economic conditions and government leadership in the Upper \n     House elections held on July 12, 1998.\n       (16) The Prime Minister of Japan tendered his resignation \n     on July 13, 1998, to take responsibility for the Liberal \n     Democratic Party's poor election results and to acknowledge \n     the desire of the people of Japan for new leadership to \n     restore economic stability.\n       (17) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect \n     on the economy of the United States and is now seriously \n     threatening the 9 years of unprecedented economic expansion \n     in the United States.\n       (18) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect \n     on the recovery of the East and Southeast Asian economies.\n       (19) The American people and the countries of East and \n     Southeast Asia are looking for a demonstration of Japanese \n     leadership and close United States-Japanese cooperation in \n     resolving Japan's economic crisis.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the \n     United States Trade Representative should emphasize the \n     importance of financial deregulation, including banking \n     reform, market deregulation, and restructuring bad bank debt \n     as fundamental to Japan's economic recovery; and\n       (2) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of \n     Commerce, and the Secretary of State should communicate to \n     the Japanese Government that the first priority of the new \n     Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet should be to restore \n     economic growth in Japan and promote stability in \n     international financial markets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       BUMPERS AMENDMENT NO. 3281\n\n  Mr. GREGG (for Mr. Bumpers) proposed an amendment the bill, S. 2260, \nsupra;

(a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the \n     ``American Competitiveness Act''.\n       (b) References in Act.--Except as otherwise specifically \n     provided in this Act, whenever in this Act an amendment or \n     repeal is expressed as an amendment to or a repeal of a \n     provision, the reference shall be deemed to be made to the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).\n       (c) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) American companies today are engaged in fierce \n     competition in global markets.\n       (2) Companies across America are faced with severe high \n     skill labor shortages that threaten their competitiveness.\n       (3) The National Software Alliance, a consortium of \n     concerned government, industry, and academic leaders that \n     includes the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force, has \n     concluded that ``The supply of computer science graduates is \n     far short of the number needed by industry.''. The Alliance \n     concludes that the current severe understaffing could lead to \n     inflation and lower productivity.\n       (4) The Department of Labor projects that the United States \n     economy will produce more than 130,000 information technology \n     jobs in each of the next 10 years, for a total of more than \n     1,300,000.\n       (5) Between 1986 and 1995, the number of bachelor's degrees \n     awarded in computer science declined by 42 percent. \n     Therefore, any short-term increases in enrollment may only \n     return the United States to the 1986 level of graduates and \n     take several years to produce these additional graduates.\n       (6) A study conducted by Virginia Tech for the Information \n     Technology Association of America estimates that there are \n     more than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled \n     information technology workers in American companies.\n       (7) The Hudson Institute estimates that the unaddressed \n     shortage of skilled workers throughout the United States \n     economy will result in a 5-percent drop in the growth rate of \n     GDP. That translates into approximately $200,000,000,000 in \n     lost output, nearly $1,000 for every American.\n       (8) It is necessary to deal with the current situation with \n     both short-term and long-term measures.\n       (9) In fiscal year 1997, United States companies and \n     universities reached the cap of 65,000 on H-1B temporary \n     visas a month before the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal \n     year 1998 the cap is expected to be reached as early as May \n     if Congress takes no action. And it will be hit earlier each \n     year until backlogs develop of such a magnitude as to prevent \n     United States companies and researchers from having any \n     timely access to skilled foreign-born professionals.\n       (10) It is vital that more American young people be \n     encouraged and equipped to enter technical fields, such as \n     mathematics, engineering, and computer science.\n       (11) If American companies cannot find home-grown talent, \n     and if they cannot bring talent to this country, a large \n     number are likely to move key operations overseas, sending \n     those and related American jobs with them.\n       (12) Inaction in these areas will carry significant \n     consequences for the future of American competitiveness \n     around the world and will seriously undermine efforts to \n     create and keep jobs in the United States.\n       (d) Establishment of H1-C Nonimmigrant Category.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 101(a)(15)(H)(i) (8 U.S.C. \n     1101(a)(15)(H)(i)) is amended--\n       (A) by inserting ``and other than services described in \n     clause (c)'' after ``subparagraph (O) or (P)'';

Mr. President, I rise to co-sponsor S. Con. Res. \n105, a resolution which I hope will bring justice to the many suffering \npeople of the former Yugoslavia. For over a decade now Serbian leader \nSlobodan Milosevic has executed his policies of hatred, policies which \nhave led to oppression and murder. And I am sorry to say that \nMilosevic's brutal assaults against the people of Bosnia and Croatia \nhave gone unpunished.\n  Milosevic now seeks to extend his reign of terror over greater \nSerbia. His efforts already have destroyed the peace, security, and \nvery lives of the people of Kosovo. He has turned Kosovo, once an \nindependent state within Yugoslavia, into a virtual prison for non-\nSerbs. He has driven Kosovo's native Albanians, who have lived in the \nBalkans longer than any other ethnic group and who comprise 90 percent \nof the region's population, to flee the area out of fear for their \nlives and the lives of their families.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important for us to keep in mind that, \nwhile the United States continues to offer peaceful and diplomatic \nsupport to the victims of Milosevic's campaign of terror, Serbian \nleaders continue their heinous policies. I am convinced that we must \nsend a strong signal to Milosevic\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\nand his cronies in order to stop the violence and oppression they are \ninflicting on the people of Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we in the United States, the birthplace \nand homeland of freedom, have a responsibility to bring Milosevic and \nhis fellow perpetrators to the Hague and make them answer for their \ncrimes. It grieves me that so many people in the Balkans have suffered \nfrom Milosevic's policies of racial cleansing. I hope that a trial will \nend the suffering of countless civilians in Kosovo. I also hope that \nMilosevic's trial will send a message to other dictators that crimes \nagainst humanity will not be tolerated by the world community.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8946-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONTEMPORARY AMERICAN THEATER FESTIVAL AND THE TOWN HALL MEETING ON THE \n                        PERFORMING ARTS AND RACE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, in June 1997, President \nClinton announced his Initiative on Race, One America in the 21st \nCentury. His Initiative was created to encourage all Americans to work \ntogether in understanding and dealing with our racial differences. In \nthe course of the past year, President Clinton has traveled around the \ncountry hosting several events to pursue these goals and foster a \nnational dialogue on the subject. I am proud to tell you that West \nVirginia not only listened to President Clinton's announcement but \nanswered his call to join him in taking action on this important \neffort.\n  The Contemporary American Theater Festival (CATF), located in \nShepherdstown, West Virginia, commissioned a play on Asian racism \nentitled Carry the Tiger to the Mountain, and Governor Cecil Underwood \nformed his own Initiative on Race, One West Virginia. Together, they \nplanned a Town Hall Meeting on the Performing Arts and Race which was \nheld this past weekend in Shepherdstown and will be broadcast by West \nVirginia Public Television this coming Thursday and Sunday.\n  Over 300 people attended the afternoon performance of Tiger and the \nTown Hall Meeting which followed and was narrated by Kwame Holman, of \nThe Newshour with Jim Lehrer. The panelists for the event included \nchoreographer Garth Fagan, who recently won a Tony Award for The Lion \nKing; Angelo Oh, a member of the President's Advisory Board on Race; \nMolly Smith, the Artistic Director of Arena Stage; George Takei, a \ntheater and television actor from Star Trek; Helen Zia, contributing \neditor to Ms. Magazine; Christian McBride, a jazz artist and composer; \nAbel Lopez, president of Non-Traditional Casting Project; Dr. Simon \nPerry, a faculty member from Marshall University; and Liz Lerman, \nartistic director of Dance Exchange. The audience included local \ncommunity members of various backgrounds, West Virginia NAACP \nactivists, and over 100 members of the Organization of Chinese \nAmericans. This impressive list of panelists and audience gathered in \nthis small town and produced a level of dialogue on the arts and race \nto further enhance President Clinton's vision for One America.\n  The afternoon discussion brought forth many ideas and questions in \nregard to the arts and race. The panelists discussed the role of the \nperforming arts in society, how the depiction of minorities as \nstereotypes can further intensify racial misunderstandings, and how if \nwe as a society would think of culture more than race, then perhaps we \ncould succeed more. As George Takei mentioned, the performing arts are \n``a forum for understanding and communication.'' Yet so much depends on \nwho does the articulating and who has access to the art being \npresented. In its most truthful essence, the arts can allow ``cultures \nto touch each other,'' as Molly Smith of Arena Stage pointed out. And \nif we can ``touch each other'' or understand each other, then we can \nbegin easing the tensions that separate us.\n  These are but a few of the ideas discussed in Shepherdstown at the \nTown Hall Meeting, but you can see the wealth of communication that \ntranspired on the subject in just a few short hours. Imagine if a \ncommunity in every state hosted a similar event to foster and promote \nhonesty and understanding of our racial differences.\n  I am very proud of my fellow West Virginians' efforts and success in \nanswering President Clinton's challenge to work towards living as One \nAmerica in the 21st Century. And I congratulate Ed Herendeen, the \nproducing director of CATF, and Cherylene Lee, the playwright of this \ncommissioned work, for bringing Carry the Tiger to the Mountain to West \nVirginia for its world premier season. CATF is dedicated to promoting \nlive, provocative theater that challenges us to think about issues in \nour society, and once again it has achieved that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8947-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO ALAN SHEPARD: NEW HAMPSHIRE NATIVE AND FIRST AMERICAN TO FLY \n                                IN SPACE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

On May 5, 1961, at a time when \nthe American space program was marked by many failures and setbacks, \nShepard courageously made a 15-minute suborbital flight, spending five \nof those minutes in space, and forever distinguishing himself as an \nAmerican hero. Shepard was also one of the seven original Mercury \nastronauts, NASA's first space pioneers.\n  On January 31, 1971, Shepard returned to space for his second and \nlast flight as the commander of Apollo 14. This trip allowed Shepard to \nbecome the fifth of only twelve Americans ever to walk on the moon, and \nthe only man to hit golf balls playfully on the lunar surface.\n  In addition to his space endeavors, Shepard headed NASA's astronaut \noffice in the years between his two flights, and he began investing in \nbanks, oil wells, quarter horses and real estate. Shepard was also a \nNavy test pilot, sacrificing a great deal for the future of his \ncountry. He retired from the space agency and from the Navy as a rear \nadmiral in 1974, in pursuit of many and varied interests.\n  Alan Shepard was known for his determination and ready wit. He never \nbacked down from a challenge, and was characterized as the most eager \nto be picked from among three astronauts who were finalists for the \nhistoric first flight. These traits are exactly what make Alan Shepard \nnothing short of a hero in American history. Without his willingness to \nmake sacrifices for the good of his country, the United States of \nAmerica never could have achieved such glorious accomplishments in its \nspace programs. He was a modest explorer, a man of integrity, a modern \nrole model and one for ages to come. The bravery of this man gave \nAmericans the confidence to continue pursuing the space program, in \nspite of the enormous challenges that were in sight.\n  Alan Shepard will be missed dearly across the nation, and especially \nin Derry, New Hampshire, the town of his birth. His motivation and \ndedication to the American space program and the American people serve \nto encourage all to welcome challenges and follow dreams to whatever \nheights they may soar. Let us mark the passing of this great leader not \nwith sadness, but with gratitude and deep appreciation for being such a \nvaliant American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8947-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8947-S8948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO CHARLES L.

Fox will retire as Senior Vice \nPresident, Congressional Relations for the Raytheon Company. Under \nChuck's leadership and dedication, Raytheon has contributed \ntremendously to the effectiveness of our national security.\n  Mr. Fox has headed Raytheon's Congressional Relations Office since \nMay\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\n1995. In this capacity he was responsible for ensuring that issues and \nprograms of interest to Raytheon in supporting national security \nrequirements were communicated to members and staff of Congress in an \neffective manner. Mr. President, I can tell you, I know of no one more \nprofessional than Mr. Fox. In all his dealings with the Congress, he \nwas a true professional, dedicated to ensuring national security \ninterests, and the security of our country were always well served.\n  Prior to joining Raytheon, Chuck served a distinguished career of \nmore than twenty seven years in the United States Air Force, retiring \nas a Colonel. He served in a variety of staff, operations and command \npositions around the world. He served as both a base and wing \ncommander, as well as the Chief of Staff of the Pacific Air Forces.

CLARK BURRUS\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments to honor Mr. Clark Burrus, a distinguished professional and a \ncitizen par excellence. Mr. Burrus has recently announced his \nretirement from First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc. Although it was \nwith great sadness that I heard of Mr. Burrus' retirement, this \nmilestone provides an opportune moment to praise him for his long \nrecord of achievements. He has served Chicago and our nation in so many \ndifferent ways that it is almost impossible to enumerate them all.\n  Mr. Burrus was born in Chicago and attended Englewood High School on \nthe city's South side. Following high school, Mr. Burrus matriculated \nat Texas State University where he excelled in both academics and \nathletics. After his studies at Texas State University, Mr. Burrus \nreturned to his hometown and continued his education at Roosevelt \nUniversity, where he received both a Masters Degree in Public \nAdministration and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting.\n  Clark Burrus began his five decades of service to the City of Chicago \nduring the administration of Mayor Martin Kenelley, and continued to \nserve under Mayors Richard J. Daley, Michael Bilandic and Jane Byrne. \nThe hard work and dedication of Mr. Burrus were recognized when the \nlate Mayor Richard J. Daley named him City Comptroller in 1973. As City \nComptroller, Mr. Burrus was the Chief Fiscal Officer of the city and \nsupervised the Department of Finance. Under his able guidance, the \nstatus of city-issued bonds climbed to its first Double-A rating. Mr. \nBurrus is also credited with engineering the low-interest rate mortgage \nrevenue bond program of Chicago, the first such program in the United \nStates.\n  In 1979, Mr. Burrus left public life and joined the First Bank of \nChicago as a Senior Vice President in the Asset and Liability \nManagement Department. Almost twenty years later, Mr. Burrus has risen \nto the position of Vice Chairman of First Chicago Capital Markets, \nInc., a subsidiary of First Chicago NBD Corporation. Mr. Burrus also \nserves as the head of the Public Banking Department. The departments \nunder the supervision of Mr. Burrus provide critical commercial banking \nservices to a wide array of fields, including health care, higher \neducation, governmental and cultural institutional markets.\n  Although he left public life in 1979, Mr. Burrus's commitment to the \nwelfare of his hometown and fellow citizens did not end. Mr. Burrus has \nsince served as Chairman of the Board of the Chicago Transit Authority \nand of its Deferred Compensation Committee. Additionally, Mr. Burrus \nwas a board member of the Regional Transportation Authority, a member \nof its Strategic Planning Committee, and a member of the Chairman's \nCoordinating Committee. Recently, Mr. Burrus was appointed to the Cook \nCounty Deferred Compensation Committee. He is also a current member and \npast chairman of the Chicago Transit Authority's Pension Board of \nTrustees, and has served as a trustee of five other public pension \nfunds. In addition, Mr. Burrus presently serves on a remarkable twenty \neight boards and commissions. I never cease to be amazed at how well \nClark Burrus is able to perform so many professional and civic duties \nsimultaneously.\n  Mr. President, the civic service and public achievements of Mr. Clark \nBurrus are of breathtaking dimensions. Indeed, they serve as an \nenduring testament of his passionate commitment to the betterment of \nhis community. As Mr. Burrus retires to private life, he leaves behind \na record of excellence that will long be appreciated, and is model of \nservice for all Americans to follow. I wish him Godspeed and hope that \nhis years of retirement will be as enriching as his years of public \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8948-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATING KATRINA RUIZ AND MARCO CAKNESELLA\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate Katrina Ruiz and Marco Caknesella of Miami, Florida. \nKatrina and Marco were selected as national finalists in the 1998 Do \nthe Write Thing Challenge Program sponsored by the National Campaign to \nStop Violence. The National Campaign to Stop Violence is a coalition of \nbusinesses and nonprofit organizations who have joined together in an \neffort to work with young people to end youth violence in America.\n  Katrina, Marco and hundreds of other middle school students in Miami \ntook part in the Do the Write Thing Challenge Program this year. The Do \nthe Write Thing Challenge Program asks middle school students in 12 \ncities across the United States to provide a written commitment to \nreducing violence in their lives by submitting a written answer to the \nquestion ``What can I do about the violence in my life?''\n  It is always a pleasure to hear about programs, like the Do the Write \nThing Challenge Program, which encourage young people to begin to think \nabout the ways that they, as individuals, can have an impact upon the \nproblems which confront their community. I am confident that Katrina, \nMarco and the thousands of other young people across the nation who \nparticipated in the program will set a positive example for their peers \nas they fulfill their written commitment to reduce violence in their \nown lives.\n  I commend Katrina Ruiz and Marco Caknesella for their selection for \nthis high honor and wish them all the best for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8948-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8948-S8949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IMPORTANCE OF ACCURATE ECONOMIC STATISTICS\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to discuss a very \nimportant issue today that often does not get the attention that it \ndeserves--the need for accurate economic statistics.\n  Policymakers rely on statistics to guide them in their decision-\nmaking process. For instance, the Federal Reserve sets interest rates \nbased on the reported level of economic activity and inflation; \nCongress and the Administration craft multi-year budget proposals using \nan economic baseline that is built upon current data; we examine the \neffectiveness of different tax and fiscal reforms by their effect on \nmeasured savings rates.\n  In all cases, we take for granted that these building block \nstatistics give us a reliable portrayal of current economic conditions. \nWe seldom consider just how difficult it is to construct them nor \nrealize that it is getting harder to do so as our economy continues to \nevolve.\n  We can no longer hope to measure overall economic activity by \ncounting how many widgets roll off an assembly line. We have to put a \nvalue on financial and high-tech services. Increasingly, we will also \nneed to be tracking\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\ninternet commerce. It is imperative that our data collection methods \nkeep pace with our rapidly changing economy. Our statistical agencies \nemploy exceptionally talented people who are working hard to ensure \nthat this happens.\n  In the last several years, one can point to many notable data \nenhancements from our statistical agencies. For instance, BLS has \nworked hard to improve the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index; BEA \nhas implemented ``chain-type'' measures for GDP which provide a more up \nto date reading of the economy.\n  Despite such progress, more needs to be done. Growth is booming in \nthe service sector, where we have the least amount of source data. We \nneed to increase our coverage of this important part of our economy. It \nis imperative that we do so immediately, because there are already \nsigns that our statistics are lagging behind the economy's advances. \nThere has been a growing discrepancy between economic activity measured \non a product basis and an income basis. In recent years, Gross Domestic \nProduct (GDP) has been growing 0.5 percentage points slower than Gross \nDomestic Income on an annual basis. In theory, these two items should \ngrow at the same rate since they are technically measuring the same \nthing.\n  Economists speculate that GDP growth is being understated because \nmuch of our recent economic growth has been concentrated in the hard to \nmeasure service sector. While a 0.5 percentage point difference in GDP \ngrowth might not seem like a lot, it has an enormous effect on our \nbudget projections. Over a five year period, this difference could \nyield up to a cumulative $140 billion swing in our surplus estimates. \nIndeed, many believe that an understatement of GDP is a major reason \nwhy CBO, OMB and major private economic forecasters have been \nunderestimating revenues as of late.\n  Thus, if we want to ensure that we have more accurate budget \nforecasts going forward, we should be directing our energies at \nimproving the accuracy of the data used to build these forecasts. The \nBureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) which compiles the GDP series has \nlaid out an ambitious agenda to make just such improvements to its data \ncollection procedures. Amongst other things, they are seeking to step \nup their coverage of the information sector in order to ensure that \ncomprehensive data is available for the computer industry.\n  This is just part of their initiative to improve the GDP accounts. In \norder to do so, they have requested an additional $4.5 million. While \nthis money is hard to come by given our tight budget caps, I think it \nis fair to say that this investment might have one of the highest rates \nof return within this bill. Indeed, in recent testimony to the JEC, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said that statistics are ``one of \nthe areas where I believe the payoff is of sufficiently large magnitude \nwhere very small amounts of money can have very large potential \nrewards.''\n  I hope that we take heed of Chairman Greenspan's words and that we \nwill be able to find the funds to allow our statistical agencies to \nimprove their data collection processes. I believe that this is the \nmost effective way to improve the accuracy of our budget forecasts and \nenhance the countless other policy decisions yet to be made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8948-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO THOMAS ESTES\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the life and accomplishments of Thomas Clifford Estes, of \nNew Ipswich, New Hampshire, who recently passed away at the age of 66.\n  The family of Tom Estes can take comfort and pride in the way that he \nlived his life. Born on November 28, 1931, to the late Bedford and \nEmily Estes of New York, Tom graduated from Erasmus Hall High School \nand later studied at RCA Institute.\n  Following his father's distinguished example in serving this country \nin the armed forces. Tom joined the United States Navy in 1951, shortly \nafter the outbreak of the Korean War. For three of his four years of \nactive duty, Tom served on the U.S.S. Tarawa, a Navy aircraft carrier \nthat entered the Asian war zone. He earned a number of Navy awards, \nincluding the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, \nthe China Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good \nConduct Medal and the Navy Occupation Service Medal.\n  Tom's service to the nation was commendable, not just during the \nKorean War, but throughout his thirty-two years of Federal civil \nservice. He began his career as a quality assurance engineer for the \nUnited States military in Florida and later moved to Dallas, Texas, \nbefore settling in New Hampshire in 1967. Upon his retirement, Tom was \nrecognized by the Defense Logistics Agency for his contributions.\n  Tom was admired for his integrity, dedication to his community and \npositive demeanor. He remained a devoted husband to his wife, Mary, \nthroughout almost thirty-five years of marriage and helped care for his \ndisabled sister for many years. An accomplished chess player, Tom also \nenjoyed baseball and studied the law. He and his wife ran a small, \ntwenty-acre farm in New Ipswich for many years. He was a man who cared \nabout the needs of others and his community, whose sense of humor, \ncheery smile and knack for storytelling will be missed by all who knew \nhim.\n  Tom will be buried with military honors at Arlington National \nCemetery on Monday, August 3, 1998. I extend my deepest sympathies to \nhis wife, Mary, his daughter, Evelyn, his sons Thomas and Peter, and \nhis sister, Nancy. It is my great pleasure to pay tribute to this \nspecial American in the official Record of the annals of \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8949-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE BLODGETT OVEN COMPANY IN HONOR OF THEIR ONE HUNDRED AND \n                          FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, July 25, 1998, is a great day for \nVermont as we celebrate the sesquicentennial anniversary of the \nBlodgett Oven Company. On behalf of all Vermonters, I want to wish the \ncompany a very happy anniversary.\n  For one hundred and fifty years, the Blodgett Oven Company has been a \ncommercial cooking products manufacturer in Burlington, Vermont. Their \nproducts are renowned for their reliability and quality. Throughout the \nworld, Blodgett ovens, broilers, steamers, and fryers are depended upon \nby the food service industry. Chefs know that they can trust the \nBlodgett name to deliver efficient, technologically advanced machinery. \nWithin Chittenden County, the Blodgett Oven Company plays an important \nrole, stimulating the local economy by providing hundreds of jobs to \narea residents.\n  Mr. President, the Blodgett Oven Company is one of the most \nsuccessful businesses in the state of Vermont.

Mr. President, this year's Captive Nations \ncelebration is dedicated to the ``Memory of the Over 100 Million \nVictims of Communism.''\n  Behind the Iron Curtain millions were killed and millions more were \nvictimized by the societal and political structures that coerced \nconformity and attempted to dictate thought in these authoritarian \nstates.\n  The term victim in this context conjures up SS troops and gas \nchambers, the purges under Stalin, Hungary in 1956, and the Prague \nSpring. Countless tragedies are recounted in the stories of those who \nfought for freedom and died at the hands of a racist regime bent on \ngenocide or in confrontation with a relentless and overpowering Red \nArmy.\n  Fascism lasted for 12 years in Germany.\n  Stalinism lasted twice as long in the Soviet Union.\n  An estimated 6 million perished in Nazi concentration and work camps \nduring World War II.\n  Between 30 and 60 million perished through the work of Stalin's \nsecret police from torture and execution.\n  There were, however, many more who persisted and became victims for \ntheir beliefs but remained clear in their conscience. The yoke of \noppression could\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\nnot smote their passion. That is the essence of the ``Power of the \nPowerless,'' according to Vaclav Havel, dissident, writer, and \npolitical prisoner who is now President of the Czech Republic.\n  The ideas contained in the ``Power of the Powerless'' is what I would \nlike to convey to you on this occasion, because of its lesson in \ntoday's world where Captive Nations are few and the powerless seized \nthe power, because it belonged to them all along.\n  In 1978, Havel wrote:\n\n       A specter is haunting Eastern Europe: the specter of what \n     in the West is called ``dissent.'' This specter has not \n     appeared out of thin air. It is the natural and inevitable \n     consequence of the present historical phase of the system it \n     is haunting. It was born at a time when the system, for a \n     thousand reasons, can no longer base itself on the \n     unadulterated, brutal, and arbitrary application of power, \n     eliminating all expressions of nonconformity. What is more, \n     the system has become so ossified politically that there is \n     practically no way for such nonconformity to be implemented \n     within its official structures.\n\n  The system was exemplified by the greengrocer whose store displays \nthe slogan: ``Workers of the world, unite!''\n  Due to semantics, the greengrocer is indifferent to the slogan.\n  His obedience is verbalized in a manner that does not degrade his \nhumanity so much as the truth. ``I am afraid and therefore \nunquestioningly obedient.''\n  Ten years later, the system collapsed in the wake of dissent. The \nBerlin Wall fell in response to the pressure of East Germans voting \nwith their feet, and within a year a microcosm of the former World \nOrder vanished. Glasnost and Perestroika shook the ossified foundation \nof the Party and its dogma to its core, and the Soviet Union collapsed, \nallowing for self-determination and the birth of democracy in many \nformerly Captive Nations.\n  It was the Power of the Powerless, the greengrocer's humanity, that \neventually brought the system to its knees. Any political system is \ncomprised of the individuals within it, and these individuals, victims \nor conformists, possess the power of conferring legitimacy to the \nsystem.\n  In the former Captive Nations legitimacy waned when the victims \nrefused to perpetuate the lie.\n  When the gap between ideology and daily reality could no longer be \nbridged by pat slogans and prescribed ritual, the system's foundation \ncrumbled.\n  By accepting the rules of the game, individuals became players. But \ntheir refusal to abide by the rules frayed the tightly woven fabric of \nfalsity upon which the system was based.\n  Rejection of the system is encapsulated in the following description:\n\n       One day something in the greengrocer snaps and he stops \n     putting up the slogans merely to ingratiate himself. He stops \n     voting in elections he knows are a farce. He begins to say \n     what he really thinks at political meetings. And he even \n     finds the strength in himself to express solidarity with \n     those whom his conscience commands him to support. In this \n     revolt the greengrocer steps out of living within the lie. He \n     rejects the ritual and breaks the rules of the game. He \n     discovers once more his suppressed identity and dignity. He \n     gives his freedom a concrete significance. His revolt is an \n     attempt to live within the truth.\n\n  In his expression of his identity and human dignity, the greengrocer \nbecomes the victim.\n  He is purged from the system and punished. His actions are a reminder \nthat an alternate truth exists, thus, he is a threat.\n  He has done more than express his dissent, he has illuminated the lie \nthat comprise his surroundings.\n  His power is augmented in its juxtaposition to the facade.\n  It was the many who expressed their identity in those Captive Nations \nwho tarnished the ideological veneer that was to bridge the gap between \ntruth and falsity. They were victimized, often murdered, for their \nunwillingness or incapacity to abide by the rules and forfeit their \ndignity.\n  Legitimacy is the glue that holds the system together. Legitimacy \nmust be conferred by the individuals in the system. Without the power \nof individuals the system must utilize force, coercion and fear to \nmaintain control. The days of an authoritarian state are always \nnumbered, and democracy is the only legitimate social order. It is for \nthis reason, I believe, that in time the remaining Captive Nations--\nCuba, China, North Korea--also will join the community of democratic \nstates. The ideological battle is over, and the system with the only \nsolid basis for its legitimacy--its citizens--won.\n  In memory of the millions who perished under authoritarian regimes, \nit is only right for us to recognize their sacrifice. They rejected the \nfacade and refused to perpetuate or propagate the lie. Their sacrifice \nis also a sobering reminder of our privilege.\n  It is also appropriate and important to recognize the victims who \nsurvived and are witness to the crimes of history. In commemoration of \nthose who perished, it is all the more potent to recognize those who \nwere victims and survived. Today we can applaud those who would not be \nvictimized, the individuals who refused to be swayed by untruths and \npromises of power. They are the ones that I would like to remember \ntoday. The ones who fought tyranny and prevailed have offered the \ngreatest gift to those who tried and failed. They serve as a reminder \nto those around them that living a lie is worse than living in fear. \nAnd in the Captive Nations they were many in 1989 and \nthereafter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8949-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CLIFFORD J.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe youth group from Devonshire Memorial Church in Harrisburg, \nPennsylvania. On Sunday, July 26 ten students from the church will \ntravel to Manning, South Carolina to assist in the rebuilding of the \nMacedonian Baptist Church which the Ku Klux Klan destroyed by fire in \n1996. The young people will also be working to renovate homes of church \nmembers that suffered damage due to the fire.\n  The teenagers, who raised their own support for the trip through \nthings such as church-wide dinners and fundraising letters, will join \napproximately 250 other young people from across the nation to work on \npainting, hanging drywall, repairing roofs and caulking windows.\n  Church burnings are a violent act of hatred against the free exercise \nof religious faith. Arson, which has destroyed many southern African \nAmerican churches, has also destroyed our dignity and our humanity. By \ndedicating their time and effort to rebuilding the walls of a church \nburned by hatred and bigotry, these young men and women are tearing \ndown the walls of violence and racism and restoring faith to the \nChristian community.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending the young \nmen and women of Devonshire Memorial Church for their dedication to \nrestoring a church and a community, as well as the ideals of freedom in \nthis country.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/23/senate-section/article/S8950-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8951]]\n              AMENDMENT NO. 3294, AS MODIFIED, TO S. 2260\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 39, Calendar No. 435.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 39) to reauthorize the African Elephant \n     Conservation Act.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering H.R. 39, the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization \nAct. The bill was introduced by Congressmen Young on January 7, 1997, \nfavorably reported by the House Resources Committee on April 21, 1997, \npassed by the House the same day, and referred to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works. Senator Jeffords introduced a companion \nbill, S. 627, on April 22, 1997. The Committee held a hearing on both \nbills on November 4, 1997, and favorably reported them on May 21, 1998. \nToday we take up the House passed bill to expedite Congressional action \non this important legislation.\n  The bill reauthorizes the African Elephant Conservation Act for four \nyears, through 2002, at the current authorization level of $5 million \nannually. The current law was enacted in 1989, in response to a sharp \ndecline in many populations of African elephants due primarily to \npoaching for ivory. Population estimates vary widely across its range, \nbut the total population is estimated to have declined by as much as 50 \npercent, from 1.3 million elephants in the late 1970's, to less than \n700,000 in 1987. The species continues to decline, with a population of \nabout 540,000 elephants in 1996.\n  The Act established a process for implementing strict ivory import \ncontrols, and established a dedicated fund for cooperative conservation \nprojects in African countries. The Act has been tremendously effective \nin assisting in conservation efforts worldwide. Under the authority of \nthe Act, President Bush established a moratorium on all ivory imports \ninto the United States, which served as the impetus for the worldwide \nban on trade in elephant parts and products, approved by the Parties to \nthe Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora \n(CITES) one year later.\n  Through the Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service has funded 60 projects \nin 19 countries since 1990. The law has generated approximately $22 \nmillion for elephant conservation programs, of which $6.8 million has \nbeen provided by the U.S. Government, with $15.8 million from other \nsources. Indeed, the success of this law has led to similar laws for \nAsian elephants, rhinos and tigers.\n  Again, I am pleased that the Senate is considering this legislation, \nand I hope that the President will sign it into law soon. Thank you, \nMr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the concurrent resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to again address the ongoing \nsituation in my home state of Florida. As I mentioned earlier this \nmonth on the Senate floor, devastating wildfires have ravaged Florida, \nimp;acting all of our 67 counties since May 24, 1998. Since this crisis \nbegan, more than 2,000 separate fires to date have been identified and \nmore than 500,000 acres have been burned.\n  The massive campaign which has been undertaken to contain these fires \nis encouraging. Firefighters from across the country have been part of \nthis effort. On behalf of the state of Florida and its people, I would \nlike to thank all of the states, communities, and families that have \ncommitted resources to these efforts.\n  Today, I join with the Florida Congressional delegation in support of \nH. Con. Res. 298. This resolution expresses our condolences to the \npeople of the state of Florida who have suffered throughout this \nordeal; and commends the important and heroic efforts of the \nfirefighters, as well as the numerous federal, state, and community \nentities aiding in the struggle to contain and extinguish the fires.\n  I appreciate the work of my Senate colleagues who have enabled us to \nbring this resolution to the floor quickly. I hope this swift action by \nCongress will help bring attention to the continuing efforts of \ngovernment and community leaders, and will help lift the spirits of \nthose closely engaged in this battle. I thank the chair and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of H. Con. \nRes. 298, expressing our deepest condolences and support to the State \nand people of Florida for the losses they have suffered as a result of \nwild land fires that occurred throughout June and July of this year.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember that Andrew roared ashore in the \nmiddle of the night and vented its fury on the people of South Florida. \nThe storm severely disrupted the lives of thousands of families. This \nAugust, Floridians will remember Hurricane Andrew with another natural \ndisaster on their minds. Since May 24, a deadly combination of intense \nheat and prolonged drought sparked more than 2,200 forest fires in \nFlorida's 67 counties.\n  Even for a state that is experienced in dealing with natural \ndisasters, these fires have been spawned during what may be one of the \nworst years in Florida meteorological history. In late January and \nearly February--in the midst of our state's dry season--several \nNorthern Florida counties were deluged by massive floods. Not long \nafter, parts of Central Florida were devastated by thunderstorms and \ntornadoes that are more typical in the summer months.\n  The fire crisis is the latest example of our state's climactic \nreversal of fortune in 1998. Florida's hot summer temperatures are \ntypically accompanied by afternoon thunderstorms and tropical weather. \nThis year's heat and drought, and the lush undergrowth and foliage that \nsprung up in the wake of Florida's unusually wet winter, combined to \nfuel the fires that have put the state under a cloud of smoke and \nchased nearly 112,000 residents from their homes--7,040 of them into \nemergency shelters.\n  Florida has sustained almost $300 million in private damage, and \nstate and local governments have spent over $100 million in responding \nto the fires. In a step never before taken in Florida's long history \nwith violent weather,\n\n[[Page S8952]]\n\nevery one of the 45,000 residents of Flagler County--a coastal area \nbetween Jacksonville and Daytona Beach--had to be evacuated from their \nhomes over the Independence Day weekend.\n  Mr. President, Mother Nature has once again subjected Florida to \nunprecedented weather conditions. But with the memories of Andrew's \naftermath still fresh in our minds, we know that the national response \nto our pleas for help is anything but unprecedented--and are moved by \nthe immediacy of Americans' heartfelt offers of assistance.\n  In response to this crisis, Americans from 44 states are fighting \nside-by-side with Floridians to prevent these fires from endangering \nfamilies and engulfing even more homes, businesses, and roads. For \nexample, U.S. Marines, National Guardsmen, and National Weather Service \nmeteorologists from all over the country have converged on Florida.\n  California, Oregon, and South Dakota--states whose residents are not \nstrangers to violent weather and natural disasters--sent nearly 1300 \nfire fighting personnel to Florida. North Carolina, a state that is \neven more heavily forested than my own, sent 47 fire trucks and 169 \nfirefighters to Florida. Pennsylvania, which lost more than 2,200 \ncitizens in less than ten minutes during the catastrophic Johnstown \nflood of 1889, has contributed 89 volunteers to combat this natural \ndisaster in 1998. In fact, so many states have donated equipment that \ntwo-thirds of all the firefighting helicopters in the United States are \nnow working in Florida.\n  Mr. President, I have lived in Florida for more than sixty-one years. \nIn that time, I have never observed wildfires as widespread and \nunmanageable as those that have plagued our state for the last forty-\nfour days. On behalf of 14 million Floridians, I offer my deepest \nthanks to the thousands of Americans who have voluntarily left their \nhomes and risked their lives so that our state's fire victims might not \nlose theirs. They are true heroes, and all of us who proudly call \nFlorida our home are forever in their debt.\n  I am pleased to announce that the Herculean efforts of these brave \nfirefighters were not in vain. Floridians who were forced from their \nhomes have now returned, and almost all of the fires have been brought \nunder control. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport H. Con. Res. 298 to pay tribute to the citizens of Florida and \nthose from around the nation who came to our assistance.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent the concurrent resolution be \nagreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and statements relating to the resolution appear \nat this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con.
