Mr. President, I wish to make some comments this morning \non the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights which we have had so much \ndiscussion and dialogue about in recent months.\n  As we all know in this body, the House of Representatives has \nactually passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. The fact that one chamber \nhas passed legislation is the encouraging news. That is the good news. \nThe bad news is that the Senate may not do anything about it. I think \nthat would be unfortunate for all Americans who are concerned about \nmaking sure that their families, their children, have adequate access \nto quality health care in this country.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, as I said, is now pending in the \nSenate. The battle now becomes: Do we bring it up? How do we bring it \nup? What happens to it? Are we going to let election year politics \ndetermine the fate of this very important piece of health care \nlegislation?\n  All of this reminds me of something we just went through not too long \nago. For 4 or 5 weeks the Senate debated a tobacco bill. Do we all \nremember that? Do we all remember what happened to it? It never passed. \nIt never passed because both sides were not able to get together and \nbridge the gap between what I consider to be relatively minor \ndifferences between the various pieces of legislation and we started \nblaming each other for its failure. So now we are arguing about whose \nfault it is that it failed instead of debating the issue of who should \nget credit for getting it passed.\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\n  I think it is incredibly more important politically and for the good \nof this country to be able to argue about success and argue about who \nshould get the credit for accomplishing something rather than arguing \nabout failure and whose fault it is that nothing got done. I have a \nfeeling that we are moving in that same direction when it comes to the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. Are we all going to go home and blame each \nother for failure? Or are we going to be able to go back home and say \nwe got together and got something accomplished? I think the latter \ncourse of action is much better.\n  I was disturbed reading the Washington Post yesterday. There was a \nshort article entitled ``Plans to Regulate HMOs Unlikely to Reach a \nVote in the Senate.'' That is very disturbing, I think, for all Members \nwho come here in order to pass legislation and do what is appropriate \nand proper for their constituents.\n  Even with the little time remaining this session, I think there is a \nway out of this logjam. I think that many of the issues in the various \nPatients' Bill of Rights are things that we can reach an agreement on \nif we are serious about getting a bill passed this year. We need to \ntalk about the information that patients should have and the \ndisclosures health plan should make. We can work that out. We need to \ntalk about access to specialists and pediatricians and direct access \nfor women to their ob/gyn. We can work that out. There are differences \nin those areas but we should be able to find some common ground on \nthem.\n  We need to talk about a prudent layperson standard for patients who \nseek care in emergency rooms: When a person goes to the emergency room \nthinking they're having a heart attack and they find out it is not that \nbad, should the insurance company be allowed to deny payment? We can \nwork that out by discussing a prudent layperson standard that ensures \nthat managed companies have to pay for that treatment. If the patient \nthought their health was in serious jeopardy, the health insurance plan \nshould, in fact, have to pay for that treatment.\n\n  We need to talk about an end to gag rules which prohibit doctors from \ntelling their patients all of the treatment options that are available \nto them. We should put an end to gag rules once and for all. We can \nwork that out.\n  It seems to me that the most controversial obstacle right now is the \nissue of whether to expand the right of patients to sue their health \nplan in state court. One side says we don't want to open up the courts \nto more litigation. Most of our Republican colleagues have taken a \nposition that patients in ERISA plans should not have a right to sue \ntheir managed care plans for damages in state court.\n  On the other hand, there are others who say, no, you have to have \naccess to a state court, you have to have the right to litigate if a \npatient is denied coverage or is otherwise harmed by a decision their \nplan makes. Principally people on my side of the aisle have taken that \nposition.\n  While there are differences on many provisions in the various \nPatients' Bill of Rights, the liability issue seems to be the biggest \nbottleneck that is preventing this bill from even being considered \nafter it already passed the House. That is unfortunate. If we don't \nbreak that logjam, we will go home arguing about whose fault it is that \nnothing was passed. We can argue about whose fault it was tobacco \ndidn't pass. We can argue about whose fault it was the Patients' Bill \nof Rights didn't pass. We can argue about whose fault it was \nappropriations bills weren't passed. We will go home arguing about who \nshould be blamed for failure and not getting anything done for the \npeople who sent us here.\n  I suggest that there is a way of bridging the gap with a realistic \ncompromise that gets the job done for people concerned about patients' \nrights. I think the approach I suggest makes a great deal of sense.\n  There are some managed care plans now, such as Ochsner Health Plan in \nLouisiana, the largest HMO in the state, that have an external review \nprocess for patients who disagree with a plan's decision. There are \nsome plans around the country that do that already for their managed \ncare patients. They have voluntarily established--there is no law that \nrequires it, but they have voluntarily established a procedure where \nyou have an external review if the patient is denied coverage by a \nhealth plan. It works very well. But private health plans are not \nrequired to have an internal and external appeals process available to \ntheir enrollees and most don't.\n  However, when you talk about the right to sue as being the solution, \nI really question that. Suppose you are a patient and your health plan \nsays we will not pay for a bone marrow transplant, so someone says, all \nright, you have the right to sue. The patient will be dead and gone and \nburied before the litigation is completed, in many cases. That right to \nsue does not help a person who is in an emergency situation and needs a \ndecision right away. For the vast majority of patients, having access \nto an internal and external appeals process would prevent the need to \ngo to court in the first place. An external appeals process in \nparticular would give patients the right to have their case heard by an \nindependent, outside panel of experts who have no financial or other \nconnection to the health plan.\n  I suggest that a compromise can be found by looking at the appeals \nprocess that already exists for Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. About 6 \nmillion of the 38 million people in Medicare are in some form of \nmanaged care. There is a procedure already established by Congress for \nthese beneficiaries when they are denied coverage by their HMO. There \nis a procedure in place that works. It has been called the gold \nstandard of the appeals process. It is not perfect. Sure, there are \nproblems with the system such as monitoring and enforcement. Even with \na good appeals system in place, patients have to know that an appeals \nprocess is available to them, how it works and how to access it. I've \nrecently asked the GAO to review Medicare's internal and external \nappeals processes to determine whether it needs to be improved. But the \nMedicare appeals process that Congress put in place works well for \nbeneficiaries overall. I suggest that in an effort to bring this \nPatients' Bill of Rights to the floor and get something passed, to \nresolve the impasse between no right to sue and absolute right to sue, \nwe should look for a middle ground by taking what we have in Medicare \nand using it as model for private health plans. We can do that very \nsimply. In fact, I have an amendment drafted that, if a bill comes up, \nI would like to offer what I think could bridge the gap on this issue.\n\n  Here is generally how the Medicare appeals process works: Health \nplans have 14 calendar days to make an initial coverage determination \nfor routine matters. If it is an emergency, a real emergency, the \nMedicare HMO has to make a determination within 72 hours. That is the \nfirst step the insurance company must take in this process. If the plan \ndecides to pay for the treatment, that is the end of it, the patient \ngets the care. But if a patient is denied coverage after this initial \ndecision made by the company, then the beneficiary or his doctor can \nrequest an internal review, and it is an internal review by the \ncompany. If it is an emergency, they have to reconsider their decision \nwithin 72 hours. If it is a nonemergency, they have 30 days to \nreconsider their original decision. If they reverse their original \ndecision, that is it, no more appeal, the patient is covered. If a \npatient is still denied coverage after the internal review by the \ncompany, then the patient can access an external appeals process. The \nexternal appeals process is done by a panel of outside experts, not by \nthe company. These outside experts are people who have no financial \ninterest in the decision and who look at the case and make a decision. \nIf it is an emergency, the external reviewers have to render a decision \nwithin 72 hours. If it is a nonemergency, they have 30 days in which to \ndecide. This is an external review--not by the insurance company, not \nby the carrier, not by anybody who has a financial interest in the \noutcome of this decision. Outside, independent experts make that \ndecision. If they find in favor of the patient, that is it. There is no \nfurther appeal by the health plan.\n  If the external reviewers find against a patient and say, no, the HMO \ndoes not have to pay for that treatment, that patient still has step 4, \nwhich is an administrative appeal. That is an appeal to an \nAdministrative Law Judge at the Social Security Administration.\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\nThe Administrative Law Judge then can make a decision based on what \nthey think the plan provides, whether it is covered or whether it is \nnot covered. If the Administrative Law Judge rules against the Medicare \nbeneficiary, the beneficiary can appeal the decision to the \nDepartmental Appeals Board at the Social Security Administration.\n  Then, there is a fifth step in the process if the Administrative Law \nJudge or Appeals Board finds in favor of the plan and against the \nbeneficiary. If the patient is denied coverage by the Administrative \nLaw Judge, that patient still has the right to judicial review in U.S. \ndistrict court where he can push his case and plead that the procedure \nbe covered. He can't sue for damages; he can't sue for punitive \ndamages, or compensatory damages, but he can sue for coverage. If it is \na bone marrow transplant, he could sue for the cost of that procedure, \nor an MRI, or whatever the procedure would be. This is what we do for \nMedicare. This is what Congress has helped establish for the 15 percent \nof Medicare patients who are now in HMOs. It is already in existence \nand in statute and it works.\n  A good thing about this, in addition to the fact that it is already \nthere and we know how it works, is that it prevents most of the cases \nfrom ever having to go to court in the first place. Either the first, \nsecond, or the third level of review solves the problem, and it is done \nin a timely fashion. Does anybody think they can go to court and get a \ndecision within 72 hours? You could not even file the papers within 72 \nhours. You would have depositions, hearings, a trial, an appeal, and \nthen it gets kicked back down, and the patient has died, and you are \nstill litigating whether they should be covered or not. That is not \nnecessarily a good procedure.\n  What I am suggesting to those who say, ``Don't allow suits'' and to \nthose who say, ``You have to have suits in this Patients' Bill of \nRights,'' is that there is a middle ground that makes sense. I ask all \nof my colleagues just to consider that we are so close to the end of \nthis session and neither side is going to get everything it wants; it \nis just not going to happen. If we hold out for everything we want and \nnot try to compromise, we are going to go home and argue about failure \nbecause nothing will pass. There is a better way to serve the people \nand that is, I suggest, to say on this question of what rights to give \npatients when they are denied coverage, let's take what we already do \nin the Medicare Program and establish that as the procedure to be used \nfor managed care plans in the private sector. While it needs some fine-\ntuning, it works; it has a proven track record. It is not perfect, but \nit certainly is better than what patients have right now because, in \nmost cases, patients do not have the right to any kind of internal or \nexternal appeal if coverage is denied. I suggest that this makes a \ngreat deal of sense and could help resolve part of this problem. We can \nbring this bill up to the floor next week, adopt this amendment, and \nthen ultimately send this to the President, who I think would be \ncertainly willing to sign something that may not be 100 percent what he \nwants, maybe not 100 percent of what anyone wants, but it is 100 \npercent more than we are going to get if we do nothing. This is a \nsuggestion that I hope our colleagues will seriously consider.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has 30 minutes reserved. Is it that \ntime that the Senator would intend to use?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Chair is correct. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9901-8", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9903-S9907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INCREASING THE MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the leadership of President \nClinton, the country has enjoyed six years of economic growth. \nUnemployment is at its lowest level in a generation. Inflation is the \nlowest in 40 years. Despite this week's gymnastics by the stock market, \neconomic indicators continue to be strong. Job growth is projected to \ncontinue throughout this year, and inflation is predicted to remain at \nhistorically low levels.\n  But for most Americans, it's someone else's boom. Too many citizens \nare just one paycheck away from bankruptcy. Facing a sudden health \ncrisis, a divorce, or some other family emergency--these families often \nhave no choice but to declare bankruptcy.\n  My Republican colleagues respond with legislation to make it easier \nfor banks and credit card companies to squeeze these already-struggling \nfamilies even harder. I say, giant corporations don't need the help as \nmuch as families do.\n  And the best way to provide effective help is to raise the minimum \nwage. The amendment I have introduced today will raise the minimum wage \nby 50 cents on January 1 next year and another 50 cents on January 1, \n2000. As we begin the next century, the minimum wage will be $6.15 an \nhour.\n  Mr. President, as this chart illustrates, we can see where the \nminimum wage has gone since 1955 in terms of real dollars.\n  We were back here at $4.34 in 1988. We raised the minimum wage here \nin a two-step procedure, and then it declined in terms of real \npurchasing power. And now we are talking about raising it up to what \nwould be $6.15 an hour in the year 2000. But if you look at this chart, \nMr. President, you will see that the actual purchasing power in the \nyear 2000 in today's dollars would be only $5.76. This chart is a \nconstant, real dollar chart. And even if we raise it to this level, we \nwill still be below where the minimum wage was for some 15 years from \nthe 1960s through the 1970s under Republicans and Democrats alike--\nbelow that level at a time of extraordinary prosperity for millions of \nAmericans--millions of Americans--even with that increase.\n  If we do not increase it, if we do not accept this amendment, we will \nfind out that the minimum wage effectively will be not $5.15 an hour, \nbut $4.82 an hour, which will put us close to the lowest levels in the \nlast 35 years in terms of purchasing power for working families at the \nlower end of the economic ladder.\n  Those at the bottom of the economic ladder have not received their \nfair share of the nation's remarkable growth. Working 40 hours a week, \n52 weeks a year, minimum wage workers earn just $10,700--$2,900 below \nthe poverty level for a family of three.\n  In the midst of what many experts are calling ``the best economy \never,'' 12 million working Americans are still earning poverty-level \nwages.\n  For them, survival is the daily goal. If they work hard enough and \ntheir hours are long enough, they can make ends meet--but only barely. \nThey don't have time for their families. They can't participate \nadequately in activities with their children.\n  They can't afford to buy birthday presents or do the countless other \nthings that most of us take for granted.\n  We know who minimum wage workers are. They assist teachers in \nclassrooms across the country. They care for the chronically ill in \ntheir homes. They are child care workers and aides in nursing homes. \nThey sell us groceries at the supermarket, and serve us coffee at the \nlocal coffee shop. They clean corridors and empty trash in office \nbuildings in countless communities around the nation.\n  They are workers like Valerie Bell, a custodian for a contractor in \nBaltimore, who told us what a higher minimum wage means in human terms. \nFor workers and their families, it means far more than dollars and \ncents. It means dignity. As she said, ``We no longer have to receive \nfood stamps or other social services to supplement our incomes. We can \nfix up our homes and invest in our neighborhoods. We can spend more at \nthe local grocery store. We can work two low-wage jobs, rather than \nthree low-wage jobs, and spend more time with our families. Our \nutilities won't be cut off. We can pay the medical bills we accumulated \nfrom not having health benefits in our jobs.''\n  Minimum wage workers are people like Cathy Adams, a home health aide \nfrom Viola, IL. Cathy is a high school graduate who is currently \nenrolled in a computer training program at the local\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\ncommunity college. She lives with her two daughters, who are 10 and 11.\n  Cathy works 11 and one-half hours a day, five days a week, caring for \na woman with multiple sclerosis. She bathes her, dresses her and feeds \nher. She does the grocery shopping, the laundry, and the cleaning. She \nruns errands and schedules doctors' appointments.\n  Cathy likes her job and is fond of her client. But she finds it hard \nto live on $5.30 an hour. She told us in March that ``I literally live \npaycheck to paycheck. After paying the bills, whatever is left over \ngoes to groceries. I have $9 in my savings account and worry about \nbeing able to save for my girls' education. We rarely have money to go \nto a movie or eat out at a restaurant.\n  The other day, my girls asked me to take them ice skating at school. \nWhile it only cost $10, I had to think twice about whether we could \nafford it.''\n  And minimum wage earners are workers like Kimberly Frazier, a child \ncare aide from Philadelphia. Kimberly works full time and earns $5.20 \nan hour. She is a single mother with three children.\n  Kimberly says that her salary barely covers her bills--rent of $250 a \nmonth, food, utilities, clothing for three growing children, and \ncarfare to get to work. Kimberly says, ``I can't afford a car and pay \nfor gas and insurance so I rely on public transportation. If I had a \ncar, I could get out to the places where there are better paying jobs. \nAnd, like all Americans, I dream of buying my own house so that I can \nraise my kids in a neighborhood that has less crime and more trees. But \nI know that, although I work and study as hard as I can, I will never \nhave the down payment for a house earning the minimum wage.''\n  Kimberly concluded that ``A dollar an hour probably doesn't sound \nlike a lot to many people, but to me and my children it would mean a \nreal improvement in our lives.''\n  Workers like Valerie Bell, Cathy Adams, and Kimberly Frazier tell \nstories that are repeated in communities across the nation. That's why \nwe say now is the time to raise the minimum wage.\n  Nay-sayers parrot the same arguments they have always used against a \nfair increase. They claim an increase will damage the economy, cut \njobs, and hurt the very people it's intended to help. The facts belie \nthose claims.\n  A study released May 6 by the Economic Policy Institute proves the \npoint. The two most recent increases in the minimum wage did not cause \nthe sky to fall. There was no measurable effect on jobs; no measurable \neffect on inflation. The only measurable effect on low-income workers \nwas positive. They received the pay increase they deserved. Mr. \nPresident, 60 percent of the benefit of the 1996-1997 increases went to \nfamilies in the bottom 40 percent of the income groups; a third of the \nbenefit went to the poorest families, those in the bottom 20 percent. \nNearly three-quarters of those who benefited were adults over the age \nof 20. On the average, minimum-wage workers contributed over half of \ntheir family's weekly earnings.\n  The most recent data support the increase. Raising the minimum wage \ndoes not cause unemployment for men and women, adults, teens or anyone \nelse. Look at the teenagers. We have a chart for the teenagers. The \nargument is made that the most vulnerable group is teenagers. But if we \nlook at the employment levels for ages 16 through 19, before the \nminimum wage increased to $4.75 in 1996 and then to $5.15 in 1997, we \nsee that the total employment for teenagers has risen steadily. Nearly \n400,000 more teenagers are working today than before the increase took \neffect. So increasing the minimum wage has not lowered teenage \nemployment.\n  Teenage unemployment has dropped dramatically during the same period, \naccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate was \nnearly 17 percent when the minimum wage was first increased. Today the \nunemployment rate among teenagers is 14 percent, a drop of almost 20 \npercent since the last increase.\n  Minimum wage opponents typically claim that low-wage industries will \nlay off workers rather than pay a higher minimum wage. But look what \nhappened in the retail industry where many low-wage workers are \nconcentrated. In the year before the minimum wage was increased, retail \nemployment grew by just under 400,000 jobs. In 1994 and 1995, before we \nincreased the minimum wage to $4.75, there were 394,000 new retail \njobs. In the eleven months since we raised the minimum wage, there have \nbeen 500,000 new retail jobs; retail employment has increased since the \nlast raise. The argument that raising the minimum wage causes job loss \nfor the most vulnerable, the teenagers and those who are the working \npoor, does not hold. The facts are not there. That argument cannot be \nmade.\n  Retail employment grew over 25 percent faster since the minimum wage \nwas actually increased because, many economists believe, when you do \nget a respectable wage for minimum wage, people will go back to work \nand go to work and increasingly move off unemployment or the welfare \nsystem, because they are able to provide for their families.\n  Despite these figures, too many of our Republican friends oppose \ngiving minimum wage workers an additional $1 an hour. Instead, their \npriority is reforming bankruptcy laws by rewarding banks and credit \ncard companies who target low-income families. That will be the item on \nthe agenda, according to the majority leader. So today I am filing the \nminimum wage as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill.\n  Democrats agree, plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else is \nthe wrong priority. We need to do more for working families and \ncommunities across America. We can do more by raising the minimum wage, \nand with the strong support of President Clinton, Democrats in the \nSenate and House and some courageous Republicans, I intend to do so.\n  I see my colleagues here. Let me just point out what this issue is \nreally all about. This is a women's issue, because more than 60 percent \nof the recipients are women. This is a family issue, because many of \nthose women have one child or more. So it is a children's issue. What \nkind of life are these children going to lead? What kind of atmosphere \nare they going to be growing up in? Are they going to have a parent \navailable to them or is that parent going to be out working two or \nthree jobs? Is that parent going to be able to treat that child with \ndignity?\n  So this is an important issue. It's a family issue, a children's \nissue, a women's issue, and most of all, more than any other issue we \nwill vote on here in the U.S. Senate, it is a defining fairness issue. \nIt is a fairness issue. It is an issue whether America is going to say \nto those Americans who are prepared to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a \nyear, that they will be able to live out of poverty. That is the issue.\n  Are we going to back up the speeches here in the U.S. Senate that say \nwe applaud work? We are talking about those who are working. If you are \nworking, you deserve a fair wage. With the most extraordinary \nprosperity we have seen in recent times, with the kind of creation of \nwealth we all read about--the stories about $2 trillion being lost in \nthe stock market in a period of 24 hours, we are talking about nickels \nand dimes for working men and women. We are not even talking about the \nkinds of increases Members of Congress have received during the same \nperiod of time. We are not talking about that, which is far in excess \nof what we are talking about for minimum wage workers. How bold will \nour colleagues be. Will they turn thumbs down on working families, and \ncontinue to accept the increases in their own pay received since the \nlast increase in the minimum wage?\n  This is a fairness issue. It is whether we, as a country, are going \nto follow a proud tradition of Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents, Republican support in the Congress of the United States and \nDemocratic support. This has been, until recent years, a bipartisan \neffort--a bipartisan effort. The question is whether it will continue \nto be a bipartisan effort, to try and make sure that working families \nin this country have a living wage.\n  I hope this body will be willing to accept this amendment.\n  I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do we have left? I have \nsplit time with Senator Durbin. However he would like me to do it, I \nsay to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has until 10:30.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will take just a few minutes then.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from \nMassachusetts once again to speak about one of the most important \nissues facing American working families. At a time when our economy is \nperforming well, many Americans who work hard, who work full time, \nstill live in poverty. I don't know what better signal we could send at \nthe end of this Congress to people who are working hard, trying to \nprovide for their families, than to pass the American Family Fair \nMinimum Wage Act.\n  This increase in the minimum wage, which Senator Kennedy and I and \nothers intend to offer as an amendment, perhaps to the Bankruptcy bill, \nis the single most important step we can take in this country \nimmediately to promote economic justice. It would lift the federal \nminimum wage to $6.15 an hour over two years. That is a one-dollar-an-\nhour raise for American workers who labor near the bottom rung of our \neconomic ladder as we enter the 21st century. Many of these men and \nwomen work just as hard if not harder than many of us here in the \nCongress. Yet they very often live economically insecure lives. They \ndeserve a raise.\n  This modest raise would still leave the federal minimum wage at a \nlevel that would be worth less in real terms less than it was in 1968.\n  We all know that glaring economic injustice and inequality remain in \nAmerica. We can say that there are two Americas--one with greater and \ngreater access to all the things that make life richer in \npossibilities, the other struggling daily to make ends meet. Even as \nour economy is generally performing well, the disparity between rich \nand poor continues to grow. If we want to declare that we honor work, \nwe must value it properly.\n  When I have toured the cafes of Minnesota, the streets of East L.A., \nthe inner city of Chicago, people want to know how they can earn a \ndecent living, how they can give their children the care they need and \ndeserve. This minimum wage increase will help hard-working Minnesotans \nand all Americans in their efforts to make ends meet.\n  Seventy-four percent of those who receive the minimum wage are \nadults. Sixty percent are women. Fifty percent work more than 35 hours \na week. Eighty-two percent work at least 20 hours. These numbers tell a \nstory. Raising the minimum wage will help hard-working Americans, many \nsupporting families, to earn a decent living.\n  The minimum wage disproportionately affects women, many of whom are \nsingle heads of households with children. Sixty percent of those who \nearn minimum wage are women. They are teachers' aides, they are child \ncare providers. They work hard, yet they make $10,700 a year. That's \n$2,900 below the poverty line for a family of three. That's not a \nliving wage. To lift themselves from poverty, they must earn a fair \nliving wage.\n  Some opponents of increasing the minimum wage argue that it will \ncause job losses and actually hurt workers. Recent experience \neffectively rebuts that claim. An Economic Policy Institute report \nreleased this year demonstrates that the minimum wage increase which \ntook effect during 1996 and 1997 raised the wages of almost 10 million \npeople. Seventy-one percent were adults and 58 percent were women. Just \nunder half worked full-time. The research also found that the increases \nhad disproportionately benefited low-income working households. \nAlthough households in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution \nreceive only 5 percent of total family income, they received 35 percent \nof the benefits from the minimum wage increases. Four different \neconomic tests of these minimum-wage increases failed to find any \nsystematic, significant job loss associated with the 1996-97 increases.\n  The overall conclusion of the EPI report was that the 1996-97 \nincrease in the minimum wage proved to be an effective tool for raising \nthe earnings of low-wage workers without lowering their employment \nopportunities. In other words, it worked.\n  So now it is our responsibility to continue this process and assure \nthat more Americans are able to earn a liveable wage. If we do not \nraise the minimum wage now, by the year 2000 the real value of the \nminimum wage will only be $4.28 an hour--almost as low as it was when \nthe 1996 bill was enacted. We must act now to allow 12 million workers \nto benefit from this increase.\n  In my home state, this minimum wage increase will benefit at least \n147,000 working Minnesotans and probably more because when we increase \nthe minimum wage, it applies pressure to increase wages for people also \nmaking slightly more than the minimum wage. In 1996, 39% of Minnesota's \nworkers paid at the minimum wage were between the ages of 16 and 21. \nNow, those numbers show us two important things: first, that the \nmajority of Minnesotans just like the majority of Americans earning the \nminimum wage are adults. This issue is not just about helping \nyoungsters looking for a paying job after school. But second, at the \nsame time, many of these minimum wage workers between the ages of 16 \nand 21 are trying to make money to stay in school, to pay the bills as \nthey study to receive their college degrees. In Minnesota, we have \nrecord low unemployment, but state statistics show that increasing the \nminimum wage will not significantly affect the number of minimum wage \njobs available for people needing the work to make ends meet.\n  We celebrate the affluence that so many Americans have enjoyed in \nrecent years. We need to make sure that the opportunity to share in \nthat prosperity is available to all Americans, whether they are in the \ntop 20 percent of wage-earners or the bottom 20 percent. People rightly \nbelieve that if you play by the rules in America, if you work 40 hours \na week, 52 weeks a year, then you should not be poor.\n  Increasing the minimum wage is about justice and a livable wage. The \nAmerican public supports it, and we should pass it.\n  Let me again thank Senator Kennedy. This will be my eighth year in \nthe Senate. I don't think there is anybody in the U.S. Senate, I don't \nthink there is anybody close, to Senator Ted Kennedy leading this \nfight. It is an economic justice fight. We raised the minimum wage to \n$5.15 an hour and people thought that couldn't be done. Senator Kennedy \nled that fight and we did it. I am confident we are going to do it \nagain. We are going to have an amendment on the bankruptcy bill and are \ngoing to talk about raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over a \n2-year period, and I think we will have a positive vote for it. It is \nthe right thing to do. The majority of the people support it and this \nshould be a priority for us.\n  Let me make three points. I heard my colleague from Massachusetts, \nand I am proud to join him in this effort and can't wait to have the \ndebate. And I am proud to join Senator Durbin from Illinois. I heard my \ncolleague from Massachusetts talk about this being a family issue. I am \npretty well convinced now, from the Minnesota State Fair to talking \nwith people in cafes, to traveling the country, that this really is a \nfamily issue. If there is one thing we could do--and, you know what, my \ncolleague, the Presiding Officer, I think, agrees with me, at least in \npart of what I am about to say--if there is one thing we can do more \nthan anything else, it is to try to basically say our major goal is to \nmake sure that parents, or parent, can do their very best by their \nkids. Because if parents can do their best by their kids, they are \ngoing to do their best for Arkansas or Minnesota or Illinois or \nMassachusetts or for the country. And part of being able to do well for \nyour kids is to have a living wage job, to be able to make a decent \nliving.\n  As I travel around the country, whether it be in metropolitan \nMinnesota or whether it be in the farm and rural areas, or whether it \nbe Delta, MS, or East L.A. or Watts or inner-city Chicago or inner-city \nBaltimore, or where my wife's family are from, Letcher and Harlan \nCounties, Appalachia, KY, I think more than anything else, what people \nsay to me--and my most recent focus group is the Minnesota State Fair, \nwhere about half the population comes in about 2 weeks--right now we \nhave the State Fair there. People are focused on how to earn a decent \nliving\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\nand how to give their children the care they know they need and \ndeserve.\n  That is what it is all about.\n  Mr. President, I think the policy goal for us ought to be as follows: \nWhen people work almost 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, they should \nnot be poor in America. I bet any poll will show that 80 percent of the \npeople agree with that. When people work almost 52 weeks a year, 40 \nhours a week, they shouldn't be poor in our country. It is that simple.\n  There are a number of things we can do that will make a real \ndifference for families. We can have affordable health care. We should \ndo that. We haven't done it yet. We should have affordable child care. \nWe should figure out ways of providing assistance to parents, whether \ntheir child is in a family child care setting or child care center or \nstaying at home.\n  The final thing we ought to do is raise the minimum wage; $5.15 to \n$6.15 is not unreasonable. My colleague from Massachusetts pointed out \nthe work of the Economic Policy Institute. Everybody said the sky would \nfall. We have been going through this, I say to Senator Kennedy, for \nhalf a century: If you raise the minimum wage, people will lose jobs. \nIt did not happen; it will not happen. People, in fact, will have more \nmoney to buy and consume, which helps our economy.\n  Mr. President, I simply say to my colleagues that this is terribly \nimportant to women, because many of our minimum-wage workers are women. \nIt is terribly important to adults, because the vast majority of \nminimum-wage workers are adults. It is also important to younger people \nwhom maybe we do not view as adults--18, 19, 20, 21. Many of them are \nworking to go to college.\n  This is a matter of economic justice. It is a matter of elementary \ndecency.\n  I close with a more hard-hitting point. This is one I am not that \ncomfortable with, but I think it really is true and needs to be said. \nMy colleague said it once, and I will say it again. We don't have any \nhesitation in voting to raise our salaries. We make $130,000 a year. We \nought to be willing to vote a decent minimum wage for people. We really \nought to be able to do that.\n  Colleagues have talked to me about how ``I need to make $130,000; I \nhave two children, they are in college; I have an apartment here, live \nback home, it is very hard.'' My gosh, that is a pretty significant \nsalary we make. I am not bashing public service. I believe in public \nservice. But I think we also can vote for a higher minimum wage for \nworking families in this country. We should do this, and we will bring \nthis amendment to the floor.\n  We are going to have a major debate, and all of us will be \naccountable as to how we vote. I hope we have an overwhelming vote for \nincreasing the minimum wage. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Under the agreement this morning, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader has time reserved until \n10:30.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  In this brief period of time, I first applaud my colleagues. I am \nglad that I have had the honor to serve in the U.S. Senate. I am \nparticularly happy to represent a great State like Illinois. I am \nhonored to be a Member of the Senate with my colleagues and, in \nparticular, Senator Kennedy who, time and time again throughout his \ncareer, has taken this floor to speak for those who do not have a lobby \nin Washington, to speak for those who do not have a special interest \ngroup with a large political action committee. When Senator Kennedy \ncomes to the floor to speak for the poor, for the dispossessed, for \nthose who do not have health insurance and lack the opportunity many of \nus take for granted, I am honored in joining him. Now that I am in the \nSenate, I find I am joining him more and more. I want to do that this \nmorning on this particular issue.\n  A few years ago at one of the National Democratic Conventions--I \nbelieve it was San Francisco--a resident of the city of Chicago, Jesse \nJackson, the Reverend Jesse Jackson--not to be confused with his son, \nthe Congressman--took to the floor of the convention hall and gave a \nspeech I still remember today.\n  He spoke to that assembled multitude of people about why we are \ninvolved in politics and what Government should be about. Jesse Jackson \nsaid in his own way--and I can't even hope to get close to imitating \nhis style or his conviction--he wanted to speak to us about the people \nwho get up every morning and go to work every day. He talked about the \npeople who clean the hotel rooms of the conventioneers. He said they \nget up every morning and they go to work every day. The people who \nremove the dishes and glasses and cups from your table in the \nrestaurant, they go to work every day. The people who watch our \nchildren in day-care centers, they go to work every day. The people who \nguard our homes, our offices, our schools, they go to work every single \nday.\n  For many of us, they are invisible. They are the work force of \nAmerica. We tend to focus on the leadership, those who rise to the top \nin terms of the public spotlight, but for millions of Americans who are \npart of our workforce, they are such an essential part of American \nlife, and, unfortunately, too many of us take them for granted.\n\n  What Senator Kennedy is challenging us to do today as the U.S. Senate \nis not to ignore these workers and their families but, rather, to show \nthem that we respect them, we respect the contribution they make to \nAmerica, we honor their work, and we do it with a vote to increase \ntheir minimum wage.\n  Many of the critics of increasing the minimum wage like to argue, \n``Well, if you raise the minimum wage, people are just going to lay off \na lot of these workers; employers can't afford to pay them.'' That \nargument has been going on since the days of Franklin Roosevelt when we \nestablished the minimum wage. In very few instances, if ever, has that \nbeen the case.\n  The most recent increase in the minimum wage had exactly the opposite \nimpact. More and more people were employed. What Senator Kennedy is \nsuggesting, raising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour over a \n2-year period of time, is hardly unreasonable. It is a reasonable way \nfor us to address the needs of many families.\n  We like to get on the floor here--and I have joined in this debate--\nand talk about eliminating welfare, changing welfare as we know it, \nmoving people from welfare to work. I say to my friends, this is part \nof moving people from welfare to work, giving to those new workers a \ndecent pay, a decent wage. These are people who get up and go to work \nevery single day.\n  It is also about family dignity. If we really believe in family \nvalues, it has to go beyond a speech on the Senate floor. It has to go \nto a question of whether or not we will vote to make sure that families \nreceive the money they need to make a living.\n  A lot of people argue, ``Wait a minute, the minimum wage is just for \nkids, just for new employees--pay them a little amount of money because \nthey don't have the experience.'' Seventy-four percent of the people on \nminimum wage are adults; 57 percent of the gains of the increase in \nthis minimum wage will go to working families in the bottom 40 percent \nof the income scale.\n  The other people argue, ``Wait a minute, don't worry about the \nminimum wage, that is for part-time workers.'' That is not the case. \nFifty percent of the workers on minimum wage are full-time workers; 40 \npercent of them are the sole breadwinners for their families.\n  What will $2,000 a year mean? That is what it will be if the increase \ngoes through, $2,000 a year for a family. To a low-income family \nstruggling to survive, it means money for groceries and rent, to pay \nfor drugs, and to pay perhaps for health insurance for their children. \nIt is the difference in quality of life which we cannot overlook.\n  When the record is written about this Congress, questions will be \nasked: What did we achieve? Well, we haven't passed a budget \nresolution. We are now more than 4 months after the requirement to do \nit. We are struggling through the appropriations bills. I believe we \nwill pass them. We have renamed the National Airport after President \nRonald Reagan, and, folks, that's about it. Shouldn't we, before we \nleave, address the millions of Americans--200,000 in my home State of \nIllinois--who are, frankly, in a position where this increase in \nminimum wage could mean a dramatic increase in their quality of life?\n\n[[Page S9907]]\n\n  I will be coming to the floor on this bankruptcy bill debate. My \nfriend, Senator Grassley from Iowa, and I have worked long and hard on \nthis bill. We have our differences on it. But I will tell you this: I \nfully support what Senator Kennedy and Senator Wellstone have set out \nto do, to make sure it is part of this debate that we will increase the \nminimum wage.\n  I hope those who are about to consider this issue, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, will understand that we are talking about people in \nAmerica who get up and go to work every single day. They deserve our \nrespect. They deserve an increase in their minimum wage.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time between 10:30 and 11:30 a.m. shall \nbe under the control of the Senator from Wyoming, Senator Thomas, or \nhis designee.\n  Senator Thomas is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I will alleviate your \nconcern that I will take the whole hour. Nevertheless, I think I will \nbe joined by some of my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9903-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9907-S9911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCERNS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE ROLE OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is an interesting time, of course, for \nus here. Entering into the last month of this Congress, we are faced, \nof course, with finishing the work that we have begun, and more \nparticularly, in closing up the appropriations process so that the \nGovernment can continue to function with a real determination and, Mr. \nPresident, to assure that that happens and that we do not get into this \nbusiness of accusing one another of closing down the Government because \nwe do not agree on issues. I am very much persuaded we will have a \ncontinuing resolution so if we do have disagreements that cannot be \nresolved in this time that the Government will continue to go on. If it \ndoes not, it would be my opinion it would be up to the administration \nto have it shut down.\n  As was the case with most of the Senators here, I recently spent a \nmonth in my home State of Wyoming, having an opportunity to visit with \npeople about things that concern them, having an opportunity, perhaps \nmore importantly than visiting, to listen to what people believe to be \nthe role of the Federal Government, what the people believe to be the \nissues most compelling to them. Of course, everyone has them.\n  In my State, where we have relatively little diversity in our \neconomy, we have three basic economic areas: One is tourism, one is \nmineral extraction, and one is agriculture. Unfortunately, both \nagriculture and mineral extraction are not in good shape economically \nat the moment, and we are seeking to do something about that.\n  So this time I think is useful time for us. People always say, ``Hey, \nyou're on vacation.'' Well, it is not vacation. It is a very busy time. \nBut it is a useful time and a chance to perhaps stand back a little and \nlook at some of the broader problems. And that is so important, \nespecially, I think, in this last month when we become so focused on \nevery detail, every little appropriations process, where we tend \nsometimes to sort of get away from really the fundamental issues that \nwe are here to represent.\n  So my comments today will simply represent my point of view. I do not \nallege to speak for anyone else. But I happen to think that one of the \nthings that is most important to us as we deal with all issues is to \nhave some philosophical guidance, some basic belief that you measure \nall these details against. Failing in that, it seems to me, it is very \ndifficult to make decisions that are consistent, to make decisions that \nfinally end up doing what you really believe in and what your \nphilosophy ought to be.\n\n  One of the conclusions that I have reached, not only on my own \ncertainly, but because of what I hear in Wyoming, people having heard \nit of course in the media, is that this administration is basically in \nlimbo, that it will be for some time, that we have relatively little, \nif any, leadership coming from the administration. We need to recognize \nthat and to move forward with the issues that confront us. We can do \nthat. And we need to do that.\n  Frankly, we have had relatively little leadership over the last \nseveral years. This administration, in my judgment, and the judgment of \nothers, has been one without any real basic commitment to a point of \nview or to a philosophy or to a direction, but rather driven more by \npolls and what happens to be the political thing at the moment. I \nsuppose this is perhaps not a brand new idea, but one that I think is \nvery dangerous and one that really does not direct us in the way that \nwe ought to be going; that, indeed, instead we have a time of spin, an \nadministration that is basically sort of predicated on how you can make \nthings seem, whether they are that way or not, or whether, indeed, they \nare predicated on Saturday morning radio talks in which there are \nissues brought forth, and subsequently no real commitment to doing \nsomething about it, like the State of the Union in which things like \n``Social Security first'' are mentioned, but then nothing is done as a \nfollowup.\n  That is a concern to me, that there is no real commitment and, \nfrankly, relatively little real belief or commitment or, indeed, \ncharacter in terms of where we are going.\n  I think there are some major areas that need attention and that will \nbe continuing to need attention. We need to look into them. One is \nforeign affairs, foreign policy--or a lack of foreign policy. Almost \ndaily we see that some country--mostly the rogue countries--is \nchallenging the rest of the world, challenging the United States. Why? \nBecause they have begun to do this, and there is no real response, \nthere is no reason why they shouldn't. Why shouldn't Iraq thumb their \nnose at us in terms of doing the weapons thing that they promised to do \nwhen obviously they are not going to be required to do that? We have \nnot finished our job in Bosnia, Kosovo. Those things are still there.\n  We have the Asian currency issue, a difficult issue that impacts us, \none that, again, we need to make some decisions as to where we are and \nlet people know exactly where we are. The idea from the administration \nthat we are going to raise that question is not a good enough answer--\nthe most current one, of course, being North Korea, and which we have \ndealt with for some time, particularly through the KEDO arrangement, \ntrying to find a way to cause them to control what they are doing in \nnuclear arms development in return for a substantial contribution on \nthe part of the United States and Japan and South Korea to build light-\nwater reactors to replace that. And yet, they seem basically to say, \n``Well, we appreciate what you are doing, but we are going to go ahead \nand do what we want to do. We are going to go ahead and fire missiles. \nWe are going to go ahead and have underground development of nuclear \nweapons, nuclear materials.''\n  We cannot do that, in my judgment. And I feel very strongly about it. \nI happen to be chairman of that subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific \nRim. We are going to have another hearing this week. We had one just a \nmonth ago before we left and talked about the adherence to the KEDO \nagreement. There was certainly a notion that at that time things were \nbeing done that were not consistent with the plan.\n\n  I think we need to give some real consideration to our military \npreparedness. This is not a peaceful world. One of the best ways to \nensure as much as we can that it is peaceful is to continue to have a \nstrong defense force, a strong military, to be the world's strongest \nmilitary. And we are. However, there is increasing evidence that we are \nnot putting enough emphasis into it in terms of support for it, in \nterms of the distribution of our troops all over the world. It is very \ncostly. It is very difficult, then, to meet the mission that we have \ngiven ourselves, and that is to be able to work in two theaters, if \nnecessary, at one time. Some doubt that we can do that now. So we, I \nthink, have to deal with those kinds of very difficult issues.\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\n  The matter of taxes is one, as you can imagine, we hear a great deal \nabout when we go home--taxes in terms of the amount of taxation that \ncitizens pay, the unfairness of taxes in terms of things like marriage \npenalty, the behavior of the IRS, which, of course, we addressed in our \nlast session and hopefully will be useful. Perhaps even more important \nis the whole notion of Tax Code reform. You can deal with the IRS, you \ncan deal with the management and the administration, certainly, of tax \ncollection, but the real bottom line is the Tax Code. If the Tax Code \nis going to be so convoluted and so difficult and so detailed, it \nbecomes increasingly difficult to do that.\n  Here again, the administration has come forth with no real idea as to \nhow to simplify the Tax Code. There is not unanimity among any of us as \nto what it ought to be--whether it ought to be a flat tax, a sales tax, \nor a consumption tax, or simply a simplification of what we have now. \nBut we need some leadership to do that and we need something from the \nadministration to do that. We need some ideas to do that instead of \nsimply getting up and saying Social Security first, and then turning \noff the radio.\n  I have a number of other items I would like to share, Mr. President, \nbut I want to recognize my friend, the Senator from Kansas, who has \ncome to the floor. I yield as much time as he desires for his \nobservations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague and my good \nfriend from Wyoming for reserving this time and for talking about some \nof the very crucial issues that affect our Nation's citizens, our daily \nlives, our pocketbooks, and, quite frankly, the lack of leadership that \nwe see both from the standpoint of the administration and, to be very \ncandid, in this Congress as well.\n  What I would like to talk about for a few moments is the issue that I \nthink is the first obligation of the Federal Government. That is our \nnational security, our national defense.\n  In beginning my comments, Mr. President, I would like to refer to a \nletter that was sent from the distinguished majority leader, Senator \nLott, to the President. Senator Lott said this:\n\n       I am very concerned about the growing inability of our \n     country to man the uniformed services. Not only is there \n     difficulty in recruiting, but also in our ability to retain \n     key personnel.\n\n  Senator Lott then went on in several paragraphs to describe the \nproblem that we have. Then in the last paragraph he said,\n\n       Mr. President, while I believe that more money needs to be \n     allocated to our National Defense, it needs to be done \n     prudently. We need to get the missions, manning, equipping, \n     and pay and benefits synchronized to enable us to continue \n     with a quality force into the 21st century. I urge you to \n     make this a high priority of your fiscal year 2000 budget \n     request.\n\n  And then in regard to the suggestion by the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, there is an \neffort by some of us who have the privilege of serving on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, and those of us in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, to take action as of this appropriations cycle. I think that \ncertainly would be very wise and it is very needed.\n  The President wrote back and pretty much said that he is committed to \nensuring that we have a strong and ready force and indicates--and I am \nparaphrasing here, and perhaps that is not entirely fair, but the way I \nread the President's letter is that we will stay the course and that we \nhave a defense system certainly prepared to meet all of our national \nsecurity interests.\n  Mr. President, I don't buy that. I rise today to voice my concern \nwith what I think is a very growing and very worrisome problem with our \nmilitary. And that problem exists right now and today and we should \ntake immediate action to find answers to that problem. The issue is \nnot, it seems to me, do they have enough tanks or fighters or ships or \nsmall arms. By the way, I do not think they have the adequate funding \nsupport for the modernization and the procurement of essential systems, \nbut I will leave that discussion for a later time. This issue is even \nmore fundamental and, I think, just as important; that is, the basic \ncare of the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families.\n\n  Now, we have all heard the concern from the leaders of the military--\nwe have had hearing after hearing--their real growing inability to \nattract and retain the needed skilled personnel, such as pilots and \nmechanics and ship drivers or any number of other very critical skills \nmaintained by enlisted and officers of our military. Some say they are \nperplexed at this talent drain and wonder why they cannot stop the \nhemorrhaging.\n  Let me recount some other related topics concerning the care of our \nmilitary and perhaps we can start to understand what I call this \nhemorrhaging.\n  Following the end of the cold war, the United States started a \nsystematic downsizing of our military, consistent with the threat, and \nthat made sense. I think everybody agreed with that. However, many \npeople have not given much thought to how far we have downsized, just \nhow far we have downsized.\n  Let me summarize what we have removed from the military: 709,000 \nactive duty troops--709,000 active duty troops--293,000 reserve troops; \n8 standing Army divisions--8--20 Air Force and Navy wings with 2,000 \ncombat aircraft; 4 aircraft carriers; 121 Navy ships and submarines.\n  With the end of the cold war and with these very dramatic reductions \nin our military, we should be able to take great solace in the fact \nthat surely our military commitments and deployments have also taken \nsimilar reductions. In other words, if you took dramatic reductions in \nregard to the active duty troops, the reserve troops, the Army \ndivisions, the Air Force and the Navy wings, 4 aircraft carriers, 121 \nNavy ships and submarines, you would think that our commitments and our \ndeployments would have been reduced as well. Unfortunately, as also \nmany of us understand, just the opposite has occurred. The military \nacross the board has experienced a many-fold increase in their \noperational commitments and tempo of their operations. Plainly stated, \nour significantly ``downsized'' military has been asked to deploy much \nmore often and for longer periods of time than they ever have in our \nhistory.\n  This increased operational commitment has directly impacted the very \nculture of our military. For example, Mr. President, General Ryan, who \nis the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, has stated that the Air \nForce has shifted from a garrison force to an expeditionary force \nduring this period--a dramatic change. The bottom-line impact on our \npeople is that they are now away from their families significantly more \nthan they were in the past. And, by the way, as we have shifted to an \nall-voluntary military, the number or percentage of married service \nmembers has also significantly increased--reportedly 63 percent now of \nour military members are married. So, problem No. 1, Mr. President, we \nhave significantly increased the workload upon a substantially smaller \nmilitary.\n  Since the percentage of service members that are married has grown, \nthis increased workload has amplified the negative affect of \ndeployments on the morale of our troops and their families. The \nreluctance of families to continue to tolerate these separations really \ncontributes to the loss of mid-level personnel, key personnel, mid-\ncareer personnel. Asking our military to deploy and endure hardship in \ntheir personal lives is not new. Ask any veteran of World War II, \nKorea, or Vietnam about hardship and long separations. But those \nsituations were drastically different than the involvements the U.S. \nmilitary is being asked to participate in as of today.\n  In each of the major conflicts in the past, the mission and \nimportance of the U.S. involvement was clearly articulated by the \nPresident, by the administration, understood by the American people, \nand certainly understood by our men and women in uniform. Those \nconflicts were founded on the notion that our involvement was in the \nU.S. vital national interests. The men and women of the military \nunderstood that concept, and they and their families were more willing \nto accept the hardship of military life.\n  I am convinced that the missions that our military are now \nparticipating in today do not meet that fundamental threshold of \nnational interest. I am\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\nalso convinced that our military members understand the nature and the \nmotivation of their missions. Although they continue to perform \nsuperbly, they understand that their sacrifice and their family's \nsacrifice today is not for the same noble cause as the defense of the \nAmerican homeland--the very reason many join the military in the first \nplace.\n  Problem No. 2: With a significantly increased deployment schedule and \na substantially smaller force, the value and importance of today's \nmissions impacts on the willingness of the men and women to join or to \ncommit to the military as a career. Without clearly articulated mission \ngoals and objectives founded in the fundamentals of the U.S. vital \nnational interest, the ability to recruit and retain motivated men and \nwomen for our military will remain very difficult.\n  You only have to look at the deployment of 27,000 men and women in \nuniform in the Gulf, 37,000 in Korea, approximately 10,000 in Bosnia, \nwith the expectation of what happens in North Korea and Kosovo as an \nexample.\n  Certainly, if we are putting our military in a position of increased \ndeployments and increased family separation, Mr. President, we must \nhave or are doing a better job of adequate pay, health care, and \nretirement system. Unfortunately, just the opposite is occurring in \ntoday's military.\n  Let me outline the pay issue with one example that is occurring all \ntoo often in the military today. Picture, if you will, a young \nsoldier--in which we have placed a great deal of training and \nresponsibility and trust--commanding the world's best tank, M1A2, a $4 \nmillion piece of equipment. At home, this soldier has a wife and three \nchildren. They live in a mobile home off post, and because of his low \nmilitary income, they are on the WIC Program, the Women, Infant and \nChildren Program, which is a form of welfare.\n  What has happened to reasonable compensation for men and women that \nare committed to the service of our country? Can't we pay our military \nenough to keep them off of welfare programs or off of food stamp \nprograms? We, the Congress, cap the raises that the military can \nreceive. The net result of this action is that the military pay \ndifferential between a comparable job in the civilian market and the \nmilitary has grown from 13 to 15 percent. That gap can go to 20 percent \nin just a few years.\n  Problem No. 3: Although the skill level required of the men and women \nof our military does continue to grow, the pay differential between the \nsame skilled civilian and the military simply continues to widen.\n  The current pay of many of our young military families is so low that \nit is not adequate to keep them off of welfare programs. The prospect \nof continued and frequent long deployments coupled, with the \nopportunity to get better pay on the outside for the same work, \ncontributes to the inability to attract and retain the skills needed \nfor today's military. This is true for both officer and enlisted \npersonnel.\n  OK, the pay is not great, but surely the housing has kept up with the \nincreased numbers of married military members, and we have provided \nthem with adequate housing--not palatial housing, but certainly \nadequate. Wrong again. To illustrate this issue, let me quote from an \narticle entitled ``Shoddy Military Housing Need Repair,'' by John \nDiamond, a writer with the Associated Press. He says this:\n\n       ``In reality, we're the biggest slum lords in the \n     country,'' said Michael J. Haze, chief of Fort Carson's \n     housing division. ``I have soldiers every day telling me they \n     live in the projects.''\n\n  In the projects.\n  The article went on:\n\n       Behind the bureaucracy, thousands of military families \n     continue to tolerate what the Pentagon acknowledges is \n     shoddy, substandard housing because they cannot or will not \n     pay higher rents for off-base housing.\n\n  I don't want to mislead anybody. Some of the base housing is very \nnice and adequate. But if a serviceman happens to be unlucky enough not \nto be assigned to nice facilities, or a base that has nice facilities, \ntheir pay will not support quality housing in the private sector.\n  Problem No. 4: We ask our military to deploy at a much higher pace \nthan ever before, we assign missions that do not meet the national \ninterest threshold, we pay them less than they could get for the same \nor similar skills as a civilian, and in many cases, we ask them to live \nin substandard housing. It goes without saying that the culmination of \nthese problems really contributes to the dissatisfaction with the \nmilitary as a career and its attractiveness to potential recruits. How \ncould anybody assume otherwise?\n  Finally, many of the men and women are able to work with and through \nall of these issues with their families and make the military a career. \nMany are still doing that. For many years, the attraction and reward \nfor the tough life in the military was the great benefit of retirement. \nThe deal was that if you would spend at least 20 years in the service \nof our country, your retirement benefits would be one-half of your base \npay. And if you elected to spend 30 years, you would receive 75 percent \nof your base pay. That retirement program was a major benefit, a major \nrecruiting tool, a major retention draw. Many young men and women have \nsaid, ``I can stick with this tough life because I know I am doing a \ngood job for my country and I know that at least I have half of my pay \ncoming to me at the end of 20 years.'' The plan is now that if a \nservice member works for 20 years, the benefit is only 40 percent of \nthe base pay. It is still 75 percent after 30 years, but the big draw \nhas always been the 20 years. This is not popular with the troops. That \nis probably the understatement of my remarks. The fear is that the \nretirement program has been so weakened that, coupled with a myriad of \nother problems that I have described, many service members will leave \nrather than ``tough it out until 20.''\n  Problem No. 5: The members of our military are working harder, \ndeploying more, receiving less pay than civilians are for the same job, \nliving in inadequate housing, and are now seeing a reduction in \nretirement benefits. It is not difficult to understand that with this \ncollection of negatives, and all of our commitments all around the \nglobe--some may or may not be in our national interest--the military is \nexperiencing problems in retention and recruiting.\n  I didn't mention health care. I don't have prepared remarks regarding \nhealth care, but I will come back to the floor and mention that as \nproblem No. 6. That is an additional problem--adequate and affordable \nhealth care that is at least accessible. So, in many cases, that is an \nadditional problem.\n  Mr. President, these are very serious problems that face the men and \nwomen of our military. I must admit that they do not have simple or \ninexpensive solutions. I do plan, with the help of many of my \ncolleagues, to systematically attack these problems as a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I hope that together we can help \nrestore the faith of our military members that the American people care \nabout the sacrifice they and their families make in the defense of our \nNation by providing adequate pay, housing and retirement benefits and \nhealth care. We owe this to these men and women and their families that \nserve our Nation.\n  In closing, again, I thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming, for the time. I want to come back to the letter sent to \nthe President of the United States by the majority leader, Senator \nLott. Senator Lott said in two or three paragraphs, in brief, what I \nhave tried to outline today. Mr. President, we have to do something \nabout this. Mr. President, we have to do something now. We have to do \nsomething with the current appropriations bills. The President has sent \na letter back to the majority leader saying, in effect, that we do have \na military that still stands in the breach to protect our individual \nfreedoms and national security. And we will talk about it in the next \nbudget. That is not good enough. It is not good enough. We need to \nbegin the process now.\n\n  I ask the President to reconsider the letter by Senator Lott. I know \nmy colleagues will work in a bipartisan fashion to end what is a \ngrowing scandal in the military in terms of retention of the people who \nwe need to maintain our military and maintain our national security.\n  I thank my colleague and my good friend from Wyoming for the time. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Kansas very much for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, I guess the real issue and the thing that he and I are \nboth talking about is the basic, fundamental functions of the Federal \nGovernment and what priority they should have. Certainly, the defense \nof this country has to be among the--if not the--top priorities. No one \nelse can do that. I appreciate very much the comments the Senator has \nmade.\n  This whole idea of priority setting, this whole idea of the concept \nof the basic belief of what you think the better role of the \nGovernment, is of course a difficult issue but it is the basis of why \nwe are here; it is the basis of elections to decide. People say, ``What \nis your position with respect to the Federal Government?'' There are \nlegitimate differences of view. You can see them on this floor. There \nare those who believe sincerely that the Federal Government ought to be \nthe predominant activity in government in the whole country. There are \nthose who, frankly, have very little confidence in local governments \nand in State governments, and they think the Federal Government ought \nto do all of those things. Obviously, there are roles for the Federal \nGovernment. In my view, there are quite certainly roles that are better \ndone at the local and State level. That is the constant issue with \nwhich we deal.\n  I was talking about some of the things people talked about while I \nwas in Wyoming. I mentioned Social Security. I would like to go back to \nthat for just a little bit. There has been a great deal of talk about \nthe condition of Social Security to the extent that people, many older \npeople, are worried about, of course. But maybe even more importantly, \nyounger people who are now just entering the workforce are saying, ``I \nam going to be paying into this thing forever, but by the time I am \nready to retire, there will be nothing there.'' I think it is clear \nthat Social Security is strong for 20 years or 25 years, and all those \nwho will become eligible for benefits during that time will see them. \nBut young people, like these folks sitting here, are the ones who will \nbe paying the tab. Unless we do something, we will unlikely have a \nsolvent Social Security program.\n  We need to move forward. I am pleased that there is a considerable \namount of talk about it. I hope we do something rather soon. It seems \nto me that if we can do it, the sooner you do it, the less severe the \nchanges need to be. If you make rather simple changes, rather \nincremental changes 20 years out, it makes a great deal of difference.\n  What are we talking about? Of course, one of them that is already \nunderway is to raise the retirement age. Times have changed. People are \nliving longer. People are working longer. That is legitimate. There \nwill be debate about how far that goes, of course. But, more \nimportantly, the notion that seems to be catching on is that some \npercentage of the payments that are made, some of the percentages of \n12-percent payments that are made into Social Security, should be set \naside into an individual account which is invested in equities, \ninvested in something that will earn more interest than the current \ninvestment which is in Government securities; that that account will \ngrow more quickly; that there will be more benefits from the same \ninvestment. And that is very possible, of course; further, that that \naccount would be your account and my account.\n  If for some reason or other you happen to pass on before you use all \nof that, that it, indeed, be part of your estate. There would be a \nsubstantial difference. I don't think many are talking about a full \nprivatization of Social Security. That is something that would be a \npretty big step. But to take 30 percent, for example, 3 or 4 percent \nout of the 12 percent, I believe that is happening. I certainly hope \nso.\n  I already mentioned tax reform. Certainly, we will have some debate \nsoon about what seems certain to be a budget surplus--a budget surplus \non which we will have some decisions to make; choices about doing \nsomething about reducing the debt, a debt on which we pay $280 billion \na year in interest; do something about reducing tax rates so that the \npeople who own the money will be able to keep more of it. I suppose one \nof the considerations will be to spend more. I hope that is not a \nsuccessful consideration. Others are suggesting some of it be put in \nfor this Social Security reform and that it be used that way.\n  There is nothing wrong with philosophical differences. We just need \nto stand for what we are for. We are for less government, if we are \nhaving people keep more of their own money. It is pretty clear where \nyou stand on that issue.\n\n  I hope the marriage penalty is considered. I saw some numbers the \nother day where two single persons were making roughly $35,000 a year, \nand they pay individually. If they are married, this is about a $1,300 \npenalty to the same people earning the same amount of money simply \nbecause they are married. That needs, of course, to be changed.\n  Another one that I heard a lot about and I also feel strongly about \nis the Executive orders that have been issued. There are a good many \nExecutive orders, some of which simply are done apparently to replace \nwhat the Congress should be doing. One on federalism created a great \ndeal of concern.\n  Basically, the President issued an Executive order that broadened the \nscope of the Federal Government in terms of working with States and \nworking with counties, and instead of the good old 10th amendment where \nit says that those things which are specifically laid out in the \nConstitution will be done by the Federal Government, other things will \nbe done by the States and by the people--this changed that. There was \nsuch a reaction to it that I understand it has been withdrawn. But the \nuse of Executive orders is something that sort of moves away from the \nleadership of causing the Congress to do things, and working with the \nCongress. The idea of an Executive order on health care, for example, \nwhich is exactly the thing that the Republican bill has on the floor, \nit seems to me, is inappropriate.\n  Energy--I guess I have a rather strong feeling about energy in that \nit is one of the things that is important to my State, but, more \nimportantly, it is one of the things that is important to this country. \nWe now have ourselves in the position where 57 percent, I believe, of \nthe fossil fuel we use is imported. That puts us at sort of a security \nrisk, it seems to me, in addition to not having the kind of domestic \nindustry that is very important. Do we have a policy at the Department \nof Energy for that? No, we really do not. We really do not.\n  We have a real problem with what we do with nuclear waste that is the \nresult of nuclear power plants. Do we have a plan to do that? The \nadministration is opposed to it. We have a responsibility to do \nsomething about nuclear waste storage. Does the Department of Energy \nhave a plan? No. We are not moving forward.\n  Those are the kinds of things that need to be resolved. One of the \nenergy issues that is fairly knew this year and will continue next year \nis the deregulation of electric energy. It has a great impact on this \ncountry.\n  The use of the huge monopolies--most of us would like to see us \nchange monopolies and make them come a little more into the \nmarketplace. Does the Department of Energy have a strong position on \nthat? No.\n  Finally, the chairman of the committee urged them to come up with a \nbill. But we need to do something with that. Here again, we get into \nthe question of whether you do the same thing for every State. I can \ntell you that Wyoming's interest in electric deregulation is different \nthan New York's. You have to have a system to do that. Leadership is \nwhat we need.\n  The Senator from Kansas who just spoke is one of the experts in \nagriculture. He was, indeed, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee \nin the House. Agriculture is having a tough time. Agriculture is having \na tough time because of the Asian situation, because of the crop \nfailures, and because of the weather and many things.\n  We are trying to do something with it and, indeed, have, but we need \nagain some kind of impetus and leadership from this administration that \nhas not been there.\n  Previous to now, we have had accelerated payments that are the \nchanged\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\npayments from where we had the acreage and payment program into a \nmarket system. We have had averaging, income averaging, just extended--\nthat is good for farmers--and an IRA for farmers and ranchers. Of \ncourse, if you don't have any money, it does not help a lot. And that \nis going to have to be done. We did something about unilateral \nsanctions in countries so that we can have more markets overseas.\n  These are some things, but there need to be more. We need to do \nsomething with crop insurance to make that work. We need to open more \nforeign markets because almost 40 percent of our agricultural product \ngoes into foreign trade. We need to do something about agricultural \ncredit to help make this transition from managed agriculture to market \nagriculture.\n  So we need to work together, and we need some leadership in doing \nthat.\n  Mr. President, probably again the thing that seems always to strike \nme, because I guess I believe it also, is that the real issue in many \nof the things we do is in terms of federalism--what is the role of the \nFederal Government? Where can we be most efficient? Where can we get \nthe job done more easily? At the Federal level? At the State level? \nShould we send block grants, for example, in some instances to the \nStates? I think so. And the delivery system is so different.\n  We held a couple of meetings on rural health care while I was in \nWyoming. We have about 475,000 people in 100,000 square miles. Many \npeople live in very small towns. We only have two towns that are over \nthe 50-60,000 category. So you have to have a little different system \nfor the delivery of health care than you do in Pennsylvania or than you \ndo in New England, and that is an important kind of thing. \nTelemedicine, for example, is going to be very important to us.\n  So all this comes into this equation of how do you best serve the \npeople of this country. I happen to believe, as you can imagine from \nwhat I have said already, less Federal Government is better than more. \nI am one who thinks that the most efficient delivery system comes when \nit is done at the local level. I am one who thinks that the Government \nclosest to the people is the one that provides the kind of services \nthat people really want.\n  So we need to focus, I think, on fundamentals. We need to focus on \nthe idea that, for example, those things that are done by the Federal \nGovernment that are commercial in nature ought to be put out for bid, \nif that is possible, so we can do it in the private sector. It is done \nmore efficiently that way, and it also creates more jobs in the private \nsector. And that is one of the fundamental things we ought to continue \nto focus on.\n  We don't have much time remaining in this session--I think something \naround 20 days of activity. We have lots of things to do. I am hopeful \nthat our friends on the other side of the aisle will address these \nissues that need to be resolved. I think it is clear that there are two \nor three issues they are going to try to insist on bringing up daily, \nnot with the intention of completing them and finding a resolution but \nsimply to bring them up so that they are the kinds of issues that will \nbe involved in the campaigns that are coming up in November--patients' \nrights, for example. Both sides of the aisle have bills on patients' \nrights. Most of the elements of those bills are very similar and there \nis a consensus that some of those things need to be done. The \nleadership has offered to deal with it with a limited number of \namendments so that we can get it done.\n  That is not acceptable to the other side of the aisle because they \nwant to keep this issue alive as a political issue. That is too bad. I \nam sorry for that.\n  The minimum wage. We just have raised the minimum wage two times. It \nis a political issue that has to keep coming back. Campaign reform. \nMost of us want to make some changes in campaign reform. We have talked \nabout it extensively in this session of Congress. It is kept alive as a \npolitical issue. We need to address ourselves to things that have to be \nresolved, those things that are important to the people in the conduct \nof the business of this country.\n  So I am just really hopeful that our leadership in the Senate and the \nleadership in the House and this administration will address ourselves \nto some of these issues and that we will, in fact, during this next \nmonth be able to resolve them, conclude them, and do them in the \nfashion that is most acceptable and most useful to the American people. \nThat, after all, is our job. I think it is based largely on making some \ndecisions as to what the Federal Government does best, how it does it, \nhow it can be done most efficiently, how we can involve the States, how \nwe can involve local governments. Invariably, when you go home, you see \nthings done voluntarily, you see things done on a local level, and it \nreminds you, fortunately, the strength of this country lies not in its \nFederal Government, the strength of this country lies in the \ncommunities and the people who live there, people who give leadership \nto issues that affect them, people who volunteer, people who address \nthe issues and resolve them, and that is, indeed, the strength of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, in conversations with the leader over \nthe last couple of days, we have set a date for the Senate vote on the \noverride of the President's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act \nof 1997. It is going to be September 18, which is just a couple of \nweeks from now. I am hopeful, even though the numbers do not look good \nright now, that we will be able to muster sufficient support to do what \nthe House did, which is to override the President's veto. The House \nvoted, with I believe six or seven votes more than necessary, to \noverride his veto. Here in the Senate we are three votes short of \noverriding the President's veto, of getting the 67 votes. We had 64 \nSenators vote in favor of the ban. We will need three more Senators to \nchange their vote and support this act and override the President's \nveto.\n  I want to pick up on what Senator Thomas was talking about and what \nis being talked about around the country, which is the President and \nhis unwillingness to come forward with the truth, and his propensity to \nlook at a factual situation and skew it some. Some would say lie; I \nwould just say maybe skew it some, to put a different spin or color on \nwhat the real facts are.\n  I think we have maybe the first opportunity here in the Senate, since \nthe President's admission a couple of weeks ago, to really pass \njudgment on the President's ability to be truthful with the American \npublic. How many people in this Chamber are going to stand by this \nPresident when he has blatantly not told the truth about the issue of \npartial-birth abortion and the need for it to remain legal? He has \nstood behind this notion that this procedure needs to remain legal \nbecause of the potential impact on the health of women who have \nabortions and that this needs to be an option available to them because \nthere may be circumstances in which women need this procedure to avoid \nserious health consequences. That was potentially a legitimate \nargument, even though I could give, and I will when the bill comes up, \nlots of reasons why from a medical perspective that makes no sense. We \nhave made those arguments time and time again, and others have made \nthose arguments, including Dr. Bill Frist.\n  But, just prior to the vote last year here in the Senate, the \nAmerican Medical Association came out with a letter that said that a \npartial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect the life \nor health of a woman. And this is an organization, by the way, that \nsupports abortion rights. This is not a right-wing, radical, pro-life \norganization--take your pick, right-wing, radical, or pro-life, or all \nof the above. It is\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\nnone of those. It is an organization that in principle supports \nabortion rights, but came out and said that there is no medical \nnecessity here. It is not necessary. Yet the President, just weeks \nafter this letter was released--and by the way, there are hundreds if \nnot thousands of obstetricians who have come forward and said the same \nthing--the President stood up and said I need to veto this bill \nbecause--I think it was on a Friday night he vetoed it, so not too many \npeople were around to watch the veto--this is medically necessary to \nprotect the health of women, when we have experts upon experts and the \ndefinitive body representing physicians in this country saying that it \nis not necessary and that, in fact, the President is not telling the \ntruth to the American public or to Members of Congress.\n  So we are hiding behind a lie. I guess the question I have is how \nmany Senators are going to continue to hide behind Bill Clinton's lie \non the issue of partial-birth abortion? Many Senators--many Members of \nhis Cabinet, many people--were apologists for Bill Clinton for the past \nseveral months because he told them one thing and we found out later \nthat it was not true. And a lot of people were hurt by that, burned by \nthat, the fact that the President wasn't coming clean with the American \npublic. We have another instance right here where the President has not \ncome clean with the American public on this issue. How many people are \ngoing to continue to go out and defend this President and his veto on a \nbill where his rationale for vetoing it is not true? Hopefully: Fool me \nonce, shame on you. If Senators allow this President to fool them \ntwice, shame on them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title V, add the following section:\n\n     SEC.   . PROVISIONS FOR STAFF DIRECTOR AND GENERAL COUNSEL OF \n                   THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Appointment and Term of Service.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 306c(f) of the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act of 1971 (2 U.S.C. 437c(f) is amended by striking \n     paragraph 1 and inserting the following:\n       ``1 (A) The Commission shall have a staff director and a \n     general counsel who shall be appointed by an affirmative vote \n     of not less than 4 members of the Commission. Subject to \n     exception in subparagraph (D), the staff director and general \n     counsel shall, beginning January 1, 1999, serve for terms of \n     6 years and such terms may be renewed by an affirmative vote \n     of not less than 3 members of the Commission.\n       ``(B) The staff director and general counsel may serve \n     after the expiration of his or her term until his or her \n     successor has been appointed.\n       ``(C) An individual appointed to fill a vacancy occurring \n     other than by the expiration of a term of office shall be \n     appointed only for the unexpired term of the staff director \n     or general counsel he or she succeeds.\n       ``(D) The term of any individual appointed prior to and \n     serving on the date of enactment of this act as general \n     counsel shall be until January 1, 2008 and shall not be \n     subject to renewal under subsection (A) until such date.''\n       (b) Rule of Construction Regarding Authority of Acting \n     Staff Director or General Counsel.--Section 306(f) of such \n     Act (2 U.S.C. 437c(f)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(5) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit \n     any individual serving as an acting staff director of the \n     Commission from performing any functions of the staff \n     director of the Commission or any individual serving as an \n     acting general counsel of the Commission from performing any \n     functions of the general counsel of the Commission.''.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the \npending McConnell amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that the yeas \nand nays be vitiated, and for the Chair to put the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to vitiating the yeas and \nnays?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McConnell \namendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have negotiated this modification in the \nMcConnell amendment so that it is no longer targeted at the sitting \ngeneral counsel of the Federal Elections Commission. That was my \nobjection to it, my very strong objection to it. This amendment has \nbeen modified now so it has no effect on the current general counsel \nuntil the year 2008. He is eligible to retire at that date in any \nevent.\n  And even then, the amendment has now been changed so that three of \nthe six members of the Federal Elections Commission can renew the \nappointment of the general counsel or staff director. It would not take \nfour of the six to renew the appointment of a general counsel or staff \ndirector.\n  So in effect we have grandfathered the current general counsel. And \nwith respect to future general counsels and staff directors, we have \nprovided that once they are appointed, which of course will take a \nmajority vote of the Commission, they shall serve for 6 year terms and \ntheir terms can be renewed by a vote of three of the six members of the \nFederal Elections Commission. This is a very significant change that \nmakes this perfectly acceptable to me.\n\n  I want to thank Senator McConnell for working with us on this. With \nthat, I support the amendment.\n  After this is concluded, I understand that we will then be offering \nand there will be general support for an amendment of Senator Glenn, if \nI understand what we worked out here correctly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Michigan, as he well knows, \nhis side of the aisle was in the position to scuttle the whole \nTreasury-Postal bill over this issue. Under those circumstances, this \nagreement was reached.\n  I gather the Glenn amendment will be adopted on a voice vote, which \nis acceptable to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McConnell \namendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3379), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent all previous \nyeas and nays ordered on other amendments be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. It is my understanding that the other amendments\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\nwill be resolved in various fashions. Therefore, I ask unanimous \nconsent the vote in relation to the final passage of H.R. 4104 occur at \n2 p.m. today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object--and I will not --I \nunderstand, that the manager, then, will be supporting the Glenn \namendment when I offer it after this unanimous consent is agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous consent \nagreement is agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have been informed that the Glenn amendment, which adds, \nI believe, $2.8 million to the FEC budget, is part of what has already \nbeen incorporated in a unanimous consent agreement and it will not need \nto be separately offered. Am I correct?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from Colorado.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 3386 and 3380\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The amendment No. 3386 offered by Senator Grassley and \namendment No. 3380 offered by Senator Glenn are acceptable to the \nmanagers. I therefore ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded \nback and ask for their immediate adoption and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3386 and 3380) were agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 3387, 3381, and 3389, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. On behalf of Senators Graham of Florida, Harkin, and \nKerrey of Nebraska, I ask unanimous consent that the amendments Nos. \n3387, 3381, and 3389 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3387, 3381, and 3389) were withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3356, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I send to the desk a modification to amendment No. \n3356, previously adopted, and ask it be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3356), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 47, strike lines 11 and 12.\n       On page 46, line 18, strike ``$5,665,585,000, of which: (1) \n     $552,757,000'' and insert ``$5,651,480,000, of which: (1) \n     $538,652,000''.\n       On page 56, line 20, strike ``$5,665,585,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,651,480,000''.\n       On page 62, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4  . DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HEADQUARTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Administrator of General Services \n     shall--\n       (1) enter into an operating lease to acquire space for the \n     Department of Transportation headquarters; and\n       (2) commence procurement of the lease not later than \n     November 1, 1998;\n\n     provided that the annual rent payment does not exceed \n     $55,000,000.\n       (b) Terms.--The authority granted in subsection (a) is \n     effective only to the extent that the lease acquisition meets \n     the guidelines for operating leases set forth in the joint \n     statement of the managers for the conference report to the \n     Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997, as determined by the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget.\n\n     SEC. 4  . SECURITY OF CAPITOL COMPLEX.\n\n       There is appropriated to the Architect of the Capitol for \n     costs associated with the security of the Capitol complex \n     $14,105,000.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to speak \nabout one aspect of the Statement of Administration Policy on this \nbill. Specifically, the section referring to the Customs Automation \nEnhancement Account.\n  The SAP makes it appear that the Committee neither funded nor \nconsidered the Administration's request for this program. In fact, we \nfully funded the request, which was $8 million. When the budget was \nsubmitted, it included authorizing legislation on a Merchandise \nProcessing Fee, which would net $56 million for this program. This is \nnot within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee and if the \nauthorizers were not going to act in sufficient time, the \nAdministration should have sent up a budget amendment to cover the cost \nof the program so that it could be considered by the Committee. That \ndid not happen, this committee never received a formal request to \nincrease the funding for this program. If we had, we would have given \nit consideration. I just wanted to let my colleagues know that we fully \nfunded this program and would have considered the request to increase \nit, but we never received anything upon which to act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Treasury appropriations subcommittee for accepting the \namendment which includes $1,500,000 additional funding for the \nSouthwest Border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area to combat the \nmethamphetamine problem. I know the Senators are aware of the growing \nnational problem of methamphetamines. New Mexico is no exception and \nhas been experiencing a growing problem with methamphetamine \nproduction, transshipment, and cleanup of seized methamphetamine labs. \nIt is fast becoming the drug of choice because it is easy to \nmanufacture, it is highly addictive, and it is cheap to buy on the \nstreet. The costs associated with combating the methamphetamine problem \nis straining New Mexico's ability to combat other illegal drugs. New \nMexico's proximity to the US/Mexico border exasperates the problem \nbecause of increased international travel.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree with the Senator from New Mexico that \nmethamphetamines are an increasingly difficult problem to control. This \nfunding will significantly help in controlling the problem there.\n  Mr. KOHL. Methamphetamine is a growing problem across the nation, and \nit is my understanding that New Mexico, because of its proximity to \nMexico, is experiencing its own share.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Is my understanding correct that the entire $1,500,000 \nin this amendment will go directly to the New Mexico HIDTA?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, Senator, per your request $1,500,000 will be \ndirected to the New Mexico HIDTA for fiscal year 1999 in order to \ncombat the methamphetamine problem in your state.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senators for their willingness to recognize \nthis problem and to assist New Mexico.\n\n\n               public access to government research data\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment during this \nbody's consideration of the Treasury, General Government Appropriations \nAct for fiscal year 1999 to recognize Senator Shelby for his diligent \nefforts this year to ensure that the public has access to federally \nfunded research data. Sunshine in government is a principle that enjoys \nbroad support from both sides of the aisle as evident from the \nbipartisan support of the Freedom of Information Act and the 1986 \nCommunity Right to Know Law. While we all agree that this principle is \nimportant, the Senator from Alabama has correctly identified a major \ninconsistency--the public's lack of access to federally funded research \ndata. Currently, there is no systematic government-wide process for the \npublic to access research data supported by federal funds. Equally \ndisturbing is the fact that this research data is often used to support \nmajor rulemakings. Because of Senator Shelby's interest in this issue, \nthe Treasury, General Government Appropriations bill for FY 99 contains \na requirement that the Director of OMB evaluate current government-wide \nprocedures for making research data available to the public and report \nback to the Committee on the need for changes to existing procedures. \nMy own view is that reform in this area is long overdue and I would \nlike to commend Senator Shelby for his leadership to help rectify this \nmatter and pledge to work with him and Chairman Campbell in Conference \non final language to correct this problem as soon as possible.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If our esteemed Majority Leader would yield for a \nmoment, I also would like to commend Senator Shelby and Chairman \nCampbell for their work in this area. Recent Congressional debates over \nfederal regulatory programs, such as the revised particulate matter \nstandard, and the criteria for listing new species under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, show the importance of providing the public with full \naccess to federal research data to validate research results and gain \nthe proper public support. The importance of this issue is also \nreflected in a recent court decision on environmental tobacco smoke \nthat concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency had been \nselective in\n\n[[Page S9914]]\n\nincluding research data in its overall assessment of health risks. \nPublic access to research data would help ensure that federal rules are \nbased on the best science possible. I too would like to commend Senator \nShelby and Senator Campbell, Chairman of the Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations Subcommittee, for their efforts to correct \nthis problem.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague from North Carolina. The public's \nlack of access to federal research data is an issue of growing concern \nto Members of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The lack of public access to research data feeds general \npublic mistrust of government and undermines support for major \nregulatory programs. The Senator from Alabama has taken the lead on \nthis important issue and I look forward to working with him and all my \ncolleagues who have expressed support for enhanced public access to \nresearch data in Conference.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Majority Leader and my colleague from North \nCarolina and the Senator from Colorado, the Chairman of the Treasury \nand General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, for their support. \nThe Administration's resistance to providing the public access to \nfederal research data not otherwise protected from disclosure under \ncurrent law indeed contradicts the spirit of current law. The Paperwork \nReduction Act of 1995 requests the Director of OMB to ``foster greater \nsharing, dissemination, and access to public information.'' OMB \nCircular 110, Subpart C, is even more specific, stating that unless \nspecifically waived, Federal agencies ``have the right to . . . obtain, \nreproduce, publish or otherwise use the data first produced under an \naward''. Unfortunately, these policy directives are not being \nimplemented on a systematic basis. Given the prevalent use of \ngovernment funded research data in developing regulations and federal \npolicy, it is important that such data be made available to other \ninterested Federal agencies and to the public on a routine basis for \nindependent scientific evaluation and confirmation. I thank my \ncolleagues for their support on this issue and I look forward to \nworking with them to improve the language in Conference.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague from Alabama for raising this \nimportant issue and I look forward to working with you, Senator \nFaircloth and the Majority Leader in Conference to develop an effective \nsolution.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I thank the Chairman for his support on this issue.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Gang \nResistance Education and Training (GREAT) Program as part of the \nTreasury Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1999. I am pleased to see \nthat this legislation increases national funding from $10 million to \n$13 million for 1999. Gangs are a serious problem in this country. We \nmust be proactive in finding ways to stop gang violence.\n  A recent article in the Washington Post noted that nearly twice as \nmany teenagers reported gangs in their schools in 1995 as they did in \n1989. School administrators from North Carolina have found that gangs \nand violence go together. I believe that when we couple gangs and \nviolence with drug use and weapons, we have a formula for disaster.\n  Fortunately, programs like the GREAT program educate children about \nthe perils of gangs and offer alternative ways to resolve conflicts \nrather than through violence. I would like to thank the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, for the inclusion of North Carolina counties in the GREAT \nprogram: Bladen, Cumberland, Mecklenburg, New Hanover, and Wake. I hope \nthat more communities in North Carolina and this country will follow \ntheir lead.\n  Experts may say that small involvement in the GREAT program means \nthat there is little gang activity in the state. I believe that we \nshould not wait until there is evidence of a gang before we bring GREAT \ninto a school district. We must be proactive in educating our young \npeople about the dangers of gangs. If we wait until there is a problem, \nthen we may face a deadly situation like those faced this year by \nseveral of our nation's schools. We must act before it is too late. \nGREAT is a sound program which I am pleased to support.\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3379, as modified\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I would like to second the comments of my \ncolleague from Michigan and add that I also have no objection to the \nMcConnell amendment as it has been changed and offered today.\n  The amendment as it is now constructed will call for a periodic vote \nof the Commission to re-confirm the General Counsel, but it will not \nallow a partisan minority of the Commission to act unilaterally, and it \nwill not leave the position of General Counsel open until a successor \nis appointed, thereby paralyzing the enforcement efforts of the agency.\n  I am also pleased that this amendment allows the current General \nCounsel to serve a term of eight years from enactment. I am confident \nthat the amendment in its current form will be enacted into law and \nsigned by the President.\n  Finally, today we add crucial money to the FEC budget in order to \nhelp the agency to investigate and prove violations of the existing \nlaw. The additional 2.8 million dollars in enforcement funds bring our \nSenate appropriation for the FEC up to the same level offered in the \nHouse. These funds are an important step in allowing the agency the \nresources it needs to investigate and enforce our remaining campaign \nfinance laws.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent when the Senate completes all \ndebate on S. 2312, the Fiscal Year 1999 Treasury and General Government \nAppropriations Act, the Chair lay before the Senate Calendar No. 478, \nthe House companion measure, H.R. 4104; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken and the text of S. 2312, as amended, be inserted in \nlieu thereof; and that the House bill, as amended, be read for the \nthird time and the Senate immediately move to final passage of H.R. \n4104; that the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference \nwith the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon, and \nthe Chair appoint the following conferees on the part of the Senate: \nMr. Campbell, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kohl, Ms. \nMikulski, and Mr. Byrd, and that the foregoing occur without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. With that, Mr. President, I have no further comment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As a Senator from the State of Nebraska, I ask \nunanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9912-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n5 minutes on the legislation before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my desire \nto work further with the Chair of the subcommittee and ranking minority \nmember on a particularly important provision affecting our YMCAs, our \nYWCAs and other charitable organizations that do so much good work \nthroughout the country. Throughout the recess, I heard continually from \nconstituents who enjoy these important organizations in Oregon that \nthey are concerned about a provision in the committee report \naccompanying this legislation that deals with the tax-exempt\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\nstatus of these organizations. I would say that I am of the view that \nthese nongovernmental groups can provide critically needed services in \nour country, particularly as it relates to juveniles: preventing crime, \ndrug use and unwholesome activities in which some kids do get caught \nup.\n  As many in this body know, Senator Smith and I have talked at some \nlength about approaches to deal with the tragedy that we saw at \nThurston High School earlier this year, when a young person entered the \nschool with a gun. A number of our young constituents were killed and \ninjured. It seems to me one of the very best antidotes to this kind of \njuvenile violence is the important work done in afterschool programs by \nthese organizations. I am concerned that a provision in this \nlegislation could curtail some of the important activities that the Y's \nand Jewish Community Centers and other important organizations provide.\n  What has transpired is that in 1984 the Internal Revenue Service \nissued a technical ruling making it clear that fitness activities \nprovided by these and other organizations remain charitable as long as \nthe entity, the nonprofit, serves a broad segment of the community. \nThese organizations, the YMCAs, the YWCAs, the Jewish Community Centers \nacross our country do provide critically needed services, particularly \nto low-income individuals. They have philanthropic missions related to \nhealth and education, community welfare. My concern is a provision \nrelating to the tax-exempt status of these organizations, in effect, \ncould prompt a review that would have a chilling effect over the entire \nrange of work done by these organizations.\n  I have organized a letter with nine Members of this body, a \nbipartisan letter--Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Roberts, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Murray, Senator Durbin, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Mikulski and myself, to make it clear to the managers of this \nlegislation that we want to work with them on a bipartisan basis to \nmake sure that the important work done by these community organizations \nis not in jeopardy. It seems to me, as we look to the 21st century, \ntrying to make sure the budget is balanced, still meeting the needs of \nour communities and particularly the young people, that these are the \nvery programs that are most likely to make a difference.\n  I had thought the question of the tax status of these groups was \nsettled law in 1984. I note I am unaware of any abuses since 1984 or of \nany violations by the ``Y's'' with respect to this charitable \nexemption, and it is for that reason that I do ask this afternoon to \nwork further with both the majority and the minority to make sure the \ntax status of these groups is protected and the important work they are \ndoing continues to go forward and, in fact, expands in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter I referred to be \nprinted in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman,\n\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Ranking Democrat,\n     Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General \n         Government, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Campbell and Kohl: We are writing to express \n     our serious reservations about a provision in the committee \n     report accompanying the FY99 Treasury/Postal Appropriations \n     bill relating to tax-exempt health clubs.\n       The provision directs the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to \n     review its standards relating to ``tax-exempt health clubs'' \n     and report on ``regulatory changes that may be required to \n     assure that tax-exempt health clubs are not unfairly \n     competing against private sector organizations.'' In 1984, \n     the IRS issued a technical ruling clarifying that adult \n     fitness is a charitable activity as long as the entity serves \n     a broad segment of the community. Moreover, under current tax \n     law, to the extent that a charity makes a profit from a trade \n     or business unrelated to the exercise of its charitable \n     purpose, it will be subject to federal income tax \n     (``unrelated business income tax'' or ``UBIT'') on the \n     profit. The statute and regulations on UBIT are very clear \n     and prevent any charity from gaining a competitive advantage \n     over a for-profit corporation.\n       Not-for-profit organizations, including the YMCAs, YWCAs \n     and Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) that serve all ages, \n     incomes and abilities likely could be adversely affected by \n     this provision. The health and fitness services offered by \n     these organizations are only one component of a whole range \n     of programs available for a community. These programs are an \n     integral part of the organization's philanthropic mission \n     related to the health, education and welfare of the \n     community, and are a significant component in financing such \n     activities. Furthermore, participation in their health and \n     fitness programs is not limited to adults: people of all ages \n     participate in them. Among the services they provide that \n     would be threatened are child care, juvenile delinquency \n     prevention, substance abuse and senior nutrition programs.\n       We appreciate your efforts in the July 29 colloquy in which \n     you stated your intent to have the IRS focus on adult fitness \n     provided by tax-exempt organizations that serve only adults. \n     However, we remain concerned that this provision still could \n     negatively affect the millions of Americans--young and old--\n     who participate in these community organizations. We ask that \n     in the conference report you ensure that the interests of \n     these individuals are protected and that the invaluable \n     programs offered by not-for-profit organizations are not \n     unfairly curtailed by unnecessary and overly burdensome \n     government regulation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Connie Mack, Paul S. Sarbanes, Pat Roberts, Chuck \n           Grassley, Ron Wyden, Barbara A. Mikulski, Ted Kennedy, \n           Dick Durbin, Patty Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further amendments to be \nproposed, the question is on the engrossment and third reading of the \nbill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Chair lays before the Senate H.R. 4104, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4104) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive \n     Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, \n     for fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the text of S. 2312, \nas amended, is substituted for the House text, the bill will be read \nfor the third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before asking for the yeas and nays, I \nwould like to say a few words in closing about S. 2312.\n  As many of you may have noticed, this bill has not been an easy one \nto craft to stay within our funding constraints. We started on this \nbill before the August break and we are still at it. I believe in some \ninstances, we have probably had to rob Peter to pay Paul because this \nbill carries programs which are all worthy and all important to \neveryone in this Nation.\n  We have had to make some difficult choices between the programs in \nthe bill and it has been easy to do because the goal is to emerge with \nan acceptable balance while still doing the right thing and staying \nwithin our funding limits.\n  I believe though, however, we can honestly say we have done our very \nbest to accommodate everyone's wishes and everyone's requests, even \nthough it has not been easy.\n  As always, the ranking member, Senator Kohl, has been great to work \nwith, and without him, we could not have completed this bill. So I \nthank the Senator from Wisconsin. I want him to know that his \nfriendship and professional efforts and courtesy have meant a great \ndeal to me.\n\n  In addition, I would like to take a moment to thank his staff--\nBarbara Retzlaff, who has been so diligent working on this bill the \nentire year, as well as Paul Bock and Liz Blevins for their support on \nthe floor during our consideration. And I also thank our staff--Pat \nRaymond, Tammy Perrin and Lula Edwards, who spent a lot of evenings, \nlong evenings at that, trying to make sure the bill came out the way we \nwanted it to.\n  In spite of our difficulties, I believe that we have put forth a good \nbill\n\n[[Page S9916]]\n\nwhich deserves the support of the Senate. I urge my colleagues to vote \nin favor of this bill.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  As the Chairman mentioned, this completes the floor action on the \nTreasury-General Government bill. By moving this bill forward, we will \nensure that important financial operations and law enforcement programs \nfunded through this bill will be fully operational at the start of the \nfiscal year.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to again thank Chairman \nCampbell and his staff--Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, and Lula Edwards. \nTheir fair and able handling of this bill makes it possible for us to \nmove to conference where I hope all outstanding issues will be resolved \nquickly.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Secretary Rubin \nfor presenting a budget request that was fair. And, I want to thank him \nand his staff for working with us, throughout the process, to make sure \nthat important Treasury programs receive adequate funding.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I commend the chairman of the Treasury-Postal Service \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee for the work he has done \non this. It was a little bifurcated. We did work on it back before the \nrecess, but he continued to work, working with his colleague from \nWisconsin, and they produced a bill that I obviously believe has broad \nsupport. I thank them for their willingness to cooperate and go ahead \nand get this completed today. They have done good work, and I hope that \nthey will get into conference early next week and have a conference \nreport completed that we can send to the President in short order.\n  So I thank them for their efforts and thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for allowing us to get through this list of \namendments we had and complete this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are ready to go to a vote, but after the \nvote we will go into recess--temporary recess--so that we can hear, \nbefore the Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees, from Scott \nRitter, a senior inspector of UNSCOM in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I have one further unanimous consent \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent that after passage of H.R. 4104, S. \n2312 be indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I believe that concludes the debate, Mr. President. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The request has been made to go to the bankruptcy bill \nwhich affects about 1,300,000 people in this country. We do have an \nopportunity to consider other legislation, like the HMO bill, that \naffects 120 million people, and we are being asked to go to the \nbankruptcy bill when we are not scheduling the campaign finance bill \nthat passed the House of Representatives that involves the elimination \nof many of the abuses of campaign finance. Some are very concerned \nabout the fact that some $50 million have been expended by banks and \ncredit card companies to move this legislation forward.\n  I am interested in inquiring of the leader whether we can have any \nindication as to when we might have the opportunity of scheduling these \nother measures which affect the average family, rather than special \ninterests, such as the banks and the credit card companies. When I go \nback home, people talk to me about health care. It is the bankers and \ncredit card people who are talking about the bankruptcy bill.\n  I wonder whether we are going to have any kind of assurance that we \nare going to move ahead with this legislation and we are going to have \nan opportunity to address and debate the merits of the Republican \nlegislation, as well as the merits of the legislation, for example, on \nHMOs that has been introduced by the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before I ask for the regular order, let me respond. I am \nperfectly prepared to go to the Patients' Bill of Rights bill. We have \nour bill ready to go. We would be glad for Senator Kennedy to offer his \nbill. We have even offered to have three amendments on each bill and go \nto final passage. That offer still stands. It is a very fair offer. The \nminute the Senator and his leadership indicates they are willing to do \nthat, we will be glad to go to both of those bills and have the votes \nand go to conclusion.\n  Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is, Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, we have just been delayed somewhat in \nthe start of the bankruptcy bill. But I think it would still be \nappropriate to make some comments, even though in morning business, on \nthe issue of why we need a bankruptcy bill.\n  I suggest, first of all, as the Senator from Massachusetts has \ncorrectly stated, there were 1.4 million bankruptcies last year. That \nwas a 30-percent increase over the previous year. And the previous year \nwas a big percentage increase over that previous year. So in the last 3 \nyears we have seen an explosion of bankruptcy filings in the United \nStates.\n  That is a tremendous economic problem. It is a problem for families \nthat have to go through this. It is a problem for the consumers because \nbankruptcies raise costs for consumers. And there are lots of reasons \nfor the rise in bankruptcies. In the 20 years since we have last had \nmajor bankruptcy legislation, we have seen a dramatic increase in \nbankruptcy filings, more than under any previous act. And we have had \nnational bankruptcy legislation for 100 years this year.\n  In the period of time since we have had the latest bankruptcy \nlegislation that was passed in the year 1978, out at the grassroots of \nAmerica there has been a feeling that it is too easy to get into \nbankruptcy.\n  I don't want to say that a bankruptcy law, in and of itself, is the \nonly reason we are having a high number of bankruptcy filings. But \nduring this period of time in the last 20 years, I have had hundreds of \npeople tell me that it is too easy to get into bankruptcy. I have had \nnot one person say to me that\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\nit ought to be easier to get into bankruptcy. And I have even had some \npeople who have gone through bankruptcy who said it was too easy.\n  I mentioned the legislation of 1978 may be one reason for the \nincrease in bankruptcies. I think also the Federal Government itself in \nthat period of time has not set a very good example for personal \nfinances by having 30 years of unbalanced Federal budgets. After all, \nif the national leadership of America can spend beyond its means for 30 \nyears, doesn't it kind of set an ethic and a tone for the people of \nthis country that maybe debt isn't so bad and it is possible to live \nbeyond your means?\n  Hopefully, this September 30, at the close of this fiscal year, for \nthe first time in 30 years we are going to balance the budget and have \na surplus. And we are going to pay down at least $68 billion, according \nto the latest estimates of what we will pay down in that national debt. \nMaybe we are going to turn that bad example around a little bit so that \nif people now do not see the Federal Government borrowing money for \nsuch long periods of time, maybe families and businesses of America \nwill take a little bit different look at their debt as well.\n  Then, of course, we have had the banks of America sending out so many \ncredit cards, maybe not with the idea that they encouraged debt, but at \nleast have left the impression upon the consumers of America that there \nwas another way of doing business than just out of the billfold. I do \nnot think that has set a very good example. I am not saying that there \nisn't a legitimacy about credit cards and that probably it is very \nconvenient for some people and other advantages, but again, it is a new \napproach that parallels this high number of filings that we have had \nand may be another reason beyond the Federal Government's borrowing, \nbeyond a 1978 statute that made it a little easier to go into \nbankruptcy, another reason why we had 1.4 million people filing for \nbankruptcy last year.\n  Then lastly--and maybe I should not say lastly--but lastly as far as \nthe reasons I would give, and there might be a lot of other reasons \nthat somebody else could give, but there does not seem to be the shame \nconnected with bankruptcy that there used to be. I do not know why. It \nmay be all of the above that I have mentioned--more credit cards, \nmaking it easier to get into debt, and you just chip away at people's \nethical thinking, the Federal Government setting a bad example, a \nliberal bankruptcy law passed in 1978. But somehow we have to think in \nterms of people looking at the moral dimension of their finances, and \nalso then an extension of that moral dimension is a moral look at \nbankruptcy--right or wrong--and whether or not it is OK to break a \ncontractual obligation to respect debt and meet the obligation.\n  One other thing I should say is that I think that to some extent--and \nit is difficult to quantify all these factors that I give--but I think \nthat within the legal profession there are some lawyers who are not \ncounseling people about bankruptcy the way lawyers used to feel an \nobligation to counsel people coming to them for help. I guess we think \nthat is a serious enough problem that we put some discouragement in our \nlegislation to the bar just willy-nilly putting people into chapter 7 \nbankruptcy.\n  But I think if we could get the bar itself to take another look at \nthe practice of bankruptcy lawyers, and suggest a little more caution, \na little more counseling, a little less use of paralegals in the \nprocess of the filing of petitions, and probably a person that is maybe \nnot in a very good position to counsel, that all of these things would \nhelp. So we have a situation that needs to be dealt with. That is why \nwe offer this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to provide some overview of the need for \nbankruptcy reform and how the bankruptcy reform bill before the Senate \nmakes meaningful bankruptcy reforms in a fair and balanced way. In \nfact, in the Judiciary Committee, the bill passed out of the committee \non a strong, bipartisan vote of 16 to 2. So, we have a good bill and \none that most Members of the Senate should be able to support.\n  Mr. President, the polls are clear that the American people want \nbankruptcy reform. In Iowa, 78 percent of Iowans surveyed favor \nbankruptcy reform. And the picture is the same nationally. According \nthe PBS program ``Techno-Politics,'' almost 70 percent of Americans \nsupport bankruptcy reform. Clearly, the time to act is now.\n  Let me start out by saying there is some justification for \nbankruptcy. People hurt by natural disasters, catastrophic illness, \ndivorce, etc., are entitled to a new start. Our society has provided \nfor that. About 80 percent of the people who declare bankruptcy are in \ndesperate financial straits. The problem is that some people use \nbankruptcy as a financial planning tool to get out of paying debts \nwhich they could pay. The convenient use of the existing bankruptcy \nlaws is the driving force behind bankruptcy reform. We have a \nbankruptcy system that lets higher-income people write off their debts \nwith no questions asked and no real way for creditors to prevent this \nfrom happening. The end-result is that everybody else who pays their \nbills ends up paying for these abuses through higher prices.\n  Last year we had a record number of Americans file for bankruptcy. Of \ncourse, each bankruptcy case means that someone who extended credit in \ngood faith won't get paid. While estimates differ as to the exact \nnumber, American businesses are losing around $40 billion a year as a \nresult of bankruptcies.\n  Now, big banks and big business are in a somewhat stronger position \nto deal with these losses than smaller businesses. Large banks and big \nbusiness can offset bankruptcy losses by increasing the amount they \ncharge to other customers. That's an important point, Mr. President. \nUnder the best of circumstances, where a big business can stay afloat \nin the face of large losses due to bankruptcies, other consumers pay \nthe price. Hence, the hidden bankruptcy tax.\n  This hidden tax affects consumers who play by the rules. These \nconsumers, the vast majority of consumers, must pay through higher \nprices and interest rates for consumers who write their debts off in \nbankruptcy. My legislation will reduce this tax by requiring those \nconsumers who have the capacity to repay their debts, or some portion \nof their debts, to do so.\n\n  But that's the situation with big businesses who can survive in the \nface of huge bankruptcy losses. What about the small business people \nwho have to close their doors because they can't afford to absorb the \nloss of so much income. The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act that is \nbefore us will reduce bankruptcy losses by ensuring that those who can \nrepay their debts be required to do so. That's just common sense. On \nthe other hand, if you're truly down and can't afford to pay anything, \nthis bill still guarantees complete bankruptcy relief.\n  The editorial page of the Des Moines Register stated on march 13, \n1997, that bankruptcy ``was never intended as the one-stop, no-\nquestions-asked solution to irresponsibility,'' But that's just what we \nhave today. And that is just the problem this bill addresses.\n  So, as we move forward to more debate on bankruptcy reform, I hope we \nkeep in mind the fact that bankruptcies of convenience impose a hidden \ntax on hardworking Americans who play by the rules and pay their bills \non time. Let's cut that tax. Lenient bankruptcy standards seem to \nfoster a lack of personal responsibility. After all, why tighten your \nbelt and pay what you owe when you can just walk away from debts by \ndeclaring bankruptcy? I think my bill makes sense and that's why it \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16 to 2.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the history of \nbankruptcy. Congress' authority to create bankruptcy legislation \nderives from the body of the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause \n4 authorizes Congress to establish ``uniform laws on the subject of \nbankruptcies throughout the United States.'' Until 1898, we did not \nhave permanent bankruptcy laws in this country. The previous bankruptcy \nlaws were temporary in nature and were largely enacted as a reaction to \na financial crisis. With each successive bankruptcy act and each major \nreform or our Nation's bankruptcy laws, we've refined our conception of \nhow bankruptcy should promote the important social goal of giving \nhonest and unfortunate American a fresh start.\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\n  The bill we're considering today makes fundamental changes to our \nbankruptcy laws. These changes are a logical outgrowth and extension of \nour various bankruptcy reform efforts. From 1898 until 1938, consumers \nhad only one way to declare bankruptcy. It was called ``straight \nbankruptcy'' or ``chapter 7'' bankruptcy. Under chapter 7, which is \nstill in existence, bankrupts surrender some of their assets to a \nbankruptcy court. The court sells these assets and uses the proceeds to \npay creditors. Any deficiency is wiped out.\n  But starting in 1938, Congress created chapter 13, which allows a \ndebtor to repay a portion of his or her debts and keep all assets. \nUnder current law, the choice between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is \nvoluntary. In the mid-1980's, Senator Dole and Congressman Mike Synar \ntried to steer higher income bankrupts--who could repay some of their \ndebts--into chapter 13. My legislation follows the attempts at reform \nSenator Dole made when he was on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Finally, Mr. President, when and if we get to S. 1301, there will be \na managers' amendment, which will permanently reauthorize Chapter 12. \nChapter 12, which I authored in 1986 because of the farm crisis, is due \nto expire this October. I hope that, for the sake of the farmers of \nAmerica, we will be able to get this bill brought before us. We now \nhave a motion to proceed because there was an objection from a Senator, \nand I hope that all of these Senators will take into consideration that \nwith low farm prices now--and I hope there is not an agricultural \ncrisis long-term although there is a crisis this minute--and that \nfarmers will have special protections under Chapter 12 bankruptcy, like \nother sectors of our economy have a special procedures for them, so \nthat we will be able to have an orderly handling of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired. Does \nthe Senator ask for additional time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Was there really a 10-minute time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is. The Senator can request additional \ntime.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The efforts of Senator Dole and Congressman Synar ultimately resulted \nin the creation of Section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. This section \ngives bankruptcy judges the power to dismiss the bankruptcy case of \nsomeone who has filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy if that case is a \n``substantial abuse'' of the bankruptcy code.\n  While this idea sounds good, it has not worked well in the real \nworld. First, nobody knows what the term ``substantial abuse'' actually \nmeans. So we have conflicting court decisions around the country and \npeople just aren't sure what the rules are. Second, creditors and \nprivate trustees are actually forbidden from bringing evidence of abuse \nto the attention of a bankruptcy judge.\n  The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act corrects these shortcomings. Under \nthis bill, 707(b) now permits creditors and private trustees to file \nmotions and bring evidence of chapter 7 abuses to the attention of a \nbankruptcy judge. This change is very important since creditors have \nthe most to lose from bankruptcy abuse, and private trustees are often \nin the best position to know which cases are abusive in nature.\n  Additionally, the bill requires judges to consider repayment capacity \nof bankrupts in chapter 7. Under this bill, if someone who has filed \nfor chapter 7 bankruptcy can repay 20 percent or more of his or her \ngeneral unsecured debts, then the bankruptcy judge can kick them out of \nthe bankruptcy system or transfer them to chapter 13.\n  Taken together, these changes will bring the bankruptcy system back \ninto balance. Importantly, these changes preserve an element of \nflexibility so that not every debtor is pushed into an inflexible and \nrigid formula. This means that each bankrupt will have his or her own \nunique situation taken into account.\n  Of course, S. 1301 also contains tough fines against creditors who \nmisuse their new powers to harass or intimidate honest consumers rather \nthan to stop abuses. This is a key feature of S. 1301. Whenever we give \ncreditors a new tool, we also give debtors a new shield to restrain \npotential creditor abuses.\n  Let me give another example of how my bill gives debtors important \nnew tools to deter and punish abusive creditor conduct. In the last few \nyears, there have been a number of reports about creditors coercing \ndebtors into agreeing to pay their debts even though the debt could be \nwiped away in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy code allows debtors to \nreaffirm debts if the choose to do so voluntarily. The problem is that \nsome companies have been threatening consumers in order to force a \nreaffirmation. Under the bill we're considering today, creditors will \nface treble damages and high fines if they use coercive tactics to \nforce a reaffirmation.\n  So, Mr. President, as we proceed to consider this bill, I hope \ncolleagues will keep in mind the balanced, fair nature of this \nlegislation.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anne \nMcCormick be granted privileges of the floor on all Judiciary \nCommittee-related matters for the remainder of this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been my good fortune to work on the \nsubcommittee with Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa. We have worked \nclosely together for more than a year. We disagree on some political \nissues--that is no surprise--but I respect him very much. He is a man \nof his word. He is a hard-working Senator, and it has been a pleasure \nfor me to work with him on this very complicated issue. We will \nprobably have our disagreements when this matter comes to the floor, \nbut my respect for him will continue as during the course of preparing \nthis complicated legislation.\n  I also acknowledge the hard work of my staff members, Victoria \nBassetti and Anne McCormick, on this complicated issue. Were it not for \nthem, I don't believe I would be able to stand here and defend my point \nof view. They have educated me well. I will do my best to represent \nthem, as well as the people of Illinois, on this issue. This is a \nhighly technical and convoluted subject. We hear words like cramdowns, \nreaffirmations, panel trustees, lien stripping, automatic stays, \ncodebtor stays, discharge stays, nondischargeable debt, super \ndischarge, and on and on. Most people's eyes are glazing over and \nwondering what this bankruptcy debate is all about on the floor.\n  This important Federal bankruptcy law is a delicate and perilous \nbalance. When a person files for bankruptcy, they have a limited amount \nof assets. They come before the bankruptcy court and ask: What are we \ngoing to do with what we have left? It isn't enough to pay our bills \nand what do you suggest we do to discharge ourselves from this debt and \ngo forward with a clean slate?\n  When you push on one thing in bankruptcy, almost invariably something \nelse will give. That is because no matter how hard you wish otherwise, \nwe are dealing with a limited amount of assets--a pie of fixed \ndimensions. Try as we might, in almost every case the pie will not be \nmade any bigger. All we can do is increase the fighting over that small \npie--and usually no one really comes out ahead in that fight.\n  In those cases where we can make the pie bigger, I fully support \nwhatever we can do. We must ferret out those people who are abusing the \nbankruptcy system. One example is the homestead exemption. The \nhomestead exemption allows a person, in some States, depending on State \nlaw, to claim that their home should be exempt from being subject to \nthe claims of creditors. That sounds reasonable. People like to protect \ntheir home. But each State sets a different standard. Some States set \nalmost unreasonable standards. That is why you can find a former \nGovernor of a major State, or a former commissioner of baseball, racing \nto the right State to file bankruptcy--buying a huge home before they \nfile bankruptcy, and then having it exempt from the bankruptcy estate. \nLuckily, this bill does away with that exemption. The House bill does \nnot. On the floor of the House, unfortunately, we left this abuse in \nthe bankruptcy code. I hope we will stand fast on this issue and that, \nif this matter goes to conference, we can prevail.\n  Let me talk about the people who do file bankruptcy, who don't fall \ninto the\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\ncategory of the rich and famous, never have been and never will. Let me \nshow you one of the charts that indicates what happened in terms of the \nincome people earn who are filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy in the \nUnited States. This is an interesting chart. The median family income \nis $42,769. In 1981, the median income of people filing for bankruptcy \nwas $23,254. Look what happened. Over the next 16 years, we have seen a \nsteady decline in the median income of people filing for bankruptcy. \nWhat it tells us is that people in the bankruptcy system are just \ngetting poorer. We are not dealing with smoothies here who are racing \nout to get attorneys and find some way to protect some treasured \nassets. We are dealing with people who have a very limited amount of \nincome and with very low-income and perilous circumstances. As \ndistasteful as bankruptcy is, the fact remains that we need it. We \ncan't dismantle or radically alter it without doing serious damage to \nour economy, to creditors, and to millions of individuals.\n  To see what would happen if we didn't have a bankruptcy system, \nimagine a world where people could not declare bankruptcy when they \nwere in bad financial straits. In this world, each individual creditor \nwould have to file suit in State court when the debtor defaulted. And \nthen it would be a race to the courthouse door. Some would end up with \nnothing. Almost nobody would win in this situation. So the bankruptcy \ncode is important. But keep in mind that this median income person, \nwith $17,652, really is not salivating for the opportunity to file for \nbankruptcy; a disaster has hit that person or his family.\n  The information I am about to give you has not been produced by some \nconsumer group, but by the major credit card companies. Visa and \nMasterCard did an analysis of the people who declared bankruptcy in \n1997. Here is what they found: 11.6 percent of the people who filed for \nbankruptcy did so because of a divorce or separation; 16.5 percent \ndeclared bankruptcy because of medical or health reasons, and 15.3 \npercent, because of unemployment. Two-thirds of the people surveyed \nreported that creditors did not try to work with them to help them \navoid filing for bankruptcy.\n  You must remember the feeling. I can remember it in my early life \nafter graduating from law school, deep in debt, trying to pay off \nstudent loans and having no really substantial income. It was a chore \nto fight off the people calling on credit cards.\n  They really weren't offering the milk of human kindness in those \ntelephone calls.\n  From the Visa study, they went on to say:\n\n       Although conventional wisdom holds that there is less \n     stigma associated with personal bankruptcy filings today than \n     there has been in the past, the experience of the respondents \n     suggests just the opposite: A substantial majority--75.2 \n     percent--had not been able to reestablish credit. Nearly a \n     quarter of the respondents--24.7%--still owed income taxes \n     after the bankruptcy was filed. More than half--52 percent--\n     reaffirmed some of their outstanding debt * * *\n\n  Let's talk for a moment about the debt. Credit card companies send \nout as many as 2.8 billion credit card solicitations a year to \npotential card holders.\n  Let me show you a chart about one family that I happen to know a \nlittle bit about, the Durbin family of Springfield, Illinois.\n  In a 6-month period of time at our house, we received in Springfield, \nIllinois, opportunities and invitations for credit cards, some \nwonderful credit cards. It used to be that they talked about gold \ncredit cards. Here is one called ``gold.'' Now we are talking about \ntitanium and platinum credit cards.\n  If you look at the total amount of credit that was offered to my home \nand household, it comes to over $600,000.\n  There was a time when I can recall getting my first car loan--of \nabout $1,000--sitting nervously across from a loan officer at the First \nNational Bank of Springfield, Illinois. Now, sight unseen, each day in \nthe mail, come invitations to go deeply into debt--in this case over \n$600,000 worth. And this doesn't count the e-mail credit solicitation \nwhich I am currently receiving.\n  What it suggests to me is that the credit card industry bears some \nresponsibility for the increased filings and bankruptcy.\n  We found in a 3-month period in 1997 that banks in the United States \nmailed a record-setting 881 million solicitations.\n  I have some that my staff received here. I will not go through them \nall.\n  I believe everyone here that is witnessing this debate on the Senate \nfloor and those by television on C-SPAN know what I am talking about. \nYou go home every night and start tossing out the preapproved credit \ncard solicitations that say, ``Just sign the back of this check, and we \nwill send you a certain amount of money.'' And you, of course, can have \na second mortgage on your home.\n  All of these things are coming at us fast and furious.\n  In addition to the mail, credit card companies logged 24.1 million \nhours in 1996 on the telephones telemarketing their cards.\n  You can be at home at night watching TV and listening to the radio. \nThe phone starts ringing. It could be some charity. It might be some \nopportunity to change your phone service. It might also be a credit \ncard solicitation.\n  So if we are going to correctly analyze the current situation about \nthe increases in bankruptcy, let us honestly look at what is happening \nhere.\n  You want to know why so many more people are filing for bankruptcy? \nLook at this. Track consumer debt in America, and track the filings in \nbankruptcy, and what you find is the lines are virtually identical.\n  This isn't a matter of America losing its morality in family values \nbecause of the increased filings in bankruptcy. It is because we are \ndeeper in debt as a nation and the credit card industry continues to \nlure people into debt. Yes. It is a free will choice. But many people \nare not as well informed as they get into it. The lure of consolidating \nyour debts, and the lure perhaps of buying something that you might not \notherwise be able to afford drags people deeper and deeper into debt \nwith risky credit. One bad occurrence, as mentioned in the Visa and \nMasterCard study, and the next thing you know these folks are in \nbankruptcy court.\n  Some people in the credit industry come to see you and say, ``You \nknow, I think these people have lost the idea of the moral stigma of \nbankruptcy.'' The Visa study says they haven't. I am not sure they have \neither. I say to the people in the credit industry, ``If there is no \nmoral stigma to bankruptcy, then how do you explain the practices of \nyour own industry, an industry that would consider installing ATM \nmachines in casinos, which we now do in America? Where is the moral \nstigma there?''\n  Let me talk to you about this bill in particular.\n  I am pleased that Senator Grassley and I have been able to work well \non many issues in this bill, and I will try to continue to do so. But \nlet me suggest there are some changes that I would still like to see in \nthis bill.\n  We must make sure that reform of the bankruptcy system doesn't \nactually end up hurting vulnerable groups like women trying to collect \nalimony, children dependent on child support payments, and the elderly \nliving on fixed incomes.\n  We have a fixed amount of money here; a limited amount of assets. \nThere will be a struggle and a fight over who will walk away with them. \nIf you give additional assets from a bankrupt estate to a credit card \ncompany, you could do it at the expense of child support obligations. \nThe Children's Defense Fund is opposed to the bill. That is one of the \nmajor reasons. Their concern is that this bill still does not protect \nchild support payments. I think that is a major concern.\n  We have to make certain that we lift that up to a level that is \nsensible. Keep in mind if we do not, we are going to assume that burden \nas a society. Children who do not receive their child support payments \nare kids who end up on welfare; kids who end up dependent on the \nTreasury of the United States and the States of our Union in an effort \nto survive.\n  I hope we will be able to adopt an amendment which will, in fact, \nprovide more protection when it comes to child support.\n  Second, we must make sure that the reforms do not increase \nopportunities for creditors to themselves abuse and distort this \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\n  I will not go through the lengthy history that we have of this \nprocess of reaffirmation.\n  What is reaffirmation? I file for bankruptcy and I have a debt, and \ninstead of having it discharged so I don't owe it any longer, I \nvoluntarily agree to reaffirm that debt and to continue to pay all or \npart of it. Why would a person do that? What if you walked into the \nbankruptcy court and you owed money on your car? You need a car to get \nto work. You better reaffirm that debt on the car so you can continue \nto make the payments, even if you are discharged from bankruptcy from \nall other debts. It makes sense. Someone walks into a bankruptcy court \nand says, ``My family has done business with that department store \ndowntown for three generations, and I just could not stiff them. I will \nreaffirm my debt. I will pay it. Just discharge the rest of my debts.''\n  The problem we have is in many instances creditors--major department \nstores and retail chains--have misled the debtors into believing they \nmust reaffirm their debts; that they can't get off the hook in \nbankruptcy. I want to make sure that this bill does not create more \nopportunities for this to happen. I hope just the opposite will be \ntrue.\n  Finally, let me urge that in the course of the debate on bankruptcy \nwe address both sides of the problems. To those who are abusing the \nbankruptcy system, who walk into court and try to, through all sorts of \nchicanery, escape their obligations and their debts, we say: This will \nstop. And, on the other side, we say to the credit card industry: You \nalso have an obligation.\n  Sadly, all of this focus on the bankruptcy code simply helps to \nobscure a far more important and dangerous feature of our consumer \neconomy--the profligate availability of risky credit.\n  Merely making bankruptcy abuse harder is only part of the equation. \nThe other part is preventing bankruptcy in the first place by \nencouraging more responsibility from the banks, as well as consumers.\n  Come with me to a ``Big-Ten'' football game this autumn--a wonderful \nexperience--in Champaign or Bement, Illinois--and walk into that \nstadium. What you are going to find there will be a booth giving away \nT-shirts. Mark my words. If you will take a T-shirt, you will also take \nan application for an official University of Illinois credit card. Kids \nfresh out of high school are signing up for credit cards when they are \n18 to get a free T-shirt. You will find these booths at virtually all \nsorts of events.\n  These sorts of things are going on at such a pace that, frankly, it \nhas become almost scandalous. Credit cards are being issued to people \nwho are mentally incompetent. They are being issued to pets; being \nissued to folks who have no business owning a credit card.\n  I want to make sure that we straighten up that side of the equation \nas well.\n  I want to make sure that the people who send us monthly credit card \nstatements are open and honest. When they say your minimum monthly \npayment is ``X,'' they ought to tell you how many months it will take \nyou to pay it off if you make the minimum monthly payment, and how much \nyou are going to pay in interest. They ought to provide people with a \nsimple worksheet so when they apply for a credit card they will \nunderstand where they stand financially. If fact, if the credit card \ncompany hasn't done any kind of analysis of your credit standing and \nthey are offering credit blindly, you ought to know that.\n  In addition, I want to make sure that we provide in these credit card \nstatements a clear statement of the conditions.\n  This same University of Illinois credit card solicitation--I don't \nwant to pick on them--said, and I quote, ``permanent introductory rate \nof 5.9 percent.''\n  You don't have to be a business major to understand that \n``permanent'' and ``introductory'' don't go together. What happens, of \ncourse, is that in a short period of time the interest rate goes \nthrough the roof.\n  Let me conclude on this note.\n  We can spend all of our time trying to punish or prevent a small \nnumber of abuses. We can also work on something infinitely more \nconstructive. We can try to help prevent financial catastrophes.\n  What I propose is a small step in that direction which works on the \nprinciple that a well-informed consumer is best able to protect \nhimself. I am happy to join with my colleague, Senator Grassley, in an \neffort to change the bankruptcy code, but let us do it in a fair way \nthat does not penalize the recipients of child support, that doesn't \ngive an upper hand to creditors who abuse the system, and which says to \nthe credit card industry, yes, we will clean up abuses in bankruptcy \ncourt but certainly you should extend your responsibility to issue \ncredit responsibly to a well-informed consumer.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9917-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9921-S9922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONSIDERATION OF THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just about an hour ago, we had the \nmajority leader taking the floor and making the request that we go to \nthe bankruptcy legislation, as is his authority, and then making a \nmotion to move toward the bankruptcy bill and filing cloture. And I \nassume, as others would, that we will be debating this legislation next \nweek.\n  In an exchange with the majority leader, I questioned him as to why \nwe were not considering taking up the HMO legislation, the Patients' \nBill of Rights. We could either take up the legislation that had been \nintroduced by the Republicans and lay that down as our leader, Senator \nDaschle, has suggested, or permit some other way or means that we could \nhave a full debate and discussion on that legislation.\n  As I pointed out in the very brief exchange with the majority leader, \nwe are talking considering legislation that affects about 1.4 million \nbankruptcies, with all the importance and consequences that has, as \nexpressed by our friends and colleagues from Iowa and from Illinois and \nstated eloquently by both of them in recent times, or whether we should \nbe considering a measure that affects 165 million Americans with health \ninsurance coverage.\n  When I go home to Massachusetts and travel around the state, I hear \nfrom families wondering when the Congress is going to take action to \nmake sure that health care decisions are going to be made by medical \nofficials, by doctors and by nurses, rather than by accountants and \ninsurance company personnel. That is what the people are talking about. \nThat is what they were talking about during August.\n  I asked the majority leader whether we would be able to have the \nopportunity to debate this issue. And as is the wont of the majority \nleader and the assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, they have \nsaid, look, you are either going to take it or leave it with our \nproposal. You are either going to take it the way we want it--that is, \nyou can offer two or three amendments, and we can offer two or three \namendments --and, if you are willing to take that, we are willing to \nschedule it; otherwise, we are not.\n  They are, for all intents and purposes, gagging the Senate. We do not \nhave any such condition on the measure that is before us this \nafternoon, the bankruptcy bill. There are a number of very worthwhile, \nsubstantive amendments for this measure. The majority leader did not \ncome out here and say take it or leave it on the bankruptcy bill. No, \nno. Why? Because the credit card industry and the banking industry have \nthe votes to pass this legislation, and, as has been publicly \nrecognized, they have expended some $50 million in order to support the \nmovement of this legislation.\n  Yet, we find out that there are children in our country today who are \nbeing denied a CAT scan because of an automobile accident or because of \na bicycle accident or because of some other kind of an accident. They \ndo not make large contributions to push forward legislation that will \nhelp them. Nor do the women who are denied access to clinical trials or \nobstetrical and gynecological care.\n  And so, Mr. President, we are being effectively gagged by the \nRepublican leadership in debating and discussing and voting on the most \nimportant health measure that we will be faced with this year. Again, \nwhen asked\n\n[[Page S9922]]\n\nwhen we can proceed to this important legislation, the majority leader, \nas is his wont, calls for regular order: We are not going to listen to \nany voices in the Senate that have been trying to get to this measure \nfor over a year and a half, either a hearing or a markup in the \nappropriate committee. No, thumbs down. Scheduled on the floor of the \nSenate? Absolutely not, unless you take it our way.\n  Now, Mr. President, you can--and the majority leader has been \nsuccessful up to this time--avoid having the opportunity for such a \ndebate and discussion, but I do not really understand the reasons why. \nWhy are the Republicans objecting to debating the gag issue or about \nemergency room access? Why shouldn t patients who believe they are \nhaving an emergency based on a reasonable person's judgment be assured \ncoverage at the nearest emergency room? Why shouldn't we be able to \ndebate what would be the appropriate responsibility of HMOs on these \nissues?\n  Why shouldn't we be able to debate whether you can keep your own \ndoctor or whether you have access to specialists or whether you are \nable to have specialists for primary care, as many women, in \nparticular, so need in our society today? And why not discuss the \nimportance of access to clinical trials, or a right to timely appeals--\nboth internal and external--and health plan accountability? Why should \nthe health insurance industry be the only industry that can cause death \nand disability and be excluded from accountability in the United States \nof America? Should we not have the opportunity to debate that issue and \ncall the roll? Not according to the majority leader. No, no, not \naccording to the majority leader. You either take it or leave it.\n  Now, that has been the position effectively on HMOs, the position on \ncampaign financing, the position on any increase in the minimum wage: \nTake ours or leave it.\n  Now, he is entitled and has authority as the majority leader to make \nthese decisions, but we also have prerogatives in this body, and we can \nexercise those prerogatives and, as Senator Daschle has indicated, will \neither do it in a regular way according to the rules of the Senate or \nwe will have some other opportunity to do so.\n  This body should not be gagged, as the majority leader is doing when \nhe responds: You will take three amendments and that is it. It is very \nclear what the priorities are for the Republican leadership--protect \nthe banks and the credit card companies--protect the insurance \nindustry--protect their friends. All you have to do is look at who is \ngoing to benefit from the HMO reform and patients' rights and who is \ngoing to benefit from the bankruptcy legislation.\n  Who is going to benefit from the bankruptcy legislation? The banks \nand the credit card companies that have been among the most profitable \nindustries in this country in the last few years. Who benefits from \nPatients' Bill of Rights? Working families benefit from it. Children \nbenefit from it. Senior citizens benefit from it. The average citizen \nin this country benefits from it.\n  But, no, no, the Senate hasn't got time for that. Make no mistake. \nWhat was determined this afternoon by the leadership is that the Senate \nis favoring the banks and credit card companies and we are giving short \nshrift, short shrift to those who are dependent upon, in too many \ninstances, the kinds of HMOs in this country that are not putting the \nmedical decisions in the hands of doctors.\n  Why is it that nearly 200 of the leading national medical \nassociations, nursing organizations, patient coalitions, disability \ngroups, mental health groups, religious organizations, small businesses \nand consumer groups support the Daschle bill? I have been in the \nChamber when I have listened to the majority leader and my friend from \nOklahoma, Senator Nickles, talk about their bill. We haven't heard of \none single patients' organization that supports their bill. Every one \nof them supports the Daschle bill. So, when we say let us at least have \nthe opportunity to debate it, we mean let's discuss each of the various \nelements. Let us have an opportunity to address those measures, with \nrelevant amendments--they are right here. I would settle for amendments \non the particular measures on this chart this afternoon, if I were \nasked, with time limits. But let's have accountability. Let's have \naccountability. Why is the Republican leadership saying to every doctor \nwho is represented by those organizations, to every nurse, to every \npatient or survivor of every breast cancer group, ``No, we can't debate \nyour proposal''?\n\n  So we are going to work at it and we are going to keep at it, time in \nand time out.\n  I know there are others who want to speak. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has just expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, finally, on another measure we have \nattempted to bring up here, and we will have the opportunity to do so, \nit is to recognize a fundamental issue of fairness and equity in our \ncountry, and that is an increase in the minimum wage.\n  I ask the Chair to let me know when I have 1 minute left.\n  We have had the most extraordinary economic prosperity in the history \nof this country. We have had the explosion in terms of Wall Street, \neven with its ups and downs. We have the lowest rates of unemployment, \nthe lowest rates of inflation.\n  Over the many debates which have taken place since I have been here \nin the U.S. Senate, since 1962--and we have raised the minimum wage \nduring this time five different times with Republican and Democratic \nsupport--we are always faced with two issues: If we increase the \nminimum wage, we are going to add to inflation and add to unemployment. \nIt is fair for those who oppose the increase in the minimum wage to ask \nus, now that we saw the last increase in 1996-1997--we have seen an \nincrease of 90 cents. For whom? The working poor; men and women working \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, who pay their bills and play by \nthe rules--words that were used by the Senator from Iowa. They are the \nworkers. They are the workers, struggling.\n  Mr. President, our particular amendment, if successful, with a dollar \nin the next 2 years, would move it up by the year 2000 to $6.15. That \nwould be $5.76, in terms of purchasing power. It would still be lower \nthan what it was for a period of some 20 years--25 years, in purchasing \npower, at a time of extraordinary prosperity and economic growth.\n  In every one of these debates they say if you raise it, you will see \nhigher unemployment and you will see higher inflation. Look what \nhappened the last time. When we raised the minimum wage in 1997, the \nunemployment rate was 4.9 percent and the rate of inflation was 1.7. \nThen we raised the minimum wage. We raised the minimum wage. Today, the \nunemployment rate is--higher? No, it is lower. It is 4.5 percent, and \nthe rate of inflation is 1.4 percent. Mr. President, 3.7 million new \njobs have been added. Executive salaries have exploded and gone up \nthrough the roof, but the real purchasing income for the needy working \nfamilies of this country continues to fall further and further behind.\n  Those who receive the minimum wage primarily are women--60 percent. \nIt is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. These are children of \nworking families. Family values? This is it. When you get an increase \nin the minimum wage, those families say, ``Now we no longer have to \nwork three jobs, we can work two. Maybe we don't have the time to spend \nwith our children.'' But this is an issue of dignity for those who are \nout there working. It is an issue of fairness. It is an issue of \ndecency.\n  This body, at the time of this extraordinary economic growth and \nprosperity, at a time when we in this body have benefited from a cost-\nof-living adjustment of more than $3,000 since our last increase in the \nminimum wage,\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\nought to be able to say to those working poor that we understand, when \nthey work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, they ought not to be \ncontinuing to live in poverty.\n  Mr. President, those issues are going to come back to us and we will \naddress them, I guarantee you, before the end of the session.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to make the most difficult \nand distasteful statement, for me probably the most difficult statement \nI have made on this floor in the 10 years I have been a Member of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  On August 17, President Clinton testified before a grand jury \nconvened by the independent counsel and then talked to the American \npeople about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White \nHouse intern. He told us that the relationship was ``not appropriate,'' \nthat it was ``wrong,'' and that it was ``a critical lapse of judgment \nand a personal failure'' on his part. In addition, after 7 months of \ndenying that he had engaged in a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, \nthe President admitted that his ``public comments about this matter \ngave a false impression.'' He said, ``I misled people.''\n  Mr. President, my immediate reaction to this statement that night it \nwas delivered was deep disappointment and personal anger. I was \ndisappointed because the President of the United States had just \nconfessed to engaging in an extramarital affair with a young woman in \nhis employ and to willfully deceiving the Nation about his conduct. I \nwas personally angry because President Clinton had, by his disgraceful \nbehavior, jeopardized his administration's historic record of \naccomplishment, much of which grew out of the principles and programs \nthat he and I and many others had worked on together in the new \nDemocratic movement. I was also angry because I was one of the many \npeople who had said over the preceding 7 months that if the President \nclearly and explicitly denies the allegations against him, that of \ncourse I believe him.\n  Since that Monday night I have not commented on this matter publicly. \nI thought I had an obligation to consider the President's admissions \nmore objectively, less personally, and to try to put them in a clearer \nperspective. And I felt that I owed that much to the President, for \nwhom I have great affection and admiration, and who I truly believe has \nworked tirelessly to make life tangibly better in so many ways for so \nmany Americans.\n  But the truth is that, after much reflection, my feelings of \ndisappointment and anger have not dissipated, except now these feelings \nhave gone beyond my personal dismay to a larger, graver sense of loss \nfor our country, a reckoning of the damage that the President's conduct \nhas done to the proud legacy of his Presidency, and ultimately an \naccounting of the impact of his actions on our democracy and its moral \nfoundations. The implications for our country are so serious that I \nfeel a responsibility to my constituents in Connecticut, as well as to \nmy conscience, to voice my concerns forthrightly and publicly. And I \ncan think of no more appropriate place to do that than on this great \nSenate floor.\n  I have chosen to speak particularly at this time before the \nindependent counsel files his report because, while we do not know \nenough yet to answer the question of whether there are legal \nconsequences of the President's conduct, we do know enough from what \nthe President acknowledged on August 17 to answer a separate and \ndistinct set of questions about the moral consequences for our country. \nMr. President, I have come to this floor many times in the past to \nspeak with my colleagues about the concerns which are so widely shared \nin this Chamber and throughout the Nation that our society's standards \nare sinking; that our common moral code is deteriorating and that our \npublic life is coarsening.\n\n  In doing so, I have specifically criticized leaders of the \nentertainment industry for the way they have used the enormous \ninfluence they wield to weaken our common values. And now, because the \nPresident commands at least as much attention and exerts at least as \nmuch influence on our collective consciousness as any Hollywood \ncelebrity or television show, it is hard to ignore the impact of the \nmisconduct the President has admitted to on our culture, on our \ncharacter and on our children.\n  To begin with, I must respectfully disagree with the President's \ncontention that his relationship with Monica Lewinsky and the way in \nwhich he misled us about it is nobody's business but his family's and \nthat even Presidents have private lives, as he said.\n  Whether he or we think it fair or not, the reality is in 1998 that a \nPresident's private life is public. Contemporary news media standards \nwill have it no other way. Surely, this President was given fair notice \nof that by the amount of time the news media has dedicated to \ninvestigating his personal life during the 1992 campaign and in the \nyears since.\n  But there is more to this than modern media intrusiveness. The \nPresident is not just the elected leader of our country. He is, as \nPresidential scholar Clinton Rossiter observed, ``The one-man \ndistillation of the American people,'' and as President Taft said at \nanother time, ``The personal embodiment and representative of their \ndignity and majesty.'' So when his personal conduct is embarrassing, it \nis sadly so not just for him and his family, it is embarrassing for all \nof us as Americans.\n  The President is a role model who, because of his prominence and the \nmoral authority that emanates from his office, sets standards of \nbehavior for the people he serves. His duty, as the Reverand Nathan \nBaxter of the National Cathedral here in Washington said in a recent \nsermon, ``is nothing less than the stewardship of our values.'' So no \nmatter how much the President or others may wish to compartmentalize \nthe different spheres of his life, the inescapable truth is that the \nPresident's private conduct can and often does have profound public \nconsequences.\n  In this case, the President apparently had extramarital relations \nwith an employee half his age and did so in the workplace, in the \nvicinity of the Oval Office. Such behavior is not just inappropriate, \nit is immoral and it is harmful, for it sends a message of what is \nacceptable behavior to the larger American family, particularly to our \nchildren, which is as influential as the negative message that is \ncommunicated by the entertainment culture.\n  If you doubt that, just ask America's parents about the intimate and \nfrequently unseemly sexual questions their young children have been \nasking them about and discussing since the President's relationship \nwith Ms. Lewinsky became public 7 months ago. I have had many of those \nconversations with parents, particularly in Connecticut, and from them \nI conclude that parents across our country feel much as I do that \nsomething very sad and sordid has happened in American life when I \ncannot watch the news on television with my 10-year-old daughter \nanymore.\n  This, unfortunately, is all too familiar territory for America's \nfamilies in today's ``anything goes'' culture, where sexual promiscuity \nis too often treated as just another lifestyle choice with little risk \nof adverse consequences. It is this mindset that has helped to threaten \nthe integrity and stability of the family which continues to be the \nmost important unit of civilized society, the place where we raise our \nchildren and teach them to be responsible citizens, to develop and \nnurture their personal and moral faculties.\n  President Clinton, in fact, has shown during the course of his \nPresidency that he understands this and the broad concern in the public \nabout the threat to the family. He has used the bully pulpit of his \nPresidency to eloquently and effectively call for the renewal of our \ncommon values, particularly the principle of personal responsibility \nand our common commitment to family. He has spoken out admirably \nagainst sexual promiscuity among teenagers in clear terms of right and \nwrong, emphasizing the consequences involved.\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\n  All of that makes the President's misconduct so confusing and so \ndamaging. The President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky not only \ncontradicted the values he has publicly embraced over the last 6 years, \nit has, I fear, compromised his moral authority at a time when \nAmericans of every political persuasion agree that the decline of the \nfamily is one of the most pressing problems we are facing.\n  Nevertheless, I believe that the President could have lessened the \nharm his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky has caused if he had \nacknowledged his mistake and spoken with candor about it to the \nAmerican people shortly after it became public in January. But, as we \nnow know, he chose not to do this. This deception is particularly \ntroubling because it was not just a reflexive and, in many ways, \nunderstandable human act of concealment to protect himself and his \nfamily from what he called the embarrassment of his own conduct when he \nwas confronted with it in the deposition in the Jones case, but rather \nit was the intentional and premeditated decision to do so.\n  In choosing this path, I fear that the President has undercut the \nefforts of millions of American parents who are naturally trying to \ninstill in our children the value of honesty. As most any mother and \nfather knows, kids have a singular ability to detect double standards. \nSo we can safely assume that it will be that much more difficult to \nconvince our sons and daughters of the importance of telling the truth \nwhen the most powerful man in the Nation evades it.\n  Many parents I have spoken with in Connecticut confirm this \nunfortunate consequence. The President's intentional and consistent \nstatements more deeply may also undercut the trust that the American \npeople have in his word.\n  Under the Constitution, as Presidential scholar Richard Neustadt has \nnoted, the President's ultimate source of authority, particularly his \nmoral authority, is the power to persuade, to mobilize public opinion, \nto build consensus behind a common agenda, and at this the President \nhas been extraordinarily effective. But that power hinges on the \nPresident's support among the American people and their faith and \nconfidence in his motivations and agenda, yes, but also in his word. As \nTeddy Roosevelt once explained, ``My power vanishes into thin air the \ninstant that my fellow citizens, who are straight and honest, cease to \nbelieve that I represent them and fight for what is straight and \nhonest. That is all the strength that I have.''\n  Sadly, with his deception, President Clinton may have weakened the \ngreat power and strength that he possesses of which President Roosevelt \nspoke. I know this is a concern that many of my colleagues share, which \nis to say that the President has hurt his credibility and, therefore, \nperhaps his chances of moving his policy agenda forward. But I believe \nthat the harm the President's actions have caused extend beyond the \npolitical arena.\n\n  I am afraid that the misconduct the President has admitted may be \nreinforcing one of the worst messages being delivered by our popular \nculture, which is that values are fungible. And I am concerned that his \nmisconduct may help to blur some of the most bright lines of right and \nwrong in our society.\n  Mr. President, I said at the outset that this was a very difficult \nstatement to write and deliver. That is true, very true. And it is \ntrue, in large part, because it is so personal and yet needs to be \npublic, but also because of my fear that it will appear unnecessarily \njudgmental. I truly regret this. I know from the Bible that only God \ncan judge people. The most that we can do is to comment, without \ncondemning individuals. And in this case I have tried to comment on the \nconsequences of the President's conduct on our country.\n  I know that the President is far from alone in the wrongdoing he has \nadmitted. We, as humans, are all imperfect. We are all sinners. Many \nhave betrayed a loved one, and most have told lies. Members of Congress \nhave certainly been guilty of such behavior, as have some previous \nPresidents. We must try to understand the complexity and difficulty of \npersonal relationships, which should give us pause before passing \njudgment on them. We all fall short of the standards our best values \nset for us. Certainly I do.\n  But the President, by virtue of the office he sought and was elected \nto, has traditionally been held to a higher standard. This is as it \nshould be. Because the American President, as I quoted earlier, is not \njust the one-man distillation of the American people but today the most \npowerful person in the world, and, as such, the consequences of his \nmisbehavior, even private misbehavior, are much greater than that of an \naverage citizen, a CEO, or even a Senator.\n  That is what I believe Presidential scholar James David Barber, in \nhis book ``The Presidential Character,'' was getting at when he wrote \nthat the public demands ``a sense of legitimacy from, and in, the \nPresidency * * * There is more to this than dignity, more than \npropriety. The President is expected to personify our betterness in an \ninspiring way, to express in what he does and is (not just what he \nsays) a moral idealism which, in much of the public mind, is the very \nopposite of politics.''\n  Just as the American people are demanding of their leaders, though, \nthey are also fundamentally fair and forgiving, which is why I was so \nhopeful the President could begin to repair the damage done with his \naddress to the Nation on the 17th. But like so many others, I came away \nfeeling that, for reasons that are thoroughly human, he missed a great \nopportunity that night.\n  He failed to clearly articulate to the American people that he \nrecognized how significant and consequential his wrongdoing was and how \nbadly he felt about it. He failed to show, I think, that he understood \nhis behavior had diminished the office he holds and the country he \nserves and that it is inconsistent with the mainstream American values \nthat he has advanced as President.\n  And I regret that he failed to acknowledge that while Mr. Starr and \nMs. Lewinsky, Mrs. Tripp, and the news media have each in their own way \ncontributed to the crisis we now face, his Presidency would not be in \nperil if it had not been for the behavior he himself described as \n``wrong'' and ``inappropriate.''\n  Because the conduct the President admitted to that night was serious \nand his assumption of responsibility inadequate, the last 3 weeks have \nbeen dominated by a cacophony of media and political voices calling for \nimpeachment or resignation or censure, while a lesser chorus implores \nus to ``move on'' and get this matter behind us.\n  Appealing as that latter option may be to many people who are \nunderstandably weary of this crisis, the transgressions the President \nhas admitted to are too consequential for us to walk away and leave the \nimpression for our children today and for our posterity tomorrow that \nwhat he acknowledges he did within the White House is acceptable \nbehavior for our Nation's leader.\n  On the contrary, as I have said, it is wrong and unacceptable and \nshould be followed by some measure of public rebuke and accountability. \nWe in Congress--elected representatives of all the American people--are \nsurely capable institutionally of expressing such disapproval through a \nresolution of reprimand or censure of the President for his misconduct, \nbut it is premature to do so, as my colleagues of both parties seem to \nagree, until we have received the report of the independent counsel and \nthe White House's response to it.\n  In the same way, it seems to me that talk of impeachment and \nresignation at this time is unjust and unwise. It is unjust because we \ndo not know enough in fact, and will not until the independent counsel \nreports and the White House responds, to conclude whether we have \ncrossed the high threshold our Constitution rightly sets for \noverturning the results of a popular election in our democracy and \nbringing on the national trauma of removing an incumbent President from \noffice.\n  For now, in fact, all we know for certain is what the President \nacknowledged on August 17. As far as I can see, the rest is rumor, \nspeculation, or hearsay--much less than is required by Members of the \nHouse and Senate in the dispatch of the solemn responsibilities that \nthe Constitution gives us in such circumstances.\n  I believe the talk of impeachment and resignation now is unwise \nbecause it ignores the reality that, while the\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\nindependent counsel proceeds with his investigation, the President is \nstill our Nation's leader, our Commander in Chief. Economic uncertainty \nand other problems here at home, as well as the fiscal and political \ncrises in Russia and Asia, and the growing threats posed by Iraq, North \nKorea, and worldwide terrorism, all demand the President's focused \nleadership. For that reason, while the legal process moves forward, I \nbelieve it is important that we provide the President with the time and \nspace and support he needs to carry out his most important duties and \nprotect our national interest and security.\n  That time and space may also give the President additional \nopportunities to accept personal responsibility for his behavior, to \nrebuild public trust in his leadership, to recommit himself to the \nvalues of opportunity, responsibility, and community that brought him \nto office, and to act to heal the wounds in our national character.\n  In the meantime, as the debate on this matter proceeds, and as the \ninvestigation goes forward, we would all be advised, I would \nrespectfully suggest, to heed the wisdom of Abraham Lincoln's second \nannual address to Congress in 1862. With the Nation at war with itself, \nPresident Lincoln warned:\n\n       If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch \n     arguments, that time is surely not now. In times like the \n     present, men should utter nothing for which they would not \n     willingly be responsible through time and eternity.\n\n  I believe that we are at such a time again today. With so much at \nstake, we too must resist the impulse toward ``catch arguments'' and \nreflex reactions. Let us proceed in accordance with our Nation's \ntraditional moral compass, yes, but in a manner that is fair and at a \npace that is deliberate and responsible.\n  Let us, as a nation, honestly confront the damage that the \nPresident's actions over the last 7 months have caused, but not to the \nexclusion of the good that his leadership has done over the past 6 \nyears nor at the expense of our common interest as Americans. And let \nus be guided by the conscience of the Constitution, which calls on us \nto place the common good above any partisan or personal interest, as we \nnow in our time work together to resolve this serious challenge to our \ndemocracy.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I do not know if the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut said anything between the time I left my office and \ncame here to the floor with which I disagree, but in the time that I \nwatched him from my office and listened to his words from my office, \nand from what I have heard him say in conclusion, I have come before \nthe Senate and I don't disagree with a single word that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has said.\n  I have passed a few words my way at the direction of the President \nfrom time to time, some of them a bit more harsh than I would have \nliked and preferred. It is sometimes my nature to say things a little \ntoo loudly than is deserved in a particular situation. And I have at \nthe same time praised, as I heard the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut do, the President's numerous accomplishments. And they are \nnumerous. I do not question his patriotism. I do not question his \ninstinct for service. I have praised his job as Commander in Chief and \nhave said to the country that there is no better example than Bill \nClinton that a civilian with no military service can be our Commander \nin Chief and can learn as he did, the hard way in Somalia. There are \ntremendous responsibilities that come with that job; and he has \nlistened to the men and women who serve our country. He has been an \nexceptional Commander in Chief.\n  I praised him on a number of other occasions where he has performed \nin a remarkably generous and good-hearted way.\n  I have found, as the Senator from Connecticut did, much with which I \ndisagreed in his statement. I believe it is important for those of us \nwho serve, especially in leadership responsibilities, as I do on the \nDemocratic side, chairing the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, \nto come and say that this is not just inappropriate behavior.\n  I have heard the Senator from Connecticut and his leadership in \ncalling our attention--by that I mean those of us who serve here in \nCongress. We all get, from time to time, a bit isolated. I work hard \nand long trying to do the best that I can for the people of Nebraska. \nIt doesn't give me much time to watch daytime television, to watch what \nis being broadcast, to listen to what is being said, to consider how \nthis could damage the moral fiber of our Nation, especially the moral \nfiber of our children upon whom we depend for so much. And he has come \nto us and told us what is going on and called to our attention that we \nneed to be mindful of the things that we say and the things that we do \nbecause our young people will very often do as we say, far less than \nthey do as we do--they will follow our example.\n  Thus, it seems to me what the Senator from Connecticut has done is \ncome as an American--not as a Democrat, but as an American, as a U.S. \nSenator. I wish to join him and say that the President has got to go \nfar further than he did in his speech to the Nation. This is not just \ninappropriate behavior. This is not a private matter. This is far more \nimportant for our country and threatens far more than his Presidency, \nunless we deal with it in a more honest, and as the Senator from \nConnecticut has said, noncondemning fashion. Lord knows, I am the last \nperson--the Senator from Connecticut said he was a sinner, and I am at \nleast as big. I do not come to the floor arguing that I have superior \nmoral authority to comment on the President's behavior. I am coming \nsimply to say that it is far more than inappropriate, and it is, \nunquestionably, public. It is serious beyond our ability to do our \nwork.\n  I think that we can come back as a Congress and finish out our \nbusiness and perform our responsibilities and do the things that we ask \npermission to do and we sought the power of this office from our people \nto do. But there is a moral dimension to what we do that in many ways \nmay be more important than any legislation that we enact.\n  So I have come here to thank the Senator from Connecticut. It was a \nthoughtful presentation. They were words that we needed to hear. I \nbelieve, in fact, they could become the foundation, the basis, for us \nto heal a wound that will otherwise not just divide Democrat from \nDemocrat--which is likely to occur--but open up a fissure in America \nthat will make it difficult for us to do what all of us, I believe, \nthink is the most important thing to do, and that is to help our \nchildren acquire the character they need not just to be good working \npeople but to be good human beings.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise with the same purpose as my \ncolleague and friend from Nebraska, to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for saying what needed saying, and saying it in a manner \nthat gives us hope at a time of profound despond.\n  In the aftermath of the President's speech on August 17, I commented \nthat it was not adequate. But it was not until just this moment that \nthe full measure of that inadequacy was presented to us in the context \nof the needs of the Nation, of the profound moral consequences that \nwill arise not just from what has happened but from what might happen \nif we do not proceed with the measure of moral compass, but also with a \ncapacity to understand we are all sinners. I say to my friends from \nNebraska and from Connecticut, I am the oldest of the three of us and, \ntherefore, have sinned the most. On that you may be sure.\n  But we have to resolve this. The Senator did not call for any \nimmediate, precipitous action. We have a process in place--imperfect in \nso many respects, but in place--and in time, not distant time, a point \nof decision will come to the Congress, a decision will come to the \nCongress, and it will be for us to discharge our sworn duty. We take an \noath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, uphold and defend \nthe Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic--foreign and domestic, sir, which acknowledges that we can be \nour own worst enemies if we do not hew to\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\nour best standards, knowing that we are all imperfect but have an \nobligation to do our very best.\n  In the words of Lord Mansfield in a case heard in London in 1772 \n(Somersett v. Stewart, 12 Geo. 3), the issue was a profoundly moral \none. A man had a slave in England he wished returned to Jamaica to \nsell. That would have been legal under American law at the time. It was \nnot legal under English law. In an epic statement, Mansfield said, \n``Fiat justitia, ruat coelum''--``Let justice be done, though the \nheavens fall.'' But it also could be indicated, ``If justice is done \nwith sufficient regularity and moderation, the heavens need not fall. \nThey might even rejoice in the nation that has shown a capacity for \nredemption and self-renewal.''\n  So I wish to state my profound gratitude for what you have said and \ndone, and hope we will listen to your wise counsel. I might just say it \nwas in so many ways representative of the very best of our Old and New \nTestament heritage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was somewhat hesitant to speak at this \ntime because I didn't in any way want to make this a partisan series of \nspeeches, but my effort here and my intent is to make it totally \nnonpartisan and bipartisan.\n  I won't say anything today about the specifics of the substance that \nthe Senator from Connecticut addressed. I made my comments on this \nsubject on Monday of this week at a press conference down the hall. But \nI listened carefully, very intently to what the Senator from \nConnecticut had to say. I don't think there was very much more or less \nin what he had to say than what I had said earlier. I think our desire \nand intent, and our wishes and hopes are both the same.\n  Instead, I want to talk today about the Senator from Connecticut. I \nexpected no less than this from him. He is truly one of the Senators in \nthis body that is always standing for the right thing, trying to make \nsure that we do have a moral compass as individuals, as an institution. \nI knew that at some point he would rise and put it all into the proper \nperspective and that he would not go too far, that he would make us \nstop and think--not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Senators and \nAmericans--about the seriousness and the difficulties that have been \ncaused by this situation. So I want to thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for what he had to say, and what he has had to say on many \nother occasions on other subjects, and for the leadership he has \nprovided on children and the violence and the filth they are being \nexposed to, and the leadership and pressure he has exerted to try to \nget us as a country and those involved directly in providing those \nfilms, those scenes, to do something about it. So I thank him.\n  I know it was not easy. I know he has taken time to think about it \nand pray about it for over about 3 weeks now. I know there was probably \na lot of reason not to say anything. But I also know that his \nconscience dictated that he had to express himself. I commend him for \nit and I thank him for it.\n  I also appreciate the fact that Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and the \nSenator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, would come here and lend his \nsupport to what the Senator from Connecticut had to say. This very day, \nI had lunch with the Senator from New York. Maybe the American people \ndo not realize that we are friends off this floor and that we enjoy \neach other's company. And we do travel together. We get to be together \nwith our wives and sometimes even our children. But today at lunch, \nwith Senator Mack of Florida, Senator Roth of Delaware, we were joined \nby the Senator from New York. We talked about the very serious \nsituation in Russia. Every time he joins us, I immediately want to \nraise a part of the world and say, ``What about India and Pakistan?'' \nor ``What about that country or this situation?'' He is such a fountain \nof knowledge and has a wealth of experience and a tremendous \nunderstanding of history and people. I found it very informative, and I \nhave been dwelling on what he had to say about Russia this afternoon.\n  I think at times like this, when our Constitution is going to be \nreviewed again as to what it means and when we are going to have to \nmake decisions about what to do when we are presented with a set of \nfacts--which may be nothing--it is going to be so important that there \nare some men and women on both sides of the aisle in this body, and in \nthe other body, that can reach across the aisle and say, ``What do we \ndo?'' and, most important, ``What is best for our country?'' With these \nmen, and with others in this Chamber here today such as Senator Hatch, \nSenator Coats, Senator Nickles, and the great Strom Thurmond, I am sure \nwe will find a way to rise above petty politics and do the right thing, \nand Senator Lieberman will lead the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in many respects, I have been pulling for \nthe President to pull through this problem and one who had hoped that \nthe speech he gave never would have had to have been given, and who \nstill is very concerned about our country and how this matter is \nhandled.\n  I want to express my gratitude to the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut and my dear friends from Nebraska and New York, as well, \nfor the moral compass that they have brought to the U.S. Senate floor \nthis day, and really for the fine work they have done through the years \nin some of these very difficult matters.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Connecticut stands and speaks on \nthese particular issues, he does so with authority because he has \nspoken out on so many moral issues in the past, and I think with good \neffect. I think it is important for all of us to reserve judgment on \nthese matters until we have the report of Judge Starr. At that time, we \ncan look at it and make determinations as to what should be done. There \nis no question that the President has been embarrassed by some of the \nthings that have happened. There is also no question that these are \ndifficult times for him, his wife, his daughter, and others in the \nadministration--frankly, for all of us. Let's hope that we can approach \nthis matter with kindness and deliberation and do the things that \nreally need to be done in this area and, again, as the majority leader \nsaid, do what is in the best interest of our country. That may give us \na number of alternatives that may be very just and worthwhile and \nbeneficial to the country. Let's hope we choose the right path.\n  In any event, I express my gratitude to these members of the other \nparty because I know how difficult it is for them to come to the floor \nand speak on this issue. I respect them for having done so. It is a \ndifficult set of issues, and certainly I feel very deeply about them as \nwell. I express my gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9926-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9926-S9927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE BANKRUPTCY REFORM BILL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed in my good \nfriend and colleague from Massachusetts, who has chosen to object to \neven proceeding to the bankruptcy reform legislation. The fact is that \nthis Grassley-Durbin legislation has broad bipartisan support. This \nparticular bill passed the Judiciary Committee with a 16-2 vote.\n  This piece of consensus legislation reflects the tireless efforts of \nboth\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\nDemocrat and Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, at subcommittee markup, no less than eight amendments \nwere offered, all of which were adopted. Furthermore, at the full \ncommittee markup, 13 amendments were offered and eight of them were \nadopted. So there has been a real bipartisan effort to resolve the \nproblems.\n  A number of changes requested by my colleagues on the minority side \nwere included in a comprehensive substitute amendment that was adopted \nat the markup.\n  All during this process, I have been open to other changes. In fact, \nI worked with Senator Dodd to address his concerns that the legislation \nmay have an adverse impact on the ability of ex-spouses and children to \ncollect support payments. Along with Senators Grassley and Kyl, I \nintroduced a comprehensive amendment that creates new legal protections \nfor ex-spouses and children who are owed child support and all money \npayments.\n  This amendment not only ensures that S. 1301 will have no adverse \neffect on child support and alimony payments, but also creates \nsignificant new legal protections that strengthen the ability of ex-\nspouses and children to collect the payments that they are owed. So we \nhave made every effort to accommodate everybody here.\n  Further, I want to respond to the suggestion that this legislation \ndoes not help real working families. Mr. President, this bill does \nexactly that. It is an important bill that will help millions of \nAmerican families. In fact, abuses of the current bankruptcy system \nimpose a $400 tax per family.\n  Let me be clear. This is not $400 per family that declares \nbankruptcy; this is a tax on every American family. This legislation is \ndesigned to remedy that.\n  Again, I am extremely disappointed that we have not been allowed to \nproceed with this important bill, and I hope we can invoke cloture on \nthis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9926-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9927-S9929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 10\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be in order for the majority leader, after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, to proceed to Calendar No. \n210, S. 10, the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act, and that it \nbe considered under the following limitations:\n  The only amendments in order be a substitute amendment offered by \nSenators Hatch and Sessions, and the following listed amendments:\n  An amendment by Senator Campbell on law enforcement concealed carry;\n  Senator Lugar on jail drug treatment;\n  Senator Hutchison, SOS on prosecutions;\n  Senator Smith of Oregon, juveniles with weapons at school;\n  Senator Hatch, relevant amendment;\n  And, five relevant amendments offered by the minority leader or \ndesignee;\n  There be a managers' package of amendments to be cleared by both the \nmajority and minority manager;\n  And, that each amendment be subject to relevant second degrees.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent following the disposition of any or \nall amendments the bill be read a third time, the Judiciary Committee \nbe discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3, and the Senate \nproceed to its consideration; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, and the text of S. 10, as amended, be inserted in lieu \nthereof; the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a \nvote on passage of the bill.

Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Utah?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I regret \nthat on behalf of the minority leader we must object to the unanimous \nconsent that was just propounded. On this side Members are working to \ntry to find a way to make some progress on this matter and a number of \nmatters related to criminal justice that also need attention. So I \nmust, therefore, formally object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand my colleague is acting on \nbehalf of the minority leader, as I am for the majority leader and the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. But I am disappointed that Members on the \nother side of the aisle do not wish to take up juvenile crime \nlegislation under an agreement that provides the Senate chance of \ngetting this done. We all know that time is short and the schedule \ncrowded in the last weeks of a session, and in my view, the only way we \ncan get this important bill done is to work in good faith to limit \namendments.\n\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that this issue, and this \nlegislation are not new. It has been over a year since the Judiciary \nCommittee completed action on S. 10, the most comprehensive reform and \nreauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act \nin that law's 25 year history. Since the Judiciary Committee completed \naction on S. 10, we have heard many suggestions on the key provisions \nof this bill. Many suggestions we received were helpful, and are \nincorporated in the substitute amendment. And I should note for my \ncolleagues that the minority has had the text of this substitute for \nwell over a month. The substitute is a good faith effort to respond to \nthe legitimate concerns of all members, and makes changes to improve \nand streamline the block grant, clarify the juvenile records \nprovisions, and improve the anti-gang provisions while ensuring the \nprotection of the rights of law abiding citizens.\n  All of us have been shocked over the past several months, as our \nnation has witnessed a series of atrocious crimes committed by \njuveniles. These incidents bring home to all of us the reality of \njuvenile crime. And the reality is that we can no longer sit silently \nby as children kill children, as teenagers commit truly heinous \noffenses, as our juvenile drug abuse rate continues to climb. FBI data \nconfirms the national problem of rampant juvenile violent crime. In \n1996, juveniles accounted for nearly one fifth--19 percent--of all \ncriminal arrests in the United States. Persons under 18 committed 15 \npercent of all murders, 17 percent of all rapes, and 32.1 percent of \nall robberies.\n  Our juvenile crime problem has taken a new and sinister direction. I \ncan imagine few acts more heinous than some of the crimes recently \ncommitted by juveniles around the country. We seem now to be in a new \nera, in which juveniles are committing sophisticated adult crimes. This \ndisturbing trend demonstrates the need to reform the juvenile justice \nsystem that is failing the victims of juvenile crime, failing too many \nof our young people, and ultimately, failing to protect the public.\n  The Senate has before it comprehensive youth violence legislation. S. \n10, the Hatch-Sessions Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Act, was \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee last year on bipartisan vote, \ntwo to one vote. This legislation will fundamentally reform and \nredirect the role played by the federal government in addressing \njuvenile crime in our Nation.\n  S. 10 provides the framework to address the modest federal role in \nreforming a system that neither protects the public nor succeeds in \npreventing juvenile crime or rehabilitating the offenders. That is why, \nI believe, it has the support of law enforcement organizations such as \nthe Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and \nthe National Troopers Coalition, as well as the support of juvenile \njustice practitioners such as the Juvenile Judges Association, and \nvictim's groups including the National Victims Center and the National \nOrganization for Victims Assistance.\n  In short, S. 10 lays the groundwork for a new national approach to \nthe problem of juvenile crime. This is not a federal approach. Indeed, \nmuch of S. 10, including the flexible block grant program, the reform \nof the mandates under the current JJDPA, and the reform of the federal \njuvenile code that applies to the handful of juvenile cases in federal \ncourt, all take their lead from successful reforms in the states.\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\n But it is past time for the federal government to adjust its \napproach to juvenile crime, in order to give realistic and meaningful \nassistance to state and local reforms. We simply need to pass this \nbill.\n\n  S. 10 will accomplish this. The bill we wish to bring to the floor \nincludes a $450 million per year block grant states and local \ngovernments can use to initiate graduated sanctions, build much-needed \njuvenile corrections facilities, improve juvenile criminal records, and \nfund a wide variety of prevention programs. The bill provides $100 \nmillion a year for state and local prosecutors and courts, for their \njuvenile crime dockets. The bill provides $50 million per year for an \ninnovative prevention program run by the private sector, to help keep \nour young people away from crime to start with. And the bill provides \n$50 million per year for states to upgrade their juvenile criminal \nrecords, so that police, courts, and prosecutors all have vital \ninformation regarding the records of juvenile offenders.\n  And this bill beefs up federal laws against interstate gang crime, by \nincluding a modified version of the Hatch-Feinstein Federal Gang \nViolence Act. In recent years, criminal street gangs not only have \nincreased in size and strength, but also have become more \nsophisticated. Gang activity has spread across the country at a \nstartling rate and is placing more and more of our people in harm's \nway. Interstate and international criminal gang activity is becoming a \nnational crisis, and it is time for the federal government to take a \ngreater role in assisting state and local law enforcement efforts in \naddressing these criminal enterprises.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues may suggest that this bill \ninadequately funds prevention programs. This is demonstrably not the \ncase. And they know it. We all recognize the value of programs that \nintervene in the lives of juveniles to prevent crime before it starts. \nThey are important. The federal government already spends about $4.1 \nbillion a year on programs aimed at delinquent and at-risk youth. The \nHatch-Sessions juvenile crime bill adds another $2.145 billion over 5 \nyears to these efforts. We are doing some great things through public-\nprivate partnerships with youth groups like the Boys and Girls Clubs, \nand we will continue to do this. What we need is to ensure that the \nprevention programs that we have are backed up by a juvenile justice \nsystem that takes crime seriously, and imposes real sanctions for \njuvenile crime.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the Senate to act, and I commend the \nMajority Leader for attempting to bring this bill up at this time. We \nshould debate this bill, debate the amendments, and vote. We have tried \nfor months to get a list of amendments from the minority. We have seen \nnothing. Accordingly, I believe we should try to limit--in the \ninterests of our children and public safety--the partisan debate which \ntoo often infects criminal justice issues. We must not let petty \npolitics stand in the way of fulfilling our commitment to the American \npeople--this matter is too important to our nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his \noutstanding leadership in juvenile justice and juvenile justice reform, \nas he mentioned, and the other issues that come before that committee. \nThe distinguished chairman is a great constitutional lawyer and a great \nchampion of law and order.\n  I came to this body less than 2 years ago. I was a prosecutor for \nover 15 years in my professional career. I have found myself with the \nopportunities and challenges of being the chairman of the Youth \nViolence Subcommittee. I made up my mind that we were not going to play \npolitics, and that we were going to produce a bill that would have a \npractical impact and effect in a way that would reduce juvenile crime \nin America. That was the goal we set out to accomplish.\n  We developed some excellent ideas and have worked with the Democratic \nmembers of the committee continuously. The committee, on a 2 to 1 vote, \nwith bipartisan support, has cleared this bill and brought it to the \nfloor. I must say that I am extremely disappointed to learn today that \nthere will be no limit on debate on this bill.\n  The majority leader, Senator Lott, has a lot of important pieces of \nlegislation, and I have asked him to keep this bill alive, to keep it \nup on the agenda so that we can have a vote on it. We want to vote on \nit. But we cannot spend all of our time on this legislation, but we do \nnot have cooperation from the other side. We had 8 weeks of debate on \nthis legislation in committee, and I consider it to be the most \nsignificant juvenile crime legislation maybe ever, certainly in the \nlast 20 years.\n  As with most meaningful pieces of legislation, there have been some \ndisagreements, so we worked hard, as Senator Hatch said, time and time \nagain to make this bill more palatable to Democratic Senators. We \nmodified it in several important areas. These modifications are in the \nbill and would be part of the consent agreement if we could get it \ntoday.\n  So I am deeply disappointed that the minority party has rejected the \nunanimous consent proposal and in effect has jeopardized once again our \nability to pass a strong, effective juvenile justice bill which would \nstrengthen the juvenile system and actually reduce juvenile crime. We \nworked in good faith with the minority and the changes we made were \ndesigned to further accommodate them. The changes were painful and \nfrustrating to me, and I hated to include them, but I did so in the \nhope that we could gain the kind of bipartisan support that would \nultimately lead to passage of the things that most of us who have \nstudied this legislation believe are critical. I am disappointed that \nwe have not achieved that end.\n  There are several important things I want to mention that are in the \nbill. There is a $2.5 billion block grant program to strengthen the \nState juvenile justice system. The money goes directly to the States. \nAnd 75 percent of the money has to go to the counties where the \njuvenile courts are, where the juvenile judges are overwhelmed, where \nthey have no juvenile halfway houses, detention centers; they do not \nhave money for drug testing. We need to strengthen that activity so \nthat that juvenile judge, when a young person comes before him or her \ncharged with a crime, the judge has the resources and the capacity to \nintervene effectively in that child's life. And if the judge intervenes \neffectively, they can perhaps change that child's direction, which is \noftentimes on the road to destruction--put them on the right path, help \nget them off drugs by drug testing, place them back into school, get \nmental health treatment if that is called for, and obtain the family \ncounseling that is so often necessary.\n  According to a New York Times front page article on juvenile justice, \nthe Chicago court system spends 5 minutes per case. How can a judge \nwork with that kind of caseload and workload? How can a judge work with \ninsufficient probation officers, insufficient detention space for the \nserious offender, insufficient halfway houses, or with boot camps for \nthose who deserve it? How can they effectively turn the tide? They \ncannot. And that is what is wrong. But I have a sense that all over \nAmerica cities and counties are coming together, demanding that we do \nsomething about juvenile crime.\n  We have spent a tremendous amount of money on adult crime. We have \ntripled and quadrupled our bed spaces in adult prisons. We have spent \nvery little on juvenile crime, when that has been the No. 1 crime \ngrowth area in the country. This bill will encourage more spending to \ncorrect that situation. For the first time, it will set up a \nrecordkeeping system that would maintain the secrecy of juvenile \nrecords from the general public but would make these records available \nto law enforcement officers. Right now they are not, amazing as it \nsounds. To get records on a child, law enforcement officers have to go \nout to each and every juvenile facility in the country. They cannot get \nthem from a national crime information center.\n  Drug testing is a critical event in effectively diagnosing a young \nperson's problems. What we require is that youngsters who are arrested \nfor crimes be drug tested upon their arrest. We fund that testing by \ngiving the States money. Then the judge can know\n\n[[Page S9929]]\n\nwhether this child's criminality is being driven by a drug problem or \nnot. And if it is, they can require drug treatment.\n  It is an absolute tragedy that we are not able to pass this bill \ntoday. Judge Eric Holder, Washington, DC, who wants drug testing of \neveryone, said it is absolutely essential for a judge to know whether \nthe kids and adults coming before the court have a drug problem.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a professionally crafted bill. It \nremains, in my opinion, an effective, solid, progressive step of \nhistoric proportions to assist our State and local communities to \neffectively deal with the growing problem of juvenile crime in America. \nBased on my experience of over 15 years, I know that passing this \nlegislation is the right thing to do. We must continue to work to get a \nvote on this bill. I will continue to listen to any suggestions for \nchange. Senator Hatch has continued to keep the doors open for \ndiscussion so that we can proceed with this bill.\n  Frankly, I believe something is happening here, and I am just going \nto say it. The bankruptcy bill came out of the Judiciary Committee 16 \nto 2. It is an absolutely excellent bankruptcy bill. It is not radical \nin any way and has tremendous bipartisan support, however, we come down \nhere today and the Democratic minority members oppose even bringing it \nup for consideration. The juvenile justice bill comes out of committee \nwith a 2 to 1 vote and the minority objects, a filibuster, and refuses \nto agree to a rational compromise on debate.\n  It appears to me that the members of the other party are obstructing \nlegislation. For some reason, they do not want good legislation to \npass. We ought to be working on these bills. If there is a legitimate \ndifficulty, let's deal with it. I am willing to do so. But it is time \nfor us to pass good legislation. I don't think it is right for people \nto go around talking about a do-nothing Congress when we produce good \nlegislation, bring it to the floor, only to have the minority object \nunder the rules of this body. The rules are legitimately utilized, but \nthe other side ought to be held accountable for obstructing good \nlegislation.\n  So, again, I am disappointed that we could not get this agreement. I \nbelieve that we have an outstanding juvenile justice bill and I have \nbeen honored to work with Senator Hatch and others on the committee to \nproduce it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The distinguished Senator from \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9927-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9929-S9934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to report on a recent trip \nwhich I made in my role as a senior member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to a very troubled region of the world. During this trip, I \ntook quick but informative visits through Bosnia, Belgrade, Yugoslavia, \nMacedonia, Kosovo, and NATO South Headquarters, in Naples.\n  To make this trip possible, I asked for and received the full support \nof the Department of State and NATO. I particularly wish to express my \nappreciation to Admiral Lopes, Ambassador Miles, posted to Belgrade, \nand Ambassador Hill, posted to Macedonia.\n  In my view there are parallels and distinctions between the situation \nin Bosnia and the situation in Kosovo. Kosovo is an integral part of a \nsovereign nation--Yugoslavia. It is a civil war between the ethnic \nfunction of Albanians and Serbs.\n  The parallels are to be found in the tragic tactics of this war. \nWhile both factions are open for condemnation for human rights \nviolations, the preponderance of evidence weighs against the Serb \nforces--regular army and ``so-called'' police. Clearly, President \nMilosevic must be held accountable for the continuing destruction of \ndwellings, the farm land, and most of all, the continuing cruel \nrepression against innocent people driven from their homes and land by \nthe combined Serb forces.\n  Currently, there are estimates in the hundreds of thousands of \nrefugees fleeing--many to the hills and forests near their villages. In \na short time, with the coming of winter, the weather will compound \ntheir misery and sufferings.\n  Diplomatic efforts by U.S. and other nations have made a credible, \ngood faith effort to reach some measure of resolution. As I departed \nKosovo on Monday, August 31, the very able Ambassadors Miles and Hill \nassured me they were continuing to press for some solution so that the \nU.S. and other nations and ``NGO's'' can put in place programs and \nlogistic plans to bring relief to victims of both ethnic factions.\n  In my view, the short time between now and winter, will not permit a \nsolution that will embrace a form of limited government acceptable to \nBelgrade. That must come in time, but for the present, we must get a \nframework solution for the refugee relief program.\n  I commend the efforts of Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft, \nwho, during her visit just days ago, sounded a fervent appeal. I attach \na copy of her analysis.\n  I also visited some of the towns ravaged by the war and continuing to \nbe ravaged by the roaming Serb forces. This must be stopped. Today I \nlearned that Senator Dole, who, like me is greatly concerned for the \nneed to stop this conflict, is going to visit on his own initiative, \nKosovo and the region. I briefed him on my trip and recommended he work \nwith the consortium of nations, including the U.S., Canada, Russia and \nE.U. nations known as ``KDOM''.\n  I have great praise for the U.S. personnel of KDOM who provided me \nwith a trip through some of the war torn regions. I place in this \nrecord a briefing given me by KDOM, together with their credible \npetition for more assistance--logistic--from the Departments of State \nand Defense. I personally will endorse their needs.\n  While in NATO South Heights, I received a briefing on options \ninvolving military forces--U.S. and other nations. This weekend I will \nreceive further briefings.\n  I close by urging all Senators to devote time to the growing problems \nin the Kosovo region. I support the doctrine--time tested--that \ndiplomacy can be no stronger than the resolve to back it up by force if \nnecessary. I urge all Senators to carefully stand by the complexity of \nthe problems--many unique and different than Bosnia--with the use of \nforce.\n  Hopefully, negotiations will produce a cease-fire and force can be \navoided. A problem still exists as to who are the KLA leaders, are they \nin some agreement among themselves, and how would they be represented \nat the negotiating table.\n  I will continue to give this troubled area a high priority and urge \nothers to do likewise. I ask unanimous consent that the documents I \nreferred to during my remarks be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I understand the Government Printing Office estimates \nthe cost of printing this material in the Record to be $1,949.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the USIA Washington File, Aug. 26, 1998]\n\n              Assistant Secretary of State Taft in Kosovo\n\n       Washington.--Julia V.

Welcome to the noon briefing. (Laughter.)\n       My watch stopped about two hours and 20 minutes ago. I beg \n     your indulgence.\n       I have a few announcements to make before I get to your \n     questions. First, a senior State Department official is \n     visiting Serbia Montenegro, including the province of Kosovo, \n     to assess the situation of internally displaced persons and \n     refugees in the region, and to encourage the return of \n     Kosovar internally displaced persons to their homes. I'm \n     talking about Julia Taft, who, as you know, is the Assistant \n     Secretary of State for Population, Refugees and Migration. \n     She will meet with government officials in the region and \n     representatives of major international organizations and non-\n     governmental organizations during her visit, which will last \n     from today until Saturday.\n       The bureau that she heads has primary responsibility for US \n     refugee assistance programs. Her visit will underscore US \n     concern and commitment to provide assistance for conflict \n     victims in Kosovo and the region. The US Government has \n     provided more than $11 million in the last few months through \n     AID and the PRN bureau to meet humanitarian needs caused by \n     the conflict in Kosovo. As a result of the ongoing conflict \n     there, we estimate there are some 250,000 internally \n     displaced persons in Kosovo, another 26,000 in Montenegro and \n     14,000 refugees in Albania. It is estimated that between \n     60,000 and 100,000 of those displaced within Kosovo are \n     without shelter--a situation that becomes increasingly grave \n     as winter approaches.\n       Assistant Secretary Taft will urge Serb officials to make \n     concrete progress on creating conditions for the return of \n     internally displaced persons, particularly those who are \n     shelterless and inaccessible to the delivery of humanitarian \n     aid. She will also meet with relief agency representatives to \n     encourage their increased presence in key areas of return, \n     which we think is very important.\n       Julia Taft's visit to the region will be one in a series in \n     coming weeks by senior United States Government officials as \n     the US acts to help meet humanitarian needs in the region.\n       The second announcement has to do with----\n       Question. (Inaudible)--where she's been, and I didn't quite \n     grab it. You mentioned the stops she made or is making, did \n     you?\n       Mr. Foley. In the region. I believe that she is in Belgrade \n     and going to Pristina today.\n       Question. (Inaudible)--to the architect of this whole \n     business?\n       Mr. Foley. Yes, yes--well, I don't believe she is meeting \n     with President Milosevic. Ambassador Hill met with President \n     Milosevic yesterday. I did not have an opportunity to talk to \n     him; he called and we didn't connect earlier this morning. \n     But the high agenda item yesterday in Belgrade for him with \n     Milosevic was, indeed, this issue of allowing humanitarian \n     access. I can get to that if we come to this question a \n     little later in the briefing.\n       Question. Well, this is short, but far from allowing \n     humanitarian access, it appears that the Serbs are now \n     targeting aid workers. They blew up a convey carrying three \n     Mother Theresa workers. How does she expect to reverse this \n     trend?\n       Mr. Foley. Well let's get into the topic, then. I have a \n     few other announcements to make. Barry, you're the dean; what \n     do you want to do?\n       Question. Let's just go--(Inaudible).\n       Mr. Foley. Okay. You're absolutely right that international \n     organizations and non-governmental organizations continue to \n     report serious access problems throughout Kosovo. A UNHCRCRS \n     convoy was unable to deliver humanitarian supplies to the \n     region south of Pec yesterday.\n       As I said, Julia Taft is in Belgrade and Pristina today, \n     where she is meeting with humanitarian organizations. That's \n     in answer to your specific question, Barry.\n       The assessment team from the US Office of Foreign Disaster \n     Assistance had planned to arrive in Kosovo this week, but is \n     yet to receive its visas from the FRY. Clearly, in answer to \n     your question, Jim, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is not \n     fulfilling its previous commitments to the international \n     community of unrestricted access to Kosovo and to internally \n     displaced persons by humanitarian organizations and \n     diplomatic observers.\n       The Kosovo diplomatic observer missions have confirmed \n     reports that three humanitarian aide workers were killed \n     between Malisevo and Kijevo yesterday. The three victims are \n     Kosovar Albanians who were working for the Mother Theresa \n     Society, a local NGO that distributes aid directly to \n     internally displaced persons. The evidence indicates that the \n     workers' vehicle was deliberately targeted by a Serbian \n     armored vehicle less than one kilometer away in broad \n     daylight. The targeting of civilians is, indeed, a cowardly \n     act. We deplore deliberate attempts to disrupt humanitarian \n     relief work, which shows indeed the emptiness of Mr. \n     Milosevic's promises.\n       We call on Serb authorities to halt immediately their \n     offensive. All NGOs--both local as well as international--\n     must be allowed to deliver humanitarian assistance to \n     internally displaced persons, free from fear and obstruction.\n       Can I move on to my other announcements?\n       Question. Can I just--who did you say has not received \n     visas?\n       Mr. Foley. This is the Office of Foreign Disaster \n     Assistance. They have been held up. But I understand that \n     Assistant Secretary Taft had some difficulty in getting her \n     visa also, which eventually came through. We certainly expect \n     that will be the case for the OFDA personnel.\n       A couple other announcements. The United States regrets the \n     incidents of August 26, 1998, that's today, in Northern \n     Israel and Southern Lebanon--especially in view of the \n     casualties which have occurred on all sides. We have been in \n     contact with both the government of Israel and the government \n     of Lebanon, and are urging restraint.\n       The April 1996 understanding, which established the Israel-\n     Lebanon Monitoring Group, provides a process for resolving \n     complaints. We call upon all the parties to use this process. \n     The Monitoring Group should meet as soon as possible to \n     consider these latest incidents.\n       Lastly, the United States welcomes the August 25 \n     announcement by the chairman of the Independent National \n     Electoral Commission of Nigeria, presenting the time table \n     for the forthcoming elections designed to return Nigeria to \n     civilian democratic rule. I won't go into the particulars, \n     because the announcement you'll see we'll post lays out the \n     different elections at all levels of government to be held \n     late this year and early next year.\n       The announcement fulfills head of state, General Abubakar's \n     public pledge to schedule the election of a civilian \n     president in the first quarter of 1999. It is also consistent \n     with his statement that the new elected president would be \n     sworn into office on May 29, 1999. We are committed to \n     working with Nigeria to ensure continued progress toward a \n     rapid, transparent and inclusive transition to civilian \n     democratic rule.\n       Question by Barry Schweid.

Thank you very much for your \n     patience. I have been delayed because of some very important \n     meetings with government officials today to discuss the \n     tragedy that is unfolding in Kosovo. I have just returned \n     from a visit, although short, to Kosovo. It was one of the \n     most heart-wrenching experiences I have had in 25 years of \n     working in humanitarian relief. We have a catastrophe \n     looming, and we only have as a world humanitarian community \n     six weeks to help the government of Serbia respond to this \n     crisis. The snows come early, I understand, to this part of \n     the world. With the snow may come the death of more than \n     200,000 people who have been displaced from their home \n     because of the conflict in Kosovo.\n       My mission here has been to meet with government officials, \n     with the international organizations, with the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] representatives, the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross and many non-\n     governmental organizations who are providing relief at this \n     moment to many villages and towns in Kosovo. I believe \n     that we have to work together, to support the efforts of \n     this government, to support the efforts of the relief \n     community, to find the way to deal with this emergency. \n     Yesterday in Pristina I announced that the United States \n     had already invested $11 million in providing relief over \n     the past few months. This compares to about $10 million \n     that we have provided for Serbian refugees in this area. \n     About $11 million was focused mostly on the humanitarian \n     crisis up to now. I have asked my office in the State \n     Department to prepare a request to the President of the \n     United States to allow us immediately to invest many \n     millions of more dollars within the next few weeks to try \n     to avert this disaster. We're here to share with you our \n     impressions, our concern, and our commitment that Kosovo \n     and the people of Kosovo will not have to face the \n     consequences of death when the snows arrive.\n       I would be very pleased to answer any questions that you \n     might have. Let us begin with the first question:\n       Q. You were speaking about the humanitarian side. Were you \n     involved in any way in the political issues that have, after \n     all, created the humanitarian catastrophe that you are \n     talking about?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. Well, I am involved in those \n     because they, of course, are driving the crisis that we have \n     now. However, Ambassador Chris Hill is the one that is \n     leading the negotiation team working with Dr. Rugova and \n     working with the authorities here on a peace process. I don't \n     know how quickly that process will come to a positive \n     conclusion. I hope it is soon, but I don't know if it will be \n     as fast as when the snows come. So we have to deal with this \n     humanitarian crisis right now, because its outcome will also \n     affect the political outcome.\n       Q. Have you talked to the representatives of the Albanian \n     people about these humanitarian issues and how much they \n     could affect their forces in the field, the so-called Kosovo \n     Liberation Army, to allow access for the humanitarian \n     organizations, because recently Ms. Emma Bonino couldn't even \n     reach the place she intended because of this situation in the \n     field?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. I had access to every place I \n     wanted to go. I went with the KDOM forces, and I went from \n     Pristina to Pec, to Decani, and to Junik, and saw many \n     villages along the road and met with some of the displaced \n     persons who were camping out in some of the destroyed \n     villages. It was a very moving experience. I then had a \n     chance to speak with Dr. Rugova to ask for a clarification on \n     a statement he allegedly made, which said that the Albanian \n     people should not come down from the mountains, that they \n     should stay up there because it was not safe to come down. He \n     denied having expressed in that way. I assured him that every \n     effort was going to be made to build the confidence so that \n     people come down from the mountains, and I hope that he would \n     change or clarify his position. While I was there, the \n     authorities in Pristina unveiled their new concept for \n     targeted assistance to 11 points within Kosovo. They \n     indicated that the government was prepared to provide \n     building materials, food, water and electricity, and they \n     encouraged and hoped that the international community, the \n     NGOs, would also have the ability to go into those same \n     locations as part of the confidence-building effort. Planning \n     for those centers is going on now. These are not safe havens, \n     but they are going to be places where there will be \n     opportunities for people to come down from the mountains.\n       I spoke today with the authorities in Belgrade and said \n     that we would be prepared to fund operational expenses over \n     the next six months, but it was absolutely critical that the \n     government considered this an emergency--to wave restrictions \n     that have existed in the past for getting relief workers in, \n     getting commodities delivered, and providing for reduced \n     military presence, particularly in those 11 areas. I believe \n     we've made a lot of progress in our discussions, and I'm \n     hoping that this new initiative starts with the 11 locations \n     and will expand and multiply in the weeks ahead.\n       Q. What kind of assurances did you get from the Serbian \n     government that people could go back to their homes? What \n     kind of security measures would make the people feel safe so \n     that they could go back?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. The assurances have been made \n     public by the authorities through leaflets, through the \n     notification and announcement of these locations. They are \n     not yet safe, because there is not the kind of presence that \n     needs to be there. I am hoping that quick planning will \n     result in some real movement back to towns soon. You know, \n     there is something called safety in numbers. Where there is \n     the presence of Western relief workers, where there is the \n     presence of the United Nations, where there is the presence \n     of KDOM observers, I think, that will add to a sense of \n     credible safety. But, quite frankly, let me say I think that \n     the entire area of Kosovo is under serious strain, \n     economically and psychologically, right now. It is not just \n     assistance dedicated to those people who are on the \n     mountains, cold and hungry and some dying, but it's also for \n     the other people in Kosovo that have to have assistance, too. \n     There are many Serb families and other ethnic groups that \n     have to be assisted by the relief community. We are going to \n     try to make sure that there is equity for everybody.\n       Q. When you say that you had talked with the \n     representatives of the so-called KLA, did you, as a \n     humanitarian worker, remember to ask them what has happened \n     to the at least 115 abducted and missing citizens of Kosovo-\n     Metohia?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. I did not speak with KLA \n     representatives, I spoke with Dr. Rugova. We did express \n     grave concern about the missing Serbs. I think there are \n     about 176 that are missing. This is a great concern. On the \n     other hand, there have also been many missing and killed \n     Albanians, too. I think this underscores that no one has been \n     left untouched by the tragedy that has happened, and that \n     makes it even more compelling that we stop the war, stop the \n     killing, and try to provide a humanitarian alternative. It is \n     not responsibility of the international community, however, \n     to stop it. It is the responsibility of the people within \n     Kosovo and Serbia to try to find conditions for confidence-\n     building and assistance. We stand ready to try to support \n     financially, and through whatever technical assistance we \n     can, to mobilize the planning and deployment of external \n     resources that can help bridge the requirements that exist \n     right now.\n       Q. Ms. Taft, how would you estimate the level of the \n     humanitarian catastrophe?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. On the scale of one to ten? I'd \n     say about nine. It is a crisis now, where some lives have \n     been lost, but we still have time to work together to save \n     about 200,000 lives. It's not too late.\n       Any other questions? Yes, San Francisco Chronicle.\n       Q. Yes, my question is: Do you think that it is realistic \n     that you can employ the kind of measures that you would like \n     to, humanitarian measures, without a cease-fire?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. A cease-fire would be our hope. \n     In the absence of a cease-fire, we have identified, however, \n     a number of things that need to go forward. We believe the \n     KDOM needs to be expanded. I will be asking my own government \n     to try to make additional contributions, and work with other \n     donor countries to expand the presence of KDOM. We have to \n     get more experienced relief workers into Kosovo working with \n     the international relief community. There is a proposal we \n     offered to try to accelerate the approval, on an emergency \n     basis, of those visas. There is a problem of communications. \n     You know, it's very difficult to have a far-flung relief \n     assistance program if the people in the field cannot \n     communicate with their base offices.\n       And we believe it's a security and a protection issue. \n     Radios are very difficult to manage in Kosovo, so we have \n     raised this question, and it needs to be resolved. There also \n     is the local economy, which has collapsed. There's very \n     little in the stores. There are some stores in the major \n     cities that are functioning, and some markets that are \n     functioning. But, basically, there is in effect an embargo on \n     commercial availability of some of the most important life-\n     sustaining requirements. And we have asked, on an emergency \n     basis, that the informal ``blockade'' be lifted for such \n     things as wheat flour, sugar, oil, milk, and detergent, which \n     did not sound life-threatening to me, but everybody needs it. \n     Those are the elements that we are going to ask to try to get \n     the government to lift this informal blockade on the \n     commercial sector. We've got to get food to people, and these \n     commodities to people in the cities and the villages down \n     there. Those are elements of what we are considering, what we \n     have offered the government to consider. We are not managing \n     this disaster. We are only trying to help those who are \n     responsible for making sure the security of people in Kosovo \n     exists, and that their livelihood and lives are sustained. I \n     had assurances at all levels today that, in fact, the \n     government here is desirous of living up to the agreement \n     that was made between Yeltsin and Milosevic two months ago, \n     which had a number of elements in it that are not really \n     operational now. Although KDOM was part of it. This Kosovo \n     Diplomatic Observer Mission was part of it. There were other \n     requirements that were in that communique, in that agreement \n     which related to unfettered access by humanitarian workers, \n     and that's what we have been particularly focusing on. It is \n     important to know that our President, the President of the \n     United States, will be meeting with [President Boris] Yeltsin \n     in the next few days, and we are going to be raising this \n     issue with the Russian authorities, too, because they have \n     been a very effective interlocutor with the authorities here.\n       Q. Were you informed by the Serbian authorities they have \n     for the past several\n\n[[Page S9932]]\n\n     months been offering a dialogue to the Albanian party, that \n     Mr. Hill has had a very hard job of convincing the Albanian \n     party to negotiate, that the new negotiating team was formed \n     thanks to the representatives of the European Union, but \n     there is no dialogue yet? In the meantime Mr. Adern Dernaci, \n     UCK representative, announces a guerrilla war. How do you \n     think there can be any improvement of the humanitarian \n     situation in Kosovo?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. That is a very troublesome but \n     appropriate question. I don't know the answer. All I can say \n     is that, from previous experiences, where there has been a \n     threat of guerrilla action, that guerrilla action takes its \n     root from the people who are displaced who have no hope, who \n     have no food, and are discontent. I think that what we need \n     to do is reinforce a better alternative for people by having \n     these areas, and appropriate distribution and shelter, so \n     that they are not victims. This is a very important feature, \n     of course, of Ambassador Chris Hill's initiative. He feels \n     that there has been some progress. I was with him yesterday, \n     but as I say, the political and humanitarian time frames may \n     be different. I do think that if we are able to find ways to \n     accelerate the flow and effectiveness of relief, so that \n     people's lives are not so tortured--I mean, these people that \n     I met with and saw, they are not political, they are \n     peasants, they are people who just want their families with \n     them, they have so many needs, they've been dispossessed and \n     moved to often--that's what they want, they don't care what \n     the politicians want. We need to be part of an international \n     effort that provides them a different alternative and some \n     hope back to their villages.\n       I hope you will all follow this story. For those of you who \n     can get down and see what is happening, you will understand \n     how appalling and how heart-wrenching it is for all the \n     people down there. Six weeks is not a long time. It will be a \n     real test of whether or not there is a viable future for the \n     people of Kosovo.\n       Q. You said that the international community is not \n     responsible for bringing the war in Kosovo to an end. So what \n     about NATO air strikes? Would you suggest to your own \n     government that they shouldn't take place?\n       Assistant Secretary Taft. I will not be making \n     recommendations about the NATO air strikes. My portfolio is \n     humanitarian. I do not think we need any more killing, any \n     more destruction, or any more bloodshed. We have got to focus \n     right now on the next six weeks, if people are still in this \n     hills, and still dying, I think that will be the point of \n     decision-making internationally about what else should be \n     done. I pray we don't get there. There seems to be energy, \n     interest and a commitment to try to avoid that catastrophe, \n     and that's what I am praying for.\n       Thank you very much.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      [From the United States Information Service, Aug. 28, 1998]\n\n Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration \n       Julia V. Taft's, Press Conference in Pristina, Yugoslavia\n\n       Secretary Taft. As you all know, I just returned from a \n     six-hour field trip today to Junik and Decani, and visited a \n     number of empty villages along the way, and was able to see \n     first hand the level of devastation that has been occurring \n     during this conflict. It would be an understatement for me to \n     say that I am just concerned. I am really appalled by the \n     devastation and overwhelmed by the need for urgent \n     humanitarian assistance. As you know, a number of United \n     Nations agencies and non-governmental agencies have been \n     working very hard to meet some of the needs that the \n     internally displaced persons, the refugees and the local \n     families are facing in Kosovo. One of the things that was \n     particularly positive about my trip was seeing so many \n     families who had welcomed internally displaced people into \n     their homes--people they didn't know, and people with whom \n     they were willing to share whatever food and shelter they \n     have.\n       In the end, of course we know that the suffering will only \n     stop when the conflict stops. I hope that would be true soon, \n     certainly within the next few months. But therefore then, I \n     am very much afraid there is a looming catastrophe within the \n     next six weeks, because of the weather and the cold that will \n     come. So, my energy is here, and the focus of the \n     humanitarian investments we are planning to make over the \n     next few days and week, or so, will be focused on how to help \n     accelerate and underscore a massive, innovative program for \n     humanitarian assistance. It will require all of the energy \n     and creativity of the NGOs. It will require the cooperation \n     of the government officials. It will require generosity on \n     the part of the donors, and it will be very important that \n     those elements of the conflict put down their arms.\n       Six weeks is almost here, and I hope very much to see in \n     six weeks that we have been able to have enough confidence on \n     the ground, and security on the ground, so that these people \n     will be able to come home.\n       In the last very few months, the United States has given \n     more than 11 million dollars to support the humanitarian \n     requirements in Kosovo. I am going back to the States over \n     the weekend, and I have already indicated today to my office \n     to prepare a request for President Clinton to offer \n     additional millions of dollars.\n       I am looking here over the next few days on how this money \n     can best be spent, but it will be significant, and it will be \n     able to, I think, help quite a lot.\n       As you know, we are participating in the Kosovo Diplomatic \n     Observer Mission. I'm going to try to urge even fuller \n     participation by our government in that, it's an excellent \n     innovation, and we appreciate the willingness of the \n     government officials to allow this observer mission as much \n     access as it does have.\n       Today, when I was meeting with the government officials, I \n     was told that they had come up with a new idea to open up a \n     special focus on eleven locations here for coordinated \n     humanitarian response. We welcome this initiative. We will \n     look forward to seeing how they are able to fulfill it.\n       We also met with the non-governmental organizations to \n     encourage their participation in a focused coordinated \n     manner, which we hope will help.\n       Eleven cities is not enough. The whole country needs help. \n     And we are going to try to do whatever we can to work with \n     the people of this wonderful area, and to work with all of \n     the relief agencies, so that we will be able to avoid a \n     catastrophe that is looming in front of us.\n       Thank you very much, and I'll be glad to answer your \n     questions.\n       Question. How do you mean to help the population of Kosovo \n     in these circumstances when we see that everyday Serbia is \n     burning and destroying every village, every town, and every \n     place in Kosovo?\n       Secretary Taft. It is true, I saw even today several \n     different buildings burning--fresh fires in places that were \n     already destroyed.\n       My sense is that we have to deal with it on many different \n     levels. There's the diplomatic level, and our ambassador, \n     Chris Hill, is working very closely on that. He also met with \n     Dr. Rugova today to try to move the process along, and he met \n     yesterday with Mr. Milosevic. The Contact Group meets every \n     week and is working very hard on the diplomatic side. I think \n     what we would welcome is a standing-down over the next six \n     weeks of any aggressive action on the part of any group in \n     this area. We have got to be able to help the citizens of \n     Kosovo, and we've got to make sure that the government here \n     is responsible for security. We also have to make sure to the \n     extent possible that there is safe distribution of relief \n     supplies by relief workers, and that means no guns and no \n     fire.\n       Question. Do you have any word of the reports that the \n     Serbs actually opened fire on a family of eleven people \n     killing them in the back of a tractor today in the city of \n     Gracka?\n       Secretary Taft. Oh, God, no I don't. We did, of course, \n     raise the issue of the deaths of the three Mother Theresa \n     relief workers with great sorrow that they were victims of \n     this conflict when their whole lives had been dedicated to \n     volunteering to help people. We expressed our condolences not \n     only to the president of the Mother Theresa Society, but I \n     raised it today with the authorities to find out what they \n     are going to do to find out who actually committed the \n     killings. I must say I was very reassured by both the regret \n     and the apology by the authorities that these people had been \n     killed, and there is gong to be an inspection. It is also \n     true that the NGOs were invited in to the government to \n     discuss not only this plan for the new eleven locations, but \n     also they expressed great regret and apology to the NGOs.\n       Question. Mr. Milosevic has said from time to time that \n     there have been irresponsible units that have destroyed \n     villages (inaudible). Shouldn't somebody be pushing him to \n     prosecute these people or actually (inaudible) them the way \n     that so-called irresponsible units would be in any normal \n     army?\n       Secretary Taft. Absolutely. It's my understanding that the \n     last incident in which there was an identified errant unit \n     that had attacked maliciously, that that unit was removed and \n     was replaced. Whether there is a broader observer mission \n     that can do this reporting and accounting, I think really we \n     have to build on the existence of KDOM and get more people \n     out there. On the issue of the willingness of the government \n     to rein in their army, my position is get the army out of \n     here and you'll have less of a problem. This all needs to be \n     negotiated in terms of this concept of unfettered access \n     which the NGOs are supposed to have--well, it's fettered and \n     we need to work on some agreements about the level of \n     security and this will be a high priority.\n       Question. Should the six weeks you've been mentioning be \n     considered as a deadline for Milosevic to stop all his \n     hostilities?\n       Secretary Taft. There are hostilities on all sides and all \n     must be stopped. The message I would like to send is that the \n     world is watching what's happening in Kosovo and we need to \n     make sure that the people who purport to lead the citizens of \n     Kosovo, whatever their background, they need to make sure \n     that there is access and there is no fighting so that people \n     can be having some degree of assurance that they can come \n     down from the mountains. Six weeks? I don't know. This is the \n     first time I've ever been to Kosovo. It's already getting a \n     little cold at night, but I do believe that, from the people \n     with whom I have discussed, six weeks is a time frame that--\n     if we can meet--will certainly alleviate much of the \n     suffering.\n       Question. Six weeks for politicians is a short time, but \n     six weeks for civilians who are in the mountains--and exactly \n     for children--is a very long time. We have there children who \n     are dying even from cold\n\n[[Page S9933]]\n\n     weather, so, if this six weeks will take so many children's \n     lives, what after?\n       Secretary Taft. My sense is that if there is enough \n     presence of relief workers, if there is enough presence of \n     the KDOM, and if there is an agreement to live up to access, \n     that the people can come down, and they will be able to be \n     assisted. We have talked a lot over the last couple of days \n     about, even if there were access, is there enough food in the \n     pipeline? And are there enough relief workers and local \n     people who can help in the distribution? And we've identified \n     a few things that we can push. But one of them doesn't even \n     relate to relief, it relates to what I understand is an \n     informal embargo or an informal blockade of a number of \n     commodities that ought to be in the stores of Kosovo. And \n     I've driven by and looked for something to buy, and there's \n     nothing to buy. So we know that there are restrictions or \n     there is in essence a variety of very important commodities \n     that the people here would like to buy that they find \n     difficult to obtain. We are going to present a list of those \n     that we consider absolutely urgent and would hope that the \n     normal market could be energized in this time frame, too, \n     because that would certainly help quite a lot, \n     particularly the families who have been so generous in \n     opening up their homes. We try to do relief assistance for \n     them, but we don't have enough in the pipeline for two \n     million people. So we have to deal with the local economy.\n       Question. How are you going to deal with the obstacles \n     usually coming from the Serbian authorities toward relief \n     organizations?\n       Secretary Taft. I've received a number of suggestions of \n     things that would be greatly helpful. One is a more \n     forthcoming role on the part of the United Nations High \n     Commissioner to help in registering agencies that have relief \n     workers. To try to get radio frequencies is a big problem. \n     Trying to deal with the visa problem. Even the USAID team is \n     waiting for its visas. So visas are not just a problem for \n     relief workers, they're also a problem for diplomats. We need \n     to find a way to streamline that and to give assurances to \n     the authorities that the people who are coming in actually \n     have training, have functions, have a job to do. We're going \n     to take this up tomorrow, and I think the highest issues that \n     I've been asked to convey mostly deal with radio and \n     communications, access, and visas. And we'll try to deal with \n     that.\n       Question. Just to speak about one issue that you've \n     raised--this informal embargo. Why should people be \n     optimistic that any one of the long laundry list of actions \n     that need to be taken, and which you are helping to identify, \n     will actually be acted upon? This embargo has been going on \n     for months. If the international community, not to mention \n     the United States, were serious about doing something about \n     it, they could have been and it seems to me, some might argue \n     should have been, banging on the doors in Belgrade for months \n     about this. It's a bit late to suddenly start talking about \n     an informal embargo when officials have known about it for \n     months.\n       Secretary Taft. From my office and my perspective, I am \n     responsible for refugee programs on a humanitarian basis for \n     the State Department, and we have been working very closely \n     obviously with the authorities and everybody on the Serb \n     refugee question. The IDPs are people in refugee-like \n     situations, and with the events of the last few months, it \n     was determined that I have got to get my resources and my \n     office much more heavily engaged, which I am doing. It is \n     also a fact that the Secretary-General has indicated that \n     Sadako Ogata, who is the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, \n     is, in fact, the lead agency. We are the primary funders \n     worldwide for UNHCR, so I have a client there and a \n     relationship where we can move very quickly. So, you will see \n     not only me, but you saw Emma Bonino last week, Soren Jessen-\n     Peterson. There will be a series of other people coming out. \n     All of us have different aspects in our portfolios and we are \n     going to be working very energetically to deal with this. The \n     food embargo, I think, is one that has been raised \n     diplomatically a number of times. Right now, I have put it on \n     the urgent list because of the time frame and the fact that \n     we are not going to be able to come up with enough relief \n     commodities. We've got to make sure that the normal economy \n     is working, and that there is access by the commercial \n     vendors and others. Now not all the laundry list of items is \n     realistic to try to change overnight, but if we're working on \n     this on an emergency basis to say, ``At a minimum, you've got \n     to have oil, sugar, wheat flour, a lot of people have said \n     detergent--I'm interested in that--and salt.'' Those are the \n     ones. I know the list is much longer, but we will push that, \n     and if you have other suggestions, I'd be delighted to hear \n     them.\n       Question. Each day the war is spreading to new parts of \n     Kosovo. On the other side the politicians are seeking a \n     political solution. Do you think there is still time to solve \n     the problem by dialogue?\n       Secretary Taft. The problem will only be solved when \n     there's a peace agreement and there is real cease-fire. I \n     have to be optimistic. We don't have a choice. We've got \n     176,000, maybe more, people who are in urgent need of help, \n     and it's up to all of us to figure out how to do it. So I \n     have to be optimistic that the good will of the people here, \n     and the government, and the NGOs will work. Now I may not \n     come back in six weeks if it's not a success, but I think \n     it's being able to identify and pinpoint exactly what \n     requirements you have that have to be met, and set up a user-\n     friendly system by all of the relief agencies to be able to \n     interface with the government. The government was very \n     responsive today and I think we need to continue to work with \n     the authorities to make sure that we are all working \n     together.\n       Question. You've spoken about this special focus on eleven \n     areas that the government has identified. Is that to suggest \n     that the government is going to provide security for \n     something resembling safe areas that they will guarantee will \n     be safe?\n       Secretary Taft. What this is going to be, as I understand \n     it, and I think it's still in its formulative stage, is that \n     they have picked eleven locations (We can make the list \n     available; I don't have in front of me right now) where they \n     will provide electricity, water, building materials, and food \n     assistance. What I have asked the non-governmental \n     organizations if they would be willing to do is right away \n     figure out where those areas are where there are areas where \n     they can operate in as well, and sit down and figure out what \n     is going to be available, so that when assistance is there, \n     it's used effectively, right away. One of the things that \n     surprised me on this trip today was to go and see two \n     different locations where the government had made available \n     building materials, but I didn't see anyone there to use them \n     for rebuilding, or any presence of organizations that could \n     be helpful. So we have an opportunity, I think, to match the \n     manpower and skills of the NGOs with the raw materials, at \n     least in those locations and to get moving. Eleven sites in \n     this immense place is not much, but it's a start, it's this \n     week. Let's go with it, and let's see how we can open up more \n     opportunities.\n       Thank you for your interest. I think the word really needs \n     to get out, not only here, but internationally. There has to \n     be more attention on this crisis, because it is here, and \n     there are opportunities for us not to have to admit to chaos \n     in about six weeks. So, I appreciate however you can cover \n     this story. It's important for the world to know the struggle \n     that's going on here. Thank you very much.\n                                  ____\n\n\nKosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission Command Briefing by Senator Warner, \n                            August 31, 1998\n\n\n                                purpose\n\n       Observe and report on the situation in Kosovo: Freedom of \n     movement/freedom of access; human rights issues and \n     humanitarian relief efforts; internally displaced persons/\n     refugees; and general security situation.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Milosevic offer of 8 March.\n       PC decision in April to establish KDOM.\n       London Contact Group meeting.\n       Milosevic/Yeltsin meeting.\n       First mission--6 July.\n       Headquarters security approved by DOS 31 July.\n\n\n                               operations\n\nPatrol planning................................................\\1\\ 1900\nPatrol/protection briefing.........................................0730\nVehicle preparation................................................0830\nDeparture..........................................................0900\nReturn.............................................................1500\nDebrief/team report................................................1900\nFinal report to Embassy............................................2300\n\n\\1\\ Day prior.\n\n                                                  DAILY RHYTHM\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Patrol day       Plan/Medevac day      I/analysis           Reports\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0730............................

This is not easy travel. This is \na commitment that is extraordinary but also extraordinarily important \nto us in terms of formulating our policy. I thank the Senator for his \nleadership in that effort.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I express my humble gratitude to my good \nfriend who has served these many years that we have been together on \nthe Armed Services Committee and, indeed, has made trips to remote \nparts of the world.

This is very important arms control/non-proliferation \nobjective.

Mr. President, we have failed.\n  For the past nine months, I have worked with the members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and the Administration to draft \nmuch needed reforms to our nation's hazardous waste program. These \nreforms would have made RCRA work more quickly and more cheaply. They \nwould have removed the bureaucratic obstacles that hinder environmental \ncleanups. They would have given the states the proper authority and \nfreedom they need to responsibly manage their RCRA sites.\n  My colleagues, the Senate has failed to save the federal government \n$2 Billion this year in clean up costs. Despite our best efforts, \nagreement could not be reached on a bill to save two billion dollars \nper year.\n  Early in this Congress, the General Accounting Office released a \nreport highlighting the need for a legislative change in remediation \nwaste policy. The Administration, states, stakeholders--even the EPA--\nagreed that only a legislative fix could adequately streamline the \nprogram and speed the pace of cleanups. This GAO report also said that \na legislative fix would save the federal government $2 billion each \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, the Congress and the administration were unable to \ncome to agreement on how to structure this legislative fix. Discussions \namong interested parties and legislators clearly showed the need for a \nbill, but translating this need into legislative language has been \ndifficult. Progress was made, but not enough.\n  And so, Mr. President, the next Congress is tasked with addressing \nthis two billion dollar environment opportunity. Although I am truly \ndisappointed that these many months of educating and negotiating have \nleft us without a bill to champion, I am hopeful that the Senate will \nreturn to this issue with renewed vigor next year.\n  I know that Senator Chafee, the Chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and Senator Smith, Chairman of the Superfund, \nWaste Control and Risk Assessment Subcommittee, share my commitment to \nseeing meaningful RCRA reform enacted in the next Congress and will \nmake it a priority. With this leadership, I believe that we can resolve \nthe outstanding issues quickly and move forward with legislation that \nwill indeed make the cleanup of contaminated sites smarter, faster and \nbetter. This is also true of those on the House Commerce Committee as \nwell as many in the Administration.\n  I was encouraged by the RCRA team built this year and look forward to \nworking with this team again next Congress.\n  I again want to stress that the RCRA reform goals have not changed. \nTo make RCRA work more cheaply and quickly, to streamline the \nbureaucratic process and give more authority to the states and to speed \nsite clean up. It is unfortunate that yet another year has passed \nwithout reform.\n  Mr. President, let's make sure Congress gets the job done next year. \nThe nation expects and deserves its RCRA sites to be cleaned up. This \nnation wants $2 billion in savings each year. I would like to thank my \ncolleagues and their staffs for the work done this session and look \nforward to redoubled efforts in the 106th Congress.\n\n\n         rcra reform will be a priority for the 106th Congress\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, for the past year, the Majority Leader, \nSenator Bob Smith, and I have been working with our colleagues on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and the Administration to draft \nlegislation to address some of the requirements of the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'') that currently impede the \ncleanup of literally thousands of contaminated sites across the nation. \nThis so-called ``RCRA rifle-shot'' would have been an important piece \nof legislation. It would have demonstrated once again that we can \nimprove our environmental laws, without jeopardizing human health or \nthe environment, and reduce unnecessary costs. Just last year, the \nGovernment Accounting Office reported that eliminating those \nimpediments to cleanup could save up to $2.1 billion per year\n\n[[Page S9935]]\n\nand, at the same time, significantly expedite environmentally \nresponsible cleanups.\n  It was our hope to craft a bipartisan bill that could be enacted this \nyear. Our goal was a shared one--to develop legislation to eliminate \noverly restrictive treatment standards for mediation waste, to \nstreamline permitting requirements, and preserve existing State cleanup \nprograms, all while still ensuring that human health and the \nenvironment are protected. Under Senator Lott's leadership, we worked \nhard to achieve that goal and I believe that we made significant \nprogress in resolving our differences. Unfortunately, we were not able \nto reach a final agreement and we have essentially run out of time.\n  I remain committed, however, to the goal of improving the remediation \nwaste program. I continue to believe that this is an important issue \nand that with appropriate legislation we can achieve a significant \nenvironment benefit--cleaning up thousands of contaminate sites and \nsaving billions of dollars. That is clearly a worthwhile goal. \nTherefore, I intend to make RCRA reform a priority for the Environment \nand Public Works Committee in the next Congress. Building on the \nprogress that we have made this year, and with Senator Lott's continued \nleadership, it is my hope that we will move legislation through the \nSenate early in the next Congress.\n\n\n                   rcra remediation waste legislation\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is with some regret \nthat I am here today to join my colleagues, Majority Leader Trent Lott \nand Environment Committee Chairman John Chafee, in announcing that we \nwill be unable to enact legislation this year to reform the remediation \nwaste provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.\n  As many of my colleagues know, since I became Chairman of the Senate \nSuperfund Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the RCRA, it had \nbecome apparent to me that hazardous waste cleanups in the United \nStates take too long, are too costly, and result in widespread areas of \nour country becoming brownfield wastelands.\n  Since I introduced RCRA remediation legislation in the 104th \nCongress, S. 1286, I have attempted to work with Senators Lott, Chafee, \nBreaux, Baucus, and Lautenberg, with the Clinton administration, \nStates, and members of the industrial and environmental communities to \nachieve a bipartisan fix to this confusing and burdensome law. Despite \nour best efforts and the dedicated work of our respective staff, we \nweren't able to come to agreement.\n  It is particularly troublesome that we come to this juncture given \nthe fact that just about a year ago we received a report from the GAO \n(Hazardous Waste--Remediation Waste Requirements Can Increase the Time \nand Cost of Cleanups) that demonstrated the urgency of fixing the \nremediation waste program. Although I have quoted that report \npreviously, I believe that it is worth repeating today.\n\n       Despite the fact that remediation waste ``does not pose a \n     significant threat to human health and the environment,'' the \n     RCRA requirements are so costly and time consuming that \n     ``parties often try to avoid triggering the requirements by \n     containing waste in place or by abandoning cleanups \n     entirely.''\n       The report further stated that RCRA ``can drive parties to \n     use less aggressive and perhaps less effective cleanup \n     methods, such as leaving contaminated soil in place and \n     placing a waterproof cover over it rather than treating it.'' \n     Instead of dealing with the problem, the statute forces \n     parties to ``purchase land elsewhere for their plant \n     expansion or other needs.''\n       Even the EPA, which is responsible for implementing the \n     statute is quoted in the report as stating: ``Although \n     cleaning up a site may offer economic benefits, such as \n     relief from liability for contamination and increased \n     property values, industry sometimes concludes that the costs \n     of complying with RCRA can outweigh the benefits.''\n\n  According to the GAO report we could save upwards of $2 billion per \nyear by making some common sense legislative fixes to RCRA--cost \nsavings that would really jump-start the efforts by industry to address \nthese languishing sites. Nonetheless, despite tireless efforts by \nmembers and staff, and notwithstanding good progress in translating \nthese changes into legislative language, it appears that we will not be \nable to accomplish our shared goal of passing a RCRA remediation waste \nrifle shot during the time we have left in the 105th Congress.\n  As I conclude my statement, I would like to join Senator Lott and \nSenator Chafee in pledging my desire to press forward on this issue \nwhen the Senate returns next year. Perhaps the additional time will \ngive the staff the additional opportunity to bridge the gaps that \ncurrently separate us.\n  Finally, in addition to thanking Senator Lott and Senator Chafee for \ntheir leadership on this issue, I would like to thank our staff, Jeff \nMerrifield, Lynne Stauss, Ann Klee Carl Biersack and Kristy Sims for \ntheir hard work on this issue. Similarly, I would like to recognize \nSenator Baucus and Lautenberg and their staff for their hard work on \nattempting to come to a consensus.\n  Again, I am disappointed that we were unable to make this happen this \nyear, but I am hopeful that we can make it happen in 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9934-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9935-S9937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UPDATE ON THE WIPO LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes to advise \nmy colleagues that H.R. 2281, a bill to implement the World \nIntellectual Property Organization copyright treaties, has been adopted \nby the House, but in a substantially different form than the Senate \nbill to implement these treaties. The House version of the bill \nincludes some improvements agreed to by representatives of the affected \nindustries, but it also includes some extraneous provisions, which in \nsome cases were negotiated without the full participation of important \naffected individuals. A number of my colleagues have expressed to my \noffice their continuing interest in this legislation, and so I thought \nit would be helpful to provide an update on the legislative \ndevelopments in the House, and to share with you some of my concerns \nabout the many extraneous provisions added to the bill.\n  On July 22, the Committee on Commerce filed its report on H.R. 2281, \nthe Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. In drafting the bill, the \nCommittee used as the base text the bill approved by the Senate, and \nthen made some substantive and clarifying changes. I understand that \nthe Commerce Committee version of the legislation represents an agreed \nupon compromise by the content community and the fair use community. \nMoreover, I understand that these groups have agreed to support the \nagreement throughout the remaining process. Some aspects of this \nagreement concern important issues that I worked to have addressed in \nthe Senate version of the bill. Let me describe a few of the most \nimportant aspects of the agreement.\n  First, with respect to ``fair use,'' the Committee adopted an \nalternative to section 1201(a)(1) that would authorize the Secretary of \nCommerce to waive selectively the prohibition against the act of \ncircumvention to prevent a diminution in the availability to individual \nusers of a particular category of copyrighted materials. As adopted by \nthe Senate, this section would have established a flat prohibition on \nthe circumvention of technological protection measures to gain access \nto works for any purpose, and thus a system that some have described as \nthe beginning of a ``pay-per-use'' society. Under the compromise \nembodied in the Commerce Committee's version of the bill, the Secretary \nof Commerce would have authority to address the concerns of libraries, \neducational institutions, and others potentially threatened with a \ndenial of access to categories of works in circumstances that otherwise \nwould be lawful today.\n  Second, the Committee made an important contribution by eliminating \nthe potential for misinterpretation of the ``no mandate'' provision of \nthe bill. I had been very concerned that S. 2037 could be interpreted \nas a mandate on product manufacturers to design products so as to \nrespond affirmatively to or to accommodate technological protection \nmeasures that copyright owners might use to deny access to or prevent \nthe copying of their works. To address this potential problem, I \noffered an amendment providing that nothing in the bill required that \nthe design of, or design and selection of parts and components for, a \ncomputing product, a consumer electronics, or a telecommunications \nproduct must provide\n\n[[Page S9936]]\n\nfor a response to any particular technological protection measures. The \namendment reflected my belief that product manufacturers should remain \nfree to design and produce the best available products, without the \nthreat of incurring liability for their design decisions. Technology \nand engineers--not lawyers--should dictate product design. This \nprovision reflected the working assumption that this bill is aimed \nfundamentally at so-called ``black boxes'' and not at legitimate \nproducts that have substantial non-infringing uses. The Commerce \nCommittee has tightened this language even further making it crystal \nclear that nothing in this legislation should be interpreted to limit \nmanufacturers of legitimate products with substantial non-infringing \nuses--such as VCRs and personal computers--in making fundamental design \ndecisions or revisions.\n\n  Third, as an important related matter, the Committee on Commerce \nreaffirmed my view that technological protection measures that cause \n``playability'' problems may not be deemed to be ``effective'' under \nthis legislation. As I pointed out in my floor speech just prior to \nfinal passage of S. 2037, ``playability'' problems may arise because \ntechnological protection measures may cause noticeable and recurring \nadverse effects on the normal operation of products. Adjustments may \nneed to be made either in the factory or after sale to correct these \nplayability problems. It was my view that the legislation did not make \nsuch adjustments illegal, and I was pleased to note that the Commerce \nCommittee made this point explicit in its Committee Report. The \nCommerce Committee's report also included helpful language \ncircumscribing the potential breadth of the bill by narrowly defining \nthe types of technological protection measures that control access to, \nor the copying of, a work.\n  In addition, the Committee of Commerce adopted specific provisions \nmaking it clear that the bill is not intended to prohibit legitimate \nencryption research. As my colleagues know, Senator Burns, Leahy and I \nhave lead the effort in the Senate to ensure that U.S. business can \ndevelop, and export world-class encryption products. By explicitly \nfashioning an affirmative defense, the Committee has made an important \ncontribution to our overall efforts to ensure that U.S. industry \nremains at the forefront in developing secure encryption methods.\n  Finally, the Committee built on my efforts to ensure that this \nlegislation would not harm the efforts of consumers to protect their \npersonal privacy by adopting two important amendments. The first \namendment would create incentives for website operators to disclose \nwhenever they use technological protection measures that have the \ncapability to gather personal data, and to give consumers a means of \ndisabling them. The second amendment strengthened section 1202 of this \nlegislation by making explicit that the term ``copyright management \ninformation'' does not include ``any personally identifying information \nabout a user of a work or a copy, phonorecord, performance, or display \nof a work.'' In my view, these amendments help preserve the critical \nbalance that we must maintain between the interests of copyright owners \nand the privacy interests of information users.\n  In sum, the House version of the bill by and large reflects the \nsubstantial improvements proposed by the House Committee on Commerce. \nIn his floor statement, Congressman Bliley of Virginia, made clear the \nimportance the Committee attaches to the ``fair use'' and ``no \nmandate'' provisions included in the bill. He and others reaffirmed as \nwell the Committee's report language with respect to the definition of \ntechnological measures and the inapplicability of the legislation to \nmanufacturers, retailers, product servicers, and ordinary consumers \nwhen faced with playability problems caused by either protection \nmeasures or copyright management information systems. None of the \nMembers of the Judiciary Committee present offered contrary views about \nthese important provisions, which represent a delicate compromise \nagreement of the interested parties. I thus would hope we can assume \nthat these matters have been definitively settled.\n\n  Since the passage of the House language several issues have begun to \narise that have either been caused by the drafting in the House, or as \nis more often the case, through the unintended consequences of \noutlawing technology. Perhaps the most troubling of these issues is \nmaking security system testing illegal and criminally punishable. \nCurrently, the federal government agencies, companies, state \ngovernments, anyone with a computer system can hire professional \nconsultants to survey and test their IT security systems for \nvulnerabilities.\n  Two of the best known organizations that engage in this sort of \nconsulting are Price Waterhouse Coopers and Ernst & Young, clearly two \nwell-known and responsible corporate citizens. With the language \ncurrently in the WIPO legislation these critical services will no \nlonger be legal. The impact will be destructive to existing businesses \nand to any future promise of electronic commerce. Moreover, without \nthis type of beneficial testing, our country's critical infrastructure \nwill be at risk from domestic and international hackers and cyber-\nterrorists. This effect must surely be unintended, as even those who \nsupport the current language would be at grave risk if our \ncommunications, security, and Internet systems were left without \nadequate protection.\n  On August 4, the House adopted H.R. 2281 by voice vote. For reasons \nnot explained on the floor, the bill contains a series of extraneous \nmeasures that have little or nothing to do with the underlying WIPO \ncopyright treaties. I would call to the attention of my colleagues in \nparticular sections 414, 416, and 417, as well as titles V and VI, of \nthe bill. Unfortunately, the floor debate in the House offered little \ninsight into the anticipated effect or scope of these provisions. They \nappear to have been added by the House Committee on the Judiciary, but \nnone of the Members of the Committee described in any way the substance \nof these measures on the floor.\n  Section 414 makes what ostensibly is only a clarifying change to \nsection 107 of the Copyright Act. No one from the House Committee on \nthe Judiciary, however, said a word on the floor about why this change \nto the ``fair use'' provision is necessary.\n  Section 415 inhibits the continued development and the further \nintroduction of new digital subscription music services. Again, I am \nleft to wonder why this provision is necessary, or even whether it has \nbeen carefully considered by anyone here in the Senate. Apparently, the \n1995 Act regarding digital performance rights in sound recordings was \nreopened to resolve ambiguous issues. What has resulted seems to be a \ntwo tiered approach to subscription service. One tier consisting of \nexisting providers that may compete effectively and a second tier of \nproviders without an up and running system who will be hobbled by many \nnew restrictions and at a greater cost. Not surprisingly, this second \ngroup was not represented in the negotiations.\n\n  The net result of this will be a significant advantage for incumbent \nproviders that reflects a legislative advantage, not a competitive \nadvantage. For those of us who believe that the market, not the \ngovernment, should pick winners, this is a disturbing development. Even \nworse, there is a small group of companies who paid the government for \nspectrum based on the assumption that they could provide subscription \nservice unencumbered, but because they have not yet provided service \nwill now have to operate under these new, anti-competitive rules. The \nresult is that the spectrum they purchased will have a vastly \ndiminished value. This is precisely the type of regulatory taking that \ndiscourages and demoralizes the kind of investment and innovation the \ncountry needs to take full advantage of the promise of new \ntechnologies.\n  Section 416 concerns the assumption of contractual obligations \nrelated to transfer of rights in motion pictures. No one from the House \nCommittee on the Judiciary said a word on the floor about why this \nprovision is necessary to WIPO implementing legislation.\n  Section 417 makes what ostensibly is only a clarifying change to the \nfirst sale doctrine. No one from the House Committee on the Judiciary, \nhowever, said a word on the floor about why this change to the first \nsale doctrine is necessary, or what relation the provision has to a \nrecent Supreme Court decision. Before the Senate is asked to act\n\n[[Page S9937]]\n\non any of these extraneous matters, we need to be convinced that the \nmeasures belong in this bill.\n  Title V apparently sets forth the views of the House Committee on the \nJudiciary on how best to provide legal protection against \nmisappropriation of collections of information such as databases. I \nunderstand that the Administration has indicated that it has serious \nreservations about this approach, including a concern that it may be \nunconstitutional. This is a matter the Senate Judiciary Committee plans \nto address in scheduled hearings. Until those hearings take place, I \nsee no reason to endanger the WIPO bill with a potentially \ncontroversial issue that the full Senate Judiciary Committee has not \nhad an opportunity to examine.\n  Title VI would provide protection for certain boat hull designs. As \nin the case of the other extraneous provisions added in the House, no \none from the House Committee on the Judiciary said a word on the floor \nabout why this change to current law is necessary. At worst, this \nprovision represents fundamental shift in the tradition and breadth of \ncopyright law. At best, it is a dubious idea that was attached without \ndiscussion or consideration. The Senate should not include this \nextraneous matter in the WIPO bill without deliberation.\n  I would hope all parties to the debate would recognize that much has \nbeen done to calibrate the WIPO copyright treaties implementing \nlegislation. Each of us, working alone, would undoubtedly have produced \na different bill. In fact, last fall I introduced a bill that I believe \ndid a far better job of implementing the treaties and did not need \ndozens of carve-outs to deal with the problems created by the approach \nrecommended by the Administration. In any event, we are now late in the \nsession. Much important work has been done in the Senate, and I want to \nthank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee for \nworking with me this spring to address my concerns with this bill. I \nthink the House Committee on Commerce has made additional important \ncontributions. This bill is not a perfect bill, but it is an important \nbill. Before taking any final action, we should eliminate the \nextraneous provisions in this bill, while preserving the true heart of \nthe legislation: the WIPO legislation. However, once that analysis has \nbeen completed, I would hope we could move this legislation forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9935-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9937-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9937-S9938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-6652.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Alaska; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Whereas certain actions, although arguably related to one \n     person's free expression, nevertheless raise issues \n     concerning public decency, public peace, and the rights of \n     expression and sacred values of others; and\n       Whereas there are symbols of our national soul, such as the \n     Washington Monument, the United States Capitol Building, and \n     memorials to our greatest leaders, that are the property of \n     every American and are therefore worthy of protection from \n     desecration and dishonor; and\n       Whereas the American Flag was most nobly born in the \n     struggle for independence that began with ``The Shot Heard \n     Round the World'' on a bridge in Concord, Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, in the War of 1812, the American Flag stood boldly \n     against foreign invasion, symbolized the stand of a young and \n     brave nation against the mighty world power of that day and, \n     in its courageous resilience, inspired our national anthem; \n     and\n       Whereas, in the Second World War, the American Flag was the \n     banner that led the American battle against fascist \n     imperialism from the depths of Pearl Harbor to the \n     mountaintop of Iwo Jima, and from defeat in North Africa's \n     Kasserine Pass to victory in the streets of Hitler's Germany; \n     and\n       Whereas Alaska's star was woven into the fabric of the Flag \n     in 1959, and that 49th star has become an integral part of \n     the Union; and\n       Whereas the American Flag symbolizes the ideals that good \n     and decent people fought for in Vietnam, often at the expense \n     of their lives or at the cost of cruel condemnation upon \n     their return home; and\n       Whereas the American Flag symbolizes the sacred values for \n     which loyal Americans risked and often lost their lives in \n     securing civil rights for all Americans, regardless of race, \n     sex, or creed; and\n       Whereas the American Flag was carried to the moon as a \n     banner of goodwill, vision, and triumph on behalf of all \n     mankind; and\n       Whereas the American Flag proudly represents the United \n     States at Olympic events; and\n       Whereas the American Flag to this day is a most honorable \n     and worthy banner of a nation that is thankful for its \n     strengths and committed to curing its faults and remains the \n     destination of millions of immigrants attracted by the \n     universal power of the American ideal; and\n       Whereas the law as interpreted by the United States Supreme \n     Court no longer accords to the Stars and Stripes that \n     reverence, respect, and dignity befitting the banner of that \n     most noble experiment of a nation-state; and\n       Whereas House Joint Resolution 54, which passed the United \n     States House of Representatives and has been referred to the \n     United States Senate, proposes an amendment to the United \n     States Constitution stating, ``The Congress shall have power \n     to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the \n     United States''; and\n       Whereas Senate Joint Resolution 40, introduced in the \n     United States Senate, proposes an amendment to the United \n     States Constitution stating, ``The Congress shall have power \n     to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the \n     United States''; and\n       Whereas it is only fitting that people everywhere should \n     lend their voices to a forceful call for restoration to the \n     Stars and Stripes of a proper station under law and decency; \n     Be it Resolved by the Alaska State Legislature, That the \n     Congress of the United States is requested to pass House \n     Joint Resolution 54 or Senate Joint Resolution 40, or \n     comparable legislation, and present to the legislatures of \n     the several states an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States that would specifically provide the Congress \n     power to prohibit the physical desecration of the Flag of the \n     United States; this request does not constitution a call for \n     a constitutional convention; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the legislatures of the several \n     states are invited to join with Alaska to secure ratification \n     of the proposed amendment.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable Al \n     Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and President \n     of the U.S. Senate;

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 60\n\n       Whereas, The United States Air Force Reserve operational \n     unit, which is now the 940th Air Refueling Wing (940th ARW), \n     has been in the Sacramento Valley since 1963; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW, which has been located at various \n     times at Mather Air Force Base, McClellan Air Force Base, and \n     Beale Air Force Base, has a proud tradition of supporting the \n     nation's defense since the 940th ARW's activation; and\n       Whereas, The mission of the 940th ARW is to perform global \n     air refueling and strategic airlift operations, which allow \n     other aircraft to fly far beyond their normal range by \n     overcoming the restrictions imposed by limited onboard fuel \n     capacity; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW has participated in many \n     conventional and humanitarian efforts that were undertaken by \n     the Department of Defense and the United Nations, including \n     rebuilding schools in Honduras, providing food and medical \n     supplies to Somalia, and deployment in support of democracy \n     in Haiti; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW was the first Air Force Reserve unit \n     to establish ground operations in the Middle East as a part \n     of Desert Shield when it deployed hundreds of United States \n     military reservists to Saudi Arabia in August 1991, just days \n     after the invasion of Kuwait; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW continues to support peace in Bosnia \n     by supporting joint service missions and conducting \n     peacekeeping operations in the skies above the former \n     Yugoslavia; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW flies KC-135E model aircraft \n     equipped with TF-33 engines that are reaching the end of \n     their 10-year to 15-year life span; and\n       Whereas, These engines are of 1960's technology and do not \n     meet contemporary international or United States noise, \n     emission, and fuel efficiency standards; and\n       Whereas, Conversion to the KC-135R model engine would \n     provide each aircraft with 26 percent more thrust on takeoff \n     and 18 percent improved fuel consumption, offering increased \n     offload capacity of 20,000 pounds of fuel; and\n       Whereas, The KC-135R model engine exceeds in-flight noise \n     standards and offers a 69 percent reduction in in-flight \n     engine emissions; and\n       Whereas, These engines are widely used in the commercial \n     sector, making repair and parts available worldwide; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW is the only air refueling wing \n     positioned in the central west coast that is capable of \n     conducting or hosting ``bridge'' refueling operations for \n     global deployment of United States Armed Forces to the \n     Pacific region; and\n       Whereas, Conversion to the KC-135R aircraft with the \n     multiport refueling system would allow the 940th ARW to cost-\n     effectively support United States Marine Corps and United \n     States Navy aircraft that are based at El Centro, Lemoore, \n     and Miramar, California, and at Fallon, Nevada, as well as \n     other locations worldwide; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW has been moved from Mather AFB to \n     McClellan AFB due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC); and\n       Whereas, Conversion to the KC-135R model engine would \n     ensure that the 940th ARW remains a viable-force structure \n     asset and would preserve, for the Department of Defense and \n     the nation, the skills of its 950 members, including 185 \n     full-time employees of the unit who live in the central \n     valley, including Sacramento, El Dorado, Yolo, Yuba, Sutter, \n     Placer, and San Joaquin Counties; and\n       Whereas, Conversion to the KC-135R model engine would \n     protect the 940th ARW's $22,000,000 contribution to the local \n     economy in the form of maintaining salaries and operating \n     expenses; and\n       Whereas, The 940th ARW creates an estimated 300 secondary \n     jobs; and\n       Whereas, The loss of the 940th ARW would have a significant \n     negative impact on the region's economy; and\n       Whereas, Resource limitations may not allow the United \n     States Air Force Reserve to fund the conversion of both of \n     its remaining KC-135E units to the KC-135R aircraft, since \n     the Air Force Reserve Command has earmarked funding for the \n     conversion of four additional aircraft, but has not decided \n     which of the two remaining KC-135E model units will be \n     converted; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature memorializes the \n     President and the Congress of the United States to endorse, \n     support, and fund the 940th ARW as the next KC-135 unit to \n     convert to KC135-R model aircraft, because that conversion \n     would ensure that the 940th ARW remains a relevant, capable, \n     and necessary part of the United States Air Force mission in \n     the 21st century and a viable and productive asset to the \n     Department of Defense, the State of California, and the \n     nation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, to each Senator and Representative \n     from California in the Congress of the United States, and to \n     each member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the \n     House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-527. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 63\n\n       Whereas, The Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve contains \n     within it two sections of\n\n[[Page S9939]]\n\n     school lands and, upon sale, the value of the school lands is \n     to become available to the State of California for the \n     purposes of retired teacher benefits; and\n       Whereas, The federal government, in the 1996 Defense \n     Authorization Act, recognized and provided a means to \n     adjudicate California's claim to revenues from the sale of \n     the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve; and\n       Whereas, The State of California, through the Governor and \n     the Attorney General, have complied with all requirements and \n     have reached agreement with the federal government on the \n     state's claim; and\n       Whereas, The agreement between the Secretary of Energy and \n     the State of California, pursuant to the 1996 Defense \n     Authorization Act, provides that 9 percent of the net sale \n     value will be used for California; and\n       Whereas, The sale has been completed and approximately \n     three hundred twenty million dollars ($320,000,000) is the \n     state's 9 percent share; and\n       Whereas, The funds received from the sale of the Elk Hills \n     Naval Petroleum Reserve will be used to provide retirement \n     benefits to those teachers who have lost most of the value of \n     their pension to inflation; and\n       Whereas, These teachers are mainly over 80 years old and \n     have the lowest pensions from the State Teachers' Retirement \n     System; and\n       Whereas, The federal government and the President have \n     included, within the 1999 fiscal year budget proposals, the \n     sum of thirty-six million dollars ($36,000,000) as the first \n     payment pursuant to the agreement; and\n       Whereas, The State of California believes that the \n     appropriation should be made and honored at the earliest date \n     possible; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California memorializes the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to approve the appropriation included in the \n     1999 fiscal year proposed energy appropriation in the bill \n     appropriating funds for the support of the Department of the \n     Interior; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-528.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois; to the Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 505\n\n       Whereas, The United States General Accounting Office issued \n     a report entitled, ``Proprietary Schools; Millions Spent to \n     Train Students for Oversupplied Occupations'', claiming that \n     an oversupply of cosmetologists exists; and\n       Whereas, In reality, a serious shortage of cosmetologists \n     exists; hundreds of job opportunities in salons are not being \n     filled, which has resulted in salon clients being turned \n     away; and\n       Whereas, While compiling data for the report, the General \n     Accounting Office did not talk to anyone in the private \n     sector, including salon owners, trade schools, and state and \n     national associations; and\n       Whereas, The report used statistics from state-level labor \n     market data, which are inaccurate because employers and job \n     seekers do not use unemployment offices, employees rarely use \n     Labor Department offices, and employers use direct marketing \n     and classified advertisements instead; and\n       Whereas, In counting available places for job openings, the \n     General Accounting Office incorrectly counted each chain of \n     stores as only one entity, when each of their multiple \n     locations should be counted as a separate retail outlet to \n     more accurately reflect the need to fill the multitude of \n     openings that are immediately available; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninetieth \n     General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge the \n     U.S. Congress to insure that federal financial aid assistance \n     continues for cosmetology training; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, \n     the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and each \n     member of the Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-530. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Illinois; to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 547\n\n       Whereas, The United States' embargo against Cuba, imposed \n     35 years ago, has increasingly created physical hardships for \n     the people of Cuba, depriving them of much needed food and \n     medicines and exposing them, including the children, to the \n     effects of malnutrition and other severe health concerns; and\n       Whereas, The recent visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II \n     focused world attention on the needs of the Cuban people and \n     called for mutually beneficial reconciliation and the lifting \n     of the United States' embargo against Cuba; and\n       Whereas, Many Cuban-Americans living in the United States \n     as American citizens have families that are being subjected \n     to these hardships and would want to help their families \n     without breaking the laws of the United States; and\n       Whereas, The State of Illinois, a leader in education, \n     commerce, agriculture, and technology, stands to benefit from \n     the potential economic development and trade that could be \n     established with the island nation of Cuba; and\n       Whereas, The Congress of the United States is currently \n     considering HR 1951 and S 1391, which seek to lift the \n     embargo against Cuba for the purpose of making available \n     humanitarian aid in the form of food and medicines; therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninetieth \n     General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge the \n     passage and enactment of HR 1951 and S 1391 to lift the \n     United States' embargo for humanitarian reasons and that the \n     delivery of food and medicine to the Cuban people be allowed; \n     and that such an adjustment in our foreign policy reflects \n     America's humanitarianism that transcends political ideology; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Speaker of the United \n     States House of Representatives, the President Pro Tempore of \n     the United States Senate, and each member of the Illinois \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-531. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Illinois; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 51\n\n       Whereas, The current State sales tax on coal burned in \n     Illinois raises approximately $60 million dollars each year \n     in revenue for the State; and\n       Whereas, Ninety percent of Illinois coal is purchased by \n     the electric utility industry, and about one-half of the \n     electricity used in the State comes from coal-burning plants; \n     and\n       Whereas, The 1990 Federal Clean Air Act amendments have \n     resulted in fuel switching from Illinois high-sulfur coal to \n     western, low-sulfur coal to generate electricity; and\n       Whereas, The sale of Illinois coal has continued to \n     decrease, due primarily to increased competition from \n     western, low-sulfur coal, resulting in the loss of thousands \n     of jobs directly related to coal mining; and\n       Whereas, Illinois coal is mined in 18 counties and accounts \n     for as much as 16% of employment and 23% of personal income \n     in individual counties; and\n       Whereas, The coal mining industry provides approximately \n     5,000 jobs and more than 17,000 spin-off jobs in the State; \n     and\n       Whereas, Almost $800 million dollars has been spent on \n     clean coal technology projects to expand the use of high-\n     sulfur Illinois coal; and\n       Whereas, It is important to keep the Illinois coal industry \n     competitive because coal is the State's most abundant and \n     economically important natural resource; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninetieth \n     General Assembly of the State of Illinois, the Senate \n     concurring herein; That a 12-member Task Force be formed to \n     study the feasibility of eliminating the sales tax on \n     Illinois coal; the Task Force shall consist of the Directors, \n     or their designees, of the Department of Revenue and the \n     Department of Commerce and Community Affairs; a member of the \n     Illinois Coal Development Board (within the Department of \n     Natural Resources); the President of the United Mine Workers; \n     the Vice President of the Illinois Coal Association; one \n     member from the Governor's office; 2 members appointed by the \n     President of the Senate; 2 members appointed by the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives; one member appointed by the \n     Minority Leader of the Senate; and one member appointed by \n     the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives; \n     appointments made by the General Assembly shall be made \n     within 30 days after this Resolution is adopted; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Task Force report its findings and \n     recommendations to the General Assembly and the Governor no \n     later than January 1, 1999; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     delivered to the Governor, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, the President of the Senate, the Minority \n     Leader of the House of Representatives, the Minority Leader \n     of the Senate, and each member of the Illinois congressional \n     delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9938-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9939-S9940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n             Kerry, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Dodd):\n       S. 2436.

A bill to require that jewelry imported from another country \nbe indelibly marked with the country of origin; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n           legislation requiring marking of imported jewelry\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nto require permanent country of origin markings on most imported \nfashion or ``costume'' jewelry products. I am joined in this effort by \nSenator D'Amato, who founded the Senate Jewelry Task Force with me, as \nwell as Senators Inouye, Kerry, Torricelli, and Dodd, who I would like \nto thank for their strong support of the 16,200 Americans employed by \nour nation's fashion jewelry manufacturers.\n  Like many sectors of our nation's economy, domestic fashion jewelry \nmanufacturers are all too familiar with the pressures of the new global \neconomy. And, for many years, little attention was paid to the industry \nby our trade negotiators and other officials. Today, that is changing: \nThe Commerce Department is working with our fashion jewelry makers and \nhas undertaken a competitiveness study of the industry, and our trade \nnegotiators now recognize the needs of America's jewelry manufacturers \nwhen they sit down with our trading partners.\n  Yet, the industry still faces an uphill battle against low-wage \nimporters, who do not have to abide by appropriate environmental \nstandards and other important U.S. laws. For that reason, we are \nintroducing this legislation to require a permanent country of origin \nlabel on imported fashion jewelry products so American consumers know \nwhere it was made. This is the same labeling requirement we see on \nthousands of imported products from televisions to tennis shoes. \nUnfortunately, the current marking requirement for jewelry imports is a \nhanging tag or sticker, which can be removed, fall-off, or be obscured \nby price tags.\n  Consumers deserve better, and this legislation allows them to make an \ninformed choice, in light of the $524 million worth of fashion jewelry \nimported in 1995 alone. Our bill is modeled on the current permanent \nmarking requirement for imported Native American style jewelry \nproducts, and it is endorsed by the nation's largest jewelry trade \norganizations such as the Manufacturing Jewelers and Silversmiths of \nAmerica and the Jewelers of America.\n  Mr. President, imported jewelry is a fact of our international \neconomy, but consumers have a right to know where a product is made and \nhard working American jewelry makers have a right to a level playing \nfield. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and I \nlook forward to its consideration by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2436\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MARKING OF IMPORTED JEWELRY.\n\n       (a) Marking Requirement.--By no later than the date that is \n     1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury shall prescribe and implement regulations \n     that require that all jewelry described in subsection (b) \n     that enters the customs territory of the United States have \n     the English name of the country of origin indelibly marked in \n     a conspicuous place on such jewelry by cutting, die-sinking, \n     engraving, stamping, or some other permanent method. The \n     exceptions from marking requirements provided in section 304 \n     of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1304) shall not apply to \n     jewelry described in this section.\n       (b) Jewelry.--The jewelry described in this subsection \n     means any article described in heading 7117 of the Harmonized \n     Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n       (c) Definition.--As used in this section, the term ``enters \n     the customs territory of the United States'' means enters, or \n     is withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, in the customs \n     territory of the United States.\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today along with my colleague Mr. \nReed of Rhode Island I introduce legislation that will require country \nof origin marking on imported costume jewelry in order to better inform \nAmerican consumers about the country of origin of their costume jewelry \npurchases.\n  The jewelry industry in the U.S. consisted of more than 3500 \ncompanies and 55,000 American workers in 1994, with sales totaling in \nthe billions of dollars annually. In 1977 imports of costume and fine \njewelry were about 14% of the jewelry sales in the U.S. By 1994 the \nimported costume jewelry sales reached 26% of all costume jewelry \nsales, and 50% of all fine jewelry sales. This increase in imports led \nto a decline in employment in the U.S. jewelry manufacturing industry \nby 26%. Of course we all favor the advantages that come from foreign \ncompetition in the marketplace. And we also favor informed consumers.\n  Currently, imported jewelry is one of the few products that does not \nrequire a country of origin stamp. This bill will require imported \ncostume jewelry to be stamped in English with the country of origin. \nThis eliminates the problem of removal or loss of adhesive labels or \ntags that state the country of origin prior to reaching the retail \nstore. In this way we respect the integrity of our American workers by \nremoving any question as to the origin of any costume jewelry \npurchases. This bill is a reasonable and low-cost response that extends \nthe country of origin marking law to cover a product that should be \nincluded.\n  With the increasing wealth of our country, the sales of jewelry are \nincreasing and those who wish to know the country of manufacture of \ntheir jewelry will be easily satisfied by a simple stamp or imprint on \nthese items. This jewelry should be subject to same rules as all other \nimports. The industry trade group, The Manufacturers, Jewelers, and \nSilversmiths of America, also support this bill. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 2437. A bill to require that jewelry boxes imported from another \ncountry be indelibly marked with the country of origin; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n        Legislation Requiring Marking of Imported Jewelry Boxes\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation at \nthe request of Rhode Island's jewelry box manufacturers to require a \npermanent country of origin marking on imported jewelry boxes.\n  This bill is similar to another piece of legislation I am introducing \ntoday to require a permanent country of origin label on imported \nfashion jewelry items, and it is my hope that this jewelry box bill \nwill be considered in tandem with that legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nlegislation be printed in the record I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The exceptions from marking requirements \n     provided in section 304 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. \n     1304) shall not apply to jewelry boxes subject to this \n     section.\n       (b) Jewelry.--The jewelry boxes referred to in subsection \n     (a) are jewelry boxes provided for in headings 4202.92.60, \n     4202.92.90, and\n\n[[Page S9941]]\n\n     4202.99.10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9940-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Bumpers) was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to amend title \n46, United States Code, to extend eligibility for veterans' burial \nbenefits, funeral benefits, and related benefits for veterans of \ncertain service in the United States merchant marine during World War \nII.\n\n\n                                 S. 374\n\n  At the request of Mr. Robb, the names of the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Maine (Ms. Collins), the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), and the \nSenator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) were added as cosponsors of S. \n374, a bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend \neligibility for hospital care and medical services under chapter 17 of \nthat title to veterans who have been awarded the Purple Heart, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1593\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, her name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n1593, a bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled \nSubstances Import and Export Act with respect to penalties for powder \ncocaine and crack cocaine offenses.\n\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1868, a bill \nto express United States foreign policy with respect to, and to \nstrengthen United States advocacy on behalf of, individuals persecuted \nfor their faith worldwide;

which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 271\n\n         \n       Whereas according to the American Cancer Society, in 1998, \n     178,700 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 43,500 \n     women will die from this disease;\n       Whereas in the decade of the 1990's, it is estimated that \n     about 2,000,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer, \n     resulting in nearly 500,000 deaths;\n       Whereas the risk of breast cancer increases with age, with \n     a woman at age 70 having twice as much of a chance of \n     developing the disease as a woman at age 50;\n       Whereas at least 80 percent of the women who get breast \n     cancer have no family history of the disease;\n       Whereas mammograms, when operated professionally at a \n     certified facility, can provide a safe and quick diagnosis;\n       Whereas experts agree that mammography is the best method \n     of early detection of breast cancer, and early detection is \n     the key to saving lives;\n       Whereas mammograms can reveal the presence of small cancers \n     up to 2 years or more before a regular clinical breast \n     examination or breast self-examination (BSE), reducing \n     mortality by more than 30 percent; and\n       Whereas 47 States and the District of Columbia have passed \n     legislation requiring health insurance companies to cover \n     mammograms in accordance with recognized screening \n     guidelines: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 16, 1998, as ``National Mammography \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     day with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution to \ndesignate October 16, 1998 as ``National Mammography Day.'' Since 1993, \nI have introduced similar measures, and each year the Senate has gone \non record in support of the value of mammography by approving this \nresolution.\n  The American Cancer Society estimates that 178,700 women will be \ndiagnosed with breast cancer in 1998, while 43,500 women will \neventually succumb to the disease this year. However, despite these \nhorrifying numbers, the cure for breast cancer continues to allude us.\n  Experts therefore agree that early detection and treatment are a \nwoman's best defenses in the fight against this killer. Mammograms can \nreveal the\n\n[[Page S9942]]\n\npresence of small cancers up to 2 years before regular clinical breast \nexaminations or breast self-examinations [BSE], reducing mortality by \nmore than 30 percent.\n  Mr. President, the resolution I am submitting sets aside one day in \nthe midst of ``National Breast Cancer Awareness Month'' to encourage \nwomen to receive or sign up for a mammogram. In doing so, we can \neducate our nation's mothers, sisters, and friends on the importance of \nearly detection through mammography and prevent more women from dying \nfrom this disease. I sincerely hope my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing mammograms as a key element in the fight against breast \ncancer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9941-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KENNEDY AMENDMENT NO. 3540\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 1301) to amend title 11, United States Code, to provide \nfor consumer bankruptcy protection, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, as children around the country \nhead back to school this week, I come to the floor to speak about 44 \nWisconsin schools with an extra reason to be excited on their first day \nof school this year. The students, teachers and parents at these 44 \nschools are excited because they are now participants in Wisconsin's \nsuccessful pilot program, the Student Achievement Guarantee in \nEducation, known as the SAGE program. These 44 schools deserve \ncongratulations and I want to recognize some of them here today on the \nSenate floor.\n  New SAGE participants include Giese Elementary School in Racine, \nMcKinley Elementary School in Kenosha, Allen-Field Elementary School in \nMilwaukee, Chegwin Elementary School in Fond du Lac and many, many, \nmore.\n  The new SAGE schools are spread throughout Wisconsin from LaCrosse in \nthe east, to Sheboygan in the west, Ashland in the north and Madison in \nthe south. They include schools in Wisconsin's most populous areas, \nsuch as, Milwaukee, Madison, Racine and Waukesha, and also, the rural \ncommunities of Winter, Kickapoo and Baraboo.\n  Mr. President, Wisconsin's SAGE program is a model for the nation in \nhow to implement successful education reforms in our public schools, \nmost importantly, reducing public school class size. I congratulate \nthose in Wisconsin that have made the SAGE program possible for these \nadditional twenty schools and take this opportunity to again alert my \nSenate colleagues to Wisconsin's innovative SAGE program.\n  Mr. President, for many years now, I have been a strong advocate of \nfederal support for states that are trying to reduce class size in \ntheir schools. I have witnessed first-hand, how reducing class size \nenhanced the overall quality of education in Wisconsin's SAGE classes. \nThose participating in SAGE, teachers, parents, students and school \nadministrators, report that student academic performance, student \nbehavior and teacher morale all improved. In addition, comprehensive \nevaluations of Wisconsin's SAGE program have confirmed that small class \nsize promotes effective teaching and learning.\n  Leading scientific studies of the impact of small class size, \nincluding Tennessee's STAR study and its follow-up, the Lasting Benefit \nstudy, found that students in small classes in their early years earned \nhigher scores on basic skills tests in all four years and in all types \nof schools. Follow-up studies have shown that these achievement gains \nwere sustained in later years, even if students go on to larger \nclasses. Along with important factors in quality education like teacher \nquality, high expectations, and parental involvement, the significance \nof small class size should not be underestimated and cannot be ignored.\n  When asked about her experience as a kindergarten teacher at Webster \nStanley Elementary School in Oshkosh, a new SAGE school, Lauren \nFlanagan said she noticed that she could visit with each table more \nfrequently and the children listened and learned more readily. In \naddition, she said about the SAGE program, quote, ``It just makes such \na difference. I had a chance to visit schools around the state \nparticipating in the SAGE program, and what\n\n[[Page S9943]]\n\nI observed is that they were much further along in their curriculum. \nThe students were much more advanced.'' end quote.\n  Mr. President, I have been so impressed with the success of the SAGE \nprogram that I introduced the National SAGE Act, legislation to offer \ngrants to qualifying states to assist them in reducing public school \nclass size in the earliest grades. The National SAGE Act authorizes $75 \nmillion over five years to fund a limited number of demonstration \ngrants to states that create innovative programs to reduce public \nschool class size and improve educational performance, as Wisconsin has \ndone. The Secretary of Education would choose the states to receive \nfunding based on several factors, including a state's need to reduce \nclass size, the ability of a state education agency to fund half the \nprogram, and the degree to which parents, teachers, administrators, and \nteacher organizations are consulted in designing the program.\n  The National SAGE Act is fully offset by cuts in a wasteful and \nunnecessary federal subsidy that benefits research and development for \nthe world's largest aircraft manufacturer. We can fund this important \nSAGE program, while simultaneously reducing the federal budget deficit \nby more than $2.1 billion over five years.\n  My legislation also includes a comprehensive research and evaluation \ncomponent that would document the benefits of smaller class size in the \nearliest grades, and support efforts to reduce class size in schools \nall over the country.\n  I think we all can agree that there are no easy solutions to the \nproblems in our public schools. I believe, however, that targeting \nfederal funds, matched on a 50-50 basis with state funding, to assist \nschool districts moving toward smaller class size, is an effective use \nof federal dollars. The federal government, in cooperation with local \nschool boards and state governments, has a responsibility to take \npositive steps toward helping school districts reduce class size as a \npart of an overall effort to improve student learning. As we near the \nend of the 105th Congress, I hope my Senate colleagues will embrace \nSAGE as a serious and exciting reform effort and act to assist states \ntrying to reduce public school class size.\n  Again, congratulations to the twenty new Wisconsin SAGE schools--you \nare off to a great start for a successful school year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9942-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n MR.

Mr. President, I want to share with the Senate a \ncourageous story about two female Tennesseans who recently succeeded in \ntheir quest to retrace a historic flight around the world.\n  Nikki Mitchell and Rhonda Miles landed their single-engine Maule M-5 \nplane at the Lebanon, Tennessee airport on Saturday, August 22, 1998. \nTheir trip, dubbed the ``Bridge of Wings Tour,'' was completed 49 days \nafter they took off from the same airport.\n  Their flight commemorates the historical achievement of three female \nRussian pilots. That journey, known as the ``Flight of the Rodina,'' \nwas a story of courage and stamina in the tradition of Lindbergh and \nEarhart. It took place in 1938, when the three Russians flew non-stop \nfrom Moscow to the southeastern tip of Siberia.\n  The Russian pilots flew with virtually no radio transmission, through \nskies so overcast no landmarks were visible, yet they broke a world \nrecord and opened up the route across Siberia. They were cheered \nworldwide and received their country's highest award, the Gold Star of \nHero of the Soviet Union.\n  Sixty years later, Nikki and Rhonda celebrated the accomplishments of \nthe Rodina on the anniversary of its flight. A portion of their 15,000 \nmile trip included retracing the steps of the three Soviet women from \nMoscow to the southeastern tip of Siberia. And for this leg of the \nroute they were joined by two Russian women who flew their plane side \nby side with the American aircraft in a unified flight of honor and \ngoodwill.\n  As they flew over Russian territory, Nikki and Rhonda were met by \ncrowds and cheers in villages across the Russian Far East. The level of \nexcitement was such that a commercial airline canceled a flight so its \nfuel could be used for the continuation of their flight.\n  Before returning to Tennessee, Nikki and Rhonda were also warmly \nwelcomed in Alaska, Canada, and Des Moines, Iowa. It goes without \nsaying that upon arrival in Lebanon, Tennessee, they were given a \nwelcome fit for heroes.\n  Nikki and Rhonda, dressed in blue flight suits and holding flowers, \ncouldn't contain their excitement as they stepped out of the plane. \nNikki showed how happy she was to be back in the Volunteer State by \nimmediately kissing the Tennessee soil. Also thankful to be home, \nRhonda could not stop smiling as friends rushed to greet her.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues in the Senate join me in saluting \nNikki and Rhonda for their courageous journey. These Tennesseans have \nrecreated one of history's most daring and remarkable flights. Their \ntrip will always be remembered as an international effort to honor one \nof aviation's most exciting moments. I have no doubt that the example \nset by these women will inspire others to strive toward achieving their \nown ambitions and goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9943-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9943-S9944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday, I led an effort during \nconsideration of the FY99 foreign operations appropriations bill to \ntighten the conditions under which additional funding is made available \nto the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n  Although the bill included provisions to prod the IMF into making \nbadly needed reforms of its operations, it stopped short of actually \nrequiring the implementation of those reforms. Instead, it merely \nconditioned the release of funds on the IMF making a public commitment \nto reform. That, in my view, was not good enough.\n  The IMF has not effectively used the funds that have been allocated \nto it in the past. According to Johns Hopkins University economist, \nSteve Hanke, few nations have actually graduated from IMF emergency \nloans. Most have stayed on the dole for years on end. One study found \nthat, of the 137 mostly developing countries from 1965 to 1995, less \nthan a third graduated from IMF loan programs.\n  The Heritage Foundation has found that, of the IMF's borrowers during \n1965 to 1995, no more than half were better off than when they started \nthe loan programs. Almost all were actually poorer, and almost all were \ndeeper in debt.\n  The IMF's failures are apparent even today. Just a few months ago, \nthe IMF orchestrated a $22.6 billion bailout package for Russia, yet \nthat country's economy shows no signs of improving. In fact, it is \ngrowing worse every day. And all of the experts agree that, unless \nRussia establishes the kind of rules of law required for a functioning \neconomy, all the money in the world will not help it. We would be \nfooling ourselves to think otherwise.\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\n  Although my amendment failed on a vote of 74 to 19, I am heartened by \ntwo things. First, we won more votes for effective IMF reform yesterday \nthan we did when the question was first put to the Senate back in \nMarch. And second, the issue is far from settled in the House, which \nhas been more skeptical of providing the IMF with any additional \nresources. In other words, this issue is far from settled, and my hope \nis that the final version of the foreign operations bill will either \ninclude the more effective reforms I have proposed, or will scale back \nIMF funding altogether.\n\n\n                       FY99 FOREIGN AID SPENDING\n\n  Mr. President, pending a final resolution of the IMF issue, I think \nit is important to consider what else is accomplished by this bill, \nbecause there are some very good things about it. First, I would note \nthat the cost of the bill, aside from the IMF, is nearly $600 million, \nor 4.5 percent, less than last year's measure. That is significant.\n  Second, this bill contains $2.94 billion in aid to Israel: $1.08 \nbillion in economic assistance and $1.86 billion in military \nassistance. I would note that this amount is $60 million less than was \nappropriated for Israel last year, and it is consistent with the United \nStates' agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \nphase out U.S. economic assistance to Israel over ten years. These \nfunds are crucial to ensuring that Israel's economic and security \nconcerns continue to be adequately addressed.\n  The level of support for Israel that is contained in this bill sends \na clear message to the people of Israel and the world that the world's \ngreatest democracy remains committed to supporting the only democracy \nin the Middle East, a critical ally that supports American values and \ninterests in a critical region.\n  Third, the bill contains other provisions that I believe will serve \nto protect our values and interests in the Middle East. For example, \nthe bill makes clear that the Palestine Broadcasting Corporation is an \norganization that restricts fundamental press freedoms and broadcasts \nmaterial that is inimical to U.S. interests, and is therefore unworthy \nof U.S. assistance.\n  Fourth, the legislation includes an amendment offered by the Majority \nLeader--an amendment I cosponsored--that will provide $10 million to \nsupport the Iraqi opposition. Saddam Hussein's recent decision to halt \nall cooperation with U.N. arms inspections and recent revelations that \nIraq had developed the capability to load deadly VX nerve gas in \nmissile warheads is a reminder of the continuing threat posed by this \nrogue regime to U.S. forces and friends in the region. The additional \nfunding in this bill is intended to reinvigorate the Iraqi opposition \nas part of an overarching strategy that is aimed at replacing the \ncurrent government in Iraq.\n  Fifth, the bill provides clear and strong support for the Agency for \nInternational Development's efforts to ensure that the countries of the \nformer Soviet Union develop effective legal systems capable of \naddressing the many challenges facing these states as they continue to \nbuild stable democratic societies. One area of particular concern is \nthe troubling amount of domestic violence in Russia. This bill makes \nclear that the active support of women's crisis centers in Russia \nshould be a priority.\n  Additionally, the bill makes clear that no funds should be provided \nto Russia if the government of Russia implements any statute, executive \norder, or regulation that would discriminate against religious groups \nor communities in Russia.\n  Sixth, I am pleased that this bill conditions assistance to Russia on \nMoscow's termination of financial and technical support for Iran's \nnuclear program. Iran's ongoing efforts to acquire nuclear weapons are \na threat to our security; it would be the height of irresponsibility to \nsend American taxpayers' dollars to a country that is assisting a rogue \nstate such as Iran in developing these dangerous weapons.\n  Along similar lines, the bill wisely restricts aid to North Korea \nunless the President can certify that it has ceased its efforts to \ndevelop nuclear weapons and that it has also stopped assisting the \nballistic missile programs of states that support terrorism.\n  Seventh, the bill takes steps to ensure that American interests in \nCentral Asia are protected. In the next few years, a massive pipeline \nwill be built to transport the vast oil and natural gas resources of \nthe Caspian Sea region to the Mediterranean sea for export to the West. \nThe bill states that an East-West pipeline that travels through \nTurkey--as opposed to a Northern pipeline through unstable regions of \nRussia--will provide a secure energy transport system that will support \nstability and democracy in the region.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, given that the IMF issue has yet to be resolved--House \napproval is tenuous at best--I ultimately based my vote on the initial \nversion of the FY99 Foreign Operations bill on the balance of factors I \nhave just discussed. Should it turn out that the IMF funding is \nultimately included, particularly without a mechanism for ensuring the \nimplementation of effective reforms of the way the international agency \ndoes business, I may well reassess my vote on the final conference \nreport. For now, I am supporting the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9943-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9944-S9945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO PROFESSOR CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na man for whom I have great respect; a man who inspired and taught me \nwhile I attended the University of Texas Law School. I am speaking of \nLaw Professor Charles Alan Wright. Today is Charles Alan Wright's \nbirthday. Charles Alan Wright is one of the most distinguished \nconstitutional authorities in the country, a champion for racial \njustice, and the model of what a great lawyer should be. For more than \nforty years he has shaped and influenced generations of Texas lawyers \nwhile teaching at the UT Law School, including myself. Professor Wright \nalso does not shy from a challenge. He has argued twelve times before \nthe Supreme Court, winning most of his cases, some of them landmark \ndecisions. As an author, Professor Wright has written one of the most \ndefinitive texts in the arena of law, Federal Practice and Procedure, \ncited by many as the bible for federal judges. His pursuit of \nprofessional excellence is mirrored by his righteous courage, having \nfought for desegregation and to put an end to racial intolerance.\n  I would like to quote from the Austin American-Statesman: ``For \nWright's accomplishments in the legal field, his country thanks him. \nFor his sterling record as a professor, the university and its \ngraduates thank him. For his personal courage in opening minds, all \nAustin should thank him.'' Happy Birthday Charles and thank you. I ask \nthat the Sunday, June 21, 1998, Austin American-Statesman editorial \npaying tribute to Charles Alan Wright be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n           [From the Austin American-Statesman June 21, 1998]\n\n                         A Scholar and a Leader\n\n       Charles Alan Wright is lucky enough to live in interesting \n     times and smart enough to make the most of it.\n       A profile of this towering scholar and professor at the \n     University of Texas law school in today's editions by \n     American-Statesman reporter Mary Ann Roser is a testament to \n     his presence on campus and in the world at large.\n       Wright has made an indelible imprint on the law school, an \n     institution he helped raise in stature in his tenure of more \n     than 40 years. And his impact in the legal profession will be \n     just as lasting, as his multi-volume bible of federal court \n     procedures, Federal Practice and Procedure, attests.\n       Wright joined the law school faculty in 1955 and made an \n     immediate impression. From intramural football to the \n     controversial defense of President Richard M. Nixon in the \n     Watergate scandal, Wright has been involved both in the \n     school and in the life around him. As he is today as a member \n     of the legal team appealing the Hopwood decision by the \n     federal court of appeals.\n       Wright brought status and stature to the UT School of Law. \n     His high profile and prestige certainly helped attract the \n     faculty that has kept the law school in the top rank in the \n     country.\n       Wright will always be known for his work with the Nixon \n     defense team during the Watergate years and for his \n     involvement with the prestigious American Law Institute, for \n     which he served as president and vice president.\n       Those intimate with the legal profession are impressed, \n     too, that three U.S. Supreme Court justices have appointed \n     him to the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and \n     Procedure of the Judicial Conference. He served the \n     conference from 1964 to 1993.\n       But Wright's personal courage in challenging this \n     community's racial intolerance in\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\n     the early years of desegregation illuminates Wright the man \n     as much as his many professional accomplishments burnish \n     Wright the constitutional scholar.\n       He fought personally to desegregate the private church \n     school his daughter attended, to desegregate the private \n     clubs and institutions on the University of Texas campus and \n     to spread the message of racial tolerance throughout the \n     community.\n       For Wright's accomplishments in the legal field, his \n     country thanks him. For his sterling record as a professor, \n     the university and its graduates thank him. For his personal \n     courage in opening minds, all Austin should thank \n     him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/03/senate-section/article/S9944-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
