This morning the Senate will be in a period for morning \nbusiness until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate \nintends to consider and complete action on the following: A continuing \nresolution which continues funding through Friday, November 14; \nadoption of the foster care conference report--I am very pleased that \nwe have been able to bring that very important matter to a favorable \ncompletion because it certainly needs to be done, and I think it is \ngoing to be a great help in getting children in foster care into \nadoption--and any other Legislative or Executive Calendar items that we \ncan get cleared. However, no rollcall votes will occur in today's, \nTuesday's, or Wednesday's session of the Senate. Of course, that is in \nobservance of Tuesday, which is Veterans Day. Members will be given \nsufficient notice if any votes will occur on Thursday.\n  At this point there is a possibility of a couple of votes on \nThursday, that is, Thursday, November 13, and there are some items that \nwe would have to deal with yet, either an omnibus appropriations bill \nor the appropriations bills separately, if they wind up coming back to \nus in that way. But those would be the final items that we probably \nneed to do before we adjourn for the first session.\n  The House has recessed until Wednesday, November 12, with the \nintention of concluding the appropriations process on that day. It is \nhoped that a few other remaining items can be considered by voice vote \nduring Wednesday's session of the Senate, although I emphasize again no \nrecorded votes.\n  Unfortunately, I cannot say at this time exactly what we can expect \non Thursday. As the Members are finding out now, the House did not get \nto a conclusion on fast track. While we have not had enough time yet to \ndiscuss what happens next on that issue with the House leadership or \nwith the administration, Senator Daschle and I have talked this \nmorning. I have talked to the President's Chief of Staff. They will be \nhaving meetings this morning, and we would have some further \nannouncement to make perhaps today or later on this week on what \nfurther will happen on the fast-track trade issue, if anything. Also, \nbecause of the energy and time that went into the fast-track efforts to \ncome up with the votes in the House late last night, the House was not \nable to take up, of course, and deal with the appropriations bills. We \nwill be working on that today and Wednesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12436-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--H.R. 2513\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask the leader his intentions when we \nreturn, what the first order of business would be. The leader and I had \nhad a chance to have a conversation last Friday, and he had indicated \nto me his intention was at that time that we would go to the highway \nbill when we return. Is that still the Senator's intention.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it would be my intention. Of course, we \nwould need to confer on that with the committee leaders. But I believe \nthat Senator Chafee and Senator Baucus would like to take it up early. \nI talked with Senator Daschle about it. That is something I would like \nto maybe begin on the next day after the State of the Union but right \nat that first part. So we can go ahead and do our work and, hopefully, \nthe House will follow our leadership.\n  One other issue that could come up early next year would be the \njuvenile justice bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee. I \nbelieve there is some language in the omnibus bill that we passed that \nwould provide funds for it, but those funds are fenced until we do \nauthorization. So that is something that could come up. And before we \ngo out for the President's Day recess, we would also take up the Morrow \nnomination for a judicial position.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. If I could just conclude the \nthought, a number of our States are very concerned about the highway \nlegislation because, although we are going to have a 6-month extension \nhere, they are concerned about having a short construction season and \nabout our completing work on a highway bill in a timely way.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield so I can bring him up to date on \nthat?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Throughout the day yesterday, meetings were occurring \nbetween the House and Senate leadership on the highway bill. We had \npassed in the Senate, as the Senator will recall, a fix which allowed \nflexibility so that some funds could be moved between accounts, if \nnecessary, to keep the Department of Transportation employees working. \nI think there was a transit accommodation. So I think it had about four \nparts.\n  During the day yesterday, they were meeting with their counterparts \nin the House. I was led to believe last night that they had come to an \nagreement and that agreement, whatever it is--I just can't give you the \ntotal outlines of it now--would be attached to either the omnibus \nappropriations bill or one of the appropriations bills that would be \ngoing to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So we will have a 6-month extension.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not sure. As I said, I don't know what they came up \nwith, but necessary actions to provide for safety, transit funds, and \nflexibility over some additional funds depending on what they agreed \nto, which I assume would take us to May 1.\n  But I do think, again, it is very important we have some deadline on \nthis. Otherwise, we will never bring this very important but very \ndifficult issue to a conclusion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. As one of the first orders of business when we turn to \nthe 6-year bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Which is what most of us would like to see, at least in \nthis Chamber. We have a problem on the House side; they only want a 6-\nmonth bill, but we want a 6-year bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Absolutely.\n  Do I have time?\n  If the Senator will allow me to respond--and I will yield the floor \nif you would like me to--the Senate, I believe, has acted very \nresponsibly on this in terms of the package we had before us, the 6-\nyear package within the budget. Obviously, there will be some important \namendments to be offered.\n  As the Senator is aware, it got tangled up on an unrelated issue, but \nthat issue will not be hanging over us on this bill when we come back.\n  What has me worried is I believe there are people really kind of \ninterested in dragging this out because they want to keep the formula \nas it now is. I think the existing formula is fundamentally unfair to \nStates like my own, and so I am very anxious for the Senate to keep the \npressure on to move a 6-year bill that comes up with a fairer formula \nbut also lives within budget constraints.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield just for a moment on that point?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield.\n\n[[Page S12437]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] raised a \nquestion about the highway issue. I just wanted to follow up briefly.\n  The Senator from Mississippi will recall that the chairman of the \ntransportation committee of the other side some many weeks ago \nindicated he would not even go to conference on a 6-year bill, and so \nwe got tangled up for a lot of reasons, including I think the desire of \nsome on the other side only to consider a 6-month bill. That pole \nvaults this into next year at some point when the Senator talks about \nMay 1. I understand and share with him the need to be some end date \nthat applies the pressure to say now we need to get the 6-year bill and \nget it done, because we cannot continue this approach of incremental \nfunding without some understanding by the States of what they have to \nwork with in the long run.\n  I have not had an opportunity to make contact or have discussions \nwith folks in the other body, but when they indicated an unwillingness \neven to go to conference if we come up with a 6-year bill, it suggests \nan approach radically different than most of us in the Senate would \nhave wanted.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is absolutely the case. But the problem they had in \nthe House--we both served in the House; we know what it is like--\nhighway infrastructure and transportation funds are very, very \nimportant in every State. This is not a partisan issue. This is an \nissue that divides us, some not really even by regions; States side by \nside can have a different view of the formula. And I think they pushed \nthe 6-month proposal because they could not get the votes for anything \nelse right then. But I think if the Senate does not show leadership and \nkeep the pressure on them, we will never get this issue resolved.\n  That is why I had not wanted to do anything akin to 6 months. I \nwanted us to have some basic flexibility so States could reprogram, \nmove funds around and make sure we had the safety fund but keep the \nheat on.\n  But I think the best thing that we could do on that right now is to \nmake sure there is not a short-term problem with availability of funds, \nrealizing that in the colder States you need to do contracting in \nDecember and perhaps early January to have those programs underway in \nthe spring.\n  But again, it is my intent for the Senate to go ahead and take up \nthis issue and address it early to put pressure on the House and also \nso that whenever they do get their act together and vote, we will be \nready for conference. But I do think it is irresponsible for a Member \non either side of the aisle, whether he or she be a chairman or not, to \nsay they are not going to go to conference with the other body if the \nother body doesn't pass a bill that they like. We have feifdoms around \nhere, but I believe we should not have that type of attitude or we will \nnever bring this important issue to a reasonable conclusion.\n  That is all I am pushing for. That is why I have tried to push this \nbill all this year. Frankly, in our own body I think our colleagues \nmade a mistake by letting it drag out to this fall. I thought it should \nhave been done last spring. I had a tentative schedule for the Senate \nto take it up in April of this year, last April. I know they had a hard \ntime working it out in committee, but to their credit they worked it \nout and brought out a good, broadly bipartisan bill.\n  It will be a focus that we need to work on and we need to do it \nearlier in the year, because if we wait until next September right \nbefore elections, there will be no way we can do it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the comments of the Senator \nfrom Mississippi. I really share his desire to move on this early next \nyear. I think the committee has done an exceptional job. I like the \nhighway bill they brought to the floor, the 6-year bill. If we can move \nsomething like that early next year, I think we will have provided some \nsignificant leadership. So I appreciate very much the leadership of the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12436-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today we are on the verge of a \nrevolution, the revolution of the transmission and distribution of \nelectricity that is fast bringing about competition and deregulation to \nboth the wholesale and retail level. Nowhere has the competitive model \nadvanced further than in the State of California, where full \nderegulation will become a reality at the beginning of 1998. As many as \n13 other States representing one-third of America have moved to \ncompetition in the electric industry. These are States with a \nsignificant population center.\n  On Saturday, November 8, I introduced legislation referred to the \nFinance Committee, and I believe that it will enhance the States' \nability to facilitate competition. The legislation arises from the \nEnergy Committee's intensive review of the electric power industry and \nfrom the Joint Tax Committee's report that I requested.\n\n  Over the past two Congresses, the committee has held 14 hearings and \nworkshops on competitive change in the electric power industry, \nreceiving testimony from more than 130 witnesses. One of the workshops \nspecifically focused on how public power utilities will participate in \nthe competitive marketplace. At these and in other forums, concerns \nhave been expressed by representatives of public power about the \npotential jeopardy to their tax-exempt bonds if they participate in \nState competitive programs, or if they transmit power pursuant to FERC \nOrder No. 888, or pursuant to a Federal Power Act section 211 \ntransmission order.\n  The Joint Tax Committee report, titled ``Federal Income Tax Issues \nArising in Connection with Proposal to Restructure the Electric Power \nIndustry,'' concluded that current tax laws effectively preclude public \npower utilities from participating in State open access restructuring \nplans without jeopardizing the tax-exempt status of their bonds. Under \nthe tax law, if the private use and interest restriction is violated, \nthe utility's bonds become retroactively taxable.\n  These concerns have been echoed by the FERC. For example, in FERC \nOrder No. 888, the Commission stated the reciprocal transmission \nservice by a municipal utility will not be required if providing such \nservice would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the municipal \nutility. A similar concern exists if FERC issues a transmission order \nunder section 211 of the Federal Power Act.\n  Mr. President, if consumers and businesses are to maximize the full \nbenefits of open competition in this industry it will be necessary for \nall electricity providers to interconnect their facilities into the \nentire electric grid. Unfortunately, this system efficiency is \nsignificantly impaired because of current\n\n[[Page S12438]]\n\ntax law rules that effectively preclude public power entities--entities \nthat financed their facilities with tax-exempt bonds--from \nparticipating in State open access restructuring plans and Federal \ntransmission programs, without jeopardizing the exempt status of their \nbonds.\n\n  No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become \nretroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in \na State open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial \nmarkets and could undermine the financial stability of many \nmunicipalities. At the same time, public power should not obtain a \ncompetitive advantage in the open marketplace based on the Federal \nsubsidy that flows from the ability to issue tax-exempt debt. Clearly \nwe must provide for the transition to allow public providers to enter \nthe private competitive marketplace without severe economic dislocation \nfor municipalities and consumers.\n  To remedy this dilemma, I have introduced legislation that will allow \nmunicipal utilities to interconnect and compete in the open marketplace \nwithout the draconian retroactive impacts currently required by the Tax \nCode. My bill is modeled after legislation that passed Congress last \nyear which addressed electricity and gas generation and distribution by \nlocal furnishers.\n  My bill removes the current law impediments to public power's \ncapacity to participate in open access plans if such entities are \nwilling to forego future use of federally subsidized tax-exempt \nfinancing. If public power entities make this election, and choose to \ncompete on a level playing field with other electric power suppliers, \ntax exemption of the interest on their outstanding debt will be \nunaffected. They will be allowed an extended period during which \noutstanding bonds subject to the private use restrictions may be \nretired instead of retroactive taxation, which is the situation under \nexisting law. The relief provided by my bill applies equally to \noutstanding bonds for electric generation, transmission, and \ndistribution facilities. This would occur 6 months after the date of \nthe bonds.\n  Mr. President, without this legislation, public power will face an \nuntenable choice: either stay out of the competitive marketplace or \nface the threat of retroactive taxability of their bonds. With this \nlegislation, public power will be able to transition into \nthe competitive marketplace.\n\n  Let me provide a few examples of real-world choices that public power \nfaces today. According to the Joint Tax Committee report, the mere act \nof transferring public power transmission lines to a privately operated \nindependent service operator [ISO] could cause the public entity's tax \nexempt bonds to be retroactively taxable. Similarly, a transfer of \ntransmission lines to a State operated ISO could, in many instances, \ntrigger similar retroactive loss of tax-exemption depending on the \namount or value of the power that is transmitted along those lines to \nprivate users. Moreover, participation in a State open access plan \ncould, de facto, force public power entities to take defensive actions \nto maintain their competitive position which could inevitably lead to \nretroactive taxation of their bonds. Such actions would include \noffering a discounted rate to selective customers or selling excess \ncapacity to a broker for resale under long-term contract at fixed rates \nor discounted rates.\n  I have also heard from the California Governor and members of the \nCalifornia Legislature about many of these problems and the need for \nlegislation to address them. I stand ready to work with them and \nrepresentatives from other States to solve this problem as part of the \nlegislation I have introduced.\n  Mr. President, my bill allows public power to participate in the new \ncompetitive world and provides a safe harbor within which they can \ntransition from tax-exempt financing to the level playing field of the \ncompetitive marketplace. In addition, the legislation recognizes that \nthere are some transactions that public power entities engage in that \nshould not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of their bonds under \ncurrent law and seeks to protect those transactions by codifying the \nrules governing them. This list may need to be expanded and I look \nforward to the input of the affected utilities in this regard.\n  In general, the exceptions contained in this bill closely parallel \nthe policies enunciated in the legislative history of the amendments \nmade in the 1986 Tax Reform Act. For example, the sale of electricity \nby one public power entity to another public power entity for resale by \nthe second public power entity would be exempt so long as the second \npublic power entity is not participating in a State open access plan. \nIn addition, a public power entity would be allowed to enter into \npooling and swap arrangements with other utilities if the public power \nentity is not a net seller of output, determined on an annual basis. \nFinally, the bill contains a de minimis exception for sale of excess \noutput by a facility when such sales do not exceed $1 million.\n  Mr. President, this legislation attempts to balance many competing \ninterests. This will be a difficult transition and this legislation \ndoes not address all the difficult problems to be faced. This is why I \nemphasize today that this is a starting point for discussion over the \nmonths ahead.\n  I look forward to receiving comments from all interested parties and \nwill encourage Finance Committee Chairman Roth to hold hearings on this \nbill early next year.\n  I am open to making revisions to this bill consistent with a public \npolicy that emphasizes a level playing field and a soft transition to \ncompetition for our important public utilities. I look forward \nespecially to working with the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, who has been a leader in addressing tax issues \nrelating to competition in this industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12437-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12438-S12439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            INTERMODAL SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I was very pleased that the Senate has \nacted on S. 1454 and want to commend Senators Chafee, Warner, Baucus, \nand Bond for coming up with this extension bill for the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA]. Despite the fact that \nthis temporary extension of ISTEA is just that--temporary--and \nobviously not a preferred way of doing business, I welcome it. I join \nin urging the House of Representatives to take it up and pass it. It \nwill provide a modicum of certainty for the States given that we were \nunable to pass S. 1173, the 6-year reauthorization of ISTEA.\n  We all know that ISTEA is an essential piece of legislation. It is \nprecisely because of its great importance and significance to every \nState that it generates controversy. Among the many controversial \nissues associated with the reauthorization are certain labor \nprovisions, safety and environmental concerns, and the always difficult \nissue of the distribution of highway funding.\n  Believe me, I am well aware of how difficult it is to build \nmajorities--and, in the case of ISTEA, a super-majority--on \ncontroversial legislation.\n  Let me say unequivocally for the record that I support the 6-year \nauthorization measure that Senator Chafee and the other members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee brought to the Senate floor last \nmonth. Though it would be hard to imagine any transportation funding \nbill being 100 percent perfect from the standpoint of any one State, \nthis bill was a solid bill and one I was pleased to support. In fact, I \nvoted for this bill four times in the form of four cloture votes.\n  But, Senator Chafee, despite his best efforts, was not allowed to \nmove this bill. Unfortunately, as we all know, ISTEA fell victim to the \nefforts of those on the other side of the aisle to force the Senate to \nact on another piece of legislation; namely, campaign finance reform.\n  Well, Mr. President, I am here to tell you that Utahns are indeed \ninterested in campaign finance reform. But, at the moment, with \nnumerous road construction projects underway, and facing a 2002 \ndeadline for the Winter Olympic Games, they are equally if not more \ninterested in ISTEA.\n  The people of every State in the Union are going to pay dearly for \nthe filibuster waged against ISTEA for the sake of campaign finance \nreform. They will be paying for it with bad roads, unrepaired bridges, \nand unimproved mass transit. They are going to pay for it with delays \nin making the necessary improvements.\n\n[[Page S12439]]\n\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee did its job. Senator Lott \ndid his job in calling the bill up for debate. But, it takes 60 votes \nto cut off a filibuster and pass a bill. We tried four times.\n  I am not enthusiastic about this short-term bill. It is a far cry \nfrom what we should have done earlier and what I hope we will do at our \nearliest opportunity next year.\n  But, we have to be realistic about where we are today. And we have to \nface the reality that the 6-year ISTEA reauthoritzation bill did not \npass this year. Under such circumstances, I think that the majority \nleader would have been entirely justified in not bringing up and \nfacilitating the passage of the short-term extension. He could easily \nsay to Senators that we should stew in our own juice.\n  So as a Senator from a State severely affected by the failure to move \nahead on ISTEA, I appreciate that he took the high road. The short-term \nbill will at least relieve the vulnerable position States would be in \nunder no ISTEA authority at all.\n  But, I want the people of Utah to know that I will be working hard in \nthe months ahead to support the Senator from Rhode Island and the \nSenator from Montana in the effort to get the 6-year ISTEA bill passed \nin the Senate and into conference with the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12438-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I rise today for the purpose of \nrecognizing the efforts of Derik Fettig, a legislative assistant on my \nstaff who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this session. With \nhis good humor and hard work, Derik has been a tremendous asset as we \nhave worked on issues impacting North Dakota.\n  A native of Bismarck, ND and graduate of Colorado College, Derik \njoined my Washington office in May 1995, and was immediately drawn into \nsome of the most important issues that confront our State. His \nportfolio--which includes water projects and disaster relief--bears \nwitness to the fact that he has served at a critical time in our \nState's history.\n  Derik played a pivotal role in the aftermath of this year's historic \ndisasters. He worked with the Corps of Engineers, as well as with the \ndifferent mayors and local officials up and down the Red River Valley, \nto address the daily crises associated with what was dubbed ``Blizzard \nHannah'' and the millennium flood. Even more significantly, he helped \ndesign and implement the Federal assistance strategy, which has \nprovided the groundwork for North Dakota's long road to recovery and \nmore than $770 million in Federal aid.\n  Derik has also been of great help with the ongoing water problems \nfacing North Dakota. He has worked to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment responds adequately to the unfolding tragedy in Devils Lake. \nIn addition, he has been the point person on my staff for producing a \nreformulated Garrison Diversion project. With Derik's able assistance, \nwe have forged an unprecedented political consensus among North \nDakota's elected political leadership on a revised plan to address the \nState's long-term water needs. And in the middle of all of this, he ran \nGrandma's Marathon in Duluth, MN.\n  We will miss you, Derik. I commend you for your tireless work and \nwish you the very best in your future endeavors.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, late last week the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, and I introduced broad-based \nelectricity restructuring legislation. Each of us spoke to that \nlegislation at that time. We expressed the belief that this first \nbipartisan approach to a major national issue facing the country would \ntrigger even more serious consideration than has been given during this \nfirst session of this Congress to that subject, and expressed the hope, \nwhich I repeat here, that it is an issue that will seriously be \nconsidered by both Houses of Congress during the course of the next \nyear.\n  One major portion of that bill, S. 1401, is a title dealing with the \nPacific Northwest fish and the management of the Columbia River system. \nI greatly appreciated Senator Bumpers' willingness to put his name on \nthose regional provisions, as he did in my case, I believe, with \nrespect to the provisions dealing with the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  This morning I wish to speak briefly on the fish and wildlife issues \nthat are a part of S. 1401. The bill does not address, Mr. President, \nexcept in the most general way, the critical need for an improved \n``river governance'' process, especially with respect to issues \nrelating to fish and wildlife. This omission should not be \nmisinterpreted. Legislation may well be needed in this area to assure \nthat the multiple purposes of the Federal power system are protected \ntogether with the public benefits that they bring.\n  I hope that over the next several months the region can reach a \nconsensus on these issues, including who pays the costs associated with \nneeded actions. Bonneville ratepayers currently fund this effort \nthrough their power rates at a cost of $435 million a year on average, \nand their ability to make additional contributions to this effort and \nstill meet other statutory obligations is increasingly constrained by \nan increasingly competitive, deregulated wholesale electric energy \nmarket. In forging a financing package, it will be important to look to \nall who benefit from this important natural resource to assume their \nfair share of financial responsibility, and to act consistently with \nsound business principles by holding administrative costs to as low a \nlevel as possible.\n  Money alone, however, is not the answer. Today, the salmon recovery \neffort is failing. It is failing because of a flawed process for \ndecisionmaking. This process has conflicting goals. It disperses \ndecisionmaking authority among many Federal and State agencies and \ntribes and has little accountability for cost effective results.\n  To make real progress, we need a regional plan; a plan in which all \ngovernmental interests--States, tribes, and the Federal Government--are \npartners, together with economic and environmental interests, for \nsuccess. And success will mean the achievement of clearly defined goals \nmeasured by unambiguous results; results that rely on the best science \nof how to improve the survival of downstream smolts and that assure \nadequate escapement of returning adults to the spawning beds.\n  All northwesterners care about our salmon resources. We argue \nsometimes about the best way to reach our shared goals but it is vital \nto remember that we share the goal of preserving and\n\n[[Page S12440]]\n\nprotecting our anadromous and resident fish and wildlife while also \nproviding a reasonable and continuing harvest for Columbia River \ntribes, commercial fishermen, and sports anglers.\n  I will continue to listen to the stakeholders interested in a \ncomprehensive approach. I am aware that the region's Governors and \ntheir transition board may look to a group of ``three sovereigns''--\nFederal, State, and tribal--to construct such a framework, together \nwith other economic and environmental stakeholders. This and other \ncreative thinking on how to maintain both the economic and public \nbenefits of the Bonneville system will be critical to Congress as we \nmove forward with this legislative package.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been considerable discussion \non the Senate floor in the last week in the matter of the fast-track \nlegislation, as we refer to it, about the trade deficit and the size of \nthe present deficit and the projections that it will increase.\n  It has been suggested that this deficit began to take form in the \ncontext of the 1974 legislation providing fast-track authority to the \nPresident, and that to extend that authority would only be to continue \nand deepen that deficit.\n  My very good friend from Maryland has been I think of this view. My \ncolleague and friend from North Dakota has proposed a commission to \nlook into the whole matter, which can do no harm as long as we keep to \nthe economics of this matter as it is now understood.\n  Many persons have opposed fast-track legislation because of the \ndeficit, and it seems to me necessary, useful to put into the Record \nthe fact that these are not in fact connected any more than in 1974 the \nfast-track authority represented some break in the Executive role in \ntrade. It did not. From 1934 on, since the time of the Reciprocal Trade \nAgreements Act, the President has had one form or another of \nnegotiating authority delegated to him by the Congress in the aftermath \nof the fearsome experience of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, when \nwe brought a tariff bill to the Senate floor and in the end disabled \nour own economy, or helped to do, and set the world economy into a \ndownward spiral. If you would list five events that led to the Second \nWorld War, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 would be one. And we \nhave not had a tariff bill in the Chamber as such since 1930. We have \nproceeded in this mode, through periods of trade surpluses, trade \ndeficits and relatively evenly balanced accounts.\n  The most important thing to state is that the current trade deficit \nis not a result of trade policy. It is a result of budget policy. It is \na result of the decisions which I think now are behind us in which \nduring a long 15 year period we incurred an enormous national debt in \nconsequence of a long sequence of very large budget deficits. This is \nnot to say that the budget deficit is the only determinant of trade \ndeficit, but it is the key indicator of the matter because it is the \nrelationship between domestic savings, which until this year has been \nsubstantially reduced by annual Federal deficits in excess of $100 \nbillion, and domestic investment.\n  That is the key, but not only factor in the sense of which, as \neconomists would say, the trade deficit is a dependent variable. I have \na chart to make this point. It is not any more complicated than most of \nthe charts we bring to the floor these days in the age of television.\n  In 1975, the United States was a creditor nation. We owned net \nforeign assets of some $74 billion. By 1996, we had become a debtor \nnation with a worldwide negative net investment of $871 billion. You go \nfrom a surplus to being a net debtor in the amount of almost $1 \ntrillion. Foreign investors have more capital in the United States than \nwe have abroad on balance, and that reflects the increase in our \nFederal debt.\n  In 1975, we had a Federal debt of $395 billion. In 1996, we had a \nFederal debt of $3.733 trillion. The net result was a trade deficit in \na manner that is entirely predictable. What we understand about \neconomics, the general consensus of economists is such that if you were \nto propose that such a change in net budget deficits would take place, \nthe economics profession overwhelmingly would say then your trade \nbalances will change in the same direction.\n  It is also clear that foreign persons will end up with the dollars \nthat we need to borrow. Given that our savings rate is so low because \nour deficits are so high, foreign persons will end up with dollars to \nlend us only if they export more to us than we export to them.\n  Last week it was noted on the floor that an October 1997 report \nentitled ``The Trade Deficit: Where Does It Come From And What Does It \nDo?'' by Peter Morici, of the Economic Strategy Institute, a group \nfounded in 1989, in effect challenged the traditional mainstream \neconomic view that trade deficits are closely related to the imbalance \nbetween domestic savings and domestic investment. Again, I say, Mr. \nPresident, it is the mainstream view of economists that this is a \npattern that is almost automatic; that the trade deficit is a dependent \nvariable related to the level of domestic savings.\n  I am not going to argue, dispute the fact that the causes of the \ntrade deficit are complex. To quote from Dr. Morici's report, he says, \n``History seems to confirm the importance of multidirectional \ncausality.''\n  Here is an able economist looking at the conventional wisdom, which I \nhave been setting forth, and saying, ``No, matters are more complex \nthan that,'' which one welcomes. That is how any science, any field of \ninquiry advances. When persons challenge the accepted judgment of the \ntime, sometimes a new paradigm emerges.\n  But, in arguing the importance of multidirectional causality, Dr. \nMorici does not deny the importance of the deficits of the early \n1980's. He writes.\n\n       . . . the combination of Reagan Administration tax cuts and \n     new defense spending increased the combined government \n     current and capital account deficit from $34 billion in 1981 \n     to about $146 billion in 1983, and the demands imposed by the \n     U.S. Treasury on capital markets drove U.S. interest rates \n     well above German and Japanese levels.\n       High U.S. interest rates served the purpose of attracting \n     foreign private investment to finance growing U.S. government \n     deficits. * * *\n\n  I will take the liberty of repeating that sentence: ``High U.S. \ninterest rates served the purpose of attracting foreign private \ninvestment to finance growing U.S. government deficits.''\n\n       In turn, these foreign private capital flows created much \n     increased demand for dollars in foreign-exchange markets and \n     the real exchange rate for the dollar rose more than 50 \n     percent. In large part, it was the appreciation of the dollar \n     that caused the trade deficit to rise from $16 billion in \n     1981 to more than $100 billion a year from 1984 to 1988.\n\n  Dr. Morici's analysis points to the causality. It may be more complex \nthan we now suppose, but basically, if you have as large a budget \ndeficit as we ran in the 1980's, you will raise interest rates, your \ndollar will appreciate, and the result is a trade deficit.\n  Earlier, I was commenting with my friend from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, that the strong dollar of the 1980's seemed to many people a \nstatement that somehow we had a strong economy. Just the opposite. And \nSenator Levin suggested, if we can, we get rid of that usage ``strong \ndollar'' or ``weak dollar' as if they were some reflection on the \ngeneral state of the economy as against the price of money, which is \nwhat it is all about.\n  What has puzzled many is why the process has not reversed since we \nhave brought the deficit down. Why hasn't the trade deficit declined as \nthe budget deficit has declined? This is a fair question. However, \neconomists have never argued that budget deficits caused trade deficits \nbut, rather, that trade deficits result when domestic saving is not \nsufficient to support domestic investment.\n  In the early 1980's, it was easy to identify the huge Federal budget \ndeficits as the source of the savings shortfall. Now it is more \ncomplex, but let me note several factors. We have a strong economy with \nexpansion now in its seventh year. For the first time in\n\n[[Page S12441]]\n\n10 years the growth of real gross domestic product has averaged more \nthan 4 percent for four quarters. Not unexpectedly, with a strong \neconomy straining at full employment, investment has increased over the \npast 5 years from about 9 percent of GDP to 10 percent as firms strive \nto meet demands by adding new plants. At the same time--and here is a \nmystery for which you will find no explanation on the part of this \nSenator--at the same time, private saving has declined from about 16 \npercent of GDP to about 15 percent during this period. That is why, \nduring the period 1992 to the present, the trade deficit as a \npercentage of GDP has not declined, even as the budget deficit has \nfallen dramatically.\n\n  In an op-ed article last month in the Wall Street Journal, Robert \nEisner, a distinguished professor emeritus at Northwestern University \nand former president of the American Economic Association, reminded us \nof the gains from trade that accrue to all nations. He wrote:\n\n       The U.S. has the mightiest economy in the world, and \n     generally the most productive. The classical economic law of \n     comparative advantage, going back to David Ricardo, tells us \n     that, even if a country is more productive than other \n     countries in all areas, it can gain from trade. It does so by \n     specializing in those industries in which it has the greatest \n     advantage, and exporting their products. It then imports from \n     others the products of industries on which it has a lesser \n     advantage.\n\n  Even though there is an advantage in both cases, you maximize by \nconcentrating on the most pronounced.\n  As Professor Eisner notes, the United States has the mightiest \neconomy in the world. We are in a period of unprecedented economic \nexpansion with real growth at 4 percent; unemployment at 4.7 percent, a \n24-year low; measured inflation of about 2 percent and a budget deficit \nrapidly approaching zero. Our economy is the envy of Western Europe and \nJapan. On average, G-7 countries have roughly half our growth rate and \nhalf again as much unemployment.\n  While undesirable in the long run, our trade deficit has not \nundermined our economy. As the chart makes clear, there appears to be \nno relationship between the size of the trade deficit and the \nunemployment rate. The unemployment rate has gone up and down, up and \ndown. It was very high in the early 1980's when the interest rates were \nvery high, and the Federal Reserve Board undertook to break the \ninflation at the time, and now down to the lowest level in 24 years. In \nthe meantime, this trade deficit has grown. But as should be very clear \nfrom this chart, there is no relation one to the other. It is not a \ncausal relationship of any kind. At least, it has not been established \nas such, and I do not think it is possible to do so.\n  U.S. industrial production increased 18 percent from 1992 to 1996. \nOver the same period, U.S. manufactured goods exports increased 42 \npercent, agricultural exports grew by 40 percent, and service exports \nby 26 percent. These are not the signs of economic weakness, \nnotwithstanding the trade deficit.\n  Finally, I make the point that if there is one cloud over the horizon \nwith respect to the trade deficit, it is the looming retirement of the \nbaby boom generation. With this in mind, I agree that it would be \npreferable to run trade surpluses to accumulate assets abroad so that \nthe burden of financing the retirement of the baby boom generation can \nin part be financed with earnings from those foreign assets. Last week \nI introduced a Senate resolution which resolved that:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) any unified budget surpluses that might arise in the \n     current expansion should be used to reduce the Federal debt \n     held by the public; and\n       (2) to achieve this goal during this economic expansion \n     that there be no net tax cut or new spending that is not \n     offset by reductions in spending on other programs or tax \n     increases.\n\n  Adoption of that resolution and the policies it suggests will \nincrease national savings, as we should during an expansion phase of \nthe business cycle. Even if one believes, as the Economic Strategy \nInstitute report suggests, that mainstream economic theory does not \nadequately explain the trade deficit, that view does not require one to \noppose fast track. In fact, Mr. Clyde Prestowitz, president of the \nEconomic Strategy Institute, supports this legislation. In an op-ed \narticle in the Washington Post last month, Prestowitz wrote:\n\n       Congress must give the President fast track. It is \n     inconceivable that the United States will not be at the table \n     when the globalization cards are dealt.\n\n  Inconceivable last week. Very near to probable today, I have to say \nwith great regret. But it is a point to be made that in the U.S. \nSenate, by 2-to-1 margins, we have supported fast track, and should \nthere be a change of spirit in the other body, we will be here in that \nsame position, hoping to be of service and knowing the consequences of \nfailure on all our parts.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Prestowitz \narticle be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 9, 1997]\n\n                        Keeping On Top Of Trade\n\n                         (By Clyde Prestowitz)\n\n       President Clinton needs the ``fast-track'' authority he has \n     requested from Congress to keep the United States involved in \n     the critical international negotiations that are reshaping \n     the world economy. But to persuade reluctant members of \n     Congress to go along and to be able to negotiate effectively, \n     he also needs to articulate a comprehensive, concrete global \n     action plan.\n       Today's trade negotiations are akin to the arms talks of \n     the Cold War era, for in the age of geo-economics they will \n     determine the balance of power just as surely as did the \n     political and military bargaining of the past. The United \n     States must be at the table when the deals are being done.\n       Just as important, however, is the ability to deal \n     intelligently from a position of strength and to ensure \n     actual fulfillment of bargains once they are struck. So far \n     the fast-track debate has focused on whether or not the \n     president should be compelled to demand adherence to certain \n     environmental and labor standards by our trading partners. \n     These are no doubt important issues and worthy of debate, but \n     they are likely to be irrelevant if the United States is not \n     equipped to analyze, negotiate, monitor, finance and enforce \n     potential deals as well as its trading partners.\n       In the past, this has not always been the case, and as the \n     administration now requests authority to enter the most \n     complex trade talks it has ever attempted with China, Latin \n     America and the World Trade Organization, the shape of the \n     U.S. global economic team and effort can only be described as \n     anemic.\n       For example, the President's Commission on Trade and \n     Investment in Asia, on which I served as vice chairman, \n     reported in April that despite rapidly rising exports, U.S. \n     firms are actually losing market share in Asian markets \n     because U.S. exports are not keeping up with market growth. \n     Indeed, during the past 10 years, the growth of European \n     exports to Asia has far outstripped that of U.S. exports. \n     Reasons for this were found to be inadequate. Export-Import \n     Bank financing, the virtual elimination of U.S. aid donations \n     in the region, the absence of U.S. concessionary loans, the \n     closure of consulates and inadequate staffing of business-\n     promotion positions at U.S. embassies.\n       Beyond these inadequacies in Asia is the fact that the U.S. \n     international economic team in Washington is too lean to be \n     mean. In the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, only \n     two professionals make up the staff of the section dealing \n     with all of the negotiations with China. The Commerce \n     Department's China office has only four people left after \n     recent budget cuts. The trade representative's Japan office \n     also has only two people to deal with the enormous range of \n     issues that continually arise with Japan. Six attorneys \n     struggle to keep on top of the 36 cases the United States is \n     currently litigating in the World Trade Organization.\n       Another example of U.S. organizational weakness became \n     apparent last year when the American Chamber of Commerce in \n     Japan conducted an evaluation of all the various trade \n     agreements between the United States and Japan over the past \n     20 years. This turned out to be a more difficult task than \n     initially anticipated because chamber officers could find no \n     one in the U.S. government who had even a list of all the \n     deals--much less any idea of whether their terms actually \n     were being observed. After the chamber complied its own list \n     and polled industry negotiators, along with current and past \n     government negotiators, it concluded that, of 45 agreements, \n     only 13 were being fully implemented. Based on its review, \n     the chamber made several recommendations regarding how to \n     achieve better success in future negotiations. Among other \n     things it called for concrete, measurable objectives, better \n     industry and country knowledge and language skills among U.S. \n     negotiators, and persistent follow-up of agreements once \n     made. With the U.S. trade deficit with Japan exploding again, \n     these recommendations take on added urgency.\n       Congress must give the president fast track. It is \n     inconceivable that the United States will not be at the table \n     when the globalization cards are dealt. But the United States \n     also must have the means and a plan to mount a serious \n     international economic\n\n[[Page S12442]]\n\n     effort rather than simply negotiating agreements that are not \n     enforced and that no one remembers.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, on the last day in October, Senator \nThompson announced that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was \nsuspending its campaign finance hearings in part because the committee \ndid not have the caliber of witnesses and information to justify \ncontinuing the hearings.\n  Mr. President, the Democrats on the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwere promised 3 days of hearings during September or October on a \nnumber of unexamined issues involving important events during the 1996 \nelections. Had that commitment been kept, one of the days would have \nbeen spent looking at the largest single transfer from a political \nparty to a tax-exempt organization in the history of American \npolitics--$4.6 million, which the Republican National Committee gave to \nAmericans for Tax Reform in October 1996, the final month before the \n1996 elections.\n  As this chart shows, over two-thirds of the money which ATR received \nin 1996, this tax-exempt organization, over two-thirds of that money \ncame from the Republican National Committee. The size of this transfer \nis unprecedented. There is no record of an American political party \ngiving even $1 million to a tax-exempt organization, much less four \ntimes that amount.\n  If the Democratic National Committee had given $4.6 million to a \nlabor union or environmental group in the month before the 1996 \nelections, I have no doubt that there would have been a searching \ninvestigation of the facts, if not full scale public hearings--and it \nwould have been totally appropriate. But here--where the money was paid \nby the RNC to a tax-exempt group whose efforts were aimed at attacking \nDemocrats--not a single hearing witness was called. Worse, the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee failed to interview a single person from \neither the Republican National Committee or Americans for Tax Reform \nabout this transfer. Given its mandate, the Committee's failure to \ninvestigate the $4.6 million was a highly partisan act which denied the \nSenate and the American public important information.\n  But even without depositions or interviews or testimony, there is \nenough evidence through publicly available documents and the limited \ndocument production by the RNC, ATR, and some banks to piece together \nthe outline of a coordinated campaign effort involving ATR that appears \nto circumvent hard and soft money restrictions, to duck disclosure, and \nto misuse ATR's tax-exempt status--all of which calls out for an \nappropriate investigation by the Department of Justice and the Treasury \nDepartment.\n  Let's begin with what was said at the time about the $4.6 million \ntransfer. In public statements, both RNC Chairman Haley Barbour and ATR \nPresident Grover Norquist denied that the money transfer was part of \nany coordinated effort between the two organizations. Mr. Barbour told \nthe Washington Post on October 29, 1996, that ``he had no understanding \nwith Norquist about how the money would be spent,'' while Mr. Norquist \ntold the press that he had made ``no specific commitment'' to the RNC \non how ATR would use the money. In short, the two principals would have \nthe American public believe that in the final weeks before election day \n1996, the RNC gave away $4.6 million to a supposedly nonpartisan, \nindependent organization with no understanding or expectation as to how \nthat money would be used.\n  Not only does common sense tell us that this is unlikely, but the \nfacts and documents behind this transaction indicate that it simply was \nnot so.\n  Let's look at what was happening around the time the money transfer \ntook place. For months prior to election day, Haley Barbour and the RNC \nhad been complaining about a television ad campaign funded by organized \nlabor and others criticizing the Republican Party on the issue of \nMedicare. The RNC and Haley Barbour were telling anyone who would \nlisten that the ads were distorting the facts and that Republicans were \nnot out to cut Medicare. And yet, the RNC waited until October, the \nfinal month before the election, to start spending funds to respond to \nthose ads. Here is Haley Barbour, at an October 25, 1996, press \nconference, explaining the RNC's decision to delay spending:\n\n       [W]e made the decision not to borrow money last year or \n     early this year in order to try to compete with the unions \n     and the other liberal special-interest groups' spending. You \n     see, our campaigns do come into the real election season \n     late September and October without having spent all the \n     money that--to match what the unions were doing. And you \n     will see us--you are seeing now, and have been throughout \n     the month of October, you are seeing Republicans using the \n     resources that we've raised in voluntary contributions to \n     finish very strong, to make sure our message is in front \n     of voters when they are making their voting decisions.\n\n  What steps was the RNC taking to ensure that its message was in front \nof voters when they are making their voting decisions in October? One \nstep was to funnel $4.6 million in soft money to ATR which used the \nmoney on a massive direct mail and phone bank operation, targeting 150 \ncongressional districts with 19 million pieces of mail and 4 million \nphone calls.\n  The subject of the ATR mailings and phone calls was just what Haley \nBarbour referred to in his statement to the press--Medicare. The title \nof one ATR mailing says it all: ``Straight Facts About You, Medicare \nand the November 5 Election.'' This mailing urged senior citizens to \nignore political scare tactics and stated ``[t]here's barely a \ndifference between the Republican Medicare Plan and President Clinton's \nMedicare Proposal.''\n  Did the RNC know what ATR was going to do with the $4.6 million? \nHaley Barbour and Grover Norquist told the American public no, but \nlet's look at a document produced by the RNC entitled, ``Memorandum for \nthe Field Dogs.'' I ask unanimous consent that this document and others \nI will mention in my statement be included in the record after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. LEVIN. This ``Memorandum for the Field Dogs'' is a document \nwhich, again, came from the files of the Republican National Committee \nand states the following in its entirety:\n\n       Re: Outside Mail and Phone effort,\n       Attached is a rotten copy of the 1st of 3 mail piece[s] \n     that will be sent to 150 selected\n\n[[Page S12443]]\n\n     congressional districts it will be directed at [sic], ``a map \n     of which has been included for your viewing pleasure.''\n       We discussed this effort during Wednesday's conference \n     call.\n       This is an effort undertaken by Americans for Tax Reform. \n     They are attempting to warn seniors about Democrat Mediscare \n     tactics. . .''\n\n  This memo to the field personnel provides clear evidence that the RNC \nhad advance information about ATR's mailing effort. It shows that the \nRNC had a copy of ATR's first direct mail piece even before it was sent \nout. In the words of the memo, attached is a copy of the first of three \nmail piece[s] that will be sent.\n  It shows that the RNC knew it was the first of three mailings, and \nthat it was being sent, not to specified cities or counties or zip \ncodes, but to specified Federal Congressional districts--150 \ncongressional districts to be exact--that it will be directed at. And \nto ensure that RNC field personnel knew precisely which districts had \nbeen targeted, the memo includes a map * * * for your viewing pleasure.\n  The fact that the mailing targeted congressional districts, rather \nthan cities or zip codes, shows clearly an election-related intent. The \nfact that this information was communicated to RNC field personnel \ndoing election-related work at the time is more evidence. The memo also \nstates that RNC field personnel had discussed the effort undertaken by \nAmericans for Tax Reform in a previous Wednesday's conference call. Any \nfair reading of this memo throws cold water on the claim that there was \nno understanding between the RNC and ATR about what ATR was doing.\n  But, one may ask, what evidence is there that the RNC knew when it \ngave ATR the $4.6 million how ATR intended to spend it? Again, let's \nlook at the facts and the documents.\n  First, let's look at an October 29, 1996 invoice sent to ATR by the \nJohn Grotta Co. This is the company that actually managed the direct \nmail and phone bank effort for ATR in October 1996. It is a company, I \nmight add, that has also run direct mail campaigns on behalf of the RNC \nand is owned by an individual--John Grotta--who is a former western \npolitical director for the RNC. The invoice shows that ATR owed John \nGrotta various amounts at various times throughout October 1996. The \ngrand total owed to the company, not including postage for the \nmailings, was $3,325,498.60.\n\n  Based on an analysis of ATR's bank records, which are in Committee \nfiles, on October 1, 1996, ATR had a total in its two bank accounts of \n$294,078.50--a tenth of the cost of the direct mail-phone bank effort.\n  Lo and behold, though, in October 1996 the RNC began pumping money \ndirectly into one of ATR's bank accounts. The $4.6 million total would \nprove more than enough to pay for the direct mail-phone bank effort. \nWhat a coincidence. Or was it?\n  A closer look shows that the $4.6 million was, in fact, not one \ndonation, but four payments spread throughout the month of October. And \nif we compare the timing of each payment to the billing dates for the \ndirect mail-phone bank operation, we find that each donation came at a \nvery convenient moment for ATR.\n  According to the invoice, ATR owed John Grotta an initial payment of \n$195,177.50 on October 7, 1996. On October 4, 1996, three days before \nthat initial payment was due, the RNC gave $2 million to ATR. The RNC \ndidn't write a check to ATR--it wired the funds directly into ATR's \nbank account. Five days later, on October 9, ATR paid its bill to John \nGrotta.\n  Two weeks after that, ATR faced another $1,313,677.40 in bills owed \nto John Grotta. These bills were due on October 18 and October 22. And \nwhat should happen on October 17, but that the RNC provided a second, \nwell-timed donation to ATR--this time in the amount of $1 million. \nAgain, this money was wired directly into ATR's account. Within days of \nreceiving it, ATR paid John Grotta $1,418,544.38.\n  ATR had another John Grotta bill due on October 24, 1996--this one in \nthe amount of $1,104,000. On October 23, 1996, however, the total in \nATR's bank account was $216,344.93. But once again, ATR got the money \nit needed. On October 25, 1996, the RNC made a third well-timed \ndonation to ATR--$1 million wired into ATR's account. Within hours of \nreceiving this donation, ATR paid John Grotta $1,104,000.\n  One week later, at the end of the month, ATR faced another John \nGrotta bill due in the amount of $607,776.72. On the day before that \nbill was due, the total in ATR's bank account was only $70,085.65. But \non the next day, the very day that the $607,000 bill was due, the RNC \nwired ATR a fourth and final, well-timed donation--in the amount of \n$600,000. Within 2 hours of receiving the RNC donation, ATR paid off \nits bill to John Grotta.\n  Are we supposed to believe that the timing and amounts of RNC \npayments to ATR, when compared to the billing dates and amounts owed by \nATR to John Grotta, were mere coincidence? Are we supposed to believe \nthat the RNC's $600,000 payment just in time to pay a $600,000 bill was \nsheer luck--a $600,000 coincidence? And that there was no coordination \nor understanding as to how the RNC money would be used by ATR?\n  That's what Haley Barbour and Grover Norquist told the American \npublic. But let's look past those statements to some other things Mr. \nBarbour and Mr. Norquist have said. In a news conference at RNC \nheadquarters on October 29, 1996, Mr. Barbour was asked about the RNC's \n$4.6 million donation to ATR. Here's what he said:\n\n       We made a contribution to Americans for Tax Reform, which \n     is a conservative, low-tax organization. You'll see in our \n     FEC report now and at the end of the year that we've made \n     contributions to a number of organizations that are like-\n     minded, share our views, promote our ideas.\n  Then he went on to say the following:\n\n       As you know, when we do advertising, when we do advocacy, \n     no matter what we do, we typically have to pay for it, either \n     totally with FEC dollars or a mixture of FEC and non-FEC \n     dollars. While our fundraising among small donors has been \n     nothing short of spectacular, we often find ourselves in the \n     position where we cannot match up non-FEC funds with enough \n     FEC funds.\n\n  Those are the key words, ``We find ourselves in the position where we \ncannot match up non-FEC funds with enough FEC funds.'' To put it in \nwords which are more familiar to the American public, ``We cannot match \nup soft money with enough hard money.''\n  Haley Barbour went on to say at that press conference:\n\n       So, when we came to that point, we decided we would \n     contribute to several groups who are like-minded and whose \n     activities we think, while they're not specifically \n     political, we think are good for the environment for us.\n\n  In an article in the Washington Post on February 9, 1997, again \nreferring to the RNC contribution to ATR, Mr. Barbour was quoted as \nsaying that groups like ATR `` `have more credibility' in pushing a \npolitical message than the parties themselves.'' So here we have Mr. \nBarbour saying that the RNC gave ATR $4.6 million in soft money, \nbecause it didn't have enough matching hard dollars to allow the RNC to \ndo the advertising itself, and further saying that having groups like \nATR do the political advertising provides more credibility than having \nthe RNC do it itself. And yet Mr. Barbour claims that he had no \nunderstanding with ATR as to how the RNC's contributions to ATR would \nbe used?\n  Then there are Mr. Norquist's statements. When asked to comment on \nthe $4.6 million, Mr. Norquist told the Washington Post on December 10, \n1996, ``We just ramped up on stuff we were going to do anyway. They, \nthe RNC, the conservative movement, knew the projects we were working \non.''\n  The facts and documents indicate that the RNC was using ATR as a \nsurrogate to do what the RNC itself had neither the hard dollars or the \ncredibility to do on its own. Such actions raise questions about \nwhether the RNC was deliberately circumventing hard money requirements \nas well as disclosure requirements. They also raise questions about \nwhether the RNC was deliberately misusing a supposedly nonpartisan, \nindependent tax exempt organization to promote the RNC's campaign \nagenda.\n  Americans for Tax Reform is a 501(c)(4) organization that is exempt \nfrom taxation. A (c)(4) organization is supposed to be engaged in \nsocial welfare that promotes the common good and general welfare of the \npeople of the community. Social welfare organizations may not engage in \ncampaign-related activity as their primary activity. The relevant Tax \nCode regulation\n\n[[Page S12444]]\n\n1.501(c)(4)-1 describes the prohibited activity as ``direct or indirect \nparticipation or intervention in political campaigns on behalf of or in \nopposition to any candidate for public office.'' An analysis of ATR's \nbank records for 1996 indicates, however, that the $4.6 million that \nthe RNC provided was more than two-thirds of ATR's income. The fact \nthat RNC funds outmatched ATR's other funding by a 2-1 margin raises \nthe issue of whether the RNC funding made electioneering ATR's dominant \npursuit in violation of its tax exempt status.\n  The tax abuse issue doesn't end there. Up to this point, for \nsimplicity's sake, I've been referring only to Americans for Tax \nReform, the 501(c)(4) organization. But ATR has an affiliate, run by \nGrover Norquist out of the same office, called the Americans for Tax \nReform Foundation. This foundation is a 501(c)(3) organization which is \nprohibited by Federal tax law from engaging in any campaign activity.\n  But it turns out that the foundation was very much engaged in the \ndirect mail-phone bank operation and served as a second conduit for RNC \nfunds spent on that operation. Of the $4.6 million provided by the RNC, \nATR actually transferred about $2.3 million to the foundation which, in \nturn, paid almost half the direct mail-phone bank bills. In effect \nthen, the RNC funneled soft money through two tax exempt \norganizations--one a 501(c)(4) and one a 501(c)(3)--to pay for an \nadvocacy effort it could not do on its own due to a lack of matching \nhard dollars. ATR paid approximately $1.8 million for the operation, \nwhile the ATR Foundation paid approximately $1.5 million.\n\n  How do we know? Believe me, Mr. President, it wasn't easy to find \nout. The committee subpoena for ATR bank records was intended to cover \nthe ATR Foundation, and the bank was willing to produce the \nfoundation's records, but felt it could not do so under the wording of \nthe subpoena without ATR's consent. When the minority asked ATR to \nallow the bank to produce ATR Foundation records, ATR refused. And when \nSenator Glenn asked the committee chairman to issue a new subpoena to \nthe bank explicitly requesting ATR Foundation records, the request was \nignored. So we were forced to piece together the foundation's role from \nthe documents we already had.\n  To make a long story short, we followed the money. On October 4, \n1996, the RNC wired $2 million to ATR. On October 17, the RNC wired \nanother $1 million to ATR. The next day--October 18--ATR transferred \n$508,000 to the ATR Foundation. Four days after that--on October 22--\nATR transferred another $851,000 to the ATR Foundation. On October 25, \nthe RNC wired yet another $1 million to ATR. That very day ATR \ntransferred $1 million to the ATR Foundation. The result is a pattern \nof RNC money coming into ATR and then being used by ATR either to pay \nthe direct mail-phone bank bills directly, or going an extra step of \nbeing passed by ATR to the ATR Foundation which then paid bills. What \nmakes this pattern all the more intriguing is that ATR bank records for \nthe year-and-a-half preceding October 1996 do not include a single \nmonth in which ATR transferred money to its foundation. Yet in October \n1996, ATR gave its foundation over $2 million.\n  Why did ATR take this extra step and involve its foundation? We'd \nlike to ask Mr. Norquist, but so far have been denied any opportunity \nto do so.\n  How do we know, then, that the foundation used RNC funds to help pay \nfor the direct mail-phone bank effort? We found two types of evidence. \nFirst, comparing the October 29 John Grotta invoice to ATR bank records \nshows that, for every recorded bill payment but two there is a \ncorresponding wire transfer from ATR's bank account to John Grotta. The \ntwo exceptions are two bill payments that were both shown as made on \nOctober 25, 1996--one in the amount of $468,000 and one in the amount \nof $1,104,000. Both payments are shown on the invoice as having been \nmade by ATR, but there is no corresponding wire transfer from ATR's \nbank account. However, both payments were made after ATR had \ntransferred over $2 million to the ATR Foundation. Common sense tells \nus that the foundation must have paid the bills on ATR's behalf. Of \ncourse, having been denied access to ATR Foundation bank records, we \ndon't have the bank records documenting foundation payments to Grotta. \nHowever, we do have one of the mailings that this money paid for. And \nright there, in black and white, underneath the heading ``Straight Talk \nAbout You, Medicare & the November 5 Election'' are the words, ``Paid \nfor by AMERICANS FOR TAX REFORM FOUNDATION.''\n  The documents and public statements of Mr. Barbour and Mr. Norquist \nindicate that RNC soft money went through ATR and ATR's 501(c)(3) \nfoundation and paid for a direct mail-phone bank operation that, if the \nRNC had done it directly, would have required either all hard money or \na hard money-soft money split. Was the RNC laundering money through the \nATR affiliates to avoid having to use any hard money to pay for the \nmailings and telephone calls? Was the RNC funnelling payments through \nthe ATR affiliates to capitalize on ATR's greater credibility? Was the \nRNC knowingly misusing ATR's tax exempt status by causing \nelectioneering to become the primary activity of the (c)(4) \norganization and by passing funds through a (c)(3) foundation that is \nprohibited from engaging in campaign activity? The evidence is powerful \nand should have been explored at a committee hearing.\n  There's more. The RNC's $4.6 million paid for more than the John \nGrotta direct mail-phone bank operation which cost about $3.3 million \nplus postage. Although Mr. Norquist told the Washington Post on \nDecember 10, 1996, that ATR ``didn't do televised issue ads,'' the \nevidence is overwhelming that ATR did. One ad, of which we have a \nvideotaped copy, attacked then-Representative Robert Torricelli, the \nDemocratic candidate for Senate in New Jersey for allegedly missing \nvotes. A company called Title Wave sent ATR an invoice for $8,524 to \nproduce the ad, which was called ``Torricelli/`Missing'.'' Invoices \nfrom Mentzer Media Services, Inc., charged ATR $325,230 for a media buy \nin New York/New Jersey media markets and another $56,656.25 for media \nbuys in Philadelphia/New Jersey media markets to keep the ad on the air \nduring the month of October right up to November 4, the day before the \nelection.\n  RNC funds delivered to ATR were used to pay for the ad. On October 4, \n1996, the same day it received $2 million from the RNC, ATR wrote a \n$4,000 check to Title Wave as partial payment on the ad's production \ncosts. Two weeks later, ATR wrote a $4,900 check to a company called \nSoundwave. The memo at the bottom of the check stated that it was \npayment on an invoice for the ``Torricelli ad.'' And beginning on \nOctober 8 through the end of the month, ATR's bank records show a \nseries of wire transfers to Mentzer Media Services totaling $374,830 \nfor the media buys. At the beginning of October, ATR's bank account \nbalances had stood at just over $290,000. After receiving the influx of \nRNC dollars, ATR spent over $383,000 on an attack ad against the \nDemocratic senatorial candidate in New Jersey.\n  Documentary evidence suggests ATR's involvement with other television \nads during the 1996 election season. Two were allegedly sponsored by an \nATR affiliate called Women For Tax Reform, which was formed in August \n1996, housed in ATR's offices, headed by ATR's Executive Director \nAudrey Mullen, and which has had no apparent existence apart from the \ntwo ads. Both ads attacked President Clinton by name with one scheduled \nfor airing on television in Chicago in August during the Democratic \nConvention.\n  In addition, the RNC produced out of its files the script of a \ntelevision ad which was apparently designed to be sponsored by ATR and \nused to attack Democratic candidates running for open seats. The \ndocument states at the top, ``RNC-TV/Open Seat TV:30/`Control'.'' The \nad requires inserting a photo of a Democratic candidate, stamping \n``Wrong!!'' over it, and then inserting the ``Democrat Tax Record'' \nunder the photo. The last line of the ad is: ``For more information \ncall Americans for Tax Reform.'' At the bottom of the document, in \nsmall type, it states: ``As of 10/15/96 4:50 PM/ Approved by legal \ncounsel.'' This document not only suggests coordination between the RNC \nand ATR on TV ads, but also a sufficient investment of resources to \ninvolve a written script and legal consultation. Since officials from \nthe RNC and ATR refused to be interviewed and\n\n[[Page S12445]]\n\nwhen subpoenaed refused to appear, we don't know whether any ad was \nactually broadcast. Whether or not one was, this RNC-produced document \nindicates coordination.\n  There's more. Documents indicate that RNC coordination efforts may \nhave extended to organizations other than ATR, and that the RNC may \nhave taken steps to pay for coordinated activities using not only its \nown funds, but also funds from third parties which the RNC solicited \nand directed. Here are some of the key documents.\n  The first is a memorandum dated October 17, 1996, marked \n``confidential,'' from Jo-Anne Coe, RNC finance director, to Haley \nBarbour, RNC chairman, Sanford McCallister, RNC general counsel, and \nCurt Anderson, RNC political director. The memo discusses Coe's efforts \nto forward certain sums of money to various tax exempt organizations, \nincluding a $100,000 check from Carl Lindner to ATR, another $100,000 \ncheck from Mr. Lindner to the National Right to Life Committee, and \n$950,000 from several sources to the American Defense Institute. The \nmemo poses questions about how certain checks should be handled and \nrequests quick action ``so I can put this project to bed.''\n\n  The project itself is not described in the memo; however, a second \ndocument may shed light on that question. It is an October 21, 1996 \nmemorandum from Jo-Anne Coe to Haley Barbour. This memo states:\n\n       As soon as we meet and hopefully come to some resolution on \n     the joint state mail project, I will forward these checks to \n     the three organizations. In the meantime, I am respectfully \n     withholding delivery of the checks until we have the \n     opportunity to discuss this matter.\n\n  Could the ``joint state mail project'' be the project referred to in \nthe October 17th memo from Coe to Barbour? Could it refer to ATR's $3.3 \nmillion direct mail-phone bank effort? Could it refer to mail efforts \nby other organizations as well, since the memo cites three \norganizations as being involved in the project? Is the fact that the \nRNC Finance Director was ``respectfully withholding'' checks to these \nthree organizations evidence that the RNC was exercising control over \ntheir performance in the mail project in exchange for funding? A \ncommittee hearing could have tried to get answers to these questions. \nThe majority denied us that opportunity.\n  In the meantime, we must puzzle over two letters bearing the same \ndate, October 21, 1996, as the Coe memo to Barbour on the joint state \nmail project. Both letters are from Jo-Anne Coe. The first letter is \naddressed to Grover Norquist, president of ATR, and the second to David \nO'Steen, the executive director of the National Right to Life \nCommittee. Each encloses a $100,000 check from Carl Lindner to the \norganization, as described in the October 17 memo. Ms. Coe states in \nboth letters: ``Glad to be of some help. Keep up the good work.'' It \nappears that the RNC may have directed its contributors to help the RNC \nby making their checks payable to these tax exempt organizations but \nthen to keep control of the situation, have the contributors send the \nchecks to the RNC. The RNC then forwarded the checks to the \norganizations, probably in support of the ``joint state mail project.''\n  Two other documents raise similar coordination questions. The first \nwas produced by the RNC and has the same ``confidential'' heading as \nthe October 17th memo from Jo-Anne Coe to top RNC officials, although \nno author is named. This document discusses contributions to ATR, the \nNational Right to Life Committee, American Defense Institute, United \nSeniors Association, the City of San Diego, and ``CCRI'' which is the \nCalifornia ballot initiative on affirmative action. Each organization \nis analyzed in terms of whether contributions to it would have to be \nreported to the public and whether a contribution would be tax \ndeductible. The final document is a list of the same organizations \nother than the ballot initiative. By each organization's name is a \nlarge dollar figure. The figure for ATR is $6 million.\n  What do these figures mean? Does the $6 million for ATR mean that, in \naddition to giving ATR $4.6 million directly, the RNC funneled another \n$1.4 million to ATR in third-party contributions such as the $100,000 \ncheck from Carl Lindner? How were those funds used? Did the RNC \nexercise some control over those funds? We'd like to ask. \nUnfortunately, despite the repeated requests and efforts by the \nminority to seek RNC and ATR testimony voluntarily and then by subpoena \nand to have the few subpoenas that were issued enforced, the committee \nnever interviewed or deposed anyone connected with these documents.\n  Improper coordination between a national political party and tax \nexempt organizations was a hot topic in this committee when the \npolitical party involved was the Democratic Party. Some committee \nmembers charged that President Clinton's participation in DNC issue ads \nwas improper or illegal, even though these ads were paid for by the \nrequired soft money-hard money split. I repeat that, because this is a \nvery important point of distinction: the DNC issue ads were paid for by \nthe required soft money-hard money split. But in the Americans for Tax \nReform case, the facts suggest that the Republican Party sent millions \nto ATR for issue advocacy in order to avoid using any hard money at all \nfor those efforts. To recall Mr. Barbour's words, they didn't have \nenough hard dollars to match up.\n\n  The committee also held an entire day of hearings to take testimony \nfrom Warren Meddoff about his asking for, and Harold Ickes' providing, \nsuggestions for contributions to tax exempt organizations. But the RNC \ndid much more than make suggestions. It actually collected checks, \ncontolled checks, and delivered checks to tax exempts which were allied \nwith it. The RNC may have directed millions of dollars to these \norganizations for ``joint state mail projects,'' television ads and \nother campaign activities.\n  Another unanswered question is how the RNC and ATR handled the $4.6 \nmillion on their own tax returns. Section 527 of the Tax Code suggests \nthat one or the other organization had to treat this sum as taxable \nincome. Did that happen? We don't know, and the committee has yet to \nask.\n  On April 9, 6 months ago, Mr. Norquist told the press that he would \n``cheerfully testify before the committee.'' But he then refused to be \neither deposed or interviewed. Even when he was finally subpoenaed for \na deposition, he refused to appear. ATR also refused to produce \ndocuments in response to a committee document subpoena, claiming, ``ATR \nhas never engaged in electioneering of any sort. It has never advocated \nthe election or defeat of any candidate for any office at any time; it \nhas never run political advertising on any subject.''\n  Yet it is beyond dispute that Grover Norquist was a key figure in the \n1996 elections. He was profiled in Elizabeth Drew's 1996 election \nanalysis, Whatever It Takes, for convening regular Wednesday meetings \nin ATR offices attended by conservative activists, RNC officials and \nGOP candidates. Drew describes him as ``one of the most influential \nfigures in Washington'' at the time. In Norquist's 1995 book, ``Rock \nthe House'', celebrating the Republican takeover of the House of \nRepresentatives, prominent Republicans provided glowing quotations, \nwith Haley Barbour calling him ``a true insider,'' and Rush Limbaugh \ncalling him ``perhaps the most influential and important person you've \nnever heard of in the GOP today.''\n  Mr. Norquist meets the test that Chairman Thompson laid down for a \nhigh caliber witness. And ATR's role in the 1996 elections--how it \nspent the $4.6 million in RNC funds, how much money was directed to it \nby the RNC from third parties and how those funds were spent, and the \nwindow that ATR's actions opens onto RNC's coordination with tax exempt \ngroups--were unexplored topics in the Senate campaign finance \ninvestigation.\n  And the ATR hearing is not the only hearing missing from the Senate \ncampaign finance investigation.\n  A second hearing we would have re-requested would have looked at the \nRepublican National Committee and Dole for President campaign. Out of \nthe more than 75 witnesses who testified before the committee over the \n3 months of hearings, not one witness was called from the Republican \nNational Committee, other than with respect to the National Policy \nForum, or from the Dole for President campaign. What most people don't \nknow is that the committee never even interviewed\n\n[[Page S12446]]\n\na single person from the Dole campaign, and request after request from \nthe minority for deposition subpoenas were refused. And although the \ncommittee permitted two limited interviews of RNC officials, Haley \nBarbour and Scott Reed, no questions were allowed to be asked \nduringthose sessions on any topic other than the National Policy Forum \nand no other person from the RNC was ever interviewed or deposed.\n  That means that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee is \nconcluding its investigation into the 1996 elections without ever \nasking a single question of the RNC or Dole campaign on such topics as \nevasion of Federal campaign limits, improper coordination, misuse of \nissue advertising, misuse of tax exempts, money laundering by a top \ncampaign official, or inadequate document production--all the topics \nthat the committee pursued vigorously with the Clinton campaign. This \nsee-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil approach to GOP conduct in the \n1996 elections has not only seriously skewed the investigation, but it \nhas also left an regrettable stain on the bipartisan traditions of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n\n  A third hearing would have looked at Triad Management--a totally new \nphenomenon in American electioneering and one which appears to have \nviolated a number of principles of Federal campaign law, from \ncontribution limits to FEC registration to full disclosure. Triad is a \nprivate corporation that was set up by experienced GOP political \noperatives to conduct multimillion dollar activities directly affecting \nthe 1996 elections. Among other activities, Triad created two tax \nexempt organizations, collected millions of dollars in secret \ncontributions to them, and then used the tax exempts to air millions of \ndollars worth of television ads affecting Federal campaigns. Triad also \nconducted hundreds of ``political audits'' of GOP campaigns, paying \nexperienced campaign professionals to advise the campaigns on how to \nimprove their operations. Triad also may have arranged for individuals \nwho contributed the maximum allowable amount to GOP candidates to evade \nFederal contribution limits by laundering additional contributions from \nthese individuals through political action committees.\n  Triad undertook all of these activities without ever registering with \nthe Federal Election Commission, or disclosing any contributions or \nexpenditures. Yet this wholesale abuse of Federal campaign law has not \nbeen deemed by the majority to be worthy of a single hearing witness or \ndepositions.\n  Mr. President, the Governmental Affairs Committee's failure to \ninvestigate the $4.6 million payment by the Republican Party to \nAmericans for Tax Reform, its failure to hold one day of hearings or \nhear from one witness with respect to Triad Management, and its failure \nto hold one day of hearings or call one witness from the RNC or Dole \ncampaign on these critical issues is simply unjustifiable. The \nmajority's commitment to allow Democrats 3 days of hearings in \nSeptember or October was not kept. As a result, important information \nsuch as the ATR story was kept from the American public.\n  That is not just some process question about subpoenas and \ndepositions. That is a question about whether or not relevant testimony \nwithin the scope of the jurisdiction of the committee should have been \nobtained and should have been made public and made subject to \nexamination and cross-examination.\n  The Senate investigation was half an investigation. The other half \nremains for the Treasury Department and Justice Department to \ninvestigate.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                            John Grotta Co.\n\n                              [Memorandum]\n\n     To: Audrey Mullen\n     From Cindy Finnegan\n     Re: Invoices/Payment Status\n     Date: October 29, 1996\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                    Amount owed     Amount paid     Balance due \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           MAIL--JGCo.                                                                          \n                                                                        10/18/96        10/21/96  ..............\nATR One.........................................................     $490,808.11     $490,808.11           $0.00\n                                                                        10/22/96        10/23/96  ..............\nATRT Two........................................................     $459,736.27     $459,736.27           $0.00\n                                                                        10/22/96        10/25/96  ..............\nATR Three.......................................................     $363,133.02     $468,000.00     $104,866.98\n                                                                                                                \n                          PHONES--JGCo.                                                                         \n                                                                                                                \n                                                                         10/7/96         10/9/96  ..............\nInbound.........................................................      $41,500.00      $41,500.00           $0.00\n                                                                        10/24/96        10/25/96  ..............\nATR #1..........................................................   $1,104,000.00   $1,104,000.00           $0.00\n                                                                        10/28/96        10/31/96  ..............\nATR #2..........................................................     $712,643.70           $0.00     $712,643.70\n                                                                                                                \n                          Database--PBL                                                                         \n                                                                                                                \n                                                                         10/7/96         10/9/96  ..............\nDatabase Acquisition............................................     $153,677.50     $153,677.50           $0.00\n                                                                 -----------------------------------------------\n     Total balance..............................................................................     $607,776.72\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Please Note: Does NOT Include Postage.                                                                         \n\n\n                                                                        \n                   Video                                Audio           \n                                                                        \nPicture of Labor Goons From Chapter II      Washington Labor Bosses and \n With Headline.

I was extremely pleased that recently President Clinton \nand Mrs. Clinton hosted a White House Conference on Child Care. The \nconference was not only informative, but also very effective, I \nbelieve, in drawing nationwide attention to the widespread difficulties \nthat most parents have in finding child care that is both affordable \nand of high quality.\n  It is estimated that each and every day 3 million children under the \nage of 6 will spend time being cared for by someone other than their \nparents, including one-half of all babies younger than 12 months of \nage. We all know that these early years are critical years for child \ndevelopment and that we need to be concerned about the quality of care \nthat these children are receiving. Unfortunately, for too many \nchildren, the quality is simply not high enough.\n  One national study, which was published in 1994, rated the majority \nof child care centers as mediocre or poor.\n  One out of eight child care centers were found to actually jeopardize \nchildren's safety and development. Not surprisingly, Mr. President, \nchildren in substandard care have delayed language and reading skills, \nthey are more aggressive than other children their age, and we should, \ntherefore, recognize that raising the quality of care has long-term \nbenefits not only for these kids but for our society as a whole. \nClearly, strong families and strong parenting comes first, but we need \nto complement that with a greater emphasis on quality, affordable child \ncare.\n  We understand and we recognize that child care can be extremely \nexpensive, costing thousands of dollars per year for each child, and \nover $8,000 a year in some parts of our country. Many parents struggle \nwith paying these bills, which are frequently larger than their rent, \nmortgage, or car payment. In the case of middle- and lower-income \nfamilies--especially single-parent families--child care costs can \neasily consume more than one-quarter of a family's annual income.\n  I have been holding a series of meetings with child care providers in \nmy State of South Dakota. We face some special challenges in our State. \nAmong these challenges is the fact that we have the highest percentage \nof working mothers in America. For more than 70 percent of the children \nin South Dakota, both parents work; or in the case of a single-parent \nfamily, the sole parent works.\n  Another item discussed at these meetings was the negative impact of \ncuts in the child and adult care food program that were part of the \nWelfare Reform Act of 1996. Many child care providers have relied on \nthis assistance to provide affordable care, and many families now face \nincreasing costs and reduced access to child care. One of the \nconsequences of the change in the nutrition program was to actually \ncreate a disincentive for child care providers to remain licensed and \ncertified.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the evidence is abundantly clear that \nwe need to do more to provide more affordable and higher quality child \ncare. This can be accomplished, I believe, without the creation of some \nnew bureaucracy. Instead, working in partnership with the States, local \ngovernments, and nonprofit organizations, the Federal Government, \nworking in Federal-State-local and a public-private partnership can \nachieve a great deal.\n  In an effort to seek constructive solutions, I have recently \ncosponsored two bills, the CIDCARE Act and the Early Childhood \nDevelopment Act. These bills would work together in a complementary \nfashion.\n  I would like to congratulate Senators Jeffords and Dodd for their \nefforts in authoring the CIDCARE Act, S. 1037. I am pleased to join \nthem as a cosponsor. The bill contains several provisions that would be \na very positive step forward for all forms of child care.\n  First, the bill would refocus the existing child and dependent care \ntax credit by making it refundable for low-income families and by \nincreasing the credit for families with incomes under $55,000. These \nsteps will provide much-needed assistance to families with the costs of \nwhichever kind of quality care they choose.\n  Second, the bill contains a number of provisions to encourage child \ncare providers to offer higher quality care by boosting training \nlevels. Child care providers would be eligible for more generous tax \ndeductions for education and training that helps them receive \nprofessional credentials. Additionally, States would receive grant \nfunding to operate training programs and to offer scholarships to \nproviders who receive training.\n  One aspect of the child care quality problem is the extremely high \nturnover among child care workers, which is not surprising when one \nrealizes that most child care center workers make barely more than the \nminimum wage. The CIDCARE Act approaches this problem in creative ways.\n  First, the bill would create a problem for student loan forgiveness \nof child care workers who earn degrees in early childhood education, or \nwho receive professional care credentials. Additionally, grant money \nwould be made available to the States under this bill, which could be \nused for programs to provide salary increases for providers, who \nreceive professional credentials.\n  We should do all we can to encourage more private sector businesses \nto offer child care benefits. The CIDCARE Act would provide tax credits \nto employers to reduce the costs of starting up a child care center, \nfor the professional development expenses of child care staff, and for \ncost also related to getting a child care facility accredited.\n  All in all, the CIDCARE Act contains a number of innovative \nnonbureaucratic provisions, and I believe it would be a great step \nforward in increasing child care quality and in making it more \naffordable.\n  The second piece of legislation that I have cosponsored is the Early \nChildhood Development Act, S. 1309. I became an original cosponsor of \nthis legislation when it was introduced just 2 weeks ago. I \ncongratulate Senator John Kerry and Senator Bond for their work on this \nbill.\n\n  One of the more critical needs in my State of South Dakota is for \nafter-school programs. More than half the school-age children in my \nState have no parent at home in the hours after school lets out. From \nnationwide statistics, we know that juvenile crime is at its highest \nbetween the hours of 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., the hours between when kids get \nout of school and before parents, all too often, get home from work.\n  The Early Childhood Development Act contains provisions to expand \nFederal financial assistance to innovative programs that target at-risk \nchildren by providing constructive activities and care after school \nlets out. The bill does not create some new Federal bureaucracy. \nInstead, it offers grant money to States who will, in turn,\n\n[[Page S12448]]\n\nmake grants to local after-school programs that are typically run by \nnonprofit organizations, such as the Boys and Girls Clubs. We need more \nof these after-school programs, and we need more resources to expand \nthe number of children that these programs can reach.\n  The Early Childhood Development Act would also strengthen programs \nthat offer care to our youngest kids, aged 0 to 6. The more we learn \nabout early childhood development, the more we realize how critically \nimportant it is that these children receive quality care. This bill \nwould supplement the Federal child care and development block grant for \nat-risk infants, toddlers, and preschoolers.\n  Along the same lines, the bill would increase funding for the new \nEarly Head Start Program, which provides comprehensive child \ndevelopment and family support services to infants and toddlers. This \nprogram not only offers a high-quality educational component for young \nchildren, but also parent education, parent-child activities, and \nhealth services.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these two important bills--the CIDCARE \nAct and the Early Childhood Development Act--will go a long, long way \ntoward addressing the critical child care needs that we have throughout \nAmerica today. I look forward to working on them in a bipartisan \nfashion during this next session of the 105th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12447-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12448-S12449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. MARINE CORPS\n\n\n                         The Air Force Memorial\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the U.S. Marine Corps will be marking \nanother one of its historic birthdays, No. 222. I have been privileged \nto have worn the Marine green, together with my distinguished colleague \nhere, Senator Chafee. We both served in the Korean war.\n  The point of my remarks, Mr. President, is that we have a most \nunfortunate and, indeed, I think, unforeseen dispute between the U.S. \nMarine Corps and the Air Force over the location of the memorial which, \nin every respect, the Air Force deserves and has earned through the \nsacrifices of its men throughout its history. I remember very \ndistinctly in World War II, it was referred to as the Army Air Corps. \nAnd then when the Department of Defense reorganized, they created, \nquite properly, in recognition of the enormous sacrifices of the \nmembers of the Air Corps in World War II, which suffered, then, the \nhighest per capita casualties of any of the combat units. Mr. \nPresident, cooler heads have to be brought to bear on this dispute. I \nam hopeful that can be done.\n  The purpose for my seeking recognition today was to recognize the \nMarine Corps birthday. But into this dispute has come a very solid, \nfair-minded, and I must say objective person, a former Secretary of the \nNavy, James Webb.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his statement, which appeared recently \nin public, be printed in the Record in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Wrong Place for the Air Force Memorial\n\n                         (By James H. Webb Jr.)\n\n       Earlier this year I had the sad honor of burying my father, \n     Col. James H. Webb, Sr., U.S. Air Force (retired). His grave \n     sits on a gentle hill in Section 51 of the Arlington National \n     Cemetery, just next to the small park on which stands the \n     nation's most famous military landmark, the Marine Corps War \n     Memorial.\n       Between his grave and the sculpture of the Marines raising \n     the flag at Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima, the Air Force \n     Memorial Foundation proposes to build a large and intrusive \n     memorial of its own. It is deeply unfortunate that the \n     location of this proposed memorial promises nothing but \n     unending controversy. And I have no compunction in saying \n     that the foundation's methods in lobbying for this site would \n     have puzzled and offended my Air Force father, just as it \n     does both of his Marine Corps-veteran sons.\n       Until late this summer, few among the general public even \n     knew that this site, which is within 500 feet of the Iwo Jima \n     statue, had been approved by the National Capital Planning \n     Commission (NCPC). The Air Force's first choice had been a \n     place near the Air and Space Museum, a logical spot that \n     would provide the same dignity, synergy and visitor \n     population that benefit the Navy Memorial's downtown \n     Washington location. Later, deciding on Arlington Ridge, the \n     Air Force during hearings erroneously maintained that the \n     Marine Corps posed no objection to the erection of a memorial \n     so near to its own. The Marine Corps had yet to take an \n     official position, and no Marine Corps witnesses were called \n     to discuss the potential impact.\n       Once the NCPC decision became publicly known, it was met \n     with a wide array of protest, including that of citizens \n     groups and a formal objection from the Marine Corps. Despite \n     a lawsuit and several bills having been introduced in \n     Congress to protect the site, the Air Force is persisting.\n       This is not simply a Marine Corps issue or a mere \n     interservice argument. Nor is it a question of whether the \n     Air Force should have a memorial. Rather, it is a matter of \n     the proper use of public land, just as important to our \n     heritage as are environmental concerns. We have witnessed an \n     explosion of monuments and memorials in our nation's capital \n     over the past two decades. New additions should receive \n     careful scrutiny. Their placement, propriety and artistic \n     impact concern all Americans, particularly those who care \n     about public art, through which continuing generations will \n     gain an understanding of the nation's journey.\n       The mood around the heavily visited ``Iwo'' is by design \n     contemplative, deliberately serene. The site was selected \n     personally just after World War II by Marine Commandant Gen. \n     Lemuel C. Shepherd Jr., who was concerned that the statue \n     required ``a large open area around it for proper display.'' \n     Dozens of full-dress official ceremonies take place each year \n     at the base of the hallowed sculpture. Even casual \n     ballplaying is forbidden on the parkland near it. It is, for \n     many Americans, truly sacred ground.\n       To put it simply, the proposed Air Force memorial would \n     pollute Arlington Ridge, forever changing its context.\n       The main argument in favor of this location--that it is \n     within a mile of Fort Myer, where the first-ever military \n     flight occurred in 1908--is weak, as all the services have \n     extensive aviation capabilities that might be traced to that \n     flight. The Air Force also argues that since the ``above-\n     ground'' aspect of its memorial would be 28 feet lower than \n     the top of the flagpole on the Iwo Jima statue, it will not \n     interfere with the grandeur of the Marine Corps memorial. \n     What Air Force officials take pains to avoid discussing is \n     that if one discounts the flagpole, their memorial would \n     actually be higher, wider and far deeper. Some 20,000 square \n     feet of below-the-ground museums and interactive displays are \n     planned, enough floor space for 10 average-sized homes.\n       The Air Force plan for an extensive three-story museum and \n     virtual-reality complex at its proposed memorial is a clear \n     departure in context from this quiet place. During the period \n     leading up to America's bicentennial commemoration, the \n     Marine Corps itself considered constructing a visitor center \n     and museum on the land adjacent to the Iwo Jima memorial. It \n     abandoned this plan because such facilities would be \n     inconsistent with the purpose and the impact of the monument \n     itself. It is not without irony that the land the Marine \n     Corps deliberately left open is now being pursued by the Air \n     Force for the very purpose that was earlier rejected.\n       Existing federal law precludes this sort of intrusion. \n     Title 40 of the U.S. Code states in section 1907 that ``a \n     commemorative work shall be so located as to prevent \n     interference with or encroachment upon any existing \n     commemorative work and to protect, to the maximum extent \n     possible, open space and existing public use.'' There can be \n     no clearer example of the intention of such law than the case \n     of the Marine Corps War Memorial.\n       The puzzling question is why the Air Force leadership \n     argues so vociferously that its memorial will not negatively \n     affect the Iwo Jima memorial.\n       I grew up in the presence of some of the finest leaders our \n     Air Force has ever produced, leaders who would never have \n     considered dissembling before a political body about whether \n     the Marine Corps concurred in a proposal that might diminish \n     the impact of its most cherished memorial--leaders who in \n     this situation would have shown the public, and particularly \n     the Marine Corps, great deference, knowing that its open \n     support was vital. Indeed, leaders who remembered that the \n     very mission in the battle of Iwo Jima, carried out at a cost \n     of 1,000 dead Marines for every square mile of territory \n     taken, was to eliminate enemy fighter attacks on Air Force \n     bombers passing overhead and to provide emergency runways for \n     Air Force pilots who had flown in harm's way.\n       It is now up to Congress to enforce the law and assist the \n     Air Force in finding a memorial site that will honor its own \n     without taking away from the dignity of others.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have known Jim Webb for many years. When \nI was Secretary of the Navy, he was a young officer on my staff, having \nserved with great distinction, for which this Nation awarded him the \nhighest in\n\n[[Page S12449]]\n\nmilitary honors and heroism, which, due to his humility, he rarely, if \never, refers to today. But that is so true of many of the men and women \nwho have received those honors.\n  Jim Webb has a way of standing back, as he is today, in his various \nprofessions, and looking at a situation and carefully and in a balanced \nway, analyzing it. I urge all those who desire to acquaint themselves \nwith this dispute--particularly those in the Department of the Air \nForce--to read this article with great care, because he reasons well as \nto why the Marine Corps Memorial in Arlington, which depicts the \nraising of the flag on Iwo Jima, which is visited each year by hundreds \nof thousands of persons from all over the world, has a very unique spot \nin history and a unique location.\n  It is, in my judgment, and the judgment of others, not in the best \ninterest of this country, or our armed services, to dislodge in any way \nthe mystique that surrounds that piece of hallowed ground, as it is \nreferred to by all marines, past, present and, I'm sure, those in the \nfuture.\n  So, therefore, I urge that all who are interested in this and wish to \napply their own sound judgment examine the article of the former \nSecretary of the Navy, James Webb.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to mark a very \nsignificant moment in the career of our good friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, who is now in these \ndays entering his 35th year of service in this body.\n  The length of that tenure is really a measure, in my judgment, and I \nthink in the judgment of the people of Massachusetts, of the \nextraordinary work that he does for our State as well as for the \ncountry. He is the most senior Senator from Massachusetts now in \nhistory, serving longer than Henry Cabot Lodge, longer than Charles \nSumner, longer even than Daniel Webster, all of whom were extraordinary \nleaders in their own right.\n  There is no question that the reason for this longevity is because of \nthe remarkable persistence of his work for the State on a local basis. \nIt was, after all, our own ``Tip'' O'Neill who said that ``all \npolitics'' was ``local.'' Indeed, no one has fought harder for the \npeople of Massachusetts when it comes to highway or bridge projects, or \nwhen it comes to mass transit, to research and development, to \nassistance for education, to helping our research hospitals, dealing \nwith biotechnology, or defense conversion. The range of Senator \nKennedy's accomplishments is really unmatched for our State. However, \nas everybody knows, he is also more than just the Senator from \nMassachusetts. He has been a Senator from Massachusetts who has had a \nnational impact of great proportions and who has absorbed and \narticulated values and aspirations of our people and for the Nation.\n  In the 35 years that he served our State, an awful lot has changed in \nthis country. And it is fair to say that Ted Kennedy has been at the \nforefront of a great deal of that change. If you go back 30 years to \nthe conditions that prevailed here in the country, there is no doubt \nthat from the moment when he entered the Senate, he has been part of \nthat change. When he came here there was no Civil Rights Act, there was \nno Voting Rights Act, and the great battle against segregation and for \nequal justice was only then just heating up. It was Ted Kennedy who \nfought those battles and who has remained a champion for bringing \nAmerica closer to the ideals that we espouse. And we are at the center \nof those fights. When Ted Kennedy entered the Senate, there was no \nMedicare for senior citizens, there was no Medicaid for the poor and \ndisabled, there were no incentives for private employers to provide \nhealth benefits, and large areas of the Nation were medically \nunderserved. It was Ted Kennedy who fought those battles and who even \ntoday remains a leader in helping to bring health care to all \nAmericans.\n  When he entered the Senate, the Vietnam war was burgeoning, nuclear \nweapons were armed and aimed across the globe, South Africa brutally \ndefended its apartheid system, and Eastern Europe remained in thrall to \nthe Soviet Union.\n  Ted Kennedy's great voice for reason and restraint on arms control, \nagainst apartheid, and for freedom resonated around the world. It is a \nmemory that many people in many parts of the world carry with them \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, we mark anniversaries not simply to recall the amount \nof time performed in service but to applaud and to take note of the \namount of service performed in that time. There are few Senators in \nhistory, in my judgment, who match the productivity with longevity as \nwell as Ted Kennedy.\n  I think it can fairly be said that he is one of the very few in this \nbody who has helped to set the agenda of this institution year after \nyear, decade after decade. In just the last 2 years, he has achieved \nsignal success on milestone legislation on behalf of working Americans.\n  Largely due to his leadership, we raised the minimum wage. We now \nhave a better health care system as he continues to fight for still \nmore improvements as we have recognized some of the problems that have \narisen even in the changes that have been made.\n  His standing in this institution is based, in my judgment, on two \nsimple attributes.\n  First, he has understood from the beginning the distant goal lines \nthis Nation needed to cross in order to make our dreams for the country \na reality.\n  Second, he has consistently moved the ball down the field with a \nsense of practicality about the limits of what the times and the \nopposition would allow.\n  Many, many Americans outside this Chamber know Senator Kennedy for \nthe power of his passion, the persuasiveness of his advocacy, and the \ntenaciousness of his fights.\n  But there is, as we all know in this Chamber, a personal side to his \npresence here, which only those of us in the Chamber or those who have \nbeen touched in some way in their personal lives outside of this \nChamber understand. There is probably not a Senator here who would not \nrecount a story of how Ted Kennedy has picked up the phone at a time of \nstress or distress and has been responsive and caring. There are those \nof us who have gone through difficult times, who have found that he is \none of the first people to offer help. I can personally remember once \nwhen I had a phone call at a time when I had pneumonia. The next thing \nI knew Ted Kennedy was making his house available for my recuperation \nand urging me to go and take advantage of it. That is the kind of \nperson he is and just one small story of the many that other colleagues \nhere have experienced.\n  So, Mr. President, we are all better off for having this colleague of \nours serve and continue to serve, and we are all better off for having \nhim as a friend.\n  I congratulate him on the occasion of his remarkable career. I \nearnestly hope that my State and this Nation will continue to rely on \nhis capacity and his foresight and his presence in this body for many \nyears to come.\n  I thank my colleagues for their courtesy in allowing me to make these \ncomments prior to another engagement.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts for the very eloquent statement from the heart about our \ncolleague. While I philosophically differ from the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, I will say he is one of the hardest working Senators \nthat I have ever observed in every respect for those issues for which \nhe fights. That fight comes from the heart. I just wanted to commend \nthe junior Senator for speaking so eloquently about our mutual friend.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to also say that the junior \nSenator\n\n[[Page S12450]]\n\nfrom Massachusetts was quite right in saying that the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts during his long years here has certainly had a \nsignificant impact on legislation, and we all should recognize that and \npay tribute to him for what he has done.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to note that the Presiding Officer \nis a former marine. So he is celebrating today likewise the 222d \nbirthday of the U.S. Marine Corps. So we are all celebrating together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12449-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12450-S12456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that the Senate \nand House have reached an agreement to continue funding for the \nNation's Federal-aid highway, safety and transit programs. The Surface \nTransportation Extension Act of 1997 will keep our transportation \nsystem up and running. It will give States the flexibility they need to \ncontinue transportation planning and construction activities until a \npermanent reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act [ISTEA] is enacted, hopefully early next year.\n  The Senate-House agreement provides $9.7 billion of obligation \nauthority--money States actually can spend. This $9.7 billion in \nspending authority is distributed according to the structure provided \nin S. 1454, the Senate-passed extension bill, which we passed this \nmonth. Each State is guaranteed at least 50 percent of its previous \nyear's limitation to spend on any transportation project or program. To \nkeep the States on an equal footing, however, no State may spend more \nthan 75 percent of its 1997 spending limitation.\n  As you might know, one of the major concerns we had with the 6-month \nextension bill passed by the House was its formula structure. By \nadopting the spending structure in the Senate bill, we have avoided the \ncontentious fight over formulas that would have prevented us from going \nforward had we adopted the House formulas.\n  Another important feature of the Senate-passed bill we have agreed to \npreserve is the flexibility provision. Under current law, the States \nare restricted in using their unobligated balances across Federal-aid \nhighway, transit and safety categories. The Senate-House agreement \nallows the States to spend their balances on any Federal-aid highway, \ntransit or safety program category. To prevent important environmental \nprograms such as the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement \nProgram [CMAQ] from being unfairly disadvantaged, however, the \nSecretary of Transportation must restore the transferred funds back to \nthese programs when the long-term reauthorization bill is enacted.\n  The Senate-House agreement preserves the Federal commitment to\n\n[[Page S12453]]\n\nsafety by funding key ISTEA safety programs. This is a very important \npart of our legislation. In the United States, there are more than \n40,000 fatalities and 3.5 million collisions on our highways every \nyear. The measure before us will help ongoing efforts to reverse this \ndisturbing trend. Funds are provided to enable the Motor Carrier Safety \nAssistance Program, the State and Community Safety Grant Program, the \nNational Driver Register, and the Alcohol Impaired Driving \nCountermeasures Program.\n  The federal transit discretionary and formula programs will receive \nthe funds they need.\n  The Senate-House agreement will provide funds for the Federal Highway \nAdministration to continue its operations and to assist the States in \nrunning their transportation programs. Without the measure before us, \nthe Federal Highway Administration would have shut down in January and \n3,600 employees would have been sent home because we lack the ability \nto pay them.\n  The Senate-House agreement extends the transfer of funds from the \nhighway trust fund to the aquatic resources trust Fund to be used for \nsport fish restoration and boating safety programs.\n  The bill also will provide funds necessary for our local \ntransportation planners, the metropolitan planning organizations, to \ncontinue their work.\n  The agreement also provides $5.5 billion in new contract authority, \nwhich will be distributed proportionately according to the structure in \nthe Senate-passed bill. I want to make it clear that this new contract \nauthority will not affect the overall spending limitation of $9.7 \nbillion provided in the agreement.\n  Let me add that we will have the opportunity next year to enact a \nlong-term ISTEA reauthorization that will set the comprehensive \ntransportation policy necessary to take us into the next century.\n  The majority leader has assured me that the ISTEA II bill--in other \nwords, the one that we will be considering next year, that we have \nalready had on the floor but regrettably we weren't able to get to it \nfor longer--that the bill which was reported out of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee 7 weeks ago will be the first item before the \nSenate when we reconvene in January.\n  That is the statement of the majority leader.\n  In the meantime, the Senate-House agreement will keep the State and \nFederal transportation programs running. It will ensure that no highway \ncontractors will be put out of work because of lack of Federal dollars. \nAnd it will continue funding for vital safety and transit programs. \nMoreover, it will keep the momentum going to enact the 6-year bill \nearly next year.\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I want to give special recognition to \nSenator Bond, who was instrumental in making sure that we addressed \nthese important issues before going home for the year. Senator Bond did \nyeoman work on this program, as did Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, \nboth of whom are on the floor. And I personally thank them for their \ndiligent and constructive work on this program.\n  I also wish to thank the majority leader for all of his help. He was \na steadfast ally in assuring that this work would be completed.\n  Further, Mr. President, the staff of all members have been \ntremendously helpful. Jimmie Powell, Dan Corbett, Tom Sliter, Linda \nJordan, Cheryle Tucker, Kathy Ruffalo, Ann Loomis, Ellen Stein, Tracy \nHenke, and Keith Hennessey of Senator Lott's staff, every single one of \nthem have done yeoman's work in connection with getting this bill in \nthe shape it is now, and all of us join in thanks to each and every one \nof them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have known Senator Chafee since 1969, \nwhen we served together in the Department of the Navy. One of the \nhallmarks of this great American is humility, and he always displays \nit. But we know that in the final few hours here it has been our \nchairman, John Chafee, who has struck the final chords of negotiation \nand coordinated with our distinguished leader, Mr. Lott, and was able \ntogether in consultation with Senator Baucus, myself, and Senator Bond \nto fashion the final portion of this interim highway measure.\n  So we thank the chairman, indeed, the staff and all, and again our \ndistinguished leader. I have now served under three leaders, and \nSenator Lott has the ability to tell a chairman to go get the job done. \nIf necessary, you can contact me. Otherwise, I trust you. He \neffectively runs the Senate, certainly on our side of the aisle, with \nthat type of strong leadership and confidence in which he imposes on \nchairmen and members to do the job.\n  I think we have done the job for both sides. It has been a bipartisan \neffort. As a committee chairman, it is a privilege for me to have the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], as my ranking \nmember on the subcommittee which he takes on in addition to his overall \nresponsibilities as ranking member on the full committee.\n  It is interesting; the three of us, in guiding through the principal \nbill, ISTEA II, the 6-year bill, have been really working in concert as \na triumvirate all along in fashioning this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman went over the various \nprovisions here--flexibility whereby the States are allowed to spend \nunobligated balances for highway construction, highway safety and \ntransit projects, and, second, continues transportation programs. Every \nState will have 50 percent of their 1997 allocation to continue highway \nspending. This is a unique formula. Recognizing that this Chamber was \nnot going to pass a 6-month bill as sent over by the House, Mr. Bond, \nof Missouri, came forward with this basic blueprint which then the four \nof us crafted, and it took a lot of give and take to craft it in such a \nway that we did not restore the formula--no formula fight at this point \nin time.\n  I do not call it a formula fight. I just call it a formula resolution \nbecause eventually we are going to have to resolve this formula thing, \nand we will do it. But thus far this bill, this particular Bond bill \npreserves the flexibility for the Senate to continue with the ISTEA II \nbill which is a bill that I term fair. Fairness is the hallmark of all \nof our work that has gone into the ISTEA II 6-year bill which hopefully \nwe will pass in large measure as currently structured by our committee, \nbut it is a formula which is fair, and that is the thing that was so \nlacking in ISTEA I.\n  New funds for critical programs; continues funding the Federal \nGovernment for 6 months for essential safety, transit and Federal \nhighway operations. Three thousand five hundred jobs were held in \nabeyance and still are until the President's signature is affixed to \nthis piece of legislation.\n  Now, they are the persons not only here in the Nation's Capital but \neach of the 50 States, in the highway offices, who day in and day out \nthrough good weather and bad weather, through one administration in the \nState and the next administration, are there as professional advisers \non the very important obligation that all of us have to modernize and \nto continue to improve America's highway infrastructure.\n  A major change from the Bond bill provides $5.5 billion in new \ncontract authority to the States using the Senate's approach. Now, that \nis a large measure we should acknowledge came from the House of \nRepresentatives under the leadership of their chairman and ranking \nmember. And Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bond, and I have met with them \nthe past several days. That was something they felt very strongly \nabout, and it is the result of a compromise. They fought very hard in \nsome instances to make some modifications for States which deservedly \nshould have some additional recognition. It was the judgment of those \nof us certainly on this side that we could not in this bill at this \ntime begin to single out some of those hardship cases, but their rights \nto reassert those hardship cases for several States are preserved under \nthis bill for the 6-year bill next year. These funds are an advance to \nthe States. These funds will be counted as part of each State's formula \nuntil the final bill is done.\n  So that in substance concludes my remarks, Mr. President. It is \nreally just so pleasing for us, after such a\n\n[[Page S12454]]\n\nlong struggle, to preserve this infrastructure so that the jobs can \ncontinue. All over America, literally millions of jobs depend on the \npassage of this piece of legislation. And the several Governors I think \ncan say to themselves that they have had a strong influence on this \nbill, all 50, one way or another together with their respective \nsecretaries of transportation and the officials in that State who have \nin them the responsibility for transportation.\n  I think, all in all, we have done a good job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will not comment on the specifics of the \nshort-term bill. They have been adequately described by the very \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, of Rhode \nIsland, as well as the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Warner.\n  I do have a couple of points I want to make which I think are very \nimportant. No. 1, this is a true compromise. We in this body suggested \n$500 million in new contract authority. The House originally suggested \nabout $12 billion in new contract authority for next year. We have \ncompromised on $5.5 billion in new contract authority, and we have done \nit in a way which does not get into new formulas. The Senate has its \nformula certainly in the 6-year bill it passed. The House has their \nformula approach.\n  This short-term bill is a compromise in the amounts of the contract \nauthority, but in a way that does not get into formulas. I think that \nis very fair, again reminding Senators that about $9.7 billion will be \navailable May 1.\n  The second point is this will allow States to have continuity in \ntheir highway programs. Contractors, highway commissions, employees, \nguys in the various labor unions, men and women who actually do the \nwork here are very worried about whether we will have continuity, \nwhether the program will continue, whether States will be able to let \nbids and accept bids and set up new projects. This bill, the short-term \nbill, maintains the continuity until we get over into a full 6-year \nbill, which I hope we pass early next year.\n  Senator Lott suggested that we will take up the 6-year bill as the \nfirst order of business after the State of the Union Address next year, \nand I am very hopeful the House will also act very quickly.\n  Another point is that even though we are somewhat congratulating \nourselves in working with the other body in passing this short-term \nbill, we have to remember that the major challenge is still before us. \nIt is passing that 6-year bill. I urge all my colleagues as well as \nMembers of the other body to be ready to roll up their shirt sleeves \nthe beginning of next year to work very hard to get this 6-year bill \npassed so then States will truly be assured of continuity.\n  I particularly wish to thank Members of the other body, the chairman \nof the House Committee, Mr. Shuster of Pennsylvania, also Mr. Oberstar, \nwho is the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Petri and also Mr. \nRahall. The four of them met with us, and I very much compliment them \nbecause they worked very cooperatively with Senators Chafee, myself, \nand Senator Warner in figuring out this short-term solution. Sometimes \nnegotiations between this body and the other body get a little \nprotracted and unnecessarily so. That was not the case here. The \nMembers I mentioned worked very hard and worked very well together. I \nthank them very much for all that they have done. This is a good \ncompromise. It provides flexibility and it is something we can proudly \npass, so long as we remember that next year we have major work ahead of \nus.\n  I particularly wish to thank our outstanding staff: Jimmie Powell, \nDan Corbett, as well as Linda Jordan, and Cheryle Tucker, who are with \nSenator Chafee's staff, worked extremely effectively and hard, Ann \nLoomis and Ellen Stein with Senator Warner, and Tracy Henke, the voice \nof Senator Bond. She is very, very good. I was very impressed with her \nin these negotiations. And two members of my own staff, of course, \nKathy Ruffalo and Tom Sliter. I will not say they are better than the \nothers, but they are very, very good. We have a good team, and we work \nvery well together. I was really struck with just how closely we have \nbeen working together. Senator Warner and Senator Chafee have alluded \nto it, but it is also at the staff level. It is cooperation and it is \nteamwork which I very much look forward to as we work out the 6-year \nbill next year.\n  I thank the chairman and I thank the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I would like to just comment on the legislation which we are passing \nhere, the 6-month extension of the highway legislation. I compliment \nall of the Members on this side who have been involved in these \nnegotiations for their success in bringing about a short-term \nextension.\n  As one of the numerous Members here who has been in correspondence as \nwell as in conversation with the leadership on this issue for the last \nseveral weeks urging a short-term extension, I am pleased that we have \nreached one. As I think all of the participants know, last week when \nthe first effort along these lines was undertaken, I offered, or \nattempted to offer as a substitute, to actually call up the bill which \nhad been passed, Representative Shuster's bill, H.R. 2516. That \nlegislation from the standpoint of my State would have provided more \nfunds, much needed funds for our State of Michigan over the next 6 \nmonths, and I had hoped that perhaps we could have that legislation \nfully considered as part of this process. An objection was raised, and \nI understand the reasons for it, and consequently we did not have the \nopportunity to actually vote on the House legislation. Had we had that \nchance, I would have voted to support it, which is the reason I sought \nto bring it to the floor.\n  Nevertheless, moving forward with an extension of one sort or \nanother--as long as it begins to move us in a direction, from \nMichigan's perspective, of fairness and equity with regard to \ntransportation dollars--was important for us to accomplish for several \nreasons. First, because highway planning and construction need some \nsort of legislative framework in which to operate. In my State of \nMichigan, highway commissioners and contractors are now in a position \nto begin planning for next year's construction season. In addition, of \ncourse, it is vitally important that highway and trucking safety \nprograms are provided the necessary funding to continue operating as \nwell. In addition, this short-term extension does provide new funding \nfor my State, funding which is at a level greater than that which we \nare used to under the current ISTEA formula that has been in effect in \nrecent years.\n  Finally, the legislative extension provides a deadline of July 1 for \nus to pass follow-on legislation to ISTEA. That, in my judgment, will \nlevel the playing field during the legislative process and take away \nthe incentives for some States with high levels of unobligated balances \nto engage in delaying and other types of dilatory tactics in order to \nforce donor States to continue to operate under the old deal, which was \na bad deal.\n  Let me also speak specifically about this legislation's impact on \nMichigan and our funding levels. Under the legislation passed here \ntoday, Michigan will receive $163 million in additional contract \nauthority. This will provide Michigan with a total of $380 million in \nhighway funds through May 1, or $650 million on an annual basis. This \nis $135 million more than Michigan averaged under ISTEA and $130 \nmillion more than we would have received under the original Senate \nformula that was proposed last week.\n  So I thank and compliment our Senate participants here, the \nleadership of the Environment and Public Works Committee, as well as \nthe Subcommittee on Transportation and Public Works for the movement \nthat has taken place since last week. This definitely, from the \nstandpoint of Michigan, is a good start. But I want to stress that I \nsee it as a good start, not the end of the story, as the Senator from \nMontana just indicated. There is much more to be done. A full 6-year \nbill is now the next item for us to consider with respect to \ntransportation funding. Apparently it will be at the beginning of next \nyear's session that we take up that 6-year plan. So I intend to \ncontinue working, as I have\n\n[[Page S12455]]\n\nworked during this process, to ensure that Michigan's return on gas tax \ndollars is more equitable than it has been in the past.\n  Michigan is 1 of the 21 donor States. We have traditionally received \nback as little as 69 cents for every dollar of gas tax we have sent to \nWashington. Our high-water mark is usually, at the best, in the 90-\ncents-back-per-dollar-sent-to-Washington range. But that doesn't happen \nvery often.\n  As a result, the roads, the bridges and the other projects that fall \nunder this legislation in our State have been dramatically underfunded. \nAt the State level, action has been taken this year to provide more \nfunding through an increase in the State gas tax to address in part \nthese problems. But it is equally clear that, unless more funding is \nmade available to Michigan from the Federal level, we will not be able \nto meet all of our transportation obligations as we move into the next \ncentury. The reason we are not receiving the level that we should is a \nresult of the formulas that have been in place and the various other \nsorts of projects that have been in place during recent years.\n  So I stand here today to indicate my continued vigilance on this \nissue, my continued willingness to work with all of the Members on the \nSenate side, and anyone on the House side as well who will be \nparticipating in this process, for the purpose of securing Michigan its \nfair share. For too long we have been sending more highway dollars, \nmore gas tax dollars to Washington than we have been receiving back. \nThat has hurt our State. It is time for that to change. So we will \ncontinue the effort. I look forward to working with Senators Chafee and \nWarner and Baucus and others.\n  In the remarks of the Senator from Virginia, he mentioned certain \nhardship States. I don't think the term ``hardship'' could be more \napplicable than it is to the State of Michigan. We suffer from the fact \nthat our Interstate System is 7 years older on average than the rest of \nthe country's. We have, as a result of the climate and the cold weather \nthat we confront in our winters, far more seasonal challenges than most \nStates must face.\n  For all of these reasons, combined with the fact that we have been a \ndonor State, we do not have the infrastructure transportation system \nthat the citizens of our State deserve. So this Senator will continue \nto work to ensure, when the final decisions are made and when the ISTEA \npackage for 6 years into the future is ultimately resolved, that it \nreflects Michigan's needs, the hardships we have worked under, and the \nlegitimate requirements that we have to address our economic and \ntransportation challenges in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan mentioned that \nhe was going to be vigilant. I can assure everybody within range he has \nbeen vigilant, continuously, on this legislation. As a matter of fact, \nI have not quite gotten to the situation where, when I see him coming \ndown the hall, I will duck into a nearby doorway, but he has pressed \nMichigan's case very, very strongly. When he assures us that he is \ngoing to continue that vigilance, I am not sure I look forward to that \nwith the greatest of pleasure.\n  Nonetheless, he argues his case very, very well in behalf of \nMichigan, and I am sure he will continue that vigorous presentation in \nthe future. So I thank him because he does present his arguments well, \nand that is very, very helpful.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Will the Senator from Rhode Island yield? I would just \nlike to thank the Senator from Rhode Island, as I said. While I know I \nhave been a frequent visitor to his doorstep and to those of the other \nMembers here, he consistently and very graciously listened to our case, \nand we look forward to working with him and thank him for his \nconsideration and his willingness to work with us.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from Montana was so right in \nrecognizing the cooperation of the Members of the House. I worked with \nthem, as did the other Members. Several times we had meetings, \ntelephone calls with Representative Shuster, the chairman of the \ncounterpart committee in the House, Representative Petri, \nRepresentative Oberstar, and Representative Rahall. All of them were \nvery helpful. Obviously, you cannot get a compromise unless you get the \nother side to join in the compromise. Fortunately, they were helpful in \nachieving that.\n  Mr. President, also, when I listed the staff members that we worked \nso closely with, I omitted Brian Riley from the Budget Committee, who \nwas extremely helpful to us. His knowledge and expertise were very, \nvery useful.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure regarding the bill we have before us.\n  Does this bill extend or otherwise reauthorize the inequitable \nformulas that were part of ISTEA?\n  Mr. WARNER. Only insofar as the fiscal year 1997 allocations are a \nreflection of the formulas that were operating in the final year of \nISTEA. However, this bill is formula neutral. We are simply allowing \nStates to use a portion of their unobligated balances with a nominal \namount of new contract authority. This will not and should not change \nany States' relative bargaining position when we finally act on a \nlonger-term authorization bill which provides new obligation authority \nto the States for fiscal year 1998 and beyond.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there anything in this bill that would prejudice \nefforts later in this Congress by me and other Senators from donor \nStates to seek more equitable treatment for our States than we received \nunder ISTEA, such as in Senate amendment No. 1376, which I offered on \nOctober 27.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. This is simply a stopgap measure to allow Federal \nHighway Administration, safety and transit programs, and to distribute \nlimited highway obligation authority to the States so these important \ntransportation programs can continue, albeit at a minimum level. \nFormula changes could occur next year and it is our intent they be \nretroactive.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Lastly, I understand that any contract authority \ndistributed through this bill to a State will be subtracted from each \nState's allocation in fiscal year 1998 and later. Could the Senator \ncomment on that statement?\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. Though this bill cannot bind the \noutcome of the multi-year bill, we have an agreement that any contract \nauthority distributed to a State will count against the amount that \nthat state will be authorized to receive in fiscal year 1998 and \nbeyond.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for his assistance, and his continuing \nhard work on behalf of a fairer highway funding formula.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senators Chafee, Bond, Warner, and \nBaucus are to be commended upon their successful negotiations with the \nHouse to produce a short-term extension to the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA] of 1991. This bill will provide \nthe States with the necessary funding while Congress completes its \nconsideration of a 6-year authorization bill early next year.\n  I am pleased that the agreement authorizes the States to spend up to \n$9.7 billion in highway funds and up to nearly $3 billion in transit \nfunds over the next 7 months. The bill also provides an additional $5.5 \nbillion in advance contract authority for the future continuation of \nour highway program.\n  The bill provides States with flexibility to transfer money among \nprogram categories. The Secretary of Transportation is required to \nensure, however, that all transferred funds be restored to their \noriginal intended use once a long-term bill ISTEA is passed. I intend \nto join with my colleagues to make sure that the Secretary faithfully \ncarries out this directive and that none of ISTEA's key environmental \nprograms, like CMAQ and Enhancements, will suffer because of the \nflexibility granted in this measure. The bill also provides $78.5 \nmillion directly to the metropolitan planning organizations, so they \nwill not be adversely affected by this flexibility provision.\n  New York will be apportioned $325 million in new highway funds and \n$380 million in transit funds. With its existing balances, New York \nwill be able to spend nearly $900 million over the next half year on \ntransportation. I am confident that with this measure, New\n\n[[Page S12456]]\n\nYork will be able to maintain its highway and transit construction \nprogram over the short term.\n  I am concerned, however, that come May, the House and Senate will \nstill not be close to agreement and we will face the need to pass \nanother short-term measure. It is essential that the process for \npassing any future ISTEA extensions be inclusive and address the needs \nof the transit program, which, unlike highways, will have almost no \nunobligated balances by May. ISTEA's goal was to create an intermodal \ntransportation system and I will fight any attempt to divorce highway \nneeds from transit needs.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12450-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12456-S12457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAST-TRACK LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senate is in the process of considering \nfast-track legislation--a take-it-or-leave-it procedure for any trade \nagreements the administration sends to the Congress for approval. This \nprocedure, created back in 1974, prevents Congress from taking any \nsteps to improve trade agreements, even if there is unanimous agreement \nto do so.\n  While it has only been used five times since its creation, Americans \nneed to understand that it amounts to an abdication of Congress' power, \ngranted under article I, section 8 of the Constitution: ``to regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations.''\n  Fast track does not provide the President with negotiating authority. \nThe President already has that authority. Agreements are then submitted \nto Congress for its approval.\n  In fact, this President has concluded over 200 trade agreements since \ntaking office, only 2 of which were approved by Congress under fast-\ntrack procedures.\n  Mr. President, much is at stake in this debate. The issue today is \nhow we can best ensure that all Americans--corporate chiefs, \nshareholders, and workers--can benefit from expanded trade.\n  Supporters of fast-track legislation are misleading the American \npublic when they claim our economic leadership is at stake. Last \nmonth's turmoil in the financial markets provided new evidence that the \nentire world takes its economic cues largely from what happens here in \nAmerica.\n  This is also not a battle that pits free traders versus \nprotectionists. With exports a key part of the U.S. economy, no one is \ndiscounting our economy's global nature. But the fact remains that this \nNation is already the most open market on the Earth. And no one \nopposing fast track today is seeking to raise a tariff wall against \ngoods from other nations.\n  The real issue is what America's trade policy should be for the 21st \ncentury. Do we continue doing things the way we have been doing them \nfor the last 20 years? Or do we find the courage to develop a trade \npolicy that benefits all Americans, from the corporate office to the \nassembly line to the storefront. And do we finally forge a true \npartnership between the executive and legislative branch to develop \ntrade policy?\n  Fast-track supporters maintain that, without the fast-track \nprocedure, Congress will simply amend any trade agreement to death. \nThey say trade agreements involve too many players, are too \ncomplicated, and are too delicate to risk bringing before a Congress \nwhere most Members didn't have direct involvement in the negotiations.\n  This is nonsense. There are many, very complicated and delicate \nissues passed by Congress through the normal legislative process. This \nyear's budget deal is a prime example, There were many players \ninvolved. The subject matter was broad and complex. Most Members did \nnot play a direct role in the negotiations. And the final resolution \ninvolved a delicate compromise that could have easily fallen apart.\n\n  But Congress took up the entire package and passed it. The President \nsigned it and we are now on our way to a balanced budget. I believe the \nsame model could be applied to trade talks.\n  Mr. President, aside from the basic philosophical differences over \nhow this Nation should approach trade policy, the fast-track bill \nreported by the Finance Committee forces the President to negotiate \ntrade agreements in a vacuum. Under this legislation, the President is \nforced to ignore the lack of fair labor standards or adequate \nenvironmental standards in other countries.\n  We should not simply accept the premise that labor and environmental \nstandards have nothing to do with trade. Any business in America \nrecognizes that labor and environmental policy is, in fact, \ncompetitiveness policy. If they didn't believe it, they wouldn't oppose \neven modest increases in the minimum wage. If they didn't believe it, \nthey wouldn't be concerned about new EPA regulations on clean air.\n  But the fact is, they do believe it. And so should Congress when it \ncomes to the labor and environmental policies of our trading partners. \nThey make a difference wherever goods are made, bought, or sold.\n  My colleagues should also be aware that the committee bill requires \nthe President to ignore environmental and labor policy, while at the \nsame time requiring him to negotiate on several other nontrade areas.\n  Patent and copyright law. Monetary policy. Food safety issues. \nGovernment procurement policies. All of these are included in the \nbill's principal negotiating objectives because the committee \nrecognizes that these nontrade areas have an impact on trade.\n  We do use trade agreements to promote more consistent and more \nequitable regulatory systems around the world. And we need to \nrecognize, once and for all, that the nonenforcement--or nonexistence--\nof labor and environmental standards jeopardizes American jobs and \nindustry just as much as the nonenforcement and nonexistence of \nintellectual property laws.\n  One of the first agreements that would come before the Senate under \nfast track would be the accession of Chile to the NAFTA. So, it's fair \nto ask how well this agreement, negotiated and adopted under fast-track \nprocedures, has operated for our country.\n  One year before the implementation of NAFTA, the United States had a \ntrade surplus with Mexico of about $2 billion. Last year, the United \nStates had a trade deficit with Mexico of nearly $17 billion--a $19 \nbillion shift in trade over a 3-year period. The administration claims \nthat 120,000 to 160,000 jobs have been created as a result of NAFTA. \nBut the Labor Department's NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nhas certified 136,000 workers as having lost their jobs as a result of \nNAFTA. Other estimates, including a recent one by the Economic Policy \nInstitute, put the number at 400,000 jobs lost.\n  By far, the hardest hit has been the apparel sector, which has lost \n158,000 workers in the last 28 months as apparel imports from Mexico \nhave doubled.\n  NAFTA certainly has been a success--for Mexico. Unfortunately, \nAmerica has fared much worse under the agreement.\n  Fast-track supporters argue that if we don't act now to expand the \nNAFTA to include Chile, and, ultimately, other South American \ncountries, we will cede our leadership and fall behind to other trading \npartners.\n  But listen to what the pro-NAFTA 20th Century Fund has to say about \nthe cost of not expanding NAFTA:\n\n       What are the costs to the United States if NAFTA is not \n     expanded? . . . Despite the growth of intraregional trade \n     outside the NAFTA, the costs to the United States of failing \n     to expand NAFTA are not high in strictly economic terms. \n     Whatever occurs on the trade front, the United States will \n     remain the region's dominant economy. NAFTA represents 75% of \n     trade in the hemisphere. . .And NAFTA's exports and imports \n     are more than ten times those of Mercosur, the next largest \n     regional organization.\n\n  And the facts bear out what the 20th Century Fund says. In the past \nyear, without fast track and without new trade agreements, our trade \nsurplus with South America has doubled, to $3.6 billion.\n  As bad as the national numbers are, they are still worse for my own \nState of Kentucky. Exports to Mexico account for just 3 percent of all \nKentucky's exports and support just 950 jobs, according to the pro-\nNAFTA\n\n[[Page S12457]]\n\nCouncil of the Americas. NAFTA resulted in an increase of just 4 \nmillion dollars' worth of exports to Mexico from Kentucky.\n  Unfortunately, the other side of the equation--imports from Mexico--\nhas had a much more immediate and devastating impact on Kentucky. In \n1993, over 30,000 Kentuckians worked in the apparel industry. Today, \nthere are just 25,000 Kentucky apparel workers. The layoffs began soon \nafter NAFTA passed and continue to this day. Just this past August, a \nmajor apparel manufacturer in my State laid off 2,000 workers.\n  When these jobs are lost and plants close, it is simply devastating \nto whole communities in Kentucky. I'd like to share with my colleagues \nan account of the plant closings we've suffered in Kentucky.\n  An August 8 story in the Louisville Courier-Journal talked about the \nlatest blow to Kentucky's garment industry. Layoffs by Fruit of the \nLoom of 2,000 workers represents the latest loss to what the paper \ndescribed as the ``hemorrhaging garment-industry'' in Kentucky. ``At \nFruit of the Loom alone, employment will have fallen from 11,000 2 \nyears ago to 5,000 by the time the latest round of layoffs is completed \n* * *.''\n  The vice president of Fruit of the Loom was blunt in his assessment. \n``We're being impacted by global competition resulting from \ninternational trade barriers. We can do the same work cheaper somewhere \nelse.''\n  Bill Parsons, executive director of the Lake Cumberland Area \nDevelopment District where Fruit of the Loom is located, agrees.\n\n       Why would any good businessman want to stay in the U.S., \n     where its going to cost $8.48 an hour to make a garment you \n     can make for 48 cents somewhere else? It makes a lot of \n     business sense when you're looking at the bottom line.\n\n  David and NaDena Agee know first-hand about the bottom-line. Another \nCourier-Journal story tells how they ``have a mortgage on a house they \nbought two years ago when they were both making good salaries at the \nFruit of the Loom Plant in Campbellsville. They also have a 19-month-\nold son who is growing up fast. But after October 8, neither David nor \nNaDena will have a job because of continuing layoffs at the plant. They \nare worried about how they will provide for their son.''\n\n  Instead of telling hardworking Americans like the Agees how fast \ntrack will assure them of a stable future, supporters of fast track are \nsimply looking the other way.\n  Mr. President, I understand that international trade is not just \nconfined to NAFTA. But proponents of fast track won't find a convincing \nargument on the other side of the world either.\n  Our trade deficit is enormous and growing. In 1995, our trade deficit \nrang in at $105 billion. Last year's deficit was still higher--$114 \nbillion. And this year we are on our way to our fourth consecutive year \nof record high trade deficits. The monthly trade deficit has increased \neach month this year except June.\n  Why do we have such enormous deficit? In the past, the experts have \nchalked it up to our persistent and large budget deficits. But now that \nwe are in our fifth year of declining budget deficits and on our way to \na balanced budget, that explanation has fallen out of favor.\n  Now, the experts are prepared to tell us the reason is a low savings \nrate compared to other countries--even though many of those other \ncountries with higher savings rates don't have a Social Security \nsystem, as we do.\n  It seems any explanation of a trade deficit will do, so long as it \nhas no connection to our trade policy. But that, in this Senator's \nmind, is where the problem is: our trade policy seems too often to be \ncrafted for the benefit of other nations.\n  Month after month, I receive letters from Kentucky businesses asking \nfor an end to a trade barrier an international trade agreement was \nsupposed to resolve. This year, for example, I have received letters \nthat: called for an end to Canada's exploitation of a NAFTA loophole to \ninundate the U.S. with wool suits made of Chinese fabric; demanded the \nPhilippines implement a WTO decision against that country's system of \nusing import licenses to keep American pork out; decried China's de \nfacto ban on pork and tobacco products; called for better enforcement \nof our flat glass agreement with Japan; and, opposed the EU's proposal \nto accelerate the phase out of CFC's in an effort to disadvantage U.S. \nexports.\n  Mr. President, violations of existing agreements are particularly \ncostly in the textile and apparel sector, where 4 to 10 billion \ndollars' worth of goods are illegally shipped to the United States. \nCountries like China and India routinely illegally label and ship their \nproducts through a third country in order to avoid an agreed upon \nquota.\n  Let me share a specific example of the noncompliance I'm talking \nabout. After the enactment of the Uruguay round, the United States \nbrought a case against Japan. Japan maintained a tax system designed to \ndiscourage the sale of imported distilled spirits, including Kentucky \nbourbon.\n  In November, 1996, the WTO found that the Japanese system violated \nthe principal of national treatment--that a participating nation must \naccord imported and domestic products the same treatment.\n  How did Japan respond? Japan agreed to make the necessary changes to \nits tax law--by the year 2001, five years after the WTO decision! So \nnow, the Japanese and American Governments are in negotiations over how \nlong it's going to take Japan to fix a law it should never have adopted \nin the first place. What's more, there is now talk that the United \nStates may accept ``compensation'' for Japan's refusal to amend its \nlaw. This would mean that U.S. distilled spirits exporters won't get a \nthing out of an agreement that was supposed to win them market access.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by reiterating what brings me and \nother fast-track opponents to the floor. It's not because we want to \nraise up new tariff walls. It's not because we are isolationists. It's \nnot because we want to protect jobs from any competition whatsoever. \nIt's simply because our trade policy has not been a good one for the \npeople of my State, nor the vast majority of States.

A bill to assess the impact of NAFTA, require the \nrenegotiation of certain provisions of NAFTA, and provide for the \nwithdrawal from NAFTA unless certain conditions are met; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                        nafta accountability act\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the North American Free-Trade Agreement \nis an example of trade agreements established under fast-track \nprocedures, then it should be no surprise that the vast majority of \nAmerican citizens oppose renewing fast-track authority to the \nPresident.\n  An editorial published earlier this year in the Bismarck, ND Tribune \nstated that before Congress grants fast-track authority to the \nPresident, ``The American people deserve a much better accounting than \nwe have received so far of the impact of the first three years of the \nNAFTA.''\n  The question of accountability and the performance of our Nation's \ncurrent trade policies is the underlying issue in the debate whether \nthis Congress should provide renewed fast-track authority.\n  In a few weeks we will mark the fourth anniversary of the passage of \nNAFTA by Congress. It is not surprising that the proponents of fast \ntrack do not want to associate fast track with NAFTA. The simple fact \nis that NAFTA has been an unmitigated failure.\n  At a time when we have been hearing new promises being made to \nadvance the cause of fast track, we need to remember the promises that \nwere made to gain the passage of NAFTA.\n  We were promised increased exports, a greater number of jobs, and \nthat these jobs would be higher paying jobs. We were promised improved \nliving standards, reduced trade distortions, and improved \ncompetitiveness for the United States in North America and global \nmarkets. At the same time, the American public was promised that the \nenvironment would be protected, that drugs would be interdicted, that \npublic welfare would be safeguarded, and basic human rights would be \nenhanced.\n  Yet, the facts show that NAFTA just doesn't measure up to its \npromises. The very first measure of failure is demonstrated in our \ntrade balances with our NAFTA trading partners. The United States has \ngone from having a $2 billion trade surplus prior to NAFTA with Mexico \nto a $16 billion deficit this past year. At the same time, our trade \ndeficit with Canada has more than doubled, escalating from $11 billion \nto $23 billion.\n  In its editorial review of NAFTA, the Bismarck Tribune concluded, \n``There has been enough pain associated with NAFTA and other trade \nagreements for Americans to insist on a scorecard we can read and \nunderstand before we go further.''\n  I agree that we need a scorecard. It is for this reason that I am \nintroducing the NAFTA Accountability Act today, together with Senators \nByrd, Campbell, Hollings, Inouye, Wellstone, and Snowe.\n  We need accountability. Promises that are made should be fulfilled. \nIf they aren't, we need to go back to the drawing board and make the \nchanges that are necessary to achieve the goals and promises that were \noriginally set forth in NAFTA's preamble and statement of objectives.\n  This bill would establish benchmarks by which we could score NAFTA, \nincluding expanded markets, currency stability, jobs wages and living \nstandards, U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, health and environment, \nillegal drugs, protection of rights, fair agricultural trade, and \nhighway safety.\n  If NAFTA does not meet these benchmarks as promised, then the United \nStates would provide notice and withdraw from NAFTA. In addition, the \nbill authorizes and directs the President to renegotiate provisions of \nNAFTA to correct trade deficits and currency distortions, to correct \njob loss, to protect public health and the environment, to interdict \ndrug traffic, to correct agricultural provisions, and to ensure \ncompliance with U.S. transportation standards.\n\n[[Page S12462]]\n\n  We have watched our trade deficits with our NAFTA partners grow by \n433 percent since this trade agreement took effect. The growth in these \ntrade deficits mean that this Nation has suffered job losses. A recent \nanalysis by the Economic Policy Institute concludes that there has been \na net loss of 395,000 U.S. jobs as a result of NAFTA. In fact, the \nstudy demonstrates that every State has suffered net job losses as a \nresult of the increased trade deficits under NAFTA.\n  These job losses range from 633 job losses in my home State of North \nDakota to 38,406 job losses in California. Now 633 jobs may not sound \nlike much, but that is twice the size of my hometown of Regent. ND. If \na new employer provided that many jobs in an economic development \nprogram, it would be considered a major accomplishment in my State.\n  States which had significant production in automobiles, computers, \nelectrical appliances, textiles, and apparel had jobs losses \ndisproportionate to their share of overall U.S. job losses.\n  It should be noted that 228,000 of these job losses were attributed \nto the trade deficits with Mexico, while 167,000 of these job losses \nresulted from deficits with Canada. If we remember the promises of \nNAFTA, the promises were that this trade agreement would result in at \nleast 220,000 high-paying jobs.\n\n  I am always intrigued by those that only look at one side of the \ntrade ledger, and never account for the net trade balance. \nUnfortunately, we cannot get a good picture of this because the \nCommerce Department only makes estimates of exports on a State-by-State \nbasis. There is no data compiled on a State-by-State basis of foreign \nimports. As a result, there is not even a statistical basis on which to \nlook at the full ledger on trade balances on a State-by-State basis.\n  However, we can make some general comparisons that can be helpful. \nFor example, one widely distributed study indicates that North Dakota \nranked third among the States in increased exports to Mexico. While \nthat sounds pretty fantastic, it also needs to be put into context. The \n320-percent increase in annual exports from North Dakota to Mexico is \nfrom the base of $3.0 million which has now grown to $9.7 million in \nexports. While the increases are substantial as a percentage, they are \nnot very significant in dollars terms in the State's overall economy. \nIn fact, another economic analysis indicates that North Dakota had a \ntrade deficit with Mexico in the neighborhood of $3.4 million.\n  Similarly, the export study reports that North Dakota had an increase \nof 35 percent in exports to Canada from $298 million to $402 million. \nBefore we conclude that North Dakota is doing well as a result of \nNAFTA, we need to look at other pieces of my State's economy.\n  While North Dakota experienced an annual increase of $114 million in \nexport sales to our NAFTA partners, at the same time North Dakota is \nlosing $222 million annually in income from the unfair export of \nCanadian durum wheat and barley into the United States. In other words, \nthe loss of annual agricultural income in a couple of farm commodities \nalone has cost North Dakota almost twice as it has gained in increased \nexport sales.\n  I want to note that one of the provisions of the NAFTA Accountability \nAct would require the President to renegotiate the terms of NAFTA to \nprevent Canadian grain exports from unfairly displacing United States \nproduction. This is just one of many provisions within this legislation \nthat would require that the promises made to secure the passage of \nNAFTA be kept.\n  Unfortunately, the American public did not get a warranty on the \npromises when NAFTA was passed. That is why they are rightfully \nskeptical of further fast-track trade procedures and the expansion of \nNAFTA. As indicated in the Bismarck Tribune editorial, Americans need a \nscorecard before we continue to go down on our current trade policy \ntrack. I would urge my colleagues to join me as sponsors of the NAFTA \nAccountability Act so that Americans would have that scorecard, as well \nas the means by which to make necessary corrections to NAFTA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1515. A bill to amend Public Law 89-108 to increase authorization \nlevels for State and Indian tribal, municipal, rural, and industrial \nwater supplies, to meet current and future water quantity and quality \nneeds of the Red River Valley, to deauthorize certain project features \nand irrigation service areas, to enhance natural resources and fish and \nwildlife habitat, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                 the dakota water resources act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Dorgan, the Dakota Water Resources Act of 1997. This is \nlandmark legislation for our home State of North Dakota. The \nlegislation that we are introducing amends the 1986 Garrison Diversion \nReformulation Act and fundamentally shifts the focus of the project \nfrom large-scale irrigation to delivery of drinking water to \ncommunities in our State and to our four Indian reservations.\n  The Dakota water Resources project is necessary to assure the \ncitizens of North Dakota an adequate supply of quality water for \nmunicipal, rural and industrial [MR] uses. In fact, without these \namendments to the 1986 Garrison Act, many communities in North Dakota \nwill be forced to be without clean and reliable water supplies. The \nimportance of a clean, safe water supply cannot be overstated. The \nimprovement of our water quality and the adequacy of future water \nsupplies is critical to the economic future of North Dakota.\n  I direct the attention of my colleagues to this chart, which shows \nthe difference between water supplies that is not atypical for rural \nNorth Dakota. This is a jar that has the water in many rural parts of \nour State, because the ground water is just not of high quality. This \nshows the water delivered to rural North Dakotans via pipeline. I think \nthis tells the story. North Dakota needs safe, clean, reliable water. \nThe bill we are introducing today is designed to deliver it.\n  Water development is essential for economic development, agriculture, \nrecreation and improving the environment. This legislation will provide \nan adequate and dependable water supply throughout North Dakota, \nincluding communities in the Red River Valley. Water is an essential \nresource to sustain the population and economic growth of that region. \nA portion of the funding will also fund irrigation projects in North \nDakota and on the Indian Reservations, as well as the development of \nfish and wildlife projects.\n  The U.S. Senate is well aware of the history of failed promises on \nwater development projects on the Missouri River. People of our State \nand on reservations have sacrificed 550,000 acres of land, including \nhomes, farms, and in many cases their livelihoods, for flood protection \ndownstream. The Federal Government has failed to live up to its side of \nthe bargain.\n  I ask the Senate today, please look at this legislation; let us have \na debate and a discussion, but do not fail to honor the promises the \nFederal Government made to North Dakota. To compensate North Dakota for \nthe loss of 550,000 acres of valuable Missouri River bottom land due to \nthe construction of the Garrison and Oahe Dams, the Garrison diversion \nproject was authorized in 1965. It was to provide affordable access to \nMissouri River water as a basic element of the State's long-range plans \nfor water management and development. That promise has not been kept.\n  The next chart I have here shows the areas of our State that would be \nbenefited by the legislation we are introducing today. This chart shows \nthe northwest area water supply project, the Southwest pipeline \nproject, and the other areas of the State, including the Red River \nValley, that would have safe, clean, dependable sources of water as a \nresult of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, North Dakotans are fully committed to a scaled back, \nmodernized project. Within the State of North Dakota we have worked \nlong and hard to produce a new project. The MR focus of the Dakota \nwater resources project is the best way to move forward. It represents \nthe best potential to meet North Dakota's water needs. We realized 6 \nyears ago that the Garrison project of 1986 would never attain its \noriginal goals. Since that time the relevant interests in North Dakota \nhave engaged in a bipartisan effort to reformulate Federal law to \naddress the\n\n[[Page S12463]]\n\ncontemporary and future water needs of our State.\n  I believe this legislation will provide water to communities in need \nin North Dakota in an environmentally sensitive manner. It is important \nto note that we have involved representatives of the conservation \ncommunity from both the national and State level to develop the \nlegislation we introduce today. We are especially pleased to have the \nsupport of the North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society for this \nlegislation.\n  I also want to assure our neighbors to the north, in Canada, that we \nwill abide by international obligations. The Dakota Water Resources Act \ncontains provisions to ensure compliance with the Boundary Water Treaty \nof 1909 between the United States and Canada.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to highlight some \nof the provisions in the Dakota Water Resources Act.\n  The Dakota Water Resources Act authorizes $300 million for MR \nprojects across North Dakota and an additional $200 million for MR \nprojects on the four Indian reservations within the State. These MR \nprojects are essential to ensure a safe and clean water supply \nthroughout North Dakota.\n  This legislation also includes $200 million to meet the comprehensive \nwater quality and quantity needs of the Red River Valley. Also, the \nbill stipulates that the State of North Dakota will select one or more \nproject features from options identified to meet those needs, including \nthe delivery of Missouri River water to the Red River Valley.\n  This legislation includes debt forgiveness for the State of North \nDakota for costs of previously constructed facilities that will not be \nutilized or will be only partially utilized.\n  This legislation includes $40 million for the construction of the \nFour Bears Bridge across Lake Sakakawea within the Fort Berthold Indian \nReservation. Lake Sakakawea is the body of water which was created by \nthe construction of Garrison Dam. The resulting lake not only flooded \nvaluable farmland on the reservation, but divided the reservation. The \ncurrent bridge, which is the only route to cross Lake Sakakawea, is \nfunctionally inadequate and cannot handle current traffic flows. The \nstructure poses a significant safety hazard and hampers access to \nemergency and medical services.\n  The Dakota Water Resources Act contains numerous provisions to ensure \nthat this project is constructed in an environmentally-sensitive \nmanner. The legislation permits the State to establish a water \nconservation program, utilizing funds provided for MR Also, this \nbill includes $25 million for a Natural Resources Trust, currently the \nWetlands Trust, and an authorization of $1.5 million to fund a wetlands \ninterpretive center. The purpose of the trust is to preserve, enhance, \nrestore and manage wetlands and associated wildlife habitat, grassland \nconservation and riparian areas in the State of North Dakota.\n  This legislation contains other important provisions, including: \nauthorization of $5,000,000 for recreation projects in North Dakota; \nauthorization for a study of bank stabilization along the Missouri \nRiver below Garrison Dam; designation of the current Lonetree Reservoir \nas a wildlife conservation area; a requirement for the Federal \nGovernment to pay for operation and maintenance on mitigation lands; \ndeauthorization of certain irrigation areas; additional flexibility for \nthe Indian tribes in determining irrigation sites within the \nreservations; ensures no increase for rural electric cooperatives using \npower generated by the dams on the Missouri River; and a provision that \n``upon transfer of the Oakes Test Area to the State of North Dakota, \nbut not later than one year after enactment of this act Federal funds \nauthorized by this act may not be used to subsidize the irrigation of \nany crop at the Oakes Test Area.''\n  The Dakota Water Resources Act represents a significant bipartisan \neffort within North Dakota to meet the contemporary and future water \nquantity and quality needs of our State and provide for the long-term \neconomic development of North Dakota.\n  I look forward to working with the members and staff of the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee on this legislation, \nspecifically Senator Murkowski and Senator Bumpers, the chairman and \nranking member respectively. I also look forward to discussing the need \nfor the Dakota Water Resources Act with my Senate colleagues and would \ninvite their support for this legislation that is essential for the \nfuture of North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has the unanimous support of the \ncongressional delegation, the Governor, state legislative leaders, \ntribal leaders, North Dakota water interests, and the North Dakota \nRural Electric Cooperatives. It also has the support of a major state \nconservation group and mayors of the major affected cities. The Dakota \nWater Resources Act is the consensus product of an extensive \nnegotiating process.\n  I want to express my personal appreciation to each of the State \nelected leaders who served as the State negotiating team. I am deeply \ngrateful for their efforts. They were undertaken in good faith, in a \nbipartisan spirit because we recognize the critical importance of the \ncompletion of this project for the future economic health and strength \nof our State.\n  Our State leaders have come together in an unprecedented way. I am \nsubmitting for the Record, and I will ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record after my statement and after the bill, the \nletters of support, including a letter signed by Senator Dorgan, \nCongressman Pomeroy, Governor Schafer, North Dakota Senate majority \nleader Gary Nelson, North Dakota Senate minority leader Tim Mathern, \nNorth Dakota House majority leader John Dorso, and North Dakota House \nminority leader Merle Boucher as well as myself. The eight of us served \nas the State negotiating team.\n  In addition to that, I am proud to say we have letters of support of \nthe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Spirit Lake Tribe, the Turtle \nMountain Band of Chippewa Indians, and three affiliated tribes.\n  We will also submit for the Record separate letters from the North \nDakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society, the Garrison Diversion \nConservancy District, the North Dakota Water Users Association, the \nCities of Grand Forks, Fargo, Minot, Dickinson, and Williston, the \nSouthwest Water Authority, the North Dakota Water Resource Districts \nAssociation, the Souris River Joint Water Resource Board, the West \nRiver Joint Water Resource Board, the Devils Lake Basin Joint Water \nResource Board, the North Dakota Association of Rural Electric \nCooperatives, the Greater North Dakota Association, which is the North \nDakota Chamber of Commerce, the Fargo Chamber of Commerce, the \nIndustrial Development Association of North Dakota, and the North \nDakota Education Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record following my remarks and before the legislation itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this outpouring of support is \nunprecedented. In essence, our citizens are saying to Washington, take \nnote. This is essential for our future.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to say that in addition to many fine \npeople in North Dakota who helped in the crafting of this legislation, \nI want to recognize the special efforts of staff members of mine who \nworked long and hard to produce these results: Robert Van Heuvelen, \nDerik Fettig, Kirk Johnson, and Mary Knapp.\n  Their dedication in getting amendments drafted has contributed \ntremendously to the positive product we are introducing today. They \nhave been instrumental in forging the consensus which is a hallmark of \nthis legislation. Through careful attention to detail, endless rounds \nof communications with all interested parties and preparation of myriad \nof drafts, these four professionals have made a real mark. As many in \nNorth Dakota will attest, Robert, Derik, Kirk, and Mary exemplify the \nfinest that we find among congressional staff. I thank them for their \ncontribution today.\n  In addition to my own staff, I want to take this moment to also thank \nthree other outstanding congressional staffers for their help in \nachieving this result: Doug Norell, the legislative director for \nSenator Dorgan, Andrea\n\n[[Page S12464]]\n\nNygren, Ruth Fleischer, and Mike Eggl of Senator Dorgan's staff, Karen \nFrederickson and Amy Goffe, the chief of staff and legislative \nassistant, respectively, for North Dakota Congressman Earl Pomeroy. \nThis has been a collaborative effort among the delegation, the State's \nelected leaders and their staffs. And I thank them for it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the \npresentation by my colleague, Senator Conrad. He is presenting today, \nand I join him in presenting, a picture of water issues in North Dakota \nthat are critically important to the future of our State. I would like \nto describe for my colleagues why this is the case and what we propose \nto do to respond to the water needs of our region.\n  We live in a semiarid State, Mr. President. North Dakota gets 15 to \n17 inches of rainfall a year. About 100 years ago, John Wesley Powell \ntold the North Dakota Constitutional Convention in the year 1888 that \nNorth Dakota would have a series of years when they would have abundant \ncrops, and then for 2 or 3 years, they would have less rainfall. There \nwill be failure of crops, and disaster will come on thousands of people \nwho will become discouraged and leave.\n  That is the history of those who live on the border between humid and \narid lands.\n  This is a picture showing some of the crusted dirt of parched soil \nthat has not had enough moisture. What has happened in our State is \nexactly what was predicted a century ago. We are a wonderful, bountiful \nagricultural State, but we do suffer being a semiarid State with the \nlack of rainfall, lack of water. We wanted to try to do something about \nthat, to provide some stability.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, held up a picture that \nshowed water in jars. It is interesting, I come from southwestern North \nDakota and know a lot about the water-quality issue Senator Conrad was \ntalking about. A fellow brought a jar of water to one of our hearings, \nand he sat the jar on the table. You would have sworn it was tobacco \njuice; if not tobacco juice, at least strong coffee; and if not strong \ncoffee, very strong tea. But, no, that jar of brown water was his \ndrinking water. It was from his well.\n  We suffer water-quality problems in addition to the lack of water in \nNorth Dakota, which is a semiarid State. We have known now for a \ncentury the consequences of that. The consequences of that are imposed \nupon our economic well-being in a State that is a wonderful State, but \nsuffers from having 42 of its 53 counties declining in population. Only \n11 counties have a growing population.\n\n  Mr. President, I come from a county in southwestern North Dakota. It \nhad a population of 5,000 when I left. It now has a population of \n3,000. The neighboring county, about the same size as my home county, \nis called Slope County. It is the size of the State of Rhode Island in \nlandmass. Nine hundred citizens live in Slope County, and last year \nthere were only seven babies born in Slope County. I say that just to \ngive people an understanding of the size of our State and what is \nhappening in some of the rural counties where the population is \nshrinking and we are seeing outmigration. Yet we are a State that is \nrecognized as one of the most bountiful agricultural States in America.\n  Something happened in the 1940's that portended for us a change. What \nhappened in the 1940's was the discussion of the Pick-Sloan plan that \nwould create flood control down the reaches of the Missouri River with \na series of dams. In 1943, there was a great flood on the Missouri \nRiver, and it crippled the delivery of supplies for American troops \nfighting in World War II to the gulf ports. It brought home, more than \nanything, the need for reliable transportation and navigation on the \nriver, for reliable flood control on the river.\n  From it was born the Pick-Sloan plan to try to harness the Missouri \nRiver and create a series of dams that would provide flood control and \na range of other benefits.\n  As part of that plan, we were told in North Dakota, because the \nFederal Government wishes to harness the Missouri River and create six \ndams in order to do so, we would like you in North Dakota to do us a \nfavor. We would like you to host a flood that comes and stays. We would \nlike to create a 500,000-acre flood in North Dakota, about the size of \nthe State of Rhode Island. We want to take a Rhode Island-size flood, \nput it in your State by backing up the river with a dam and you keep it \nthere. A flood that comes and stays forever.\n  North Dakotans thought about that a little bit and said, ``Gee, so \nyou want to give us a Rhode Island-size flood, what does that mean for \nus?''\n  The Federal Government said, ``Well, you need to understand the \nsecond half of this. We would like you to host a flood that comes and \nstays, but we propose to give you a very significant benefit. You are a \nsemiarid State. We would like you to be able to take water from behind \nthat dam and from that flood and move it all around your State in order \nto deal with water quality and water accessibility and irrigation all \nacross your State.''\n  The people of North Dakota thought, ``Gosh, that sounds like a really \ngood deal, something needed in our State.''\n  From that was born the Garrison Diversion Project. Behind the \nGarrison Dam, the ability to divert water all around our State to \nirrigate, provide good quality drinking water, to provide assured \nsupplies of water for municipal and industrial use in cities and, yes, \neven in the eastern part of our State who are served by the Red River, \nwhich has run dry in the past. All of that sounded good to North \nDakota, so we got the flood.\n  Elbow Woods--where my dad lived as a young boy and used to herd \nhorses up on the Indian reservation--Elbow Woods doesn't exist anymore. \nIt is a community that is gone because now where Elbow Woods stood is a \nlake, a flood. Elbow Woods and other communities were flooded, and the \nIndian population moved to the upland, so the flood came and stayed.\n  But when President Eisenhower went out to dedicate the dam that held \nback the water and created the flood and the people were moved and we \nhad the Rhode Island-size flood, it took a while for the benefits to \ncome to North Dakota. We had the cost now. The cost was this flood, but \nthe benefits were something else. The benefits kept shrinking and \nshrinking because controversy developed, and finally we passed a piece \nof legislation in 1965 and another one in 1986 to try to make sure that \nwe got the benefits we were promised.\n\n  At least part of the benefits were to, for example, move water \nthroughout North Dakota. From the 1986 act, we finally have water \ncoming to southwestern North Dakota. We have a plan to move water to \nnorthwestern North Dakota. These areas are areas from where we see this \npicture about the drinking water that looks like tobacco juice. This \nnow represents an area that is getting water from the Missouri River, \ngood quality water moved to all these communities, which helps them \nenormously. But more needs to be done. We cannot finish the project and \ncomplete the promise given to our State until we enact changes once \nmore in the Garrison diversion legislation.\n  It has been enormously controversial. Canada has objected; \nenvironmental groups have objected. So we put together a group of \nelected officials who are the elected leaders of North Dakota--the \nGovernor, the congressional delegation, the Republicans and Democrats \nwho are leaders in the State legislature--House and Senate--and we \ncreated a negotiating team. All of us, which is pretty unusual, sat \naround a table for many, many months at various periods and negotiated \na bipartisan solution that will finish this plan for North Dakota. When \nfinished, we hope it will provide this kind of sight all across our \nState in small towns and big towns, on farms, in cities--clean drinking \nwater enjoyed by North Dakota, opportunities from water delivery to all \nparts of our State. That is what we hope the benefits of this plan will \nbe.\n  I have taken some time to give a much broader history of how we have \ngotten to this point, simply because I want people to understand, this \ndoes not have as its origin in our State coming to Washington saying, \n``Give us something, please; we'd like you to give us a plan, please.'' \nThat was not the origin. The origin was the Federal\n\n[[Page S12465]]\n\nGovernment going to North Dakota saying, ``Please play host to a flood \nthe size of the State of Rhode Island that will be forever in your \nState, and we will promise you that you will get from that an \nopportunity to move good quality water throughout the State for \nmunicipal, rural, and industrial purposes, and for irrigation.''\n  What has happened to us is we bore the cost of the flood, but we \nnever received the full flower of the benefits that were promised us \nunder the act.\n  Senator Conrad and I and our colleague, Congressman Pomeroy, in the \nHouse, today offer a bipartisan piece of legislation that will, if \ncompleted, finally allow us to realize the full benefits of this \nproject.\n  I am not going to go into all the details of it except to say that \nthe compromise that we offer finally allows us to connect the \nwaterworks, to get water to eastern North Dakota, and an assured supply \nof water for some of the largest communities in North Dakota that live \nalong the Red River.\n  It addresses in a very significant way the concerns that were \nexpressed by environmental organizations. It addresses the issues that \nwere raised by a number of others who have had concerns about the \nproject. In short, it says, let us finish this project in a way that \nsatisfies the interests and needs of North Dakota, but also do it in a \nway that addresses the concerns others have raised about this project.\n  This project is fiscally responsible. It would in fact, if completed \nthe way we envision, cut nearly $200 million from the current \nauthorization. So we are talking about completing a project in a \ndifferent way but cutting up to $200 million from the current \nauthorized level for this project. The Act provides substantial \nenvironmental benefits, incentives for water conservation, the creation \nof a natural resources trust, and additional incentives for the State \nto establish and meet other specified conservation goals. So it \nprovides substantial environmental benefits.\n  We believe that the cooperative effort with the congressional \ndelegation and the State's political leaders have vastly strengthened \nthis bill. I want to commend especially the North Dakota chapter of the \nWildlife Society, which, incidentally, wrote a letter saying: ``We \nsupport this compromise. This compromise meets the test of being \nenvironmentally sound.''\n  The third test this bill meets is that it provides more in economic \ndevelopment than natural resource enhancement alone. Water is necessary \nfor all life, but in a semi-arid plain State it is critical.\n  I began this description by talking about the outmigration from rural \ncounties and the desperate need to try to pump some economic life into \nthose counties. One way to do that is to have an assured supply of good \nwater. The fourth test this bill meets is project completion. This \nfinally would complete the project and allow North Dakota to realize \nthe full promise that the Federal Government gave North Dakota.\n  Finally, our bill represents a rare consensus among all the major \nparticipants in State water development and conservation. It is a rare \nthing, I suppose, to hear these days that this is a bipartisan plan. It \nis the product of Republicans and Democrats sitting around a table, not \ndescribing themselves as partisans, not describing themselves by their \npolitical party, but describing themselves as leaders serving North \nDakota's long-term interests. We did that. And I am very pleased with \nthe result.\n  Senator Conrad described the support across North Dakota. And we are \ngoing to put in the Congressional Record the letters of support from \nall of the people who have written us, communities and many, many \nothers, for this project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for in excess of 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to finish in 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Finally, Mr. President, let me add my compliments to \nSenator Conrad himself. Senator Conrad has played an instrumental role \nin getting us to this point. We would not be here without Senator \nConrad's leadership. Let me also commend Senator Conrad's staff, and \nlet me echo the words of praise that Senator Conrad gave to Doug \nNorell, the legislative director of my staff, and Ruth Fleischer and \nAndrea Nygren, and so many others.\n  Congressman Pomeroy has played a critically important role here. \nGovernor Schafer, the state legislative leaders, State senator Tim \nMathern, State representative Merle Boucher, State representative John \nDorso, State senator Gary Nelson all were important in getting us to \nthis point.\n\n  My hope is that we will now begin a process to move this legislation, \nhave some hearings, and I hope at the end of this struggle--I am not \nsure when that end will occur; it is not clear that this is going to \nmove quickly--but at the end of this struggle we in North Dakota will \nbe able to look back and say, it was a long, hard fight, but we got \nwhat was promised for our State. And not only did we get what was \npromised, but it was important, critically important, for the long-term \neconomy of North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me just thank my colleague, Senator \nDorgan. Senator Dorgan and his staff have worked tirelessly to produce \nthis result. This isn't something we have just worked on the last few \nmonths. This has been an effort of 6 years to bring us to this point. \nIt is remarkable to have brought together such a broad cross-section of \nthe State of North Dakota in support of a project as significant as \nthis one.\n  I just want to thank my colleague for all of his efforts and all of \nhis leadership. He was involved in the 1986 reformulation. He early on \nrecognized that we had an additional opportunity here to have something \ndevelop that would secure the economic future of our State.\n  I think we should also acknowledge that we understand we face a tough \nstruggle to pass this legislation. We know that we have determined \nopponents downstream, that we have other opponents as well, certain \nnational environmental organizations. And the State of Minnesota and \nour neighbors to the north in Canada all have expressed reservations. \nBut we have done our level best to address their concerns. We have \nbrought forward a project that is environmentally sensitive, that is \nfiscally sound, and does meet the current and long-term water needs of \nthe State of North Dakota, all within the context of changing what has \nalready been approved by Congress.\n  Senator Dorgan made the point and made it well. We have an approved \nproject that is even a bigger project than what we are proposing here \ntoday, but it is unlikely to ever be built. Now is the time to step \nforward and to propose reasonable alternatives that are alternatives \nthat would secure the long-term interests of the State of North Dakota.\n  So, again, I want to especially thank my colleague from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It might be useful to discuss the plans as we proceed. We \nintroduced the legislation today here in the Senate. It will be \nconcurrently introduced in the House of Representatives by our \ncolleague, Congressman Pomeroy. At that point my expectation would be \nthat we will want to hold some hearings.\n  This will likely be referred--without doing the Parliamentarian's \njob, I assume will be referred--to the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee on which I sit. We expect to request some hearings \nby the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. My expectation is \nwe would want to perhaps hold some North Dakota hearings with the joint \nleadership in North Dakota to have an opportunity to further discuss \nthis project.\n  I want to emphasize something Senator Conrad just indicated. There \nwill be opposition. This is a bipartisan approach, but there will be \nopposition.\n  There is this old story about the radio announcer who was \ninterviewing an old guy, some 85-year-old codger. And he said, ``You've \nseen a lot of changes in your life, ain't you?'' And the guy said, \n``Yeah, I sure have.'' The old guy added, ``I've been against all of \nthem, too.''\n\n[[Page S12466]]\n\n  You know, there are people like that. They are against all changes \nuntil it is demonstrated that change was good, and then they say, ``OK, \nnow let me just oppose the next change.'' So it is clear to me that we \nwill have opposition.\n  The test for us, however, is to have developed a plan, which I think \nthis plan meets, that is sensitive to all of the issues that are raised \nin opposition.\n  When environmental organizations say to us, ``Well, we have some real \nproblems with this,'' I think what we are able to say is we worked with \nmajor environmental organizations in our State and negotiated with \nthem, made changes relative to the recommendations they made, and they, \nI am pleased to say, have sent us a letter saying, ``We support this \napproach.''\n  We think this approach is a good compromise, meets the environmental \ntests. So my expectation is that today is getting this piece of reform \nlegislation to the starting line. We have a hill ahead of us. The \nquestion is, how steep, how long does it take to get up the hill and \ndown the other side? We will get there. The question is, how difficult \nis this and what is the timeframe?\n  So I thought we might want to talk about that kind of approach today.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just respond by saying, I think it is very important \nthat we have hearings--and have hearings in North Dakota--to be able to \nhear from all affected interests there. We already have heard from \nvirtually every affected interest in the State of North Dakota. They \nhave sent us letters in support of this project.\n  There is absolutely an unprecedented degree of bipartisan support, \nvirtually every affected interest in the State of North Dakota. But we \nalso will look forward to hearings here because we understand there are \npeople in opposition, there are tests in opposition. We want the \nopportunity to explain what we have done to respond to their concerns, \nbecause I think this is a remarkable effort to try to listen to what \nother people have said and to try to design a project that meets their \nconcerns.\n  So I think we are looking forward to the opportunity to tell our \nstory and to make our case. We believe it is a powerful one. As I \nindicated earlier, we believe this project is environmentally \nsensitive, fiscally sound, and in the long-term interests of the State \nof North Dakota and of the Nation.\n  So, again, I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota for all of \nhis efforts in bringing us to this day.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If you might yield for one additional point.\n  I think what we say today when we introduce this legislation is, we \nsay to the Federal Government, ``Keep your promise. You made our State \na promise. We expect the Federal Government to keep their promise.'' \nThis legislation, in our judgment, the combined judgment of the \nGovernor, the congressional delegation, the elected leaders of the \nState legislature, on a bipartisan basis, we believe this legislation \nallows the Federal Government to keep its promise.\n  There might be controversy here about this in this Chamber, but we \nwould say that ``You owe North Dakota this project. You promised it. We \nhave the flood. The flood isn't going away. Now you must provide the \nbenefits you promised, Federal Government.'' So that is what we say \ntoday to the Federal Government: Keep your promise.\n  We would say, I think, to those who are naysayers, those who look at \nthis and say, ``Well, we don't support this,'' we want to hear you. We \nare willing to listen. We are going to hold hearings. If you have a \nbetter approach, if you have a better plan, tell us. If you have \nproblems with this, tell us what those problems are.\n  We want to address all the real problems that exist, but we intend at \nthe end of the day to get for our State what was promised to our State. \nIt is not just because we want to get something; it is because our \nState's economic future depends on our ability in the coming years to \ncomplete this project the way it was promised to North Dakota.\n\n  So let me, finally, Mr. President--and I thank Senator Conrad for \nyielding--indicate that Senator Conrad already mentioned that Bob Van \nHeuvelen and Derik Fettig and Kirk Johnson of his staff played a very \nimportant role in this, as did Karen Frederickson and Amy Goffe of \nCongressman Pomeroy's staff. I don't know if we mentioned Dave \nSprynczynatyk working for Governor Schafer, and Murray Sagsveen and Bob \nHarms, as well as critically important staff members at the State \nlevel, to help us formulate this set of amendments that we offered \ntoday to the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator would just yield, I think we also want to \nacknowledge, I might say, the individuals from the State level that we \nhave acknowledged in our statements. We should add Mike Dwyer, of the \nNorth Dakota Water Users, who played a critical role of shuttle \ndiplomacy, going back and forth in the final days to reach conclusion \nhere.\n  So this has been a true team effort, with Dave Sprynczynatyk, the \nState water engineer, and Maj. Gen. Murray Sagsveen working on behalf \nof the Governor and Bob Harms, of the Governor's staff, and, as I have \nindicated, Mike Dwyer of the North Dakota Water Users. All of them \nplayed very important roles, as did Mike Olson, Bill Bicknell and Dick \nKroger of the North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society.\n  In the final hours, in the final days, it took a real coming together \nto achieve this result. We certainly appreciate all of their efforts.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                 North Dakota,\n\n                                                 November 7, 1997.\n     Sen.

George Miller,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Resources, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington DC.\n       Gentlemen: Today marks a significant milestone for the \n     State of North Dakota. We, the elected political leaders of \n     the state, have agreed to support the introduction and to \n     urge the passage of the ``Dakota Water Resources Act.'' The \n     attached legislation, if enacted, will play an integral part \n     in the economic future of our state.\n       We are proud that this legislation is the product of \n     extensive and full consultation with people who represent \n     nearly all aspects of the life of our state. It represents a \n     cooperative effort which has not only reached across partisan \n     political lines, but also has constructively engaged all \n     affected interests of the state. It reflects the views of \n     Republicans and Democrats, Tribal leaders, the North Dakota \n     Chapter of the Wildlife Society, The North Dakota Water Users \n     Association, and the Rural Electric Cooperatives.\n       Accordingly, we urge you to give this legislation your \n     early review and full support.\n           Sincerely,\n         Kent Conrad, U.S. Senator; Byron Dorgan, U.S. Senator; \n           Carl Pomeroy, U.S. Representative; Edward Schafer, \n           Governor; Gary Nelson, Majority Leader, State Senate; \n           Timothy Mathern, Minority Leader, State Senate; John \n           Dorso, Majority Leader, State House; Merle Boucher, \n           Minority Leader, State House.\n       Attachment.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              North Dakota Chapter of The Wildlife Society\n\n\n  STATEMENT CONCERNING THE NOVEMBER 7TH, 1997 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO \n              GARRISON DIVERSION REFORMULATION ACT OF 1986\n\n       The North Dakota Chapter of The Wildlife Society supports \n     the proposed amendments to Garrison Diversion Reformulation \n     Act as described in the November 7, 1997 Discussion Draft. We \n     strongly believe the cooperative effort with the \n     Congressional Delegation and North Dakota's state political \n     leaders has strengthened the bill. Throughout this effort we \n     have sought to develop legislation that benefits North \n     Dakotans through water development and minimizes potential \n     impacts to our state's natural resources.\n       Modification of the 1986 Reformulation Act will benefit \n     substantially more North Dakotans by emphasizing municipal, \n     rural, and industrial water needs of the State. The November \n     6, 1997 additions also place an equal emphasis on recognition \n     of the enhancement of fish and wildlife and other natural \n     resources as a full project feature. We are pleased to see \n     the designation of Lonetree as a wildlife conservation area. \n     This change is consistent with the recognition of natural \n     resource conservation as a project feature that benefits \n     North Dakota and the State's economy.\n       We are also encouraged by the addition of funds and the \n     increased opportunities for natural resource conservation in \n     North Dakota presented by the evolution of the Wetlands Trust \n     into the new Natural Resources Trust. We believe the \n     establishment of an account within the Natural Resources \n     Trust to\n\n[[Page S12467]]\n\n     operate and maintain wildlife development areas will benefit \n     wildlife resources in the state. This will ensure the stated \n     commitments of the project are met in the future.\n       The findings of the Environmental Impact Statement written \n     by the Bureau of Reclamation will provide a framework for a \n     project which minimizes impacts to North Dakota's natural \n     resources and provides for opportunities to meet the \n     comprehensive water needs of eastern North Dakota. We will \n     gladly be a full participant in this process to help ensure \n     that the water needs of Fargo, Grand Forks, and neighboring \n     communities are met in an environmentally sound cost \n     effective manner.\n       Our involvement in this legislation has not ended. We look \n     forward to working with all parties involved to develop the \n     corresponding report language to capture all points of \n     agreement. Full involvement by all interested parties has \n     produced a final bill that North Dakotans can embrace. We \n     welcome the opportunity to cooperatively work on this and \n     other issues effecting North Dakota's natural resource \n     heritage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           North Dakota Education Association,\n\n                                   Bismarck, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the North Dakota \n     Education Association, we encourage you to support the \n     proposal to amend the 1986 Reformulation Act and complete the \n     Garrison Division water facilities. The proposal you have \n     developed is important to the future of our state.\n       We appreciate your efforts and encourage you to support the \n     legislation that will enact a water policy for the state of \n     North Dakota that has been long awaited.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Joseph A. Westby.\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       North Dakota Association of\n\n\n                                  Rural Electric Cooperatives,\n\n                                     Mandan, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     To: Sen.

Merle Boucher.\n     From: Dennis Hill, Executive Vice President.\n     Re: Amendments to 1986 Garrison Reformulation Act.\n       On behalf of the rural electric network in North Dakota, I \n     want to commend each of you for the leadership you've \n     provided to develop a set of amendments to the 1986 Garrison \n     Reformulation Act. This process has been an impressive \n     display of bi-partisan leadership that has resulted in a set \n     of amendments that will finish a major water supply project \n     for our state.\n       The rural electric network has long supported the \n     completion of Garrison Diversion. We supported the 1965 Act, \n     the 1986 Reformulation, and we now support these amendments \n     that you have been able to craft that will help our state \n     meet its future contemporary water needs.\n       We pledge our continuing support of this project and this \n     process. Please let us know how can we be of help in moving \n     this set of amendments through the Congress.\n       Again, thanks for the excellent leadership.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                North Dakota Water\n\n\n                                            Users Association,\n\n                                   Bismarck, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     To: Gov.

Merle Boucher.\n     From: North Dakota Water Users Association.\n     Re: Garrison Amendments.\n       We would like to thank you for your considerable effort to \n     achieve consensus on a proposal to further the Garrison \n     project and meet the critical water needs of North Dakota. We \n     sense there is a unity we have not had before among state \n     water users, state wildlife interests, Tribes, power \n     customers and others on how we should proceed in proposing to \n     complete Garrison Diversion water supply facilities.\n       We fully support the amendments that have been developed to \n     enable the 1986 Reformulation Act to be modified and \n     implemented. While the amendments eliminate most of the \n     irrigation opportunities provided in the 1965 and 1986 Acts, \n     we will vigorously support the current proposal in the spirit \n     of compromise with the many competing interests in this \n     project, and with the belief that the proposal will meet the \n     critical water needs of our state, including the opportunity \n     to utilize the existing facilities to provide Missouri River \n     water to meet the water needs of the Red River Valley.\n       We look forward to working with you and the Tribe, state \n     wildlife interests, cities, rural water systems, other water \n     users, power customers and others to secure approval and \n     implementation of the proposed amendments.\n     Mike Dwyer,\n       Exectuvie Vice President.\n     Jack Olin,\n       President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    Southwest Water Authority,\n\n                                  Dickinson, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     Gov.

We in southwestern North Dakota also benefit from \n     this project.\n       Currently the Southwest Pipeline Project provides water to \n     15 communities, Assumption Abbey, Sacred Heart Monastery, and \n     1200 farms and ranches. Construction to these areas was \n     possible because of funding through Garrison Diversions' \n     Municipal, Rural, and Industrial Fund and the North Dakota \n     Resource Trust Fund.\n       The cities of Hettinger, Reeder, and Glen Ullin, cited for \n     excessive fluoride violations, await a new water supply. The \n     Southwest Pipeline Project will be that new source of water. \n     An additional 11 cities and approximately 2300 farms and \n     ranches are waiting for water from the Southwest Pipeline \n     Project. The amended 1986 Reformulation Act will supply funds \n     necessary for completion of the Southwest Pipeline Project.\n       Your support and efforts are appreciated. The Southwest \n     Water Authority offers its support and assistance to you as \n     necessary.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Pinkie Evans-Curry,\n     Manager/CEO.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                 Devils Lake Basin\n\n\n                                   Joint Water Resource Board,\n\n                                Devils Lake, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     Gov.

Merle Boucher,\n     Rolette, ND.\n       Dear Gentlemen: On behalf of the Industrial Development \n     Association of North Dakota, and as a member of the North \n     Dakota Water Coalition, we support the proposal to amend the \n     1986 Reformulation Act and completion of the Garrison \n     Diversion water facilities plan. My understanding is that \n     this is being offered under the ``Dakota Water Resources Act \n     of 1997''.\n       Water is one of the predominant economic development issues \n     for many of the communities in the state. Simply stated, we \n     seem to have too much water in some areas and not enough in \n     others. Therefore, we support the consensus efforts of the \n     water coalition and our congressional delegation in crafting \n     legislation that will help us build our future by developing \n     water delivery systems across our state.\n       We appreciate your initiative in this important matter. We \n     look forward to working with you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Thomas C. Rolfstad,\n     Immediate Past President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    City of Fargo,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                                 November 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The latest draft amendments to the \n     Garrison Diversion Reformulation Act of 1986 have been \n     received and reviewed by Fargo staff and elected officials. \n     We are very supportive of the proposed language.\n       As the State's largest City which continues to have a \n     population growth of nearly 2% per year--this rate of \n     increase has sustained for over 20 years--the need for an \n     adequate, reliable and quality source of water is key to our \n     future. The City has just completed construction of a state \n     of the art water treatment facility having the capabilities \n     of addressing all current and anticipated safe drinking water \n     standards well into the 21st Century. While this facility is \n     on line and treating water from the Red River of the North \n     and the Sheyenne River, it will be of little use if water is \n     not available in either of these water sources.\n       History bears out the fact that the lack of water in these \n     rivers is a real possibility--in the 1930's low flow \n     conditions prevented the use of water from the Red River for \n     seven straight years. As late as 1975, severe rationing of \n     water in Fargo was caused by low flows in the Red River.\n       The introduction of new legislation to continue the \n     Garrison Diversion effort is very timely. The modifications \n     to the established legislation will greatly enhance Fargo's \n     and eastern North Dakota's potential as a growth area--for \n     population, economic and agricultural purposes--in the \n     Midwest.\n       Your continued support and work on this very important \n     legislation is needed and appreciated. If we can do anything \n     to further this legislative effort, please call on me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Bruce W. Furness,\n                                                            Mayor.\n                                           Turtle Mountain Band of\n\n\n                                             Chippewa Indians,\n\n                                   Belcourt, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     Hon.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians \n     approve the efforts of our congressional representatives in \n     your effort with regard to the ``Dakota Water Resources Act'' \n     We know how hard this type of legislation is to get \n     bipartisan agreement and feel your efforts have been \n     exceptional.\n       We of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians \n     appreciate being invited to the October 27th, 1997 hearing on \n     the Draft Garrison Amendments. We feel that the hearings were \n     very productive and appreciate the cooperation and courtesies \n     extended to the tribes of North Dakota.\n       We have reviewed the total ``discussion draft'' dated \n     November 5, 1997 as was sent to us.\n       1. We feel this draft is well put together and generally \n     portrays the feeling of the majority of attendees at the \n     table. The Tribes of North Dakota agreed on the breakdown of \n     the Native American authorizations and find them as was \n     discussed.\n       2. We note that you have taken some of the suggestions put \n     forth in Russell D. Mason, Sr. letter dated October 27, 1997 \n     handed out at the hearings.\n       3. We note that in section 7(c) you have made specific \n     reference to the Trenton Indian Service Area in the Turtle \n     Mountain allocation and are pleased with that thought.\n       4. In the Section 7(c) page 14 line 22, you have included \n     ``along with adjacent areas'' what is the intent of this?\n       The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians feel this \n     document is put together in the spirit of cooperation with \n     the entities involved and look forward to doing whatever the \n     Tribe can do to support the passage of this legislation. \n     Please contact myself or Ken Loveland at any time if we can \n     assist your efforts toward final passage of the Dakota Water \n     Resources Act.\n           Respectfully yours,\n     Raphael J.

Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is in \n     full support of the amendments to the Garrison Reformulation \n     Act of 1986.\n       The Tribe especially appreciates the inclusion of the \n     irrigation issues for the Standing Rock reservation and the \n     $200 million requested for water systems on the reservation.\n       The Tribe hereby acknowledges the efforts of all our \n     representatives in Congress and will continue to endorse the \n     North Dakota Congressional delegation with regards to Indian \n     Affairs.\n       I was very grateful for the opportunity to represent my \n     tribe by giving testimony on this very important piece of \n     legislation. I look forward to a continued effort on both our \n     parts to ensure the very best for our State and my Tribe.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles W.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dakota Water \nResources Act of 1997. I introduce this bill jointly with my colleague, \nSenator Kent Conrad, while our colleague in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, Representative Earl Pomeroy, will introduce an \nidentical companion bill.\n  This bill is the most important piece of legislation I will introduce \nfor my State. I say this because the key to North Dakota's future is \neconomic development based on water resource management and \ndevelopment. And the key to water development in my State is the Dakota \nWater Resources Act.\n  Over 100 years ago, John Wesley Powell of the U.S. Geological Survey \ntold the North Dakota Constitutional Convention that the State would \nhave:\n\n       . . . a series of years when they will have abundant crops; \n     then for two or three years they will have less rainfall and \n     there will be failure of crops and disaster will come on \n     thousands of people, who will become discouraged and leave. \n     That is the history of those who live on the border between \n     humid and arid lands.\n\n  Well, I want to let my colleagues know that what was true in 1889 is \nstill true in 1997. Thousands of people are leaving North Dakota for \neconomic opportunity Denver, Minneapolis, and dozens of other places. \nOnly 11 counties in North Dakota had population increases in the past \ndecade. The root of the problem is the challenge of making a dependable \nliving on farms in rural areas and of planning for a dependable \neconomic future in major cities that do not now have reliable water \nsupplies.\n  Before turning to the main features of the Dakota Water Resources \nAct, I thought my colleagues would find it useful to know how the \nstoppage of war supplies in 1943 brought us to introduction of this \nlegislation in 1997.\n\n\n                           KEEPING A PROMISE\n\n  This bill offers hope to North Dakotans that they will finally see \nthe completion of a major Federal-State water development project that \nwas promised over 50 years ago. The promise was that North Dakota would \nget a comprehensive water development project if it accepted a \npermanent Rhode Island-sized flood behind a dam built for downstream \nflood protection and generation of hydro-electric power primarily for \nout-of-State customers.\n  It all started in 1943 when a great flood on the Missouri River \ncrippled the delivery to gulf ports of supplies for American troops \nfighting World War II. The Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of \nReclamation responded with the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program to \nbring massive flood control with dams in the States of the Upper \nMissouri Basin. The dams were built under the authority of the 1944 \nFlood Control Act.\n  When the Garrison Dam and Reservoir were completed in 1955, North \nDakota lost 550,000 acres of rich farmlands in the Missouri River \nValley. The cumulative value of farming losses over several decades \namounts to hundreds of millions of dollars. In addition, the State lost \naccess to valuable coal and oil reserves. But the losses didn't stop \nhere: valuable wildlife habitat, especially along game-rich river \nbottoms, also were lost.\n  In return, North Dakota expected to receive both a network of \nirrigation systems across the State to develop more than 1 million \nacres and access to reliable supplies of municipal, rural, and \nindustrial water. The 1965 Reauthorization Act set the stage for the \ndevelopment of the Garrison diversion project. The project consisted of \na network of canals throughout North Dakota to irrigate more than \n250,000 acres. That plan eventually encountered some stiff opposition \nand had to be modified.\n  In 1986, I wrote the Garrison Diversion Reformulation Act to \nimplement the Federal commitment to North Dakota in a way that \naddressed concerns raised about the project. That act provided \nsubstantial benefits to North Dakota, primarily in the form of water \nsystems for nearly 200,000 North Dakotans in almost 100 communities. \nThree Indian reservations, with some of the\n\n[[Page S12471]]\n\nworst water in the State, have started to realize the Reformulation \nAct's promise of safe drinking water as they have completed the first \nphase of their own MR programs.\n  Experts from North Dakota State University have conducted valuable \nresearch at the Oakes test area, also authorized by the 1986 act, on \nalternative crops such as beans, onions, and carrots, which were not \ntraditionally grown in our State. This research provided the basis for \nfarming diversification that will benefit our economic future. With \nsuch research in hand, the State will be able to carry out agricultural \ndevelopment in five areas authorized by the new bill.\n  In addition, the 1986 act provided for the purchase of 23,000 acres \nof wetlands, grasslands, and woodlands for wildlife mitigation and \nenhancement and authorized development of the 5,000-acre Kraft Slough \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n\n\n              RETHINKING THE PROMISE OF WATER DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Despite the Garrison act's benefits, much of its promise remains \nunrealized. We still have not completed a means of meeting the water \nneeds of North Dakota's most populous area, the Red River Valley with \nkey cities at Wahpeton, Fargo, Grand Forks, and Grafton, ND. That act \nalso included authorizations for agricultural projects that were deemed \nto be too costly or too environmentally disruptive to pursue.\n  So the bipartisan leadership of the State, including the Governor, \nthe majority and minority leadership of the State legislature, and the \ncongressional delegation embarked on an effort to complete the project \nin a way that could meet the tough tests of fiscal responsibility, \nenvironmental protection, economic opportunity, project completion, and \nstatewide support.\n  I want to commend publicly the efforts of my two congressional \ncolleagues, Senator Kent Conrad and Congressman Earl Pomeroy, as well \nas Gov. Ed Schafer, and the bipartisan leadership of the North Dakota \nLegislature--State Senators Gary Nelson and Tim Mathern, and State \nRepresentatives John Dorso and Merle Boucher--for their creative and \ntireless efforts to build a statewide consensus for a bill that meets \nthose tests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12461-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12471-S12477]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DAKOTA WATER RESOURCES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Before turning to those tests, let me summarize the key components of \nthe bill and their benefits to North Dakota. The bill provides:\n  $300 million for municipal, rural and industrial [MR] water systems \nin North Dakota;\n  $200 million to meet the comprehensive water needs of the Red River \nValley;\n  $200 million for MR projects for four Indian reservations; 1$40 \nmillion for construction of Four Bears Bridge across Lake Sakakawea;\n  $25 million for a natural resources trust to preserve, enhance, \nrestore, and manage wetlands and associated wildlife habitat, \ngrasslands, and riparian areas;\n  $5 million for recreation projects;\n  $1.5 million for a Wetlands Interpretive Center in North Dakota;\n  Debt forgiveness for expenses associated with features of the \nGarrison project previously constructed with Federal funds, but which \nnow will go unused, or only partially used;\n  Authorization for the state to develop water conservation programs \nusing MR funding;\n  Authorization for a study of bank stabilization along the Missouri \nRiver below Garrison Dam;\n  Designation of the current Lonetree Reservoir as a wildlife \nconservation area;\n  A provision requiring the Federal Government to pay for operation and \nmaintenance on mitigation lands;\n  A provision that ``upon transfer of the Oakes Test Area to the State \nof North Dakota, but not later than 1 year after enactment of this Act, \nfederal funds authorized by this Act may not be used to subsidize the \nirrigation of any crops at the Oakes Test Area'';\n  A provision giving Indian tribes flexibility in determining \nirrigation sites within the reservations;\n  A provision that the bill will not result in any rate increases for \npower generated by dams on the Missouri River; and\n       Authorization for the following irrigation areas: Turtle \n     Mountain--13,700 acres, McClusky Canal--10,000 acres, \n     Missouri River Basin--28,000 acres, Stand Rock Sioux \n     Reservation--2,380 acres, Fort Berthold Reservation--15,200 \n     acres, and New Rockford Canal--1,200 acres, provided user \n     fees pay for the cost of irrigation at this site.\n\n\n             THE DAKOTA WATER RESOURCES ACT MEETS THE TEST\n\n  Let me return to my prior thought and show how the Dakota Water \nResources Act of 1997 meets the tests I noted before.\n  First, it is fiscally responsible because it cuts nearly $200 million \nfor irrigation projects and requires cost sharing by the State for the \nMR projects authorized by the bill. Further, it stretches Federal \nresources by allowing the State to make loans, rather than grants, \nunder the MR program so that money can be recycled through a \nrevolving fund and thereby benefit even more communities across the \nState. The MR programs for the State and tribes alike focus only on \nthe highest priority water needs, which have been validated by the \nState Water Commission and the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  Second, the act provides substantial environmental benefits. It \nincludes incentives for water conservation and the creation of a \nnatural resources trust. The bill provides additional incentives for \nthe State to establish and meet specified conservation goals. Also, it \nallows for the creation of a separate account in an expanded national \nresources trust to maintain sensitive mitigation tracts. Perhaps more \nnotably, the bill includes for the first time as one of the defined \nproject purposes ``enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and other \nnatural resources.''\n  Let me share with colleagues a letter and statement from the \nprofessional wildlife managers and biologists, the North Dakota Chapter \nof the Wildlife Society, which explains their support for the new \nlegislation. The Society said, in part, that:\n\n       We strongly believe the cooperative effort with the \n     Congressional Delegation and North Dakota's state political \n     leaders has strengthened the bill. Throughout this effort we \n     have sought to develop legislation that benefits North \n     Dakotans through water development and minimizes potential \n     impacts to our state's natural resources.\n\n  I want to commend the North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society \nfor its strong and explicit support for this legislation. Its members, \nespecially Mike Olson, Dick Kroger, and Bill Bicknell, have played a \nkey role in developing this bill.\n  Third test: This bill meets a third test by providing much more for \neconomic development than natural resource enhancement alone. Water is \nnecessary for all life, but in the semi-arid Plains States, such as \nNorth Dakota, it is often difficult to find a reliable supply of water \nto meet the needs of growing population centers and agriculture. \nMoreover, even where water is available, it often is undrinkable.\n  I remember seeing a constituent from the Dickinson area hold a glass \nof what appeared to be tobacco juice only to be informed that it was \ntap water. Several communities in southwestern North Dakota, where I \ngrew up, cannot even comply with Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] \nstandards implementing the Safe Drinking Water Act. Western North \nDakota communities clustered around Minot and Dickinson will gain the \nbenefits of reliable drinking water supplies from the northwest area \nwater supply and the southwest pipeline, which are authorized in this \nbill.\n  The Dakota Water Resources Act of 1997 will assure an adequate and \ndependable water supply for at least one out of three North Dakotans in \nurban, rural, and native American communities. It will also promote \nindustrial uses in North Dakota for manufacturing and agricultural \nprocessing and target water delivery to five project areas for \nagricultural development. Finally, the bill will enhance recreation \nthrough projects such as a Wetlands Interpretive Center.\n  The fourth test this bill meets is project completion. A major \nprovision of the bill is to allow the State to choose, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of the Interior, how to meet the water needs of the \nRed River Valley--North Dakota's fastest growing region. The \nlegislation will permit the State to either complete an existing water \nsupply system or choose alternative methods to meet the comprehensive \nwater\n\n[[Page S12472]]\n\nquality and quantity needs of Fargo, Grand Forks, Wahpeton, Grafton and \nother Red River Valley communities in both North Dakota and Minnesota. \nNorth Dakotans have waited 50 years to have this promise kept and this \nbill keeps the promise while meeting tough environmental standards, the \nrequirements of the Boundary Waters Treaty with Canada and the test of \nfiscal responsibility.\n\n  Finally, our bill represents a rare consensus among all the major \nparticipants in State water development and conservation. To insure the \nmost balanced and representative bill, the North Dakota congressional \ndelegation, the Governor, and State legislative leaders worked \ncooperatively with the many State interest groups to reach consensus on \nwhat are often contentious issues. Evidence of our success in building \nthat consensus on this bill is provided in the many letters from \ncommunity leaders, cities, native American tribes, water users, rural \nelectric cooperatives, water resource districts, the North Dakota \nEducation Association, Chamber of Commerce, industrial development \ncommission, and the North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society, as \nnoted before.\n  I ask that copies of all of these letters be entered into the Record \nat the end of my statement and that of my colleague, Senator Conrad. \nHowever, I would like to give my colleagues a flavor of the support \nthat this bill enjoys in my State.\n\n\n                      SUPPORT ACROSS NORTH DAKOTA\n\n  In western North Dakota, Dickinson Mayor Fred Gengler says that \nnothing has improved the quality of life for citizens in western North \nDakota more than a reliable supply of water made possible through water \ndelivery funded by grants through the State of North Dakota. On behalf \nof the city of Minot, Mayor Orlin Backes says: ``The proposal you have \njointly and cooperatively developed will finish a project that has \nlanguished far too long.'' Williston's mayor, Ward Koeser, wrote that \n``Your efforts to address the water needs of the entire state, and in \nturn that of the Williston trade area, make it very easy to send this \nletter of support for your efforts.''\n  Growing communities in eastern North Dakota, such as two of North \nDakota's largest cities, Fargo and Grand Forks, need an assured supply \nof water to plan for their future growth. It may shock some of my \ncolleagues to know that the Red River of the North, the source of \ncatastrophic flooding last spring, is the major source of drinking and \nindustrial water for nearly one-fourth of the State's population and \nthat it has actually stopped flowing several times in the past 100 \nyears.\n  For the past 20 years, Fargo has been an engine of growth in North \nDakota and its population has grown by nearly 2 percent per year. If \nthis rate of growth is sustained, its population would double in 36 \nyears. This population growth is essential to building the statewide \neconomy, including Fargo's.\n  The city of Fargo has just completed construction of a state-of-the-\nart water treatment facility to address community needs into the 21st \ncentury. But even the best treatment facilities need an adequate and \ndependable supply of water to meet the current and future needs of a \ngrowing community. Not surprisingly, Mayor Bruce Furness of Fargo \nwrites that this bill ``. . . will greatly enhance Fargo's and eastern \nNorth Dakota's potential as a growth area--for population, economic, \nand agricultural purposes . . . .''\n  For her part, Mayor Pat Owens of Grand Forks said: ``I strongly \nsupport the approach taken of implementing a comprehensive package that \nwill benefit the State of North Dakota.'' Many of you will remember \nMayor Owens as the steady hand that guided her city through tumultuous \nevents of last spring's historic flood and the ensuing relief and \nrecovery. She indicated that it was essential that Grand Forks have a \nreliable drinking supply for its citizens for the future.\n  The four native American tribes sent letters supporting the proposed \nlegislation. Chairman Charles Murphy of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe \nespecially appreciated the Indian irrigation included in the bill. The \nthree affiliated tribes of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation at \nFort Berthold, in a letter from Chairman Russell Mason, welcomed \nongoing funding for MR water needs of the tribes. They are joined in \nsupport for the bill by the chairs of the Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle \nMountain Band of Chippewa Indians, Myra Pearson, and Raphael DeCoteau, \nrespectively.\n  It's rare for both water users and conservation groups to agree to \nsupport the same project. These groups are usually at loggerheads over \npolicy. This legislation is a dramatic exception.\n  The water users embraced the bill as a sound compromise between water \ndevelopment and environmental protection. Mike Dwyer and Jack Olin, \nleaders of the North Dakota Water Users Association, stated that ``We \nfully support the amendments that have been developed to enable the \n1986 Reformulation Act to be modified and implemented.'' The Garrison \nDiversion Conservancy District, the historic manager of North Dakota's \nmajor water project, indicated its support in a letter from its \nmanager, Warren Jamison. The chairman of the State Water Coalition and \nexecutive director of North Dakota's Rural Electric Cooperatives, \nDennis Hill, pledged support to finish our State's major water supply \nproject. Meanwhile, the North Dakota Chapter of the Wildlife Society \nconvened a special session of their executive board, which issued the \nstatement supporting the legislation noted before.\n\n\n                      ``WHAT GOOD WATER'S WORTH''\n\n  Many of the participants in the discussions leading to the consensus \nin support of this legislation say that their economic well-being and \nquality of life depend on passing the Dakota Water Resources Act of \n1997. Perhaps I can illustrate this feeling with a picture and a quote.\n  It's as familiar as a picture of a kid taking a drink of clear, clean \nwater from a hose in summer time.\n  It's as profound as Lord Byron speaking through ``Don Juan'': ``Till \ntaught by pain, men really know not what good water's worth.'' I can \ntell my colleagues that in North Dakota we know both the pain and the \nworth of good water.\n  This consciousness is what has brought such a wide array of North \nDakota groups together behind the bill. Nearly everyone determined that \nsolving this water problem was so important that we must rally behind a \ncommon approach. The supporters include Republicans and Democrats, and \nindependents as well. The backers also number conservationists and \nwater users, rural and urban communities, and tribal and State leaders \nwho have joined together in the most impressive display of unity that I \nhave seen this decade in North Dakota. Let me again say how much. I \nappreciate the efforts of my North Dakota colleagues in the \ncongressional delegation and in State government, as well as all of our \nstaffs, for their invaluable contributions in achieving this unity.\n  So I urge my colleagues to consider favorably the Dakota Water \nResources Act of 1997 as the consensus fulfillment of the Federal \ncommitment to North Dakota and the acknowledged program for water \ndevelopment in our State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             North Dakota Chapter,\n\n\n                                         The Wildlife Society,\n\n                                    Bismark, ND, November 7, 1997.\n\n                              [Memorandum]\n\n     To: The Garrison Negotiating Team.\n     From: The North Dakota Chapter of The Wildlife Society.\n     Subject: Statement Concerning The Proposed Garrison \n         Legislation.\n       On November 6, 1997, the North Dakota Chapter of The \n     Wildlife Society convened a special session of the Executive \n     Board to discuss the proposed Garrison legislation and the \n     Chapter's position on current legislative amendments. As a \n     result of this meeting, the Chapter issued the attached \n     statement of support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              William B.

We \n     strongly believe the cooperative effort with the \n     Congressional Delegation and North Dakota's state political \n     leaders has\n\n[[Page S12473]]\n\n     strengthened the bill. Throughout this effort we have sought \n     to develop legislation that benefits North Dakotans through \n     water development and minimizes potential impacts to our \n     state's natural resources.\n       Modification of the 1986 Reformulation Act will benefit \n     substantially more North Dakotans by emphasizing municipal, \n     rural, and industrial water needs of the State. The November \n     6, 1997 additions also place an equal emphasis on recognition \n     of the enhancement of fish and wildlife habitat and other \n     natural resources as a full project feature. We are pleased \n     to see the designation of Lonetree as a wildlife conservation \n     area. This change is consistent with the recognition of \n     natural resource conservation as a project feature that \n     benefits North Dakota and the State's economy.\n       We are also encouraged by the addition of funds and the \n     increased opportunities for natural resource conservation in \n     North Dakota presented by the evolution of the Wetlands Trust \n     into the new Natural Resources Trust. We believe the \n     establishment of an account within the Natural Resources \n     Trust to operate and maintain wildlife development areas will \n     benefit wildlife resources in the state. This will ensure the \n     stated commitments of the project are met in the future.\n       The findings of the Environmental Impact Statement written \n     by the Bureau of Reclamation will provide a framework for a \n     project which minimizes impact to North Dakota's natural \n     resources and provides for opportunities to meet the \n     comprehensive water needs of eastern North Dakota. We will \n     gladly be a full participant in this process to help ensure \n     that the water needs of Fargo, Grand Forks. and neighboring \n     communities are met in an environmentally sound cost \n     effective manner.\n       Our involvement in this legislation has not ended. We look \n     forward to working with all parties involved to develop the \n     corresponding report language to capture all points of \n     agreement. Full involvement by all interested parties has \n     produced a final bill that North Dakotans can embrace. We \n     welcome the opportunity to cooperatively work on this and \n     other issues effecting North Dakota's natural resource \n     heritage.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Mandan, Hidatsa, & Arikara Nation--Three Affiliated \n           Tribes, Fort Berthold Indian Reservation,\n                                   New Town, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     Re Final proposed amendments to the 1986 Garrison \n         Reformulation Act, dated November 7, 1997.\n\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: On behalf of the Three Affiliated \n     Tribes, I want to thank you for the opportunity to present \n     our views regarding the drafts of proposed legislation \n     amending the Garrison Reformulation Act of 1986 to you and \n     your staff over the past two weeks. We are especially \n     appreciative that the municipal, rural and industrial water \n     needs of the Tribes are being provided for through the new \n     funding authorization contained in the legislation, and that \n     funds are included in the legislation for a new Four Bears \n     bridge that will serve not only our communities but also all \n     of northwest North Dakota.\n       It is our understanding that you plan to introduce the bill \n     in the few remaining days of this session of Congress, in the \n     form as submitted to us today, November 7, 1997, and we \n     strongly support your effort to do so. The bill, while it \n     does not address all of our concerns, as further explained \n     below, is a great step forward in the process of ensuring \n     that the water needs of the Tribe and its members are met. In \n     crafting this legislation, we especially applaud your efforts \n     to bring everyone to the table to discuss their views \n     concerning this proposed bill.\n       We also want to thank you for the efforts you and your \n     staff have made to address the concerns mentioned below. We \n     recognize that significant changes have been made to the \n     Final Amendments to the Garrison Diversion Reformulation Act \n     of 1986 that you will soon introduce, and we thank you for \n     those changes, including the change that allows some \n     flexibility with regard to irrigation projects.\n       We do, however, have several remaining concerns about the \n     bill as proposed. We know that there is insufficient time to \n     address these concerns before the bill is introduced, but we \n     are hopeful that with further discussion, these concerns can \n     be addressed either in language within the bill or in final \n     Committee Report language as the bill is being considered by \n     Congress.\n       First, we would prefer that language be included in the \n     bill, or in a Committee Report, that would assure us that the \n     reserved water rights of the Three Affiliated Tribes to water \n     from the Missouri River and its tributaries that flow through \n     the Fort Berthold Reservation, expressed by the U.S. Supreme \n     Court in the Winters case early in this century, are \n     preserved in this legislation. This statement should be \n     similar to the purpose expressed in the legislation to \n     ``preserve any existing rights of the State of North Dakota \n     to use water from the Missouri River.'' We understand that \n     consideration is being given to include such language in any \n     Committee Report on the bill.\n       Second, we would ask that language be included in the bill \n     which allows the Tribe the opportunity to seek Federal funds \n     for additional irrigation sites, other than those authorized. \n     While we do not now have additional sites in mind, additional \n     studies and advances in irrigation techniques over time may \n     well yield further areas which are suitable for irrigation.\n       At the same time, we would like to see additional \n     authorization for funds for our irrigation projects. As your \n     staff has indicated to us, present law seems to provide that \n     all of the present Indian irrigation funds are earmarked for \n     the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. We do not in any way wish to \n     take away such funds from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, but \n     we believe our irrigation funding needs for the approximately \n     15,000 acres authorized under the present legislation are \n     being neglected in this process. We understand that other \n     opportunities may be present at in future legislation for \n     additional authorization of and appropriation of Federal \n     funds for these projects.\n       Third, we would prefer that language be included, again \n     either in a Committee Report or in the legislation, which \n     would include the Tribe as a participant in the Natural \n     Resources Trust, as it has been renamed in Section 11 of the \n     bill. The Three Affiliated Tribes and the Standing Rock Sioux \n     Tribe lost significant wetlands and other wildlife habitat \n     with the construction of the Garrison and Oahe dams, and \n     should have just as much an opportunity for mitigation of \n     those lost acres with funds from the Natural Resources Trust \n     as does the rest of North Dakota.\n       While we realize that the Equitable Compensation Fund \n     created for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Three \n     Affiliated Tribes may also be used for the same purposes as \n     those of the Natural Resources Trust, the main thrust of \n     those funds are for education, economic development and \n     social welfare, as stated in the Equitable Compensation Act. \n     These funds, used for the above purposes, barely begin to \n     repair the economic and social losses to the members of the \n     Three Affiliated Tribes caused by the destruction of their \n     homelands along the Missouri River, and are unlikely to be \n     used to purchase additional lands in compensation for loss of \n     wetlands and other wildlife habitat.\n       Finally, we would hope that in Committee Report language or \n     in the bill itself, language is included that will point out \n     that the benefits being provided in this bill help implement \n     the goals set forth in the Garrison Unit Joint Tribal \n     Advisory Committee Report, dated May 23, 1986. The language \n     should be similar to that already in the bill in the purposes \n     regarding the Garrison Diversion Unit Commission Final \n     Report, dated December 24, 1984. Such language simply \n     recognizes what the bill actually does and we believe will \n     assist in gaining political support for the bill both in \n     Congress and otherwise. We do recognize that the JTAC Final \n     Report is implicitly recognized by the mention of the \n     Garrison Diversion Unit Commission Final Report in the bill.\n       As you know, we have provided suggested language to you and \n     your staff regarding these concerns. As always, we look \n     forward to working with you about moving the bill forward and \n     addressing our concerns as summarized above.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                            Russell D.

We \n     support the Coalition's water development plan, which \n     includes increasing the availability of quality water \n     resources to support continued population and industrial \n     growth across the state.\n       One of two primary goals of the North Dakota Water \n     Coalition is to provide an adequate water supply across North \n     Dakota through a workable and achievable Garrison Diversion \n     Project. We believe that a completed water infrastructure in \n     our state will benefit all North Dakotans. Thus, we endorse \n     the proposal to amend the 1986 Reformulation Act to compete \n     Garrison Diversion.\n       An adequate, reliable water supply is essential to \n     sustaining communities and supporting economic development \n     activities throughout our state. Thank you for your efforts \n     on behalf of water development in North Dakota, including \n     completion of the Garrison Diversion Project.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David K.

We recognize water as North \n     Dakotas greatest natural resource and the Missouri River as \n     the greatest source of water in the state. Your efforts to \n     develop this natural resource should be commended.\n       The ``Dakota Water Resources Act of 1997'' is a bold move \n     to utilize Missouri River water throughout the entire state \n     and its passage would be a great step towards the goal of \n     developing a strong and balanced economy in North Dakota.\n       Your efforts to address the water needs of the entire \n     state, and in turn that of the Williston trade area, make it \n     very easy to send this letter of support for your efforts.\n       Thanks for your initiative and support to amend the 1986 \n     Garrison Reformulation Act to address the major water \n     concerns of the state of North Dakota.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   E.

I believe, if enacted, this \n     legislation will go far toward relieving the federal \n     government from the onerous ``trail of broken federal \n     promises.''

Indian and non-Indians will benefit from the \n     water supplies provided by this legislation. In many cases, \n     these amendments will restore spirits nearly broken by the \n     drudgery of hauling poor quality water for many miles through \n     severe weather conditions. Affordable access to a portion of \n     North Dakota's rights to Missouri River water will be \n     possible, and the 120 miles of canals and pumping stations \n     that remain a scar on the belly of the prairie will finally \n     be put to limited use.\n       The Amendments provide assurances that the Boundary Waters \n     Treaty, with our Canadian friends, will not be violated. \n     Environmental benefits for fish and wildlife resources are \n     also included. The project is already referred to as a model \n     for wildlife nutigation and enhancement. This legislation \n     will further that reputation. Finally, thus legislation \n     reduces the overall cost of the authorized project features \n     while providing for returning on the existing investment.\n       I will submit this legislation to the Garrison Diversion \n     Conservancy District's full board at their next meeting, with \n     a strong recommendation that they adopt a resolution in \n     support of its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Warren L. Jamison,\n     Manager.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                             Greater North Dakota Association,\n\n                                   Bismarck, ND, November 7, 1997.\n     Governor Edward Schafer.\n     Senator Kent Conrad.\n     Senator Byron Dorgan.\n     Representative Earl Pomeroy.\n     Senator Gary Nelson.\n     Senator Tim Mathern.\n     Representative John Dorso.\n     Representative Merle Boucher.\n       Dear Gentleman: We were informed that an agreement has been \n     reached regarding the Garrison Diversion Project. On behalf \n     of the\n\n[[Page S12475]]\n\n     Greater North Dakota Association, we support the proposal to \n     amend the 1986 Reformulation Act and complete the Garrison \n     Diversion water facilities. We understand this amendment will \n     be introduced as the ``Dakota Water Resources Act of 1997.''\n       Water--quality and quantity--is the most limiting and \n     valuable resource throughout the state. We believe that \n     passage of the proposal you have jointly and cooperatively \n     developed will assist North Dakota in developing its water \n     resources so that water can best facilitate the growth of the \n     state's four part economy and best serve the needs of our \n     citizens, business, agriculture, industry and tourism.\n       The members of GNDA express their appreciation for your \n     enlightened leadership to achieve consensus on the Garrison \n     Diversion Project! We pledge our support in working \n     cooperatively toward completing the Garrison Diversion \n     project for the benefit of all North Dakotans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dale O. Anderson,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 1518. A bill to require publicly traded corporations to make \nspecific disclosures in their initial offering statements and quarterly \nreports regarding the ability of their computer systems to operate \nafter January 1, 2000; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n  THE COMPUTER REMEDIATION AND SHARE HOLDER (CRASH) PROTECTION ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, there is a great adventure coming up. \nEveryone is looking forward to it and reservations are already being \nmade. We are talking about the great New Year's Eve party on December \n31, 1999, the New Year's Eve party of the millennium. Join with me in a \nmoment of fantasy and speculation and consider yourself at that party.\n  You have made your reservations. You are in New York City so you can \nbe part of the celebration in Times Square. This is going to be a \nwonderful event in your life.\n  You are wearing a name brand digital watch, one of the fancy ones \nthat records not only the time and the day, but the year. So you have \nyour watch on, and you look at it to follow the time until we get to \nthe magic moment. You are looking at your watch, and it says 11:59, \nDecember 31, 1999. At the stroke of midnight, your watch clicks over to \nmidnight and goes blank.\n  What has happened? We have already seen that. Someone has taken a \nwatch and set it ahead to that date to see what would happen. At the \nmoment it goes to the year 2000, a circuit freezes open, the watch \ndisplay disappears, the power from the battery fries the chip and the \nwatch becomes useless. So at the moment of midnight, as you look at \nyour watch, your watch becomes useless.\n  I know the Presiding Officer would not do this, but for the sake of \nthe illustration, let's say you celebrate a little more than maybe you \nshould, and you decide it is appropriate that you take a taxi back to \nyour hotel. You don't have enough money for a taxi. No problem, there's \nan ATM machine and you have your ATM card with you. You put the ATM \ncard in, push the buttons and wait for the money. Nothing happens, \nbecause the ATM machine is not geared to click over into the year 2000, \nand it won't give you any cash; it is frozen.\n  Somehow, Mr. President, with the help of maybe some of your friends, \nyou get yourself to your hotel. The elevators won't work in the hotel \nbecause at midnight of the year 2000, the chip in the elevator said \nthis elevator has not been inspected for 99 years, and it goes \nimmediately to the bottom and stays there until an inspector shows up. \nSo you are forced to stagger up the stairs to find your room. We hope \nyou are using a key and not some other high technology to get into the \nroom so that you can get a good night's sleep.\n  The next morning, you get up, go down and find the lobby filled with \nangry guests. None of them can check out because the hotel's computers \nthat handle the checkout procedure are all frozen with the year 2000 \nproblem. You stand there getting more and more angry until finally with \nmanual checkout procedures, you get out of the hotel and say, ``Can I \nget a car to the airport?''\n  ``Unfortunately, Senator,'' says the manager of the hotel, ``our cars \nwon't start. They have computer chips in them that are geared to the \nyear 2000, and we can only get you to the airport in old taxi cabs that \nare so old they have no computers, and today they are in great \ndemand.''\n  You show up at the airport finally, hours and hours late, sure you \nhave missed your flight, only to discover that no flights have gone \nbecause the computer program that controls the flights and the \nreservations is all shut down because of the year 2000 problem that has \nnot been fixed.\n  It is probably just as well that the flights are not flying, because \nthe air traffic control system is managed by computers which have not \nbeen fixed for the year 2000 problem, and we would have no safety in \nthe skies anyway. Whether you like it or not, Mr. President, you are \nstuck in New York for the foreseeable future.\n  When Monday comes, the 3d of January, and the opening of the stock \nmarket in the new millennium. The stock market can't open because all \nof the stock market procedures are run by computers, and inadequate \nprecautions have been taken to get the stock market ready for the year \n2000 circumstance and the computers have shut down everywhere.\n  You write a check only to discover that the automatic deposit that \ngoes by computer into your checking account hasn't worked, because the \nbank in which you have your money is not year 2000 compliant and your \ncheck won't clear. The money is not in your account.\n  Every single circumstance that I have just described could easily \nhappen if nothing is done between now and the year 2000. Some of the \ncircumstances that I have just described inevitably will happen no \nmatter how much we work to try to get the problem solved between now \nand the year 2000. Our challenge, as a society, is to see that as few \nof those problems that I have described happen. It is impossible to \nguarantee that none of them will happen. The one that you can be \nabsolutely sure of, Mr. President, is that, if you're wearing the wrong \nbrand, your watch will fry on that date.\n\n  How big a problem is the year 2000 problem? We have held hearings in \nmy subcommittee and asked this question, and we have come up with two \nnumbers, both of them large.\n  The first is the number that it will cost to fix the problem. The \nestimate that we have before our committee and in our subcommittee \nrecord is roughly $600 billion--$600 billion. That is a little less \nthan 10 percent of our gross domestic product, which is currently \nrunning at $7 trillion. So 10 percent of that would be $700 billion. If \nwe are $100 billion off, it is going to cost 10 percent of our gross \ndomestic product to fix the problem--a very large number, a very large \npercentage.\n  The other number is even bigger. We have asked the question: How big \nis the potential liability that can come from lawsuits that people file \nin the year 2000? The answer we have is $1 trillion.\n  So we are looking at a problem in the economy that could cost us as \nmuch as 10 percent of GDP to fix, and if it is not fixed properly, it \ncould cost us as much as one-seventh of the economy in lawsuits to deal \nwith the liability.\n  I don't know of a problem we have faced here on the floor that has \nthat kind of certainty connected with it and that kind of urgency \nconnected with it. We, in politics, always try to create a disaster so \nthat the politicians then can pass a law to fix it and then take credit \nfor having averted the disasters. Many times the disasters we were \ntalking about weren't coming anyway. This one you can count on. It is \ncoming; it is there; it is quantifiable; it is very real.\n  A lot of folks have said to me, ``No, no, no, Senator, don't get \nexcited, this is a simple problem and Bill Gates will fix it for us.'' \nThe idea is Bill Gates, or some other smart computer jockey, will sit \ndown, spend a weekend coming up with a solution, mail it out to \neverybody, and we will put it in our computers like a magic fix, press \na few buttons and the whole problem will go away. That is not possible, \nbecause it is not that kind of a problem and if you don't believe me \nlook at the Microsoft website, under frequently asked questions, FAQ. \nThere will be no magic bullet.\n  Here is the problem, Mr. President. The computer code was written 20, \n30, sometimes as recently as 10, 15 years ago. It was important for \ncost reasons to hold down the number of areas in a field. I am using \nthe language the computer folks talk about, the bits and the\n\n[[Page S12476]]\n\nbytes, and so on. They will have a field, and if they have two digits, \nit is a whole lot cheaper to put the field in the code than if there \nare four, at least under the old languages in the old code. So, to save \ntime, to save money, they put in a two-digit field instead of a four-\ndigit field, assuming that no one needed to know the 19 of the year, \nthey only needed to know the 61, 62, 71, 72, or whatever would come \nlater.\n  Many of them assumed that these programs would long since be phased \nout by the year 2000, and if they gave any thought to the year 2000 \nproblem at all, they were sure that their computer codes would not be \nin use at that time.\n  In fact, Mr. President, many of those codes are in use, and they are \nin use in the largest computer systems that we have in the country, in \nthe mainframe systems that run most of American business.\n  Is it an easy problem to fix? Oh, yes, it is very simple; very \nsimple. All you have to do is find that portion of the computer code \nwhere there is a two-digit field and change it to a four-digit field. \nThat is not rocket science. What is not simple is finding where that \nfield is in the first place.\n  The analogy that I heard that best describes it is this: Fixing a \nline of code is as simple as changing a rivet on the Golden Gate \nBridge. The Golden Gate Bridge is held together by hundreds of \nthousands, if not millions, of rivets. You have the responsibility of \nfinding every one and changing every one during rush hour, and if you \nmiss one or two, the bridge will fall down. That is the enormity of the \nproblem that we have here.\n  It is a simple, easy fix once you find it, but gargantuan in its \nsize, because there are so many that must be found and, in many cases, \nwith the older software, no one knows where the code is. Documentation \nwas not an extended science at the time they were writing that code. No \none knows where it is. You are on a search mission that can be \ntremendously frustrating. You can think you have everything, then you \ngear up the system and run it, only to discover there are still some \nrivets missing that you have not changed. There are still some fields \nof code that have not been expanded.\n  Mr. President, we have held four hearings in my subcommittee on this \nissue. The first one we had the banks and the financial institutions \ncome in and testify as to the size of the problem from their point of \nview. It was very revealing.\n  They gave us this number which is what is driving my sense of \nurgency. They told us that if we do not have the year 2000 problem \nfixed by September of 1998 in the banking system, we are too late. \nSeptember of 1998, that is less than a year away. Many people say, \n``Oh, 2000, this is 1997, we have 3 years to worry about it.'' No, Mr. \nPresident, we have less than 1 year to worry about it.\n  I asked the question, why must it be fixed by September of 1998? Back \nto my analogy about changing the rivets on the Golden Gate Bridge \nduring rush hour. You have to test this system once you have replaced \nall of the fields with two digits with fields with four digits to make \nsure you got them all. The banking system can't test its computer \nprograms while it is running all of its checks and deposits and \ntransfer payments. So by September of 1998, when you supposedly have \nyour system done, you have about 50 weekends left to test it. The \nexperts who have looked at it said you have to have at least 50 in \nwhich to test it to keep changing the problems as they come along.\n  So I repeat, as far as the banking system is concerned, if people do \nnot have their remedial program pretty well done by September of 1998, \nthey are way behind the curve and, indeed, the witnesses who spoke to \nus said we are already in a circumstance where we are not talking about \na total fix, we are talking about triage, the medical term that says \nwhen you bring in an accident victim or a gunshot victim, you do what \nis necessary to save the victim's life and then you worry about other \nthings to restore him to health later on. Triage is the lifesaving \nactivity; the return to health comes later on.\n  So we are talking about triage activity with respect to the year 2000 \nbeing in place by September of 1998. We are not talking about the total \nfix, because the total fix will have to take place for months and \nmonths after we pass the turn of the millennium.\n  Obviously, when we are talking numbers this big if the problem is not \nproperty solved, it can have serious implications for the economy. Dr. \nEd Yardeni testified in our last hearing. He is an investor analyst who \nhas been looking at this problem, and his first reaction to it when he \nlooked at it was, ``My gosh, if this thing isn't settled, this could, \nin fact, cause a recession.'' He put the chances of that happening at \n30 percent, a recession of worldwide proportions, Mr. President--30 \npercent. That is enough to get our attention.\n  Why does he say there is a 30-percent chance of a worldwide recession \nof the problem isn't fixed properly?\n  He makes this very powerful point, going back to our last truly major \nrecession which came as a result of the interruption in oil supplies in \nthe early 1970's. The world runs on oil. If we cannot get a regular and \ndependable supply of oil, we cannot run our world economies. Today, the \nworld still runs on oil, but it runs on information. And if there is an \ninterruption in the flow of information, it will have implications far \nbeyond your inability to get a taxi in New York on New Year's Day.\n  If the information in the banking system and in the financial \nmarkets, information in insurance and loans is all interrupted in ways \nthat cause things to fail, it could in fact trigger this trillion \ndollars worth of liability that we are talking about and create a \nrecession.\n  Many people said that to Dr.. Yardeni, ``You're an alarmist saying \nthere is a 30 percent chance of recession. Study the problem more so \nyou understand it better.'' He has done it and raised his prediction \nfrom 30 percent to 35 percent. At the time we had the hearing, he \nprepared himself for the hearings to that he would be very much up to \ndate on everything that was going on.\n  When he came before our subcommittee he said the chance of a \nworldwide recession occurring as a result of the year 2000 problem is \nnow at 40 percent. The chances are going up as time runs out and people \nfail to react. The more time we have, the lower the chance. The less \ntime we have, with a slow reaction time, the greater the chance.\n  Mr. President, we have learned in the hearings in my committee that \nthis is a pervasive business problem, not just limited to the financial \nmarkets. Businesses rely on computer systems for nearly every aspect of \ntheir operations from operating medical equipment that administers \nchemotherapy, to calculating interest on loans, to launching and \ntracking satellites.\n  Failure in one computer system could not only devastate it, but we \nare so interconnected that it could have a ripple effect on other \ncomputer systems. So this brings us back to the fact that businesses \nare going to have to expend huge sums of money in order to deal with \nthe risks connected with this. Some of the companies have already \nstepped forward and disclosed what they are going to do.\n  American Airlines puts the cost at $100 million to solve their year \n2000 problem. GTE plans to spend $150 million. And outside of the \nbusiness arena--my State of Utah has set aside $40 million to deal with \ntheir problems. The USAA group said they will spend as much as $75 \nmillion.\n  What about the companies in which you own stock, Mr. President? If \nyou say you do not own any, then what about the companies that your \npension funds own stocks? How much do they plan to spend in remediation \nor in contingency planning? If you check their disclosure statements, \nyou probably will not find the answer, because more and more companies \nare saying, ``We don't want to disclose how big a year 2000 problem we \nhave because we don't want to tip off your competitors, we don't want \nto hurt the stock price, to in effect say to our investors that we've \ngot this huge cost coming, while our competitors are not disclosing \nit.''\n  And some of the regulators have said to us, ``If a stockholder wants \nto know how big the problem is, he or she should call the company and \nask.'' That is totally unacceptable, Mr. President. It is unfair and \nunrealistic to expect an individual shareholder in any company or a \ndepositor at any financial institution to make the inquiries on his own \nand have any hope of getting a meaningful answer.\n\n[[Page S12477]]\n\n  What we need is disclosure that is mandated by the regulators that \neverybody responds to. The burden must be upon the institution to \ndisclose its readiness in this circumstance.\n  That is why, Mr. President, I am rising today to introduce the CRASH \nProtection Act of 1997. We love acronyms in Government. CRASH stands \nfor ``Computer Remediation And Share Holder'' protection.\n  I hope that it will make our transition into next millennium much \nsmoother than it would currently be. My legislation will require the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to amend its disclosure requirements \nin five specific ways.\n\n  First, it will require disclosure of a moving peg pinpointing any \npublicly traded corporation's progress with regard to the remediation \nof the five recognized phases of the year 2000 preparation. Awareness, \nthese five are awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and \nimplementation. So there will be a disclosure of how a company is doing \nin those five areas.\n  Second, my bill will require a summary of the costs incurred by the \ncompany in connection with any remediation effort. Both sums already \nexpended and those that can reasonably be expected to be expended in \nthe future. That is a cost that every shareholder deserves to know.\n  Third, it will require the disclosure of likely costs associated with \nthe defense of lawsuits against the company or its directors and \nofficers due to any liabilities incurred as a result of year 2000 \nproblems.\n  Fourth, it will require an estimate and a detailed discussion of \nexisting insurance coverage for the defense of lawsuits or the specific \noccurrence of any year 2000 failure, large or small, and finally it \nwill mandate the disclosure of all contingency plans for computer \nsystem failure.\n  Mr. President, the SEC has commented on this issue. And I would like \nto read their appropriate paragraph. They say:\n\n       It is not, and will not, be possible for any single entity \n     or collective enterprise to represent that it has achieved \n     complete Year 2000 compliance and thus to guarantee its \n     remediation efforts.\n\n  Again, Mr. President, it will not be possible for anyone to do that. \nBack to the statement:\n\n       The problem is simply too complex for such a claim to have \n     legitimacy. Efforts to solve Year 2000 problems are best \n     described as ``risk mitigation''. Success in the effort will \n     have been achieved if the number and seriousness of any \n     technical failures is minimized, and they are quickly \n     identified and repaired if they do occur.\n\n  Mr. President, that statement more than any other reflects my concern \nthat we must move forward to make sure that the year 2000 problem is \ntaken seriously by publicly traded companies, their officers and their \nlegal representatives.\n  It will be my goal to move this bill as quickly as possible after the \nfirst of the year because again may I stress, Mr. President, it is not \nmidnight, December 31, 1999, tht is our deadline, it is September, \n1998, in which the plans must be in place or they will not have the \nopportunity to be tested and get us out of the circumstance.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me stress that year 2000 problems are not \nlimited to the private-sector businesses. Studies have shown that our \nGovernment is well behind the curve in its remediation efforts.\n  As one of my staffers says that his grandmother, Maria Schwibinger, \nalways told him ``sweep your own stoop first.'' Government ought to \nfocus on its own year 2000 problems as well as require that others do \nthat.\n  The GAO has given many branches of Government unsatisfactory ratings \nin their management of the year 2000 problems. I have asked the GAO to \nreport on the progress of the financial institution regulatory \nagencies. And they are doing that.\n  So far I have only one of their reports, and it is not reassuring. \nThey have completed their review of the National Credit Union \nAdministration and expressed a myriad of concerns about its \npreparedness for the date change.\n  Last Monday, I received NCUA's response to the GAO. And this response \ntroubled me for several reasons.\n  No. 1, it made no effort to refute the GAO assertion that ``For some \ncredit unions, year 2000 problems could even result in their \nfailures.'' We are not talking about expense here, we are talking about \nsurvival. And they do not refute that.\n\n  No. 2, it implicitly agreed with the GAO's assertion that NCUA does \nnot have qualified staff to conduct examinations in complex systems \nareas. They had better get going in getting that qualified staff as \nquickly as they possibly can.\n  And, No. 3, its response plan for compliance on the part of the \nNation's credit unions is all prospective in nature. They had no report \nof anything that they had done in the past.\n  Now, lest anybody think I am beating up on the credit unions, let me \nmake it clear that this is the only report I have. It is entirely \npossible that the GAO's review of bank, insurance, and securities \nregulators, would be equally as devastating. So others need not take \ncomfort in the fact that I am talking about credit unions and not about \nthem. Their time may very well be coming.\n  So, Mr. President, I submit this bill and ask it be appropriately \nreferred. I close with this final comment. I am doing everything I can. \nChairman D'Amato, as chairman of the full committee, is cooperating \nfully and leading the charge at the full committee level and doing \neverything he can to see to it that our Nation's financial institutions \nare prepared and ready for the year 2000 problem.\n  The Banking Committee and my subcommittee have no jurisdiction over \nthe other areas of Government where this problem is real. We have no \njurisdiction over the Defense Department, over the IRS, over the air \ntraffic control system or any of the other myriad of agencies that have \ntheir own year 2000 challenges.\n  I am currently putting together a letter to the President in which I \nam calling upon him to appoint, through the use of his Executive power, \nsome coordinating figure within the entire executive branch whose sole \nresponsibility between now and that great New Year's Eve party will be \nto monitor, hector, prod, push, and otherwise produce results in every \narea of the executive branch.\n  I hope that if the Government will get involved in this at that kind \nof level, if the regulators in the financial areas will respond to the \nkind of prodding that is coming as a result of my bill, as shareholders \nreact to the information that is made available to them if my bill \npasses, demand remediation efforts on the part of the companies that \nthey own, that we will be able to look back on my opening comment on \nwhat the Presiding Officer could expect on New Year's Eve and say, \ninstead of the disaster that Senator Bennett outlined back in November \n1997, we had some minor inconveniences.\n  Nothing could make me happier in this area than to see that my \nprediction will not come true, to have Dr. Yardeni, and other \nthoughtful people examining this issue, begin to move down their level \nof concern so that instead of a 40-percent chance of a worldwide \nrecession, they are talking about a 35- or 30- or a 25- or a 20-percent \nchance or finally saying, well, by virtue of the reaction that was \ncreated, the chance of a worldwide recession is now down to practically \nnothing.\n  I would be very, very happy to be proven wrong by the reaction that \nis created as a result of the legislation that we will introduce today \nand the hearings that we have held. But I stress again in closing, Mr. \nPresident, this is the disaster that we can see. It is like the oil \ncrisis in its size, but it can be prepared for and it can be mitigated \nagainst if we only will muster the will to recognize what we are facing \nand do the things we have to do. I am hoping that my legislation and \nthe hearings held in my subcommittee will move us in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12471-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12477-S12478]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 497\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coverdell, the name of the Senator from \nColorado [Mr. Allard] was added as a cosponsor of S. 497, a bill to \namend the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor Act to \nrepeal the provisions of the Acts that require employees to pay union \ndues or fees as a condition of employment.\n\n\n                                 S. 950\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the name of the Senator from Montana\n\n[[Page S12478]]\n\n[Mr. Burns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 950, a bill to provide for \nequal protection of the law and to prohibit discrimination and \npreferential treatment on the basis of race, color, national origin, or \nsex in Federal actions, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 952\n\n  At the request of Mr. McConnell, the name of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 952, a bill to establish a \nFederal cause of action for discrimination and preferential treatment \nin Federal actions on the basis of race, color, national origin, or \nsex, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 987\n\n  At the request of Mr. Specter, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Johnson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 987, a bill to \namend title 38, United States Code, to authorize a cost-of-living \nadjustment in the rates of disability compensation for veterans with \nservice-connected disabilities and dependency and indemnity \ncompensation for survivors of such veterans and to revise and improve \ncertain veterans compensation, pension, and memorial affairs programs;

which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 155\n\n       Whereas April 6 has a special significance for all \n     Americans, and especially those Americans of Scottish \n     descent, because the Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish \n     Declaration of Independence, was signed on April 6, 1320 and \n     the American Declaration of Independence was modeled on that \n     inspirational document;\n       Whereas this resolution honors the major role that Scottish \n     Americans played in the founding of this Nation, such as the \n     fact that almost half of the signers of the Declaration of \n     Independence were of Scottish descent, the Governors in 9 of \n     the original 13 States were of Scottish ancestry, and \n     Scottish Americans successfully helped shape this country in \n     its formative years and guide this Nation through its most \n     troubled times;\n       Whereas this resolution recognizes the monumental \n     achievements and invaluable contributions made by Scottish \n     Americans that have led to America's preeminence in the \n     fields of science, technology, medicine, government, \n     politics, economics, architecture, literature, media, and \n     visual and performing arts;\n       Whereas this resolution commends the more than 200 \n     organizations throughout the United States that honor \n     Scottish heritage, tradition, and culture, representing the \n     hundreds of thousands of Americans of Scottish descent, \n     residing in every State, who already have made the observance \n     of Tartan Day on April 6 a success; and\n       Whereas these numerous individuals, clans, societies, \n     clubs, and fraternal organizations do not let the great \n     contributions of the Scottish people go unnoticed: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates April 6 of each year \n     as ``National Tartan Day''.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \ndesignating April 6 of each year as ``National Tartan Day,'' not only \nto recognize the outstanding achievements and contributions made by \nScottish-Americans to the United States, but to better recognize an \nimportant day in the history of all free men, April 6.\n  It was nearly 700 years ago, on April 6, 1320, that a group of men in \nArbroath, Scotland, enumerated a long list of grievances against the \nEnglish king of the day, asserted their independence in no uncertain \nterms, and claimed that they, the people of Scotland, had the right to \nchoose their own government. They wrote, ``We fight for liberty alone, \nwhich no good man loses but with his life * * *''\n  These were daring words, because the Scots who wrote those words \nlived in dangerous times. Violence ruled the world. Wars were fought \nfor property, for conquest, for great tracts of land in far away \ncountries.\n  But the Scots who met on that cold April day, perhaps in the rain, \nwere not fighting for property or conquest or estates. They wrote, ``We \nfight for liberty alone.'' This was all they fought for. Liberty.\n  These were daring words--dangerous words--words that could bring \ncertain death to them and their families. These Scotsmen were claiming \nliberty as their birthright. They were claiming they were born free \nmen--and no king, no baron, no landlord with his troops could take this \nliberty from the men in Scotland.\n  These were words that lasted, long after kings and buildings had \nfallen into ruin. These were words that endured, like the mountains, \nhills and stones of Scotland.\n  These were words that reached across the years, the centuries, across \nthe ocean. Over 450 years later, a group of men stood in a building in \nthe British colony of Pennsylvania, on a hot summer's day, debating and \nthen signing their own declaration of independence. They used the \nArbroath Declaration as the template for their own thoughts,\n\n[[Page S12479]]\n\ntheir own words. This was natural--many of the men in that room in \nPhiladelphia, almost half, were of Scottish ancestry. The draftsman of \nthe document was Thomas Jefferson--one of his ancestors had signed the \nArbroath Declaration, all of those centuries before. The words of the \nArbroath Declaration meant something to those men--they were daring \nwords--words that would not be quiet, that would not lie quiet and \nstill on some forgotten Scottish hill. The men in Philadelphia that day \nremembered those words--``We fight for liberty alone''--and the men in \nPhiladelphia signed their own declaration of independence.\n  The words and thoughts of those long-ago Scottish patriots live on in \nAmerica. Liberty, true liberty, has been good to their descendants in \nAmerica. Scottish-Americans have helped build this nation since the \nbeginning. Three-fourths of all American presidents can trace their \nroots to Scotland. The contributions of Scottish-Americans are \ninnumerable: Some of the great have included Neil Armstrong, Alexander \nGraham Bell, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Alva Edison, William Faulkner, \nMalcolm Forbes, Billy Graham, Alexander Hamilton, Washington Irving, \nJohn Paul Jones, John Marshall, Andrew Mellon, Samuel F.B. Morse, James \nNaismith, Edgar Allen Poe, Gilbert Stuart, Elizabeth Taylor, to name \nonly a few.\n  But beyond all of the accomplishments of Scottish-Americans, beyond \nall the wonderful inventions like the telegraph and telephone and \nelectric light, all the works of literature, all the great businesses \nand charitable organizations founded by Scottish-Americans, beyond all \nof those accomplishments, are the words. ``We fight for liberty alone * \n* * We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with his \nlife.''\n  Those are haunting words. Those are words that haunted the men who \npassed them down for generations, wherever men dreamed of being free, \nwords that haunted the men who rewrote them in Philadelphia on that \nhot, steamy day, words that have haunted generations of Americans. \nWords that have lived inside men, unspoken, as they marched to \nYorktown, as they lined up quietly behind the cotton bales in New \nOrleans, marched to Mexico, sailed to Cuba and the Philippines, and \nEurope and the Pacific and Korea and the Persian Gulf. These are words \nthat live inside all of us Americans, and especially inside our \nveterans: ``We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but \nwith his life.'' And how many have lost their lives for our freedom.\n  It is appropriate that we honor April 6 as National Tartan Day. The \nScottish clansmen who met on that cold day and declared their \nindependence were our clansmen, no matter what nation we hail from. \nThey were our brothers.\n  Mr. President, I ask all my colleagues to support this resolution, so \nthat we may never forget, so that the world, in some small way, may \nnever forget, the beginnings of freedom in far-away, long-ago Arbroath.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12478-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 THE WIRELESS TELEPHONE PROTECTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HATCH AMENDMENT NO. 1634\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Hatch) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 493) \nto amend section 1029 of title 18, United States Code, with respect to \ncellular telephone cloning paraphernalia; as follows:\n\n       On page 6, line 1, strike ``The punishment'' and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) ``In general.--The punishment''.\n       On page 6, line 2, strike ``section''.\n       On page 6, line 3, strike ``(1)'' and insert ``(A)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 7, strike ``(A)'' and insert ``(i)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 11, strike ``(B)'' and insert ``(ii)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 14, strike ``and''.\n       On page 6, line 15, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(B)'' and \n     indent accordingly.\n       On page 6, line 19, strike the punctuation at the end and \n     insert ``; and''.\n       On page 6, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       ``(C) in any case, in addition to any other punishment \n     imposed or any other forfeiture required by law, forfeiture \n     to the United States of any personal property used or \n     intended to be used to commit, facilitate, or promote the \n     commission of the offense.\n       ``(2) Applicable Procedure.--The criminal forfeiture of \n     personal property subject to forfeiture under paragraph \n     (1)(C), any seizure and disposition thereof, and any \n     administrative or judicial proceeding in relation thereto, \n     shall be governed by subsections (c) and (e) through (p) of \n     section 413 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \n     853).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         KYL AMENDMENT NO. 1635\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Kyl) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 493, to \namend section 1029 of title 18, United States Code, with respect to \ncellular telephone cloning paraphernalia; as follows:\n\n       On page 6, line 5, strike ``that has become final and that \n     was committed on a separate prior occasion.'' and insert ``, \n     which conviction has become final--''.\n       On page 6, line 7, strike ``(2),''.\n       On page 6, line 11, strike ``(1),'' and insert ``(1), \n     (2),''.\n       On page 6, beginning on line 16, strike ``that has become \n     final and that was committed on a separate prior occasion, \n     that has'' and insert ``which conviction has become final,''.\n       On page 7, line 24, after ``subsection (a)(9)'' insert ``, \n     provided that if such hardware or software is used to obtain \n     access to telecommunications service provided by another \n     facilities-based carrier, such access is authorized''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12479-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12479-S12480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      ABERDEEN FOSTER GRANDPARENTS\n\n Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to speak in honor of \nthe special 25th annual banquet for the Foster Grandparents Program in \nAberdeen.\n  I would like to recognize most especially Linda Dillavou for all the \nhard work and time she has put into the Foster Grandparent Program. The \nsuccess of their operation is due in no small part to her dedication \nand hard work.\n  For the past 25 years, this Foster Grandparents organization has \nstrengthened the Aberdeen community by providing services to children \nthat local budgets cannot afford. It has built important bridges across \nthe generations. Those of you gathered here this evening offer \nemotional support for those children who have been abused or neglected, \nmentor troubled teens and young mothers, and care for premature infants \nand children with physical disabilities. ``Grannies'' and ``Granddads'' \nserve one-on-one with children. They tutor, counsel, assist, guide or \nhelp in a variety of ways--whatever is needed. They serve in schools, \nhospitals, shelters, Head Start, and other child-serving facilities.\n  They represent one of South Dakota's growing resources. The United \nStates is in the midst of a demographic revolution. There are twice as \nmany older adults today as there were 30 years ago; soon nearly a \nquarter of the population will be more than 65 years old. By the middle \nof the next century, for the first time, the number of Americans over \n65 will exceed those under 18.\n  For the most part, this transformation is portrayed as a source of \nnew strains on South Dakota families, the economy, and the Federal \nbudget. But the prevailing pessimism about the graying of America is \nblinding us to the great promise of this change. The talent and civic \npotential they provide for South Dakota is immeasurable. After all, our \nsenior population is, quite possibly, this country's best increasing \nnatural resource.\n  Why? They share the time they have. They offer practical wisdom, \ngained from experience, and carry with them a world otherwise lost to \nyounger generations. Seniors also have special reason to become \ninvolved in the civic and voluntary work that others cannot perform. \nThe awareness that comes with age inspires reflection about the legacy \nthat we leave behind: we are what survives of us, especially through \nthese children.\n  Their 25 year history is, indeed, impressive. To help us all \nappreciate how far this organization has come, I'd like to share the \nstory of this organization's beginning--a story of a historical \naccident rather than enlightened vision.\n  President Johnson--in an attempt to help poor seniors--ordered the \nOffice of Aging at the Department of Health, Education and Welfare to \ndevise an initiative engaging low-income seniors in community service \nfor vulnerable children. When the office was unveiled,\n\n[[Page S12480]]\n\nwhat would become the Foster Grandparent Program was rejected as \npreposterous by the Nation's most progressive children's \norganizations--mostly hospitals and large institutions for \ndevelopmentally disabled youth. The seniors would have little to \ncontribute to children, they complained; besides, they would spread \ndisease and probably even lack the wherewithal to get to the job. The \nagencies actually refused to take the Government's money. Times have \ncertainly changed.\n  Given this history, we should challenge ourselves to imagine new \ninstitutions that make full use of the resources of age for the next \nsuccessful 25 years for the Aberdeen Foster Grandparents. Pilot \nprograms suggest the kinds of contributions seniors might make. In \nHilton Head, SC, a group of retired physicians and nurses have formed a \nfree health clinic providing, among other things, preventive care for \nlow-income families. In Virginia and Montana, the Senior Environmental \nCorps is dedicated to alerting doctors, the elderly, and the public to \nthe special environmental hazards faced by the older population. In \nMassachusetts, a group of downsized electrical workers is helping young \nex-criminal offenders make the transition to productive life in the \ncommunity.\n  This Aberdeen Foster Grandparent Program--on the occasion of their \n25th anniversary--is our best glimpse at how we can benefit from the \nenergy and talent of older Americans on a grander scale. The record of \nthe Foster Grandparent Program suggests that if we build appealing \nservice opportunities for older adults, they will come forward and lend \na hand.\n  I congratulate the Aberdeen Foster Grandparents on this very special \noccasion, and I thank them for giving selflessly of their time to make \nthe past 25 years so successful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12479-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TELEMARKETING FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Telemarketing \nFraud Prevention Act of 1997. It is long past time to punish criminals \nwho have perpetrated fraudulent telephone scams.\n  Telemarketing fraud swindles Americans out of $40 billion dollars \nevery year, but one group in particular is especially hard hit: senior \ncitizens. In fact, the Attorney General recently noted that the elderly \nare subject to a barrage of high-pressure sales calls, sometimes as \nmany as five or more calls every day.\n  In a recent Associated Press story, the chief of the Financial Crimes \nSection of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Chuck Owens, \ndiscussed criminals who commits telemarketing fraud. Mr. Owens stated \nas follows:\n\n       We estimate that, conservatively, 50% of the time, these \n     people victimize the elderly . . . Many times you've got \n     senior citizens who basically need the money that they've \n     saved to continue to provide for themselves in their elder \n     years, and we've had numerous instances where they've taken \n     every cent.\n\n  Over the past year, one especially heinous scheme has gained \npopularity among criminals. Past victims of telemarketing fraud are \noften called by a second swindler who promises to help recover the \nmoney lost in the first scam. However, once the victims turn over their \nrecovery fees, the second swindler fails to lift a finger to help.\n  The Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act directs the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to provide enhanced penalties for those persons convicted of \ntelemarketing fraud, and allows prosecutors to seek even greater \npenalties for those who mastermind fraudulent schemes. In addition, the \nact requires offenders to forfeit their ill-gotten gains, much in the \nsame manner as drug dealers are forced to turn over the fruits of their \ncrimes.\n  Although the original version of this bill mandated specific \nincreases in sentencing levels, those provisions were removed during \ndiscussion with the minority in order to move this legislation forward. \nHowever, I note that the House recently approved legislation nearly \nidentical to the original version of this bill, and I recognize that \nfinal passage of this bill must reconcile the House and Senate \npositions on the underlying issues. I am hopeful that the final version \nwill contain the strongest possible deterrents for those who might \nconsider taking up the unsavory practice of telemarketing fraud.\n  Mr. President, this bill presents an opportunity to curb the growing \nproblem of telemarketing fraud, a crime which is especially cruel when \ntargeted against the elderly and infirm. We should not let this \nopportunity pass.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12480-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ENCRYPTION EXPORTS NEED LIBERALIZATION\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in the final days of this session, \nthe Congress is emersed in a debate over our Nation's trade policy. In \nmy judgement, we have not focused enough attention on our policies that \nare hindering our ability to compete internationally and policies that \nare increasing our trade deficits.\n  One issue that relates the ability of U.S. companies to compete \ninternationally is the existing policy of the administration with \nrespect to controls on the exportation of encryption technology. \nCurrently, U.S. firms are the world leaders in encryption but other \nnations are gaining fast. Perhaps the greatest single factor in the \nerosion of U.S. dominance in encryption technology is the \nadministration's export controls.\n  As some of my colleagues know, there are several bills introduced in \nCongress to address encryption. The Senate Commerce Committee has even \nreported legislation in this area and I and the Senator from Montana, \nSenator Burns have been pushing alternative legislation that would \nrequire more realistic export controls on encryption. However, the \nadministration does not need Congress to pass a law to change their \npolicy in this area and I would like to encourage the administration to \nreview their current policy and apply more realistic export controls on \nencryption technology.\n  My understanding is that many other nations have multilaterally \nagreed to decontrol the export of computer software with encryption \ncapabilities. Yet, the United States continues to impose unilateral \ncontrols. Thus, we have handicapped ourselves in the global market.\n  Commercial products from companies in Germany, Japan, and England are \nsecuring more of the international market share because those nation's \nimpose fewer restrictions on their encryption exports than we do. Mr. \nPresident, our Olympic team could not win if they had to compete with \nankle weights. The same is true for American computer hardware and \nsoftware companies. They face real competition in the international \nmarket place and their ability to provide strong information security \nfeatures is costing them sales of computer systems and software \npackages. Lost sales will mean lost jobs.\n  In my judgement we need to update American export control policy and \ncatch up with modern realities of technology and the international \nmarket place. Unfortunately, rather than make real progress on this \nissue, the administration has raised all sort of new issues, such as \nattempting to impose more controls on domestic encryption. I hope that \nthe administration will take a second look at their export controls and \nstart making progress on developing a policy that will allow U.S. \ncompanies to compete. Short of that, I hope we will make some progress \nin the Senate in moving legislation sponsored by Senator Burns, the \nPro-CODE bill, which will require a relocation of export controls, but \ndone in a manner that is sensitive to national security and law \nenforcement concerns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12480-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12480-S12481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN WAR\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, the conferees included a \nprovision (sec. 1083) authorizing the Secretary of Defense to begin to \nplan, coordinate, and execute a program to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the Korean war.\n  The Department of the Army--under the able leadership of retired \nGeneral Kicklighter--has been designated to carry out this 50th \nanniversary program. A good friend of mine, Mr. Roy Martin, former \nmayor of Norfolk, VA, and currently chairman of the Gen. Douglas \nMacArthur Foundation in Norfolk, has taken the lead in planning a \nseries of commemorative events for this very special anniversary.\n\n[[Page S12481]]\n\n  As a veteran of the Korean war, I was disappointed to learn--the day \nafter the defense authorization conference report was approved by the \nSenate--that the provision we included in our bill to commemorate this \nhistoric event was inadequate. The conferees acted in good faith to \nauthorize a program worthy of the event. Unfortunately, new information \ncame to light after the conclusion of our conference which revealed \nthat the $100,000 we had authorized would not be sufficient.\n  In an effort to correct this oversight, at my request Senator \nThurmond introduced S. 1507, a bill making technical corrections to the \ndefense authorization bill, to provide $1 million for the Korean war \ncelebration. That bill passed the Senate last evening, and the House \nhas indicated that it will pass this legislation before the end of the \ncurrent session.\n  While I understand that this will not be enough to fund the entire \nKorean war commemoration program, it will solve the immediate problem \nfor fiscal year 1998.\n  I pledge to my follow Korean war veterans that I will work with the \nDepartment of the Army in the coming fiscal years to ensure that \nadequate funding is provided by the Congress to fund a commemoration \nthat is worthy of the brave men and women who served so well on the \nbattlefields of Korea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12480-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in the spring, I was asked by the \nLaymen's National Bible Association to serve as a congressional \ncochairman for National Bible Week. The goal of the association is to \nencourage the reading and study of the Bible. I was pleased to agree to \ndo this, and to join the association in announcing that November 23 \nthrough 30 of this year has been designated as National Bible Week.

The bedrock of religion for Jews and \nChristians, it is a boundless source of comfort, hope, action, love, \nguidance, and inquiry.

Mr. President, I rise to commend six \nindustrial sites in my State that have received recognition by the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration's Voluntary Protection \nPrograms, known also as VPP.\n  The VPP is a cooperative organization between government and industry \nthat was established in 1982 to emphasize and encourage safety, health, \nand environmental programs among labor, management, and government. \nThis is done by recognizing certain industrial sites that have either \nachieved, or are making significant strides toward, excellence in \nworker safety and health protection. Mr. President, I am proud to say \nthat six sites in Idaho have been recognized by the VPP.\n  The following sites, all in Soda Springs, IA, have been awarded \nhighest recognition as star sites: the Agrium Conda Phosphate \nOperations; the J.R. Simplot Company's Conda Pump Station; the Kerr-\nMcGee Corporation's Vanadium Facility; and Solutia, Inc.\n  In addition to these star sites, I would like to commend two \nadditional industrial sites in Idaho, both run by Potlatch Corp., that \nhave achieved recognition as Merit Sites: Jaype Plywood, in Pierce, ID; \nand Potlatch Corp.'s Consumer Products Division, in Lewiston. Mr. \nPresident, both of these Potlatch sites have employees who are \nrepresented by unions. Jaype Plywood workers belong to the \nInternational Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local \nWO358, and Potlatch's Consumer Products Division employees are \nrepresented by the United Paperworkers International Union, Locals 608 \nand 712, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local \n73. I would like to say, in regard to these Potlatch sites being \nrecognized by the VPP, that the cooperation that has been exhibited \nbetween organized labor and management represents, in my mind, the best \nway to achieve a truly productive working environment by avoiding \ndivision and intrusive government regulation that frequently is \ncounterproductive to the best interests of both the laborers and \nmanagement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate all of these industrial \nsites in Idaho for their efforts. VPP recognizes the cooperation of \nlabor and management, working in conjunction with the government, to \ncreate a safe and healthy work environment for all who work at the \nsites. This spirit of cooperation has clearly achieved results, and as \na U.S. Senator from Idaho, I would like to say again that I am very \nproud of the six sites in my State that have been recognized by the \nVPP.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12481-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INDIAN DISTRIBUTION JUDGMENT FUND BILL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that H.R. 1604, the \nIndian distribution judgment fund bill, passed the Senate yesterday. \nThis bill cleared the Senate with bipartisan support, including my \nMichigan colleague, Senator Spencer Abraham. I would like to thank my \ncolleague in the House, Representative Dale Kildee, for introducing \nthis bill. I believe that H.R. 1604 will pass the House in the next few \ndays and will then be signed into law by the President.\n  H.R. 1604 is a very important piece of legislation for several \nMichigan tribes. To fully understand this bill, it is necessary to \nunderstand Michigan history. In the Treaty of 1836, the Chippewa and \nOttawa Indians of Michigan ceded over 12 million acres of land in \nMichigan to the Federal Government. Approximately 15 cents per acre was \ngiven to the tribes as compensation for this land.\n  In 1946, the U.S. Congress established the Indian Claims Commission, \na body created to redress some of the worst injustices of the U.S. \nGovernment/Indian Nation treaty era. The Indian Claims Commission \ndetermined that the value of the land ceded by the Michigan tribes was \n90 cents an acre, not 15 cents. In 1972, Congress appropriated $10 \nmillion as a final settlement for the land, but the money could not be \ndistribute until the tribes reached an agreement on how the funds would \nbe distributed. This amount has now grown to over $70 million.\n  Over the last few years, the tribes have worked among themselves to \ncome to an agreement as to the means of distributing the funds. H.R. \n1604 is the result of this consensus between the parties.\n  I would like to commend the tribal leaders for coming together to \nnegotiate this agreement. It has taken many years and much negotiating. \nTribal elder, Arthur LeBlanc, of the Bay Mills Indian Community, \ntestified before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on November 3, \n1997, on behalf of H.R. 1604. Mr. LeBlanc, and other tribal members, \nwill now be compensated for a settlement claim that has taken 25 years \nto fully resolve.\n  In closing, I offer my strong support for H.R. 1604 and am hopeful \nthat it will pass the House quickly and that the tribes will receive \ncompensation for their land as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12481-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12481-S12482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives for their recent passage of H.R. 1534, the \nPrivate Property Rights Implementation Act. This long overdue \nlegislation will provide a much needed boost to the thousands of \nhomeowners, small landowners, farmers, and others who for years have \nhad their constitutional rights compromised.\n  For too long, these landowners have seen their constitutionally \nguaranteed property rights eroded by expanding Government regulations. \nI believe the taking or restriction of the use of private property \nwithout due process and just compensation is directly contrary to our \nConstitution.\n  This predicament that too many private property owners find \nthemselves\n\n[[Page S12482]]\n\nin today was not always the case. So strong was the belief in private \nproperty ownership that our Nation's Founding Fathers guaranteed it in \nthe Constitution's Bill of Rights. The fifth amendment to the \nConstitution states: ``No person shall be * * * deprived of life, \nliberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private \nproperty be taken for public use without just compensation.''\n  For centuries, this constitutional directive was so respected that \nthe needs of public concerns were adequately addressed without \nsacrificing private property rights. However, in the 1960's, 1970's, \nand 1980's our Nation's local, State, and Federal governments began to \npass increasingly burdensome regulations governing air, water, land, \nand other natural resources, most of which had strong policy \njustification. The net, cumulative result, however, was a serious \ndiminution of private property rights.\n  Unfortunately, fighting the Government over a taking in court is not \nonly extremely expensive, it is time consuming and usually futile \nagainst the deep pockets of the Government, which has nothing to lose \nby drawing the battle out for years and years and wearing down \nopponents.\n  More than 80 percent of the time when property owners try to access \nFederal courts, they are thrown out on procedural grounds, before the \nmerits are even considered. Of the 20 percent who are successful in \nhaving their cases heard in Federal court, it takes an average of \nnearly 10 years of litigation and negotiation to get through the \nprocess.\n  Governmental bodies at the State and local level often have \nlegitimate reasons for restricting the use of private property for \nlocal zoning, environmental protection, and other purposes. Most State \nand local governments use their power responsibly, respecting the \nrights of private property owners when making land use decisions. \nNevertheless, when a governmental body at any level infringes on an \nindividual's constitutionally guaranteed rights, that person should at \nleast have his day in court.\n  H.R. 1534 allows property owners whose rights have been violated the \nsame access to Federal courts that other claimants have. For example, \nFederal environmental laws are readily enforced in Federal courts. \nFirst amendment claims against local governments also have no trouble \ngetting heard in Federal court. Only private property rights are \nroutinely dismissed or delayed. When landowners cannot afford to go to \ncourt to protect their legal and civil rights, the Government can use \npressure to effectively take the land from the landowner.\n  As chairman of the Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I \ncannot help but be reminded of one of the most contentious issues that \nfaced our subcommittee this year--the Headwaters Forest land \nacquisition. For years, the Government tried to use a variety of \nforestry and other environmental laws, including the Endangered Species \nAct, to force the landowner off a portion of its land.\n  The landowner filed a takings suit and now the Government has finally \ncome to the bargaining table offering to pay for the property. As a \nresult at the request of the Clinton administration, our Interior \nappropriations bill appropriates $250 million for the Headwaters \nacquisition. I cannot help but think that this landowner would never \nhave received compensation if it had not had the substantial financial \nresources necessary to fight a long and contentious legal battle.\n  H.R. 1534 takes several steps to allow smaller, less wealthy \nlandowners the same access to the Federal courts. Unlike other bills \ndealing with property rights, H.R. 1534 does not affect any \nenvironmental law, impact the budget, or define for the courts when a \ntaking has occurred. Instead, the bill simply attempts to clear the \nmany procedural hurdles that currently prevent most property owners \nfrom having their case heard in court in a fair and expeditious manner.\n  H.R. 1534 gives a property owner access to Federal court without \nhaving to spend years in an endless cycle of administrative appeals \nwith Government agencies. The bill still requires the owner to attempt \nat least two appeals before going to court--but provides a clear end to \nthe process. H.R. 1534 simply gives property owners the same access to \nFederal court that other claimants have.\n  Opponents of this legislation argue that this bill undermines the \nauthority of State and local governments in zoning disputes. If this \nwere the case, I would not be supporting H.R. 1534. I strongly believe \nthat land use decisions should be made at the local level to the \ngreatest extent possible. I believe in most cases it is in the best \ninterests of landowners to have their cases decided at the local level. \nRather than giving property owners another avenue or authority to sue \ncities and localities in Federal court, the House passed bill simply \nallows the decision to be made on the facts of the case without \nspending 10 years litigating on procedural questions.\n  Under H.R. 1534, local officials will still be in control of local \nzoning decisions. The Federal courts have consistently upheld local \nauthority to make these decisions. The only role the Federal courts are \ngiven under this bill is the one they already have: to interpret the \nConstitution and determine whether individuals rights have been \nviolated.\n  Passage of H.R. 1534 will be a small but significant step in the \nbattle to restore private property rights. The issues of compensation \nand adequate notification of landowners when takings occur also need to \nbe addressed by this body. Nevertheless, passage of H.R. 1534 is a \npositive step. As a cosponsor of companion legislation S. 1204 \nintroduced by Senator Coverdell, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \npass this legislation soon and hope the President will sign this \nmoderate bill when it comes to his desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12481-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12482-S12483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FDA MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there are very few pieces of \nlegislation that we will act on that has the kind of impact that S. 830 \nwill have on improving the quality of lives for millions of Americans. \nUltimately, this legislation will impact every Member of this body. S. \n830 represents a historic piece of legislation that will reform and \nmodernize the Food and Drug Administration.\n  This legislation will result in the more rapid approval of new, \nlifesaving drugs and medical devices without jeopardizing a strong \npublic health protection role for the FDA. Millions of people will have \naccess to break through medical technology faster. More children will \nalso benefit from the rapid improvement in drugs and devices to treat \nserious and life-threatening illness. And, finally the FDA will be \ngiven the resources it needs to meet the challenges and demands of \nprotecting the public health and approving safe and effective drugs in \na more timely manner.\n  When I made the decision to seek a seat on the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee I did so because I wanted to be directly involved \nin the development of education and public health reform. I am proud to \nhave worked with Chairman Jeffords in his effort to shepherd through \nthe FDA reform legislation. I know that at times this was a difficult \ntask and his leadership and patience were truly tested. I want to thank \nhim for his willingness to forge a bipartisan bill that addressed many \nof the concerns that I had early in the process. I also want to thank \nSenator Kennedy for his efforts on behalf of patients and consumers. \nSenator Kennedy's hard work and commitment to a strong public health \nrole for FDA resulted in some real improvements in this legislation.\n  The fact that we have before us today a bipartisan reform agreement \nis in itself a historic accomplishment. Prior to the 105th Congress I \nthought that I had a pretty good understanding of how the agency worked \nand where improvements needed to be made. What I discovered is that the \ndrug and device approval process from lab to patient is a complex \nprocess involving numerous steps. The pressure on the FDA to improve \nsafe and effective drugs and devices with minimal delay is \noverwhelming. In addition, the FDA must regulate billion dollar \nindustries that have almost unlimited resources. What I have learned \nfrom this process is that the FDA is by far one of the most important \npublic health agencies, but it is also one that we all seem to take for \ngranted.\n\n[[Page S12483]]\n\n  S. 830 is not just about the reform or modernization of a Federal \nagency. The activities of the FDA effect every single one of us, every \nsingle day. Whether it is taking an aspirin or brushing our teeth the \nFDA was involved. It ensured that the aspirin and the toothpaste was \nsafe and effective. The FDA manufacturing standards protect these \nproducts so that we can feel confident that they were not contaminated \nor tampered with prior to our purchase.\n  The agency is also involved in making sure that new technology to \ndiagnosis or screen for life-threatening illnesses is reliable and that \nthe claims made by the manufacturer are consistent with the available \ntechnology. The FDA must also ensure the safety and effectiveness of \nall drugs as well. When we pick up a prescription like an antibiotic at \nthe pharmacy, we never think twice about the safety or effectiveness of \nthe drug. We simply assume that if taken properly it is safe and \neffective at treating an ear infection. It is because of the success of \nthe FDA that we do take so much of this for granted.\n  This is not to say that there have not been problems in the past. \nBut, I believe the changes and improvements made by S. 830 addresses \nsome of these problems and that the commitment made by the chairman to \nmaintain aggressive and effective oversight of the agency will prevent \nsignificant problems in the future. I know that there are some who are \nskeptical of the reforms and modernization called for in this \nlegislation and they point to past problems at the agency as their \nproof. I am not dismissing past mistakes by the FDA, but I also do not \nbelieve we can allow the past errors to paralyze the agency. We have to \nmove toward the future, and learn from the mistakes of the past.\n  The agency has been given a daunting task with limited resources. \nHowever, it has become obvious over the years that a major \nmodernization was necessary in order to keep pace with the rapid \nchanges in drugs and devices and the globalization of the biotech \nindustry. In 1992 the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA], the \npartnership between the agency and the prescription drug industry, was \nenacted. This major effort has proven to be a major success for the \nFDA, industry, and patients. I am pleased that we were able to include \nreauthorization of PDUFA in S. 830 that builds on the success of the \n1992 legislation.\n  I am pleased that we have completed this process and are sending a \nsolid, bipartisan bill to the President for signature. I am confident \nthat enactment of S. 830, FDA Modernization and Accountability Act will \nprove to be one of the major accomplishments of the 105th Congress. I \nknow that I am proud to have been directly involved in the development \nof this legislation.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Jeffords and Senator Kennedy \nin the same bipartisan manner as we tackle other public health reform \ninitiatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12482-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JONES ACT WAIVER--S. 1349\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

(Bud) Smyser, commemorated Veterans Day with an \narticle entitled, ``Hawaii's Exceptionally Strong Patriotism.'' This \narticle appeared in the Thursday, November 6, 1997 edition. I ask that \nMr. Smyser's article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            [From the Honolulu Star Bulletin, Nov. 6, 1997]\n\n                Hawaii's Exceptionally Strong Patriotism\n\n                            (By A.A. Smyser)\n\n       For Veterans Day next Tuesday, I have a message from on \n     high. The Defense Department's top officer in this half of \n     the world calls Hawaii ``the most patriotic community I \n     know.''\n       Adm. Joseph W. Prueher said that to a Chamber of Commerce \n     of Hawaii lunch in July. He reiterated it recently when I \n     asked for amplification.\n       He has been CINPAC (commander-in-chief Pacific) since \n     January 1996, dealt with a lot of community matters, watched \n     the turnouts of political and community leaders for Military \n     Appreciation Week in May (which few if any other communities \n     have), Memorial Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day and Pearl \n     Harbor anniversary events.\n       He also is fully aware of the World War II contributions of \n     Hawaii's soldiers of Japanese ancestry fighting to prove \n     their loyalty. He is impressed by the still-continuing \n     reunions of those groups with sons and daughters pledged to \n     carry on.\n       He knows there are scratchy points in military-community \n     relations such as the Makua Valley beach landing exercise, \n     which he called off at the request of Governor Cayetano and \n     leaders of the Leeward Oahu community.\n       But he has faith the community remains behind the essential \n     use of Hawaii facilities to train fighting forces. He works \n     closely with Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, who says ``this community \n     pulls out the stops for the military more than any place I've \n     ever seen.''\n       He's a Navy man, of course, who sees more of our mainland \n     coasts than inland, but his Army deputy, Lt. Gen. Joseph \n     DeFrancisco, concurs. The only place DeFrancisco can think of \n     that comes close to matching us in showing its patriotism is \n     the Gulf Coast area of Georgia around Fort Stewart and Hunter \n     Army Airfield. Our Navy League chapter of 5,000 is the \n     biggest in the U.S.\n       Servicemen in Hawaii get stickers for their ID cards that \n     entitle them to kamaaina discounts in Waikiki an elsewhere. \n     They also get auto license discounts and reduced tuition at \n     the University of Hawaii.\n       There's a two-way street, of course.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate \nyesterday passed S. 537, the 5-year reauthorization of the Mammography \nQuality Standards Act. The original statute, now 5 years old, passed in \n1992 with broad bipartisan support. Through the tireless efforts of \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, the lead sponsor of the Mammography Quality \nStandards Reauthorization Act, we will be able to continue this \ncritical program for women's health.\n  Prior to the passage of this legislation, breast tumors in women were \noften missed because of defective x ray equipment or inadequately \ntrained personnel. Today, to operate lawfully, a mammography facility \nmust be certified as providing quality mammography services. That means \nthat a national uniform quality standard for\n\n[[Page S12484]]\n\nmammography has been established. It requires that facilities use only \nproperly trained personnel, establishes a control program to ensure the \nreliability, clarity, and accurate interpretation of the mammogram, and \nnow each facility undergoes an annual inspection.\n  Breast cancer is currently the second leading cause of cancer deaths \namong American women. One woman in eight will develop breast cancer \nduring her lifetime, and, during the nineties, it is estimated that \n500,000 women will die from the disease. If breast cancer is detected \nearly, however, the probability that a woman can survive is greater \nthan 90 percent.\n  Currently, the most effective technique for early detection of breast \ncancer is mammography, an x ray procedure that can often locate small \ntumors and abnormalities up to 2 years before they can be detected by \nphysical examination. However, mammography is one of the most \ntechnically challenging x ray procedures, and ensuring the quality of \nmammography services is difficult. To address concerns about variations \nin the quality of mammography service provided by the more than 10,000 \nfacilities throughout the United States and its territories, the \nCongress passed the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992.\n  This reauthorization continues an important program that gives the \nwomen of America and their families an assurance that the quality of \nservices for this vital test has improved, and will, hopefully, \nencourage even greater numbers to take advantage of this life saving \ndiagnostic tool.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12483-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NEW REPORT DOCUMENTING THE RISKS OF PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the last several years a virtual \ncottage industry has sprung up in this city to promote the \nprivatization of this Nation's Social Security system.\n  Phase out, partially privatize, or dismantle Social Security \nentirely, say the privatization advocates, and let each American \ncitizen invest their payroll tax on Wall Street and become a \nmillionaire by retirement. With Social Security requiring adjustments \nto maintain its long-term solvency, and the Dow Jones until recent days \nseeming to hit stratospheric highs almost every day, the notion of \nletting the private markets provide for retirement has had a certain \nappeal for privatizers.\n  Now a thoughtful and extremely sobering new economic analysis is \nwarning us to plant our feet back on solid ground and take a hard look \nat the very considerable and too-little discussed risks of privatizing \nSocial Security.\n  On October 21, 1997 I was pleased to sponsor a congressional staff \nbriefing which unveiled a report written by economist John Mueller of \nthe Lehrman, Bell, Mueller, Cannon, Inc. market-forecasting firm on \nbehalf of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  It is worth pointing out that this report is not the product of some \nanti-Wall Street or pro-big government partisan. John Mueller is a \nconservative, supply-side Republican who served for a number of years \nas the chief economist for Jack Kemp and the U.S. House Republican \ncaucus.\n  After putting aside the usual optimistic rhetoric about privatization \nand actually examining the numbers, here's what John Mueller found:\n  That Social Security provides a measurably higher real return than \nall types of financial assets--including the stock market--when \ntraditional calculations of risk are considered. In fact, financial \nasset returns, under the same economic conditions, are lower than the \naverage return on a steady-state, pay-as-you-go Social Security system.\n  Social Security will be even more attractive, not less, than private \ninvestments in financial assets during the next 75 years, when \nactuarial projections contend that the U.S. economy is likely to slow \nto a 1.4 percent growth rate. The same economic and demographic factors \nthat drove average, real stockmarket returns up by 10 percent annually \nin the past 20 years will drive Wall Street returns down to about 1.5 \npercent in the next 20 years.\n  Social Security, by financing a huge investment in human capital, has \nbeen an enormous engine for the growth of the U.S. economy. \nPrivatization would result in lower investment, slower growth, and a \nsmaller economy; the loss well could reach $3 trillion and cost the \neconomy at least 4 percent in lost growth during the next 75 years.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to obtain a copy and read John \nMueller's report: Three New Papers on ``Privatizing'' Social Security, \nOne Conclusion: Bad Idea. I would be pleased to provide a copy to any \ncolleague who may be interested.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12484-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING CONGREGATION B'NAI ABRAHAM ON THE OCCASION OF ITS 90TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer my \ncongratulations to congregation B'nai Abraham, located in Beloit, WI, \nas its members mark 90 years of service to the Jewish community in \nsouthern Wisconsin.\n  Mr. President, B'nai Abraham was founded on November 7, 1907, by a \ngroup of people who were collecting funds to help a destitute man. It \nwas a highly appropriate beginning to a congregation dedicated to \nproviding comfort, inspiration, solace, guidance, and support. Since \nthen, the members of congregation B'nai Abraham have nurtured a strong \nsense of community responsibility, and the congregation has embraced \nthe role of the synagogue, as with any house of religious faith, as a \nshelter and a center for renewal of the spirit.\n  But faith, like the body that carries it, only grows stronger with \nexercise, and by that I mean its application in our daily lives. The \nvalues I learned in my community, including diligence, compassion a \nsense of justice and feeling of responsibility to my community, have \nbeen cornerstones of my career in public service, and I have tried to \napply those values in my work, including my efforts on bipartisan \ncongressional reform, my support of Israel and the Middle East peace \nprocess, and my commitment to civil rights.\n  As with so many other Americans, the people who founded B'nai Abraham \ncame from a culture whose members sought these shores to escape \noppression, and they relied on one another for support even as the \nwhole new world of challenge and opportunity spread itself out before \nthem.\n  Mr. President, I grew up among the members of that community, and I \ncounted on my congregation to provide the grounding in values and \ntraditions every young person needs as he or she is growing up, as well \nas a sense of spiritual and cultural refreshment. It is particularly \nimportant for people of faith who find themselves in the minority to \nhave a place to worship and to pass along their values and traditions \nto their children.\n  B'nai Abraham places a very strong emphasis on education, and \ncongregations like B'nai Abraham also serve to represent their members \nto others and promote the awareness of Jewish heritage in our \ncommunities.\n  In that way, B'nai Abraham's members not only educate their neighbors \nbut also show how people of diverse backgrounds still share \nexperiences, histories and concerns, which can be a powerful \nencouragement to the continued efforts of so many Americans to promote \nunderstanding, tolerance, and cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I am a member of many communities America, the State \nof Wisconsin and the town of Middleton, but without this community of \nfaith that has done so much to guide and support me, I would be a \npoorer man.\n  So, Mr. President, let me offer my warmest congratulations to \ncongregation B'nai Abraham, and may its members enjoy good health and \ngood fortune as they prepare to celebrate 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12484-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12484-S12487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WIRELESS TELEPHONE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support S. \n493, the Wireless Telephone Protection Act. This important bill will \nclose a glaring gap in the protection afforded by federal law to \ncellular telephone communications.\n  Law enforcement is alarmed by the increasingly prevalent practice of \n``cloning'' cellular phones. Essentially, criminals operating scanners \nfrom the roadside or from buildings near urban freeways, copy \nidentifying numbers for cellular phones. Using the data they obtain, \nthese criminals alter other phones to access the accounts tied to the \nphone whose data was scanned, thus creating so-called ``clone phones''. \nThey then either sell these phones, or use the clone phones themselves \nfor criminal purposes. These phones are used for several weeks or \nmonths, until the legitimate customer notices the fraud when he or she \ngets the bill for phone service accessed by the clone phone.\n  The effects of these criminal schemes are twofold. First, this crime \nsteals cellular service from the phone companies, which typically \ncredit legitimate customers' accounts when alerted to the fraud. \nSecond, the use of clone phones masks other criminal conduct by making \ncriminal's calls difficult, if not impossible, to trace. S. 493, \nsponsored by Senator Kyl, helps close this gap in the law by making it \na federal crime to own or use the software or hardware needed to clone \ncell phones.\n  I also urge my colleagues to support an amendment to this bill, to \nensure the confiscation of the equipment used to violate this law, and \ncommit other frauds related to access devices. Presently, persons \nconvicted of committing access device fraud under section 1029 of title \n18 forfeit to the government the proceeds of their crime. However, \nthere is no provision ensuring that the computers, hardware, software, \nand other equipment used to commit the crime is forfeited, as well. My \namendment to this bill corrects this.\n  My amendment includes in the penalties for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n1029, the forfeiture of any personal property\n\n[[Page S12486]]\n\nused to commit, facilitate, or promote the commission of the violation. \nI note for my colleagues that my amendment only addresses criminal \nforfeiture, so there must be a conviction for the assets to be seized. \nSecond, my amendment only permits the forfeiture of personal property \nused to commit the offense--mainly, equipment. Houses, other buildings, \nor land could not be subject to forfeiture under this provision.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we close the gaps in the law that \npermit criminals to brazenly sell and use equipment to steal cellular \nphone service and evade law enforcement. It is equally important to get \nthis equipment off the streets. I urge my colleagues to support my \namendment and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask consent that the amendment be considered as read and \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1634) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1635\n\n                (Purpose: To make technical amendments)\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

and\n       (H) any other factors that the Commission considers to be \n     appropriate.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am gratified that S. 493, the Cellular \nTelephone Protection Act, which would make it easier for Federal law \nenforcement to stop cell phone cloning, has unanimously been approved \nby the Senate. I expect that the bill will soon pass the House of \nRepresentatives, and be\n\n[[Page S12487]]\n\nsigned into law by the President. S. 493 is the first in a series of \nanticrime initiatives I introduced that are aimed at modernizing U.S. \nlaw to reflect changes in technology.\n  It is estimated that the cellular telecommunications industry lost \n$650 million due to fraud in 1995, much of it as a result of cloning. \nCloned phones are popular among the most vicious criminal element. The \nfeature story from the July/August edition of Time Digital, ``Lethal \nWeapon: How Your Cell Phone Became Gangland's Favorite Gadget'' quotes \nJames Kallstrom, head of the FBI's New York office as describing \ncloners as ``hard-core criminals, child pornographers and pedophiles * \n* * violent criminals who use technology to avoid the law.''\n  On September 11, Representative Bill McCollum, chairman of the House \nJudiciary Crime Subcommittee, held a very useful hearing on cellular \nphone cloning. The hearing discussed legislative proposals to combat \ncellular phone fraud. Representatives of the Secret Service, FBI, and \nDEA all testified that legislation resembling S. 493 would be helpful \nin thwarting cell phone cloning.\n  The hearing revealed that cloned phones have become a staple of the \nmajor drug trafficking organizations. Anthony R. Bocchichio, of the DEA \nstated that, ``[International drug trafficking organizations] utilize \ntheir virtually unlimited wealth to purchase the most sophisticated \nelectronic equipment available on the market to facilitate their \nillegal activities. We have begun to see that this includes widespread \nuse of cloned cellular telephones.''\n  The Secret Service--the Federal agency charged with investigating \ncloning offenses--has doubled the number of arrests in the area of \nwireless telecommunications fraud every year since 1991, with 800 \nindividuals charged for their part in the cloning of cellular phones \nlast year. While the cell phone law (18 U.S.C. 1029) has been useful in \nprosecuting some cloners, the statute has not functioned well in \nstopping those who manufacture and distribute cloning devices.\n  In testimony before Mr. McCollum's Crime Subcommittee, Michael C. \nStenger of the U.S. Secret Service stressed the need to revise our \ncurrent cell phone statute:\n\n       Due to the fact that the statute presently requires the \n     proof of ``intent to defraud'' to charge the violation, the \n     distributors of the cloning equipment have become elusive \n     targets. These distributors utilize disclaimers in their \n     advertising mechanisms aimed at avoiding a finding of \n     fraudulent intent. This allows for the continued distribution \n     of the equipment permitting all elements of the criminal \n     arena to equip themselves with free, anonymous phone service.\n\n  Consistent with Mr. Stenger's recommendation, the Cellular Telephone \nProtection Act provides that--except for law enforcement and \ntelecommunications carriers--there is no lawful purpose for which to \npossess, produce, or sell the ``copycat boxes'' for cloning a wireless \ntelephone or its electronic serial number.\n  For S. 493 to apply, a prosecutor would need to prove that an \nindividual ``knowingly uses, produces, traffics in, has control or \ncustody of, or possesses hardware or software, knowing it has been \nconfigured for altering or modifying a telecommunications instrument so \nthat such instrument may be used to obtain unauthorized access to \ntelecommunications services.'' Someone who does not know that a \ntelecommunications device has been altered to modify a \ntelecommunications instrument would not be criminally liable under this \nsection.\n  To be clear, except for law enforcement and telecommunication \ncarriers, there is no legitimate purpose for which to possess equipment \nused to modify cellular phones. Representatives from the Secret \nService, DEA, and FBI testified to this point at the cellular fraud \nhearing. As Special Agent Stenger put it, ``There is no legitimate use \nfor the equipment such as that designed to alter the electronic serial \nnumbers in wireless telephones.''\n  The removal of the ``intent to defraud'' language in 18 U.S.C. 1029 \nonly applies to the possession and use of the hardware and software \nconfigured to alter telecommunications instruments. This narrowly \ntargeted proposal does not apply to those who are in the possession of \ncloned phones. Nor does it apply to those in the possession of scanning \nreceivers, which do have some legitimate uses.\n  The Senate bill enjoys broad bipartisan support. Senators Cleland, \nDeWine, Dorgan, Durbin, Gorton, Helms, Lott, Mikulski, and Thurmond \nhave cosponsored S. 493. And a bipartisan House companion bill (H.R. \n2460) has been introduced by Representatives Sam Johnson, Bill \nMcCollum, and Charles Schumer.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues will join in supporting this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12484-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVERTISEMENT CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of H.R. 1090, and, further, the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1090) to amend title 38, United States Code, \n     to allow the revision of Veterans benefits decisions based on \n     clear and unmistakable error.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to encourage the Senate to adopt \nH.R. 1090. This legislation is identical to my bill, S. 464, to address \nthe issue of clear and unmistakable error. S. 464 was unanimously \nreported by the Veterans' Affairs Committee on which I proudly serve. I \nwant to extend my thanks to both the chairman and ranking member of our \ncommittee for moving this important legislation in a timely and \nbipartisan manner .\n  Importantly, this legislation has been adopted by the House in three \nconsecutive Congresses. Congressman Lane Evans has long championed this \nlegislation; I commend him for his persistent and determined \nleadership. This legislation has also long been a priority issue to the \nDisabled American Vetetans. It has been a pleasure for me to work with \nthe DAV here in Washington, DC and with local DAV representatives in \nWashington State.\n  Clear and unmistakable errors are errors that have deprived and \ncontinue to deprive veterans of benefits for which their entitlement is \nundeniable. The status quo denies benefits to a small number of \nveterans who are legally entitled to the benefits in question. To deny \na veteran a legally entitled benefit due to a bureaucratic error or \nother mistake is beyond comprehension in my mind.\n  In recent months, I've handled several cases with the Department of \nVeterans Affairs that directly involved clear and unmistakable error. \nIn one case, a veteran with a serious shoulder injury dating back to \nthe Vietnam war was rated incorrectly for more than 20 years. In \nanother case, a veteran with PTSD also dating to service in Vietnam was \nmisdiagnosed for a lengthy period affecting his disability rating and \nbenefits and the treatment he received. My legislation seeks to correct\n\n[[Page S12488]]\n\nthis. I believe that we must make available every opportunity to right \na wrong on behalf of a veteran.\n  To the VA's credit, some cases of clear and unmistakable error are \nreversible but it depends on where the veteran is in the VA process. S. \n464 and H.R. 1090 will codify the VA's current regulatory authority to \nreview ratings decision based on claim of clear and unmistakable error.\n  Unfortunately, some cases of clear and unmistakable error no longer \noffer recourse to the veteran. S. 464 and H.R. 1090 will allow a \nveteran to request that the Board of Veterans' Appeals review its prior \ndecision based on a claim of clear and unmistakable error. A veteran \nwould also have the opportunity to challenge the Board of Veterans' \nAppeals decision at the Court of Veterans' Appeals.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has determined that this legislation \nis budget neutral. This legislation will not require additional \nresources for the VA or take needed resources from other VA programs or \nbenefits.\n  So often we in Congress talk about providing for veterans or about \nmeeting our obligations to veterans. That is what this bill is all \nabout; it gives a veteran the right to request a review rather than \nsubjecting an ailing vet to a sometimes faceless bureaucracy hesitant \nto correct its mistakes. In passing this legislation, the Senate will \nstand with veterans that have been deprived of benefits for which their \nentitlement is undeniable.\n  Many veterans have waited decades for this day. The Senate should end \nthis wait now with a strong vote. A strong vote will also send a \nmessage to President Clinton. In closing, I call upon President Clinton \nto bring this legislative effort to a successful conclusion; to join us \nall to ensure that the system errs on behalf of a deserving veteran \nrather than the Federal Government.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1090) was considered read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12487-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12488-S12494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VETERANS' BENEFITS DENIAL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, as the ranking minority member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate \nis considering S. 714, as amended, a bill that would make valuable \nchanges to a number of veterans benefits and services. In the waning \ndays of this session, the House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees \nwere able to reach compromise on a wide range of programs and services \nfor veterans--from programs to assist homeless veterans, to providing \nhome loans to Native American veterans, and I urge my colleagues to \ngive their unanimous support to this measure. It is particularly \nfitting that we make these improvements for veterans programs now, \nsince tomorrow is Veterans Day.\n  Mr. President, because all the provisions of this measure--which I \nwill refer to as the compromise agreement--are set forth in the joint \nexplanatory statement which Senator Specter will place in the Record, I \nwill discuss here only some of the issues which are of particular \ninterest to me. The explanatory statement was developed in cooperation \nwith the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs and that committee's \nchairman, Bob Stump, will insert the same explanatory statement in the \nRecord when the House considers this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12488-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXTENDING AND IMPROVING THE NATIVE AMERICAN HOUSING LOAN PILOT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. President, section 201 of the compromise agreement will extend \nfor 4 years the authority for the Native American Housing Loan Pilot \nProgram, under section 3761, title 38, United States Code. This pilot \nprogram was created in 1993 to provide loans to eligible Native \nAmerican veterans to purchase, build, or improve dwellings on Native \nAmerican trust lands. This program is so important because commercial \nlenders will not finance the purchase of homes on Native American \nlands, as lenders cannot foreclose in the event of default. Therefore, \nthe traditional VA loan guaranty program is not, in effect, available \nto Native American veterans residing on tribal lands.\n  This program has been very successful in financing purchases of homes \nby Pacific Islanders. However, it has been somewhat underutilized by \nother Native American populations. Therefore, this bill would also \nprovide for enhanced outreach by VA to inform Native American veterans \nof the availability of this program. It further tasks VA with analyzing \nwhat is working and what could be improved in its administration of the \nprogram.\n  I would like to commend Senators Akaka and Campbell for their \ntireless advocacy on behalf of Native American veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12494-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REINVENTING VA'S EEO SYSTEM\n\n  Title 1 of the compromise agreement will establish a new employment \ndiscrimination complaint system for the VA.

Currently, the eligibility of the child is \ndetermined by looking to the veteran father. However, under title 38 of \nthe United States Code, a former service member who received a \ndishonorable discharge is generally not considered a veteran, and is \ntherefore not eligible for veterans benefits from the VA.\n  It was Congress' intention to provide benefits to all Vietnam \nveterans' children with spina bifida. Congress did not mean to exclude \nthe children of veterans with dishonorable discharges.\n  This provision will clarify the eligibility criteria to include the \nchild with spina bifida of a Vietnam veteran regardless of the \ncharacter of his discharge. This is a minor modification in the law, \nbut to the children who suffer from spina bifida, these benefits can \nmake a significant difference in their lives. These benefits can \nimprove their quality of health care, provide educational \nopportunities, and enhance their quality of life. It would be a great \ninjustice if these children were denied these benefits because of their \nfathers' discharge status.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12494-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MAMMOGRAPHY POLICY\n\n  Section 208 of the compromise agreement seeks to address a \ndiscrepancy between VA's stated principles and their clinical practice \nwith respect to breast cancer programs. Though a guiding principle of \nthe Veterans Health Administration states that ``the quality of care in \nVHA must be demonstratively equal to, or better than, what is available \nin the local community,'' in my view, VHA's breast cancer detection \npolicy fails to achieve community standards because it only targets \nwomen between the ages of 50 to 69.\n\n  Section 208 requires the VA to adopt a comprehensive national policy \non breast cancer detection. Rather than requiring the VA to adhere to a \nspecific clinical standard, the provision relays the sense of the \nCongress that VA's policy be in accordance with guidelines issued by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Director of the \nNational Institutes of Health.\n  Mr. President, it is very important that veterans have access to \npreventive diagnostic tests to protect their health.

I \nalso thank Bob Cover and Charlie Armstrong of the House and Senate \nOffices of Legislative Counsel for their excellent assistance and \nsupport in drafting this compromise agreement.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Employment Discrimination Resolution and \nAdjudication Act. As we approach Veterans Day, it is indeed fitting \nthat this important legislation will soon become an integral part of \ntitle 38, of the United States Code.\n  This legislation addresses the critical issue of sexual harassment \nwithin the Department of Veterans Affairs and ensures that the rights \nof all employees will be protected. I would like to recognize the \nleadership of Chairman Specter and the support of Senators Rockefeller \nand Graham in the development of this necessary legislative remedy.\n  Specifically, this bill creates within the Department an Office of \nEmployment Discrimination Complaints Resolution which will be headed by \na director who shall be solely responsible for resolving complaints of \nunlawful employment discrimination within the Department. It requires \nthat those employed in handling the complaints be properly trained and \nthat complaints are handled in a fair and objective manner. The \nlegislation further ensures that those individuals in top management \npositions are held to the same standards concerning equal opportunity \nemployment law as those individuals that they manage and supervise.\n  The legislation requires that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nsubmit to Congress three reports on the implementation and operation of \nthe equal opportunity employment system. These reports are due April 1, \n1998, January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2000. In addition to the reports \nrequired of the Department, the legislation further stipulates that an \nassessment of the Employment Discrimination Complaint Resolution system \nbe conducted by an independent contractor who has been approved by both \nthe House and Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees. The first \nindependent assessment is due June 1, 1998 with the second report due \nJune 1, 1999.\n  Mr. President, our Nation's veterans and the over 200,000 Federal \nworkers who support the nationwide network of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs programs and services must be assured that they can \nput veterans first in an environment that has zero tolerance for any \ntype of sexual, emotional, or physical harassment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs Employment Discrimination Act. This legislation offers \nan effective and expeditious method for filing and processing sexual \nharassment and employment discrimination claims within the Department.\n  Over a year ago, the problem of sexual harassment with Veterans \nAffairs Department was brought to my attention by a case of widespread \nabuse at the VA Medical Center in Fayetteville, NC. Regrettably, this \nsituation involved the director of the facility who was also the man \nresponsible for handling complaints filed against him. Not \nsurprisingly, claims of sexual harassment made against the director \nwent nowhere, and he continued his reprehensible behavior without fear \nof being caught.\n  The legislation I introduced with my colleague from Florida, Senator \nGraham, and my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, is a \nconstructive measure that would prevent such a blatant abuse of \nauthority from occurring again. This bill will create the Office of \nEmployment Discrimination Complaint Adjudication [OEDCA] with a \ndirector who would report only to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of \nVA. Centralizing authority within the OEDCA will restore a large amount \nof accountability to currently flawed system.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that Congress provide the thousands \nof employees of the Veterans Affairs Department with a system they can \nrely upon to judiciously resolve employment discrimination claims. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation to prevent an incident \nsuch as the one that occurred in my State from happening again.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move that the Senate concur in the \namendments of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12495-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WAIVING TIME LIMITATIONS IN REGARD TO MEDAL OF HONOR AWARD\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 281, S. 222.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 222) to establish an advisory commission to \n     provide advice and recommendations on the creation of an \n     integrated, coordinated Federal policy designed to prepare \n     for and respond to serious drought emergencies.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause and \ninsert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Drought Policy Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States often suffers serious economic and \n     environmental losses from severe regional droughts and there \n     is no coordinated Federal strategy to respond to such \n     emergencies;\n       (2) at the Federal level, even though historically there \n     have been frequent, significant droughts of national \n     consequences, drought is addressed mainly through special \n     legislation and ad hoc action rather than through a \n     systematic and permanent process as occurs with other natural \n     disasters;\n       (3) several Federal agencies have a role in drought from \n     predicting, forecasting, and monitoring of drought conditions \n     to the provision of planning, technical, and financial \n     assistance;\n       (4) there has never been one single Federal agency in a \n     lead or coordinating role with regard to drought;\n       (5) the State, local, and tribal governments have had to \n     deal individually and separately with each Federal agency \n     involved in drought assistance; and\n       (6) the President should appoint an advisory commission to \n     provide advice and recommendations on the creation of an \n     integrated, coordinated Federal policy designed to prepare \n     for and respond to serious drought emergencies.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established a commission to be \n     known as the National Drought Policy Commission (hereafter in \n     this Act referred to as the ``Commission'').\n       (b) Membership.--\n       (1) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of 14 \n     members.

TERMINATION OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n       The Commission shall terminate 90 days after the date on \n     which the Commission submits its report under section 4.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I comment this body for passing the \nNational Drought Policy act of 1997. Our\n\n[[Page S12499]]\n\nNation must not forget that while the Midwest United States has \nrecently suffered from severe flooding, and my home State of New Mexico \nis currently not lacking precious rainfall, last year the Southwest \nexperienced the worst drought in over 100 years. The results were \nnothing less than disastrous.\n  In New Mexico, for example, the drought decimated the State's \nagricultural community. Every county in the State received disaster \ndeclarations from the USDA. Farmers in the southern part of the State \nwere forced to go to water wells, depleting an already-taxed aquifer. \nIn northeastern New Mexico, winter wheat crops failed for the first \ntime in anyone's memory. It was estimated that ranchers lost up to 85 \npercent of their capital, and 40 percent reductions in livestock herds \nwas not uncommon.\n  The drought also had a catastrophic impact on New Mexico's forests. \nThe incredibly dry conditions brought on by the drought sparked fires, \nwhich were exacerbated by the lack of water needed to extinguish them. \nIn all, there were over 1,200 fires in New Mexico last year that burned \nover 140,000 acres of land and wiped out dozens of homes and \nbusinesses.\n  The drought also taxed municipal water systems to their limits, and \nforced many cities and towns to consider drastically raised water rates \nfor their citizens. And the drought meant that critical stretches of \nthe Rio Grande River were almost completely dry, which in turn meant \nvastly reduced amounts of water for wildlife such as the endangered \nsilvery minnow.\n  However, New Mexico's problems were those of just one State; the \n1995-96 drought devastated the entire Southwest. Arizona, California, \nColorado, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Kansas were all severely \ndamaged by the drought. We in the Southwest are fortunate that this \nyear is proving to be a much better year for precipitation than the \nlast. But we do not know what the next year will bring. Another drought \ncould again send towns scrambling to drill new water wells, sweep fire \nacross bone-dry forests, and force farmers and ranchers to watch their \nway of life blow away with the dust.\n  But I do not want to give the impression that severe droughts are \nsolely the curse of the Southwest. Every region in the United States \ncan be hit by these catastrophes. In 1976-77, a short but intense \ndrought struck the Pacific Northwest, requiring the construction of \nnumerous dams and reservoirs to secure millions of additional acre feet \nof needed water. The 1988 Midwest drought caused over $5 billion in \nlosses. And the infamous 7-year drought of 1986-93 experienced by \nCalifornia, the Pacific Northwest, and the Great Basin States caused \nextensive damage to water systems, water quality, fish and wildlife, \nand recreational activities. Recently, areas of Maryland, Virginia, and \nPennsylvania suffered unusual drought conditions.\n\n  Yet, while drought is so pervasive and even though it seriously \naffects the economic and environmental well-being of the entire nation, \nthe United States is poorly prepared to deal with serious drought \nemergencies. As a result of the hardships being suffered in every part \nof my State last year, I convened a special Multi-State Drought Task \nForce of Federal, State, local, and tribal emergency management \nagencies to coordinate efforts to respond to the drought. The task \nforce was ably headed up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nand included every Federal agency that has programs designed to deal \nwith drought.\n  While FEMA has done a tremendous job in responding to sudden \ndisasters such as flooding, the impact of drought emerges gradually \nrather than suddenly. Unfortunately, what the task force found was \nthis: although the Federal Government has numerous drought related \nprograms on the books, we have no integrated, coordinated system of \nimplementing those programs. Drought victims in this Nation do not know \nwho to turn to for help, and when they finally do find help, it is too \nlate and totally inadequate. The gradual nature of drought devastation \nunderscores the need for drought management rather than drought \nresponse.\n  We must be vigilant, and prepare ourselves for quick action when the \nnext drought cycle begins. Last year's devastating drought and the \nchaotic manner in which governments responded to it, confirmed my \nbelief that this legislation is needed. With recommendations from the \nWestern Governors' Association, the National Governors' Association, \nand the Multi-State Drought Task Force, I introduced the National \nDrought Policy Act of 1997 in January. This legislation, which passed \nthe Senate today, will be the first step toward finally establishing a \ncoherent, effective national drought policy. S. 222 creates a \ncommission comprised of representatives of those Federal, State, local, \nand tribal agencies and organizations that are most involved with \ndrought issues. S. 222 charges the commission with providing \nrecommendations on a permanent and systematic Federal process to \naddress this particular type of devastating natural disaster. On the \nFederal side, the Commission will include representatives from USDA, \nInterior, the Army, FEMA, SBA, and Commerce--agencies which all \ncurrently have drought-related programs. Equally important will be the \nnon-Federal members, including representatives from the National \nGovernors' Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and four persons \nrepresentative of those groups that are always hardest hit by drought \nemergencies.\n  The Commission also will be charged with determining what needs \nexists on the Federal, State, local, and tribal levels with regard to \ndrought; reviewing existing drought programs; and determining what gaps \nexist between the needs of drought victims and those programs currently \ndesigned to deal with drought. The Commission will then make \nrecommendations on how Federal drought laws and programs can be better \nintegrated into a comprehensive national drought policy.\n  In recognition of the national nature of drought emergencies, this \neffort has garnered bi-partisan support. Senator Bob Kerrey and other \nwitnesses encouraged amendments which include collaboration with the \nNational Drought Mitigation Center as well as the Western Drought \nCoordination Council. These suggestions ensure that the Commission \nwould receive important input from existing entities on the needs at \nthe Federal, State, local, and tribal levels to prepare for and respond \nto drought emergencies.\n  Unfortunately, drought conditions are a way of life in my region of \nthe country. But better planning on our part, and with the \nrecommendations of the Drought Commission established under S. 222, may \nlimit some of the damage. I look forward to passage of this \nlegislation, which is important to the entire United States, in the \nHouse of Representatives early next year.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 222), as amended, was read a third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12498-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMENDING THOSE WHO WORKED ON THE ISTEA BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Madam President, as we conclude this session of \nCongress, I would like to take a moment to recognize a valued adviser, \nan extraordinary public servant, and an able advocate for high quality \neducation and job training for all our citizens, Bill Spring of Boston.\n  Tragically, Bill was severely injured in an accident 2 weeks ago as \nhe was walking home from work and he remains unconscious today. We are \nall very optimistic that Bill will regain good health. Our hearts go \nout to his wife Micho and his children. I want them to know how proud \nwe are to have Bill as a friend and colleague. Our thoughts and prayers \nare with them at this difficult time.\n  Many of us in the Senate know Bill and worked with him during his \nyears as a staff member of the Senate Labor Committee or as a senior \nadviser to President Carter. He has also served as a professor at \nHarvard and at Boston University, as a vice president of the Federal \nReserve Bank of Boston, as a member of the Boston School Committee, and \nin many other valuable positions. In each capacity, Bill has always \nbrought a brilliant intellect, an unyielding commitment to the \nprinciples of fairness and opportunity, an extraordinary creativity, \nand an unfailing ability to find a way forward, even in the most \ndifficult times.\n  His leadership on education and job training has been outstanding. \nHis understanding of the basic issues and his tireless pursuit of \nbetter policies and programs to improve the quality and quantity of \nopportunities for all Americans have made an immense contribution to \npublic policy and to the lives of tens of thousands of individuals and \ntheir families.\n  In the policy arena, Bill Spring has been a leader in every \nsignificant debate and legislative achievement by Congress on \nemployment and job training for over three decades. His judgment, his \nevaluation of alternatives, and his understanding of the needs of the \npeople who need our help the most have been indispensable to the \nbipartisan progress we have made.\n  He has devoted special attention and energy to the serious problems \nof poor and minority youth. From the unprecedented youth employment and \ntraining program of the Carter administration to the current Out-of-\nSchool Youth Initiative in the pending work force development \nlegislation, unanimously reported to the Senate last month, Bill \nSpring's guidance and direction have been superb.\n  In Boston and Massachusetts, Bill has had a key role in all the \nprogress we have made in meeting the employment and training needs of \nworkers and the needs of students for quality education and effective \nlinks between their learning and the work force.\n  The nationally renowned Boston Compact could not have been achieved \nwithout Bill Spring's design, support, and direction. The compact has \nbecome the most successful effort in the country to keep young men and \nwomen in school and assist their transition from school to their future \ncareers. Thousands of youths in Boston now have different and better \nlives because of Bill's creativity and energy.\n  The new and successful relationship between the Boston Police \nDepartment, juvenile justice system, and the Boston school system is \nanother of Bill Spring's major achievements. The success that Boston \nhas achieved in reducing juvenile crime, including the elimination of \njuvenile murder for over 2 years, is an extraordinary tribute to his \ninsight and leadership.\n  We wish him a speedy and full recovery, and a quick return to his \nleadership on all these vital issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/10/senate-section/article/S12500-6", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 12 NOON, WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
