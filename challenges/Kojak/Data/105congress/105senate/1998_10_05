Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nbegin a discussion today which should clarify some of the competing \nrhetoric and certainly some of the misinformation that is being spoken \nabout the potential for tax cuts in our culture.\n  We are taxed at the highest rates in history. Never before have the \nAmerican people been asked to devote so much of their hard-earned \nresources to government. Yet there are lots of statements made about \nthe incapacity of this government to afford tax cuts to the American \npeople, to give them some more of what they have earned in return for \ntheir hard work.\n  I rise today to speak the truth about tax cuts, to speak the truth \nabout the so-called emergency spending, about Social Security, and \nabout the budget surplus. A group of like-minded Senators and I have \nbeen engaged in a long and arduous fight to return to the American \ntaxpayers more of their own money. We are here to announce that we are \nnot giving up that fight. It may now be clear that the Senate will not \nbe passing a tax cut this year.\n  Even if the majority leader were to bring the House-passed bill to \nthe floor, there are just too many Members, big spenders, if you will, \nwho are more interested in spending the surplus than returning the \nsurplus to the rightful owners--those who generated the surplus. I only \nwish the advocacy groups who attack tax cuts would be honest enough to \ncriticize the President and the other big spenders as they spend the \nsurplus on more and more government programs and projects.\n  Senators Inhofe, Grams, Brownback, Bob Smith and I have waged a long \nbattle, battle after battle, as a matter of\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\nfact, since May of this year, when we opposed the Senate Budget \nCommittee resolution, because it contained only $30 billion in tax cuts \nover the next 5 years. Because of our strong and vocal opposition to \nthat particular measure, our leadership made a commitment to us to \nfight for more tax relief, to adopt the House-passed tax cut number, to \nmake eliminating the marriage penalty a priority of the Senate in a tax \ncut bill, and to move the budget reconciliation package so that tax \ncuts would be protected.\n  In June, the House did pass a budget resolution that included $101 \nbillion in tax relief. The other Senators and I, in accordance with the \nprevious agreement with the leadership of this House, assumed that this \nwould be the amount of tax relief that would be delivered to hard-\nworking Americans this year. You have $101 billion in the House and an \nagreement by the Senate that it will go to the House figure; you would \nthink you would be able to get to $101 billion.\n  As the August recess loomed before us, the tax cuts remained elusive. \nThat is why on July 17, a group of Senators and I came to the floor \nduring consideration of the legislative branch appropriations bill and \nattempted to add a marriage penalty elimination amendment to that bill. \nTo eliminate the marriage penalty would effectively reduce taxes for \nabout 21 million couples who are penalized simply because they are \nmarried. Our point was simple and clear: Congress should not receive \nthe funding under the legislative branch appropriations before the \nAmerican people got the opportunity to keep a reasonable amount of what \nthey earned. Why give all the money that Congress wants to Congress \nwhile we don't honor the need for the American people to fund their \nfamilies?\n  We were prevented from offering our amendment at that time by the \nDemocrats. We came back 2 weeks later while this body was considering \nthe Treasury-Postal Services appropriations bill and we offered our \namendment again. Our amendment would have eliminated the unfair and \ndiscriminatory marriage penalty, that extra tax that people pay just \nbecause they are married, which affects 21 million American families to \nthe tune of about $29 billion a year.\n  We did not rely on spending the surplus in order to advocate that tax \ncut. We called for reductions in spending. We said that the Government \nhas been on a budget high in fat for too long, it is time for us to \nprovide the people with some relief, and we should do that by cutting \nspending. So we called for reductions in spending to offset the reduced \nrevenues that would have come as a result of the tax cut.\n  On July 29, a majority of the individuals serving in this Senate \nvoted in favor of eliminating the marriage penalty when they voted not \nto table our amendment. A majority of the Senate said that it is time \nto stop imposing Washington's values on the people and start imposing \nthe people's values on Washington. The marriage penalty is perhaps one \nof the best examples of an elitist Washington imposing its values on \nthe principles of the American people. We know that the American people \nunderstand the value of marriage and families in our culture. We know \nthat they understand that if we expect to succeed in the next century, \nif we don't want to sink, if we want to swim, we had better make it \npossible for families to meet their needs. One way to do that is to \nstop penalizing people for being families, and we ought to do that.\n  Unfortunately, we had to withdraw the amendment because of the \nconstitutional requirement that revenue bills originate in the House of \nRepresentatives. But the Senate did go on record supporting a marriage \npenalty elimination--this tax cut. A majority of this body voted to \nsupport eliminating the marriage penalty, but today we are facing the \ndisappointing reality that the Senate will not pass, or probably will \nnot even vote on, tax relief.\n  Much has been made about the surplus that is now attendant to the \nfinancial situation in Washington. Last week, the President happily \nannounced that, for the first time in almost 30 years, the Federal \nbudget is in balance--not just in balance, but there is a budget \nsurplus of almost $70 billion. President Clinton even took credit for \nthe balanced budget and the budget surplus.\n  Well, who is really responsible for the budget surplus? Was it the \nPresident and his party who voted for the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history in 1993? Or was it the Republicans who made balancing \nthe budget a national priority? Let me suggest that it wasn't the \nPresident, and let me suggest that it wasn't the Republicans, but that \nit was the American people who continued to work hard, to pay their \ntaxes, continued to demand from their elected officials that we have \nsome fiscal discipline. The American people should be credited with \nbalancing the budget through their hard work, creativity, innovation, \nand their industry. Government doesn't generate revenue, it doesn't \ncreate wealth, people do, when they work hard.\n  Make no mistake, the Federal budget surplus is up because Federal \nincome taxes are up. Income tax revenues have increased $83.7 billion, \nor 11 percent, just since last year. Where do those tax revenues come \nfrom? They come from the American people.\n  The President's record on taxes is threefold: Increase, increase, and \nincrease. He has not proposed cutting taxes. Rather, his latest budget \nproposed increasing taxes by $100 billion over the next 5 years. \nAmericans pay more in taxes today than they have in any other time in \nour history. President Clinton raised taxes by $242 billion in 1993, \nthe largest hike in U.S. history, and sought to increase them another \n$290 billion as part of his plan to nationalize the Nation's health \ncare system in 1994. And he sought to increase taxes by another $500 \nbillion-plus this year as part of a tobacco tax bill. In 1995, he \nvetoed the first major tax cut since Ronald Reagan was President. We \nall remember when the President mused aloud about his 1993 tax \nincrease. He put it this way: ``It might surprise you to know that I \nthink I raised them too much, too.''\n  Well, frankly, I believe the President is right that he raised taxes \ntoo much. If we raised taxes too much, wouldn't it behoove us to begin \nto settle the account and start to let the American people have some of \ntheir hard-earned resources for expenditure in their families? It is \none thing to confess that you raised taxes too much; it is another \nthing to develop another plan to spend all that you raised when you \nraised too much. If he really believes we raised taxes too much, we \nshould give some of these hard-earned resources back. The President \nseems to have forgotten that it is the American people who have led us \nto this budget surplus. It is their money, not our money.\n  Mr. President, I have not forgotten this key fact. That is why I am \nhere today--to say to the American people that they deserve not to have \ntheir money squandered on more Government, but they deserve a return on \ntheir investment--a return in the form of tax relief that is funded by \nreducing the spending of a Government addicted to a high-fat diet. This \nGovernment should be involved in reducing its invasion of the American \nculture with more and more Government and thereby consuming more and \nmore of what families need to meet their needs.\n  Now, the President has a plan, but his plan is to spend the surplus. \nWhen it became clear earlier in the year that the fiscal discipline the \nRepublican Congress had demanded from the President would result in a \nbudget surplus, the President made a statement in his State of the \nUnion Address which he has repeated numerous times since then. He said \nthis, and I have this statement on a chart here:\n\n       But whether the issue is tax cuts or spending, I ask all of \n     you to meet this test: Approve only those priorities that can \n     actually be accomplished without adding a dime to the \n     deficit. Now, if we balance the budget for next year, it is \n     projected that we will then have a sizable surplus in the \n     years that immediately follow. What should we do with this \n     projected surplus? I have a simple four-word answer: Save \n     Social Security first. Tonight, I propose that we reserve 100 \n     percent of the surplus--that's every penny of any surplus--\n     until we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen \n     the Social Security system for the 21st century.\n\n  That is quite a statement. It is a bold statement. The President has \nused this statement to attack our plan to eliminate the marriage \npenalty and provide tax relief. He has used this sort of suggestion \nthat we will just have to save Social Security and therefore you can't \nhave any tax relief for the American people--a tax relief package that \nwe\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\nwere and are prepared to pay for out of reduced spending. But has the \nPresident attempted to keep his pledge to use every penny to save \nSocial Security? There is only one answer. That answer is a resounding \nno.\n  Only days after his Social Security pledge, he sent a budget to \nCongress that contained $150 billion in new spending, according to the \nSenate Budget Committee. Without that new spending, the surplus would \nhave been $150 billion larger--hardly every penny of any surplus being \nused to save Social Security.\n  It seems like every week the President has proposed an additional new \nspending program. His fiscal year 1999 budget, submitted earlier in the \nyear, contained $150 billion in new spending. Just last Thursday, the \nPresident was at it again. At a press conference at the White House, he \nrepeated his call for $34 billion to run our schools from Washington \nand to take control of our children's education away from their parents \nand teachers with new Federal expenditures of resources that are hard-\nearned by the American people, which he won't allow them to keep to \nfund their families.\n  The President called for this new spending, as with all his spending \nrequests, without a dime of offsetting savings. He is not talking about \nreallocating Federal expenditures, he is talking about increasing \nFederal expenditures. That means it can only be financed by dipping \ninto the same surplus that he pledged would be spent for Social \nSecurity.\n\n  Every penny of any surplus--the President said, should be reserved \nuntil we have taken all the necessary measures to strengthen Social \nSecurity.\n  The President is gifted with language, so now we're redefining the \nphrase, every penny.\n  It reminds me of the fellow who sat down to dinner every night and \nput his finger in the wine glass and flipped a little wine off his \nfingers. His friend said to him, ``Why do you do that? Every night you \ncome in, stick your finger in the wine glass, and you flip the wine off \nyour finger.'' He said, ``Well, I promised my mother on her deathbed \nthat I would never drink a drop of wine. And that is the drop I am not \ndrinking.''\n  The truth of the matter is that the President has said we are going \nto devote every penny of the surplus to Social Security, and there are \nnot any pennies there--just dollars, and billions of dollars. So we are \nfree to spend the billions of dollars. Those are the pennies we are not \nsaving but flipping them off our finger because they are not there.\n  In addition to all the increased spending that the President has \nasked for--spending that breaks the budget caps--this body will be \ncalled upon to vote for a package that includes at least $17.8 billion \nto pay for so-called emergencies--and I will go into what those quote-\nemergencies-unquote are shortly--that will be paid for out of the \nsurplus.\n  The truth is, they have done nothing to save Social Security. They \nhave no proposal. They tried to discredit tax cuts by saying cutting \ntaxes would impair Social Security. They might impair some other \ninvasive government programs but not Social Security. But this is a way \nof trying to fight against any reduction in government, any ability of \nthis Senate to try to say to families you need to be able to fund your \nneeds rather than just be used as workers to fund the ambitious schemes \nof spending and big government.\n  The truth is that the big spenders don't care about saving Social \nSecurity or balancing the budget. They care about reserving their \nability to spend the taxpayers' money.\n  They do not want their ability to spend curtailed in any way--they \nwant the amounts to continue to increase, and they want to stop any tax \ncut that infringes on their spending power.\n  They look at this surplus as an huge pot of money to finance all \ntheir pork barrel pet projects. There is no fiscal discipline here! \nThere is only a strong commitment, an all consuming passion to prevent \ntax cuts at any expense--even if it means misleading the American \npeople by their demagoguery about saving social security.\n  The President said he wanted to save Social Security; devote every \npenny. The President and the big spenders have feigned their concern \nfor Social Security and fiscal responsibility. It is a mantra that has \nbeen repeated thousands of times--sort of a slogan that any time there \nis a problem, they run and hide behind the Social Security billboards. \nThey stick their heads into the ground and yell, ``Social Security,'' \nso they can avoid dealing with issues that count.\n  I guess we can expect to hear that mantra another thousand more times \nin the next month preceding the election. But it is also clear that \nwhen we look at the President's record on Social Security reform, that \nhe talks the talk but then takes a walk.\n  Despite promising to save Social Security first, the President has \nnever proposed a plan to reform Social Security--not even hinted at it. \nClinton's one and only proposal related to Social Security was to \npromote and to sign into law a $25 billion tax increase for some Social \nSecurity beneficiaries. For all his rhetoric, not one plan--not one \nconcrete proposal--to preserve the Social Security program.\n  Social Security merely becomes a tool in his hand to try to divert \nattention from the opportunity to cut government spending and provide \nAmericans with the opportunity to fund their families rather than to \nfund the bureaucracy.\n  While a series of bills have been introduced by Republicans and \nDemocrats addressing Social Security solvency, Congress is still, to \nthis day, waiting upon a plan from the President.\n  But the President has one goal, and that is to spend the surplus, and \nspend it as quickly as he can. Unfortunately, the President is not \nalone in this goal. It appears that a majority of the Senate is opposed \nto cutting taxes or cutting spending. They are only interested in one \nthing as well--stopping tax relief so that they can spend the surplus \nthemselves.\n  The President has presented to the American people a false choice--he \nsaid it has to be either this or this--and it is a false choice. He has \nsaid it is a choice between saving Social Security and Squandering the \nSurplus on tax relief. But this is a misleading choice. It doesn't have \nto be one or the other. We can take the surplus, devote it to Social \nSecurity, and we can provide tax relief by cutting some of the spending \nthat is wasteful and inappropriate by a bureaucracy which is bloated.\n  I believe we can do both. But only if we do not spend the surplus on \nincreased government, as is currently being planned. Congress is \nplanning to spend at least $17.8 billion of the surplus next week in \nthe ``emergency supplemental'' bill. And we can be sure that the $17.8 \nbillion figure will continue to grow exponentially by the time this \nCongress adjourns.\n  Mr. President, the Administration's spending requests during this \nCongress have become more than a bad habit. These requests reveal a \nconsistent failure at responsible governance. Twenty billion dollars or \nmore in ``emergency'' appropriations may be requested before this \nCongress adjourns.\n  Billions of these dollars will pay for expenditures the \nAdministration knew it would incur. What are we talking about? These \naren't surprise expenditures. These aren't emergencies that have come \nup. These are expenditures that have long been planned to be put into \nthe emergency spending portion of the budget so they wouldn't come \nunder the caps--so they wouldn't come under the normal limits that are \nrelated to balancing the budget.\n\n  First, the administration did not realize--according to this, if it \nis an emergency--the year 2000 would follow the year 1999. It requested \n$3.25 billion to clean up the year 2000 computer problem. Why wasn't \nthat in the ordinary spending appropriations request?\n  DId anyone in the Administration have a calendar? Not only is the \nemergency designation of Y2K funding wrong, but experts in the field \nhave informed my office that the Administration could have corrected \nthis computing problem for far less money if the process had been \nstated earlier.\n  So instead, the administration proposes to raid the surplus and to \nspend money that could have been used to save Social Security.\n  Every penny? Maybe there haven't been any pennies, just dollars.\n  Second, the administration claims it did not know that we would \ncontinue to deploy troops in Bosnia next year. This is an \n``emergency''--that somehow\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\nthe Bosnia deployment is unanticipated.\n  It has been apparent from the beginning of NATO's Implementation \nForce (IFOR) that American troops were there to stay much longer than \nthe President had initially promised the American people three years \nago.\n  In dispatching over 22,000 U.S. soldiers to participate in the NATO \nBosnia mission in 1995 and 1996, the President told the American people \nthat the mission would take about one year. Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Perry and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs John Shalikashvili both \nconfirmed the one-year duration of NATO's Implementation Force (IFOR). \nSecretary Perry testified before the House International Relations \nCommittee that the total cost of the Bosnia mission would be about $2 \nbillion.\n  Now, three years later, after two broken troop withdrawal deadlines \nand over $6 billion in cost, the Administration is seeking to fund this \noperation straight out of the surplus, which could be used, if we were \nto take the President at his word, to save Social Security. The \nPresident announced in December of 1997 that American troops would stay \nin Bosnia indefinitely, and yet he asked for an emergency \nappropriations of $1.9 billion for fiscal year 1999 operational costs.\n\n  Next the Administration proposed to spend the surplus that he \nproposed be used to save Social Security on building embassies \noverseas. Yet, after the tragic bombings of Kenya and Tanzania, the \nState Department could not even tell the Congress how much money they \nhad spent to upgrade embassy security to meet standards set forth in \nthe Inman Report of 1985. An effective accounting system to track these \nfunds had not been established.\n  A failure to monitor where the money has been going is not the only \nproblem. In recent years, the State Department has not even spent all \nthe money appropriated by Congress for diplomatic security. In 1995 and \n1996, the State Department failed to spend $100 million appropriated by \nCongress to enhance the security of U.S. overseas posts but now they \nwant to raid the surplus in a so-called ``emergency.''\n  Mr. President, this administration has not managed fiscal resources \nin a manner which inspires confidence. The administration will spend \nover $550 billion in discretionary spending under the budget agreement, \nbut instead of paying for these new spending requests from some other \npart of the budget, the administration wants to raid the surplus that \nwould save Social Security.\n  The real outrage is that the President plans to spend the surplus, \nnot to preserve Social Security. The truth is that the President and \nsome in the Congress have misled the American people about their plans \nfor the surplus. They have no intention of saving the surplus to fix \nSocial Security. They have no plan to fix Social Security. Their plan \nis to spend the surplus on fake emergencies and increase spending. They \nare unwilling to use the budget process to live within the budget caps \nto finance their spending, so they categorize items as emergencies so \nthat they don't have to exist within the framework and discipline that \nwould characterize any family's budget. We have caps on our spending at \nhome. We have limits on what we can take and spend. We can't decide we \nare going to call something an emergency and create resources out of \nthin air. It can't be done by the American people. It shouldn't be done \nby the American President and Congress. So we, the Congress, end up \ndenying hard-working Americans a tax cut and we scare senior citizens \nabout the future of Social Security, and then they spend the surplus.\n  One of the things we end up spending the surplus on is pork projects. \nThere are many additional spending items that are being talked about \nfor the omnibus appropriations emergency spending behemoth. I do not \nmean to say all of these items are without merit. Indeed, there have \nbeen natural disasters, floods, embassy bombings and other occurrences \nwhich demand our attention and perhaps some additional funding. But to \ndo it all in an emergency rather than to be addressing in the next \nfunding year, very shortly anyhow, where we would put the funding in \nthe stream of limits and discipline that the budget process imposes is \nto simply not do our job.\n  But even these events should not be used to excuse our willingness to \ndeny tax relief or to spend the surplus. The Congress should find the \nmoney within the existing budget to pay for these items. As I said \nbefore, most of these items are not true emergencies. We have known \nabout Bosnia for a long time. The need to increase our military's \nreadiness we have known, and the Y2K computer problem we have known for \nyears. But by labeling them emergencies, the President wants to use an \naccounting gimmick to spend the surplus, to spend it outside the normal \nbudget process, and spend it in a way that does not affect the \ncalculation under our spending caps. The fiscally disciplined way to \ndeal with this is to work within the budget, to stop pork barrel \nspending, and to pay for these priorities.\n  Mr. President, I want to share with you some of the items contained \nin the fiscal year 1999 budget in various appropriations bills that the \nCongress thinks are more important than saving Social Security because \nthey are willing to spend on this kind of pork.\n  Now, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, has done the American \npeople and this body a great service. He has gone through the \nappropriations bills and he has identified all the earmarked pork \nprograms and put this information on his home page on the Internet. I \nrecommend it to people who want to spend an evening getting a headache \nreading about additional Federal spending. Seriously, it is a list that \nis comprehensive and it is worth looking at. I have looked at the \ninformation. Let me share some of it with you. Here are some of the \nexamples of what we are spending for this year, items that the big \nspenders obviously think are more important than Social Security \nbecause they are unwilling to cut these programs in order to save the \nsurplus. If they really wanted these things, thought they were worth \nit, they should be willing to cut other spending. But they are willing \nto take them out of the surplus.\n  Believe you me, if this list of earmarked expenditures that Senator \nMcCain has on his web site were put up in big print, it would be a \nstack that would be substantial. Here are a couple things. Here is $3.3 \nmillion for the Shrimp Aquaculture project. And let me apologize to the \nSenate for calling it pork. This isn't pork. This is shrimp. But there \nis $3.3 million.\n  Here is another earmark. Wait a minute. Here is another one that is \nnot pork, either. Pardon me. This is grasshoppers--$750,000 for \ngrasshopper control research. Here is another--pardon me, not pork, not \nshrimp, not grasshoppers. Here is $150,000 to hire a new potato \nbreeder. Here is $143,200 to continue subterranean termite research.\n  Well, we have gotten through virtually everything but pork. Let's see \nif we can find something related to pigs in the process. Obviously, \nthis is political pork, whether or not it is pork in the nutritional \nsense. Here is $2 million to unspecified communities in southern \nCalifornia for planning associated with the National Communities \nConservation Planning Program. So we have $2 million for communities to \nplan to be a part of a planning program. We might call it planning \nsquared, I think--planning for planning. I suppose we could have some \nadditional resources to help people plan for planning to plan. Here is \nan earmark of $1.1 million to rehabilitate priest quarters in an old \nschoolhouse in a national historic site; an earmark of $1 million for \nincinerator replacement; an earmark of $3.4 million to meet \nuncontrollable costs at a wildlife center located in Wisconsin. \n``Uncontrollable costs'' may be a phrase that seems acceptable in \ngovernment, but families don't allow for uncontrollable costs. We are \nnot allowed to have uncontrollable costs.\n  So the bottom line is this. When we are willing to load up our bills \nwith this kind of pork or termites or shrimp or grasshoppers or \nwhatever else it is, it is not about tax cuts, and it is not about \nsaving Social Security. It is about money. It is about spending. It is \nabout power because he who has the money has the power. Someone said it \nis the Golden Rule: He who has the gold makes the rules. It is a power \ngame here in Washington, and the big spenders just can't allow the \nAmerican people to control their own money.\n  Last week, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan appeared before\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\nthe Senate Budget Committee and was asked what in his opinion should be \ndone with the surplus. Let's look at his remarks.\n\n       My first preference is to allow the surplus to reduce the \n     debt. I am also, however, aware of the pressures that will \n     exist to spend it.\n\n  This individual, who perhaps knows as much about Washington and knows \nas much about this country and its financial caps indicates he knows \nabout . . .\n\n       . . . the pressures that will exist to spend it. And that \n     in my judgment would be the worst of all outcomes. And if \n     push came to shove and it was either to spend it or cut \n     taxes, I would strongly and unequivocally be on the side of \n     cutting taxes.\n\n  Alan Greenspan happens to know that the growth and intensity, the \nkind of opportunity that is presented in the American economy is \ncurtailed when we have more and more spending, and that growth and \nopportunity is enlarged when we have people with more of their money to \nspend themselves through tax cuts.\n  That is why he says:\n\n       And if push came to shove and it was either to spend it or \n     cut taxes, I would strongly and unequivocally be on the side \n     of cutting taxes.\n\n  He stated that to spend the surplus would be the worst of all \noutcomes, but that is apparently what this President plans to do.\n  I am sad to inform you, Mr. President, that the worst of all outcomes \nis about to happen. The pressure to spend is just too strong. I am here \ntoday to set the record straight. We cannot let the surplus be spent on \nmislabeled emergencies and increased spending. We must demand fiscal \ndiscipline from this Congress. We should demand truth to senior \ncitizens about the fate of the surplus, and we will demand that the \nPresident, who decries tax cuts--we will demand that the President \nstand accountable for his actions as he prepares to spend the surplus \nrather than to keep his promise to save Social Security.\n  The American people will not be fooled. You cannot save Social \nSecurity by wasting the surplus on bureaucracy in Washington, DC. You \ncannot save Social Security when you are sending the elderly's Social \nSecurity checks to the shrimp aquaculture project in Hawaii. You cannot \nsave Social Security when the people recognize your posturing for what \nit is, a political exercise designed not to save Social Security but to \nsave yourself.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity and yield the remainder \nof my time to my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thought it would be important this \nmorning to do a short reality check on our President. The President \nlast week said Congress is a do-nothing Congress. They have not done \ntheir work. Why has Congress not done its work? You know, when he made \nthat comment about us--and I have been here hour after hour in \ncommittee meeting after committee meeting, here on the floor, day after \nday for the balance of the year--I thought, you know, Mr. President, \nyou challenged me a little bit. It is time to do a reality check. So I \nsent staff scurrying. We compiled the President's travel log, and what \nI am about to report to you is the travel log of President Bill \nClinton.\n  For a man who is bent on remaining in the White House, President \nClinton sure spends a lot of time away from the White House. What you \nare about to hear is an analysis of how much time he has spent away, \nand why his people have not been on the Hill, why they have not been \nworking with us, and now in the closing hours of a Congress he is \neither threatening a veto or threatening that he might just have to \nshut down Government to awaken us. Mr. President, let's do a bit of a \nreality check.\n  Last year, President Clinton broke the Presidential record for \nforeign travel with his 27th trip abroad. Like the Energizer Bunny, he \nhas continued to keep on going and going and going. This year so far he \nhas logged 41 days in 11 countries--11 different foreign countries. \nSome say he is traveling in foreign countries to keep his mind off \ndomestic problems. I would not want to make that assertion. What I do \nknow is that the President has now broken all-time Presidential travel \nrecords with 32 trips abroad, more than any other president ever. Mr. \nPresident, you are out breaking records.\n  However, just because President Clinton is not on foreign soil all \nthe time doesn't mean he is in the White House. Bill Clinton also likes \nto travel around the country as well. He is particularly fond of \ncombining both domestic travel and campaign fundraisers, with at least \n37 trips which include fundraisers just through this year, 1998, and \nthere are at least 14 more fundraising events scheduled for October, \naccording to reports. Stay tuned as I go down through this report, \nbecause you will find an anomaly between official travel and \nfundraising travel and what it is costing the taxpayers and maybe why \nhe needs a little bit of supplemental spending.\n  All told, the President has spent almost half of 1997, 149 days, as \nwell as over half of 1998 so far, 155 days, outside of Washington, DC. \nHello, Mr. President, we are trying to get our work done here. You \ncriticize us for being a do-nothing Congress? Mr. President, where have \nyou been?\n  The President's travel at taxpayers' expense long ago broke the \nforeign travel record. To put it in perspective, Mr. President, you \nhave traveled domestically over 304 days in the last 2 years. You have \nalready spent more time out of Washington than four out of the last \nfive Congresses have spent in session.\n  If the implications were not so serious, the President's wanderlust \nwould be a mere fact for amusement, and we could all chortle a little \nbit about it. This is, after all, a President who has claimed an \ninitiative for every problem and credit for every solution. Yet the \nPresident has not been around for much of the work. If America is to \nbelieve he is serious about Social Security reform and Medicare reform \nand health care reform, tax reform and a host of other problems, it \nwould help if they could first believe he is going to be here so we \ncould meet with him to get the work done.\n  In 1992, then-candidate Bill Clinton excoriated President Bush for \ntaking 25 trips to 60 countries from 1989 to 1993. He stated, ``It is \ntime for us to have a President who cares more about Littleton, NH, \nthan Liechtenstein; or more about Manchester than Micronesia.'' But \nonce in office, guess what? Mr. Clinton took Air Force One and away he \nwent, and he broke the Bush record. In less than 2 years, 1997 through \n1998, Clinton has spent almost as many days overseas as Bush spent \nduring his entire term in office--79 versus 86 days. President Clinton \nhas taken 32 foreign trips during his Presidency, 6 more than President \nBush, to 78 countries, including 51 different ones. Trips to South \nKorea, Japan, Malaysia are already in the travel plans for next year.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. The point is quite simple. As \nAmerica has discovered, just because Mr. Clinton is in the country does \nnot mean he is in the White House. The ``DC'' in Washington, DC, \nprobably means ``Devoid of Clinton.'' While Clinton was able to leave \nhis passport in the White House, he has made sure he has taken donor \ncards. As the press has noted, fundraising is prominent in his travel \nagenda.\n  What is in the Washington Post today? The President was out once\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nagain, Friday, fundraising. I understand now the American people are \nwaking up a little bit. Here is what one of the picket signs said as \nthe President entered a fundraiser in Ohio: ``Fundraising? Is this the \npeople's work?''\n  I am starting to ask the same thing. In 1997, President Clinton spent \n111 days on the road on domestic travel. He has already surpassed that \nin 1998 with 114 days. In 1997, he used at least 28 of those trips for \nfundraising. Through September of this year, President Clinton has \nalready used at least 37 of those days for fundraising.\n  That is part of the story, but here is the rest of the story that \nreally concerns me. Do you know how much it costs to fly Air Force One? \nMr. President, in 1992 figures it was $42,000 an hour. Mr. President, \nthat is for you and the entourage. How do you balance that off between \nimportant domestic travel and fundraising? I hope you are keeping an \naccurate record, or the taxpayers will be paying a phenomenal amount \nfor our President to be out of the White House.\n  President Clinton was out of town 149 days in 1997; 155 days through \nSeptember of 1998. The President spent a total of 304 days outside of \nWashington in just the last 21 months.\n  The reason I come to the floor this morning to talk about the \nPresident's travel schedule is to bring some substance to the seaminess \nof a comment a week ago that this is the do-nothing Congress. You might \nhave grounds to make that kind of an argument if you had been sitting \ndown at the White House with a phone in your hand working with us to \ntry to resolve the budgets, to try to get out our appropriation bills, \nto try to do the business of this Government. But you have chosen not \nto do that. You have been out and about the country and the world at a \nrecord pace, and at the expense of the American taxpayer.\n  I understand by news reports today the President is in town for the \nweek: Mr. President, welcome back to Washington. I understand that you \nare going to be here for a week, hopefully to work with us in \nfinalizing the work of Congress to get our budgets complete so we can \nleave town--most important, adjourn the Congress and go home as the \nAmerican people would expect us to do and turn off the expense clock.\n  I also think it is important, Mr. President, that you do, in fact, \nrecognize that our country and our world is just in a little bit of an \neconomic crisis and you are finally willing to cancel a few travel \nschedules and stay home to see if we can work out our problems.\n  So, Mr. President, welcome home. I am going to be watching very \nclosely and giving reports from time to time as the President spends \nthe American public's tax dollars to travel around the country. Here is \nthe travel log, and it is growing. Here are the charts, and they are \ngrowing. Call us a do-nothing Congress, Mr. President, and I will call \nyou AWOL because you won't be here; you will be off flitting around the \ncountry, either fundraising or staying out of Washington because the \nheat is too hot in the kitchen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11405-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11406-S11407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE TAXPAYER RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of tax relief for \nthe American people and in support of the House-passed legislation that \nwill provide taxpayer relief today.\n  Tax collections, it is estimated, will exceed over $8 trillion in the \nnext 5 years. An $80 billion tax cut--that is what the House of \nRepresentatives cut--an $80 billion tax cut amounts to about one penny \nsavings on every dollar paid in to the Federal Government. I don't \nbelieve that is too much out of this surplus that we are realizing \nbecause of a robust economy and because of restraints on spending, as \nmuch waste as therestill is. We have slowed the growth of Federal \nspending and, as a result of that, for the first time in 29 years, we \nhave a balanced budget, we have a surplus, and it is only right and it \nis only proper that a portion of that be returned to the American \npeople.\n  I think the only problem with the House-passed tax cut is that it is \ntoo little, but we should at least bring it forward, and we should at \nleast have that debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Under the Clinton administration, taxes have risen to the highest \nlevel in peacetime history. If Ben Franklin was right, that the only \nthing that is certain is death and taxes, this administration has made \nit equally true that nothing is as certain as spending and \novertaxation. We have the highest tax rate in peacetime history. Taxes \nare at a historic high at a level of 21 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct.\n  According to data from the OMB, total Federal receipts will amount to \n19.9 percent of the GDP in 1998 and 20.1 percent of the GDP in 1999. \nThat tells me one thing. That tells me that even under a Republican-\ncontrolled House and Senate, Government continues to grow and \nGovernment revenues continue to grow as well.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, this amount of taxation translates into \n$7,352 in taxes per capita in 1998. That is an onerous burden to put on \na low-income State. It is a heavy burden to place upon people anywhere.\n  In Connecticut, the tax burden is $15,525 per capita.\n  The typical American family sees 38 percent of its income going to \npay for taxes, as opposed to 28 percent for food, for clothing, for \nhousing and only 3.6 percent going to savings--38 percent for taxes--\nFederal, State and local level--28 percent for food, clothing and \nhousing.\n  Mr. President, it is time to stop picking the pockets of American \ntaxpayers, and it is time to put money back in their pockets and untie \ntheir hands. The Taxpayer Relief Act does just that by giving the \nAmerican people a tax cut of $80.1 billion.\n  Couples today who want to be responsibly married, to share their \nlives together, have a slap in the face immediately from the Federal \nGovernment. Twenty-one million couples pay an average of $1,400 extra \nin taxes for pursuing the right course of marriage.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act takes away this stinging insult by allowing \nmarried couples who file jointly to claim a standard deduction twice \nthe amount of the standard deduction for a single taxpayer. It also \nincreases the basic standard deduction for married taxpayers who file \nseparately to equal the basic standard deduction for singles. Even as \nthey try to raise a family with limited resources and increasing costs, \nparents strain under this very heavy burden of taxation.\n  The House-passed bill protects important tax credits, including \ncredits for children, the $500-per-child tax credit, new credits for \nadoption and education, and reduces the alternative minimum tax as \nwell.\n  All of these are important steps. They are, I believe, the right \ncourse for this Congress to take. I regret the President's commitment \nto veto any tax-cut legislation this year.\n  American farmers and ranchers have had to face a terribly hard time \nwith unpredictable and damaging weather trends that have destroyed \ntheir harvest and livelihood, only to face income erosion from \nunpredictable and damaging tax regulations as well. The House-passed \nbill would provide greater stability amidst this turmoil by income \naveraging, currently set to expire in the year 2000, and it would make \nthat permanent. Farmers and ranchers would be able to benefit from the \n100 percent health insurance deductibility. All of these things would \nprovide relief for the agricultural community.\n  Men and women attempting to manage their money wisely find the \nGovernment chipping away at their savings, through taxation on interest \nand dividends, and the Taxpayer Relief Act will exclude the first $200 \nin interest and dividends that they receive. We say we want the \nAmerican people to save and invest, and yet we penalize them with our \nTax Code. Some say the $200 exclusion is not very much. That exclusion \nwill eliminate all taxation on interest and dividends for 32 million \npeople in this country.\n  When taxpayers become senior citizens, their Social Security earnings \nlimit will be increased under this legislation, between full retirement \nage and age 70, from $17,000 in fiscal year 1999 to almost $40,000 in \nfiscal year 2008.\n  These are important provisions, certainly not the least of which is \nthe accelerated relief that will be provided from the death tax, a \nheinous provision\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\nin our Tax Code that says if you work hard enough, save enough, invest \nwell enough, Uncle Sam is going to reach into your grave, reach into \nyour pocket and take 55 percent of what you own. The American dream is \nto work hard enough, invest enough, and pass them on to your children \nand give them a little better start than you had.\n  The death tax is just the opposite. It is one of the most anti-\nAmerican dream provisions in the Tax Code. The bill passed from the \nHouse would accelerate raising that exclusion to 41 million. It would \nbe a small step in providing relief from the death tax.\n  There are those who say we can't cut taxes this year; we have to give \nit all to Social Security. It is interesting to me that those who argue \nthat have yet to come forward with a save Social Security plan. They \nhave yet to come forward with a Social Security reform plan, but they \nhave advocated billions of dollars in new spending.\n  Mr. President, I wish I had much longer to elaborate on this, but I \nquote the President when on May 26 of this year, he said:\n\n       We can use these good times to honor those who've put in a \n     lifetime of work and prepare for the future retirement of the \n     baby boomers by saving the Social Security system for \n     generations to come. Or we can give in to the temptation in \n     this election year to squander our surpluses the moment they \n     start coming in.\n\n  Do you get the picture? If you take the surplus and spend it on new \nspending programs, that is good, but if you return it to the American \npeople in the form of tax relief, that is squandering. The very \nPresident who made that statement has advocated billions of dollars in \nadditional spending--$5.8 billion already spent--and a request in \nsupplemental funds for $14.148 billion, including almost $2 billion for \nBosnia. That is coming out of this sacrosanct untouchable surplus.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act just says let's return $7 billion of that \nsurplus in the first year, 1999, to the American people. I believe that \nis what we should do. Instead of enacting $150 billion in new spending \nprograms, we should return one penny on the dollar, which is what the \nTaxpayer Relief Act does, out of what they are paying into the \nGovernment back to them in the form of tax relief.\n  The debate hasn't changed: higher taxes and more Government; lower \ntaxes and less Government. We were given that mandate by the American \npeople, and we should enjoin that debate by passing the Taxpayer Relief \nAct this year, sending it to the President and letting him decide \nwhether or not he will give the American people the relief they so much \ndeserve.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.

Madam President, I have come over today to respond to the \nOffice of Management and Budget and to the White House in relation to \ncomments they made about our weekly radio address, which we made in \nresponse to the President's radio address and which I had the privilege \nto make on behalf of the Republican majority in the Senate.\n  What I thought I would do is simply take a little bit of time and \nreview what I said in the radio address because it is relevant, \nobviously, to the response by OMB and the White House. I would like \nthen to respond to the comments they made. And I will try to do it as \nquickly as possible.\n  Madam President, in the Saturday radio address I tried to make \nseveral simple points, the first point being that we all can remember \nvividly, when the President gave his State of the Union Address, in \nprobably the most dramatic statement made by any political figure in \n1998, the President proclaimed: ``Save Social Security first.'' He then \nset out a prescription for Congress, and the prescription basically \nboiled down to: ``Don't increase spending; don't cut taxes; take every \npenny of the surplus and save it for Social Security.''\n  The President kept delivering exactly the same message over and over \nand over again through February, into June; and then all of a sudden, \nduring the summer and into the fall, the President's message started to \nchange. And the President's message started to change because he \nstarted leaving out the part of the policy prescription that had to do \nwith not spending the surplus.\n  What the President is now saying is that Republicans are wrong in \ntrying to cut taxes, eliminating the marriage penalty, providing some \ntax relief to farmers and small business and to senior citizens--that \nRepublicans are wrong in doing that in the House because it takes $6.6 \nbillion away from the surplus. And then the President last week said if \nyou take a little of the surplus here and a little of it there on tax \ncuts, then you don't have the money to put Social Security first.\n  The problem is that at the very moment that the President is saying \nto the Republicans in the House not to use $6.6 billion to fund a tax \ncut, the President is proposing to Congress, in the strongest possible \nterms, that we spend up to three times that amount--roughly $20 billion \nthis year--on a series of programs, most of which have nothing \nwhatsoever to do with emergency spending by any definition that we have \never used for emergency spending.\n  So the point I made, in very simple terms, was the President is not \nliving up to his word. He is not putting Social Security first. The \nPresident is pretty clear about not wanting Republicans in the House to \ncut taxes and to use $6.6 billion of the surplus for that purpose. But \nthe President is now actually threatening to veto bills and to shut \ndown the Government unless we spend up to $20 billion of additional \nmoney this year, every penny of which would come out of the same \nsurplus that the President is saying to the Republicans in the House, \n``Don't dare touch that surplus, don't take $6.6 billion to cut \ntaxes.''\n  The White House decided, over the weekend, that they wanted to \nrespond to what I had to say. And I want to respond to a lady, Linda \nRicci, who is the spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget. \nShe made two statements that I want to respond to.\n  Let me read you from the Reuters wire service story:\n\n       Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the administration's Office of \n     Management and Budget, noted the actual additional spending \n     request is roughly $14 billion, and said such emergency \n     packages have become a normal part of the budget process.\n\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\n\n  She further says:\n\n       There is nothing extraordinary about emergency spending and \n     there's nothing extraordinary about the amount of emergency \n     spending we are requesting in this year's budget.\n\n  Madam President, I take great exception to these statements because \nthey are not true. I mean, other than the fact that they are not true, \nI do not have much objection to them. But one of the standards that we \nnormally set in debate is a standard that we cannot have much of a \nmeaningful dialogue if we are not sticking with the facts. One of the \nthings that is often said in these kinds of debates is that you have a \nright to your own opinion, you just do not have a right to your own \nfacts.\n  Let me remind the Senate, and anybody who is listening, of the \nfollowing facts: No. 1, we have already passed a $6 billion emergency \nspending bill earlier this year. If you add up all the requests the \nPresident has made for additional emergency spending, it is $14 \nbillion. And when you add the two, that is a $20 billion emergency \nspending increase that was requested in calendar year 1998.\n  The OMB says, ``There's nothing extraordinary about the amount of \nemergency spending we are requesting in this year's budget.''\n  Let me tell you what is extraordinary about it. Everything --\neverything--is extraordinary about it.\n  First of all, the level of emergency spending is far beyond any level \nof emergency spending ever proposed by any President under the budget \nagreement that was reached in 1990 that started this current loophole \nof emergency spending.\n  I remind my colleagues, and anybody who is interested, that the first \nyear that this ability to designate something as ``emergency'' and \nexempted from the budget--the first year it was in effect, in 1991, \nPresident Bush signed into law $.9 billion worth of emergency spending. \nPresident Clinton this year has asked for $20 billion of emergency \nspending. In fact, if you take the 3 years that President Bush was in \noffice while we have had this emergency spending designation, in those \n3 years President Bush averaged $4.6 billion of emergency spending, \nvirtually all of it for things like hurricanes, floods, natural \ndisasters, or what we normally refer to as acts of God.\n  In the years, since President Clinton came into office, if this \nyear's request is granted, President Clinton will have requested $9.9 \nbillion worth of emergency spending a year. And, as I said, this year's \ntotal is roughly twice what the President has requested, on average. \nAnd that is what Bill Clinton has requested since he has been \nPresident. So to say there is nothing extraordinary about the request I \nthink is simply not true.\n  But there are two other things that are extraordinary. First of all, \nwe have never had emergency requests for money to be spent in years \nwhere we have not even appropriated the money yet. And, finally, what \nwe have in the President's proposal is a designation of emergency \nspending for ongoing programs of the Federal Government. I could talk a \nlong time about this, but let me give you three examples.\n  The President tells us that he needs $3.25 billion because he has \ndiscovered since he submitted his budget in January that the year 2000 \nis coming. Apparently he was unaware of this in January when he \nsubmitted his budget, because he did not ask for the money to be used \nfor year 2000 computer problems of the Government in January, but since \nthen it is an emergency because he did not ask for it in January.\n  I went back and looked, Madam President, at when we first started to \nkeep time in Anno Domini, ``in the Year of Our Lord.'' And the first \ntime we did was when the Julian calendar was amended so that the \nmeasurement of time started at the birth of Christ. And that was in the \nyear 525. The point is, we have known for 1,470 years that the year \n2000 was coming. Everyone in the world knew it was coming. In fact, we \nhardly hear a political speech that does not talk about the 21st \ncentury or the President rarely opens his mouth that he doesn't talk \nabout the new millennium.\n\n  Many people have actually planned where they are going to be on New \nYear's eve of next year. The only people on the planet who were \nsurprised that the year 2000 is actually coming, are people in the \nClinton administration. The reason they are surprised is they knew the \nyear 2000 was coming, they knew we had these computer problems, but \nthey didn't include this in their budget in January so they could try \nto hide the fact that they are busting their own budget, so that they \ncould hide the fact that they are taking money away from Social \nSecurity to spend, at the same time that they are criticizing the House \nof Representatives for trying to have a modest tax cut.\n  Now, a second example of nonemergency spending is Bosnia. I know the \nPresiding Officer is aware that we have troops in Bosnia because I have \nheard her demand that the administration establish a policy on numerous \noccasions. Her feelings and leadership on this are well-known. But we \nhave an emergency in the President's mind because we don't have funding \nin his budget for Bosnia.\n  I remind my colleagues the President sent troops to Bosnia 3 years \nago. Then he extended the mission for our troops to Bosnia 2 years ago, \nand he extended it again last year. Finally, he said they would be \nthere indefinitely. You might ask yourself a question: Given that we \nhave had troops in Bosnia for 3 years, given that no one on the planet \nis surprised that there are troops in Bosnia, why does the President \nnow ask for funding for troops in Bosnia as an emergency?\n  Now, this lady, Linda Ricci, with the Office of Management and Budget \nsays that there is nothing extraordinary about the President's \nemergency requests. I find it extraordinary, when we are in our fourth \nyear of troops in Bosnia and the President has an emergency because he \nhas discovered that we have troops in Bosnia, that we have no money in \nhis budget to pay for troops in Bosnia. I find that extraordinary.\n  The next item is my last. The Constitution, in article I, mandates \nthat there be a census; that every 10 years we go out and count the \nnumber of people in the country and that we allocate representation in \nthe House of Representatives based on the census. It has been in the \nConstitution for over 200 years. We have never had the change of a \ndecade occur that we have not done a census. We have known from the \nfirst day that the Constitution was ratified in 1779 that we were going \nto do a census in the year 2000. Yet now we are considering declaring \nan emergency because we are going to have to do a census in the year \n2000. Now, why is there an emergency? There is an emergency because the \nAdministration did not include enough money in their budget to provide \nthe funding for the buildup to the census year. In fact, they and \nCongress have systematically underfunded the census.\n  Now, the Office of Management and Budget may not find it \nextraordinary that we have $20 billion worth of requested emergency \nspending by the President. But I find it extraordinary. They may not \nfind it extraordinary that the President is asking for twice as much \nemergency spending this year as he has on average since he has been \nPresident, and on average since President Clinton has been in office. \nHe has asked for twice as much as President Bush. In fact, his request \nin calendar year 1998 is over 20 times as big as President Bush's \nrequest for emergency spending in 1991, the first year that we had this \nemergency designation. I find it extraordinary. OMB may not, but the \nfact that they don't, it seems to me, simply shows that either they \ndon't know what the history of the use of emergency spending is or they \ndon't want to know.\n  Now, the second response I wanted to give is a response to the brand-\nnew White House spokesman. Joe Lockhart, in his first day on the job, \nWhite House spokesman Joe Lockhart rejected my comments saying that the \nemergency requests only total $14 billion and that it would not come \nout of the surplus. As I have already said, in calendar year 1998 the \nPresident has requested a total of $20 billion. The fact that he \nalready has gotten $6 billion does not change the fact we are talking \nabout $20 billion worth of new unbudgeted spending.\n  I suggest that Joe Lockhart, in one day at the White House, has \neither shown that he is getting bad habits at the White House very \nquickly or he knows absolutely nothing about the budget. The only way \nthese ``emergency spending programs''--like fixing\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nthe computers of the government, the census, funds for Bosnia--can be \nfunded is taking every penny of it directly out of the surplus.\n  When Mr. Lockhart, in his first day at the White House says that none \nof this money will come out of the surplus, it is obvious that Mr. \nLockhart either doesn't know how the budget works, or he has gotten a \nvery bad habit in only one day at the White House.\n  I suggest that Mr. Lockhart set the record straight.\n  Now, what is relevant here is the following: There were a few \npeople--and I am one of them, so I am sensitive about it--who took the \nPresident at his word back in January. That word was ``save Social \nSecurity first.'' I would like to vote for a tax cut but I have said, \ngiven that we have problems in Social Security, given that we need next \nyear to restructure Social Security and build the financial base of it, \nI have been willing to forego a tax cut so that we could set aside the \nwhole $70 billion of the surplus to put Social Security first. I feel \nin this area that I have been trying to do what the President \nrequested. Now I find that the President is not doing what the \nPresident requested, that while I have been trying to say no to \nspending and while I have been trying to say no to tax cuts, the \nPresident is saying no to tax cuts, but he is trying to force-feed \nCongress the largest increase in emergency spending in history.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me finish this thought and I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the pending order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana, by unanimous \nconsent, does control the time between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is more than generous and I can complete what I have \nto say.\n  Madam President, I have tried to live up to the President's challenge \nin that State of the Union Address by putting Social Security first, by \ndelaying until next year a tax cut so that we could rebuild the \nfinancial base of Social Security and have the money to do it with.\n  However, I have to say I am very distressed in that while I am trying \nto carry out the President's policy on a bipartisan basis and not \nsupporting something that I am very much for--a tax cut--the President \nnow is trying to say to Congress I am going to veto your spending bills \nand shut down the Government unless you spend $20 billion more than you \nhave written into your budget and $20 billion of additional spending \nthat the President didn't even ask for in his budget back in February.\n  Now we have people at the White House and at OMB who are saying there \nis nothing extraordinary about what the President is doing and that the \namount of money he is spending is not coming out of the surplus. My \npoint is, everything about what the President is doing is \nextraordinary. It is twice as much as the President, on average, has \nrequested in the past.\n  It is 20 times as much as the last President requested for \nemergencies in 1991; it is for programs that have nothing to do with \nconventional emergencies: Funding for Bosnia, when we have been there 3 \nyears. Why doesn't the President put it in his budget? Funding for the \ncensus, which we have done every 10 years since 1789. Why doesn't the \nPresident put it in his budget? Funding for the computer problem for \nthe year 2000, when we have known since 525, when the world went to \nmeasuring time from the birth of Christ, that we were going to have a \nyear 2000.\n  Clearly, every penny that the President spends, or forces the \nCongress to spend, is coming right out of the surplus and right out of \nSocial Security. So I don't believe the President is living up to his \nword. I don't think he is putting Social Security first, and I don't \nthink it is right.\n  I thank our dear friend from Montana for allowing me to finish my \nstatement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11407-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11409-S11411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE GLOBAL CRISIS, BIPARTISANSHIP AND THE IMF\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, in my 20 years in the Senate, I have \nscarcely experienced a more politically trying time than this. As the \nnation decides how to cope with an unprecedented political crisis, \nCongress must not only consider impeachment proceedings but pass \nspending measures to keep our government running.\n  More important, a number of serious foreign policy crises demand our \nattention. From Kosovo to Iraq and Tanzania to Latin America, the need \nfor American leadership has never been greater.\n  To the extent that we can deal with these issues in a reasoned, \nbipartisan fashion, the world and the United States stand to gain.\n\n\n                             america's role\n\n  Mr. President, we Americans have a unique role. More than at any time \nsince the early years of the cold war, the world looks to us as a \nguarantor of peace in regions from Kosovo to Central Africa to Cambodia \nand the Persian Gulf; as a leader in the quest for prosperity, as we \nlook toward more fair and open trade and an effective approach to the \nfinancial crisis; as the pace-setter in science and technology; and as \nan example of effective democratic government and respect for human \nrights.\n  This is a demanding role. We may not have sought it. Some of us may \nnot entirely welcome it. But it is a role that in this post-cold-war \nworld nobody else can fulfill.\n  Japan is in the midst of a deep financial crisis; Russia and China \nstill in the process of economic reform; Europe concentrated on \ndeepening and expanding the EU. Only the United States can lead.\n  As the world's largest economy and most trusted trading partner, the \nUnited States is unique. I find this sentiment continually reinforced \nas I travel to Asia, Europe and South America. My counterparts there \ntell me that there is no one with whom they would rather do business \nthan Americans.\n  Our openness, respect for the rule of law and willingness to innovate \nmark the United States as the global leader. It's why we won the cold \nwar, and it's why we are viewed as a relative safe haven in these times \nof global financial instability.\n  Mr. President, we are also the world's foremost cultural power. \nAmerica is the birthplace of the Internet and more than 80 percent of \nWorld Wide Web material is in English; our movies dominate over 70 \npercent of the European market, more than half that of Japan; and there \nare increasingly few countries where one cannot order a Big Mac in \nEnglish, pay for it in U.S. dollars and wash it down with a Coke or \nPepsi.\n  Mr. President, I may sound biased, but I think it appropriate that if \nthere is to be a world superpower, the United States should be it. We \nare not an imperialist country; we respect human rights; we have open \nmarkets; and we are the foremost example of this experiment called \ndemocracy.\n  It has been said that our Founding Fathers envisioned a governmental \nsystem that is fragmented and dispersed of power. Our Founding Fathers \nsucceeded. Neither the President nor the Congress nor the Judiciary has \nan inordinate ability to effect change, and that sets us apart from \nparliamentary systems of government.\n  But this is the system we have, and while we must accept its \nlimitations, we must also praise its virtues for making us the \nwealthiest and most powerful nation in the history of the world.\n  We must also work especially hard to facilitate more contact between \nCongress and the Executive, and between the parties that make up our \nunique political system.\n  And we must accept that despite the current political crisis, Bill \nClinton is still our President. Whatever the outcome of impeachment \nproceedings, crises the world over will not wait.\n  Americans have a duty--bipartisan, bicameral, and bi-institutional--\nto lead.\n  Like or not, this is a role we must fulfill--for the sale of our own \npeople, because if we do not lead, Americans will pay the price in a \nmore turbulent, dangerous world.\n  So while we may at times have differences, as individuals or as \nDemocrats and Republicans, we must also at times put these differences \naside and remember our larger responsibililities.\n\n\n                         asian financial crisis\n\n  We see this very clearly in the Asian financial crisis. In the past \neighteen\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nmonths, an event which began with the devaluation of the Thai currency \nhas become a crisis threatening nations all over the globe.\n  It has brought cataclysmic change to Indonesia, a nation of 200 \nmillion people. It has threatened the stability of Russia--a nuclear \npower whose efforts toward reform will help determine the future of \nEurope. It has shaken the economies of South America and South Africa.\n  And this year, it has come home to the farms and the farmers in our \ncountry. And I can say that particularly of my State of Montana, as our \nexport markets have dropped. Asians are not buying our wheat. Prices \nhave fallen and families have faced the worst threats they have faced \nin recent years to their future in farming.\n  On such an occasion, the United States must lead, both in long-term \nreform and in short-term emergency action.\n  In the long run, we need to carefully examine our international \nfinancial policies. This includes the question of whether the \ninternational financial institutions have enough capability to monitor \nthe health of foreign financial systems.\n  And it includes the search for ways to improve our ability to predict \nfinancial crises and thus prevent them from spreading around the world. \nThat must be a careful, deliberate process.\n  In the short run, however, we need to do two things.\n  First, the Administration should speed up and perhaps augment food \nrelief to Indonesia and other countries that may be threatened by \nhunger. The President has committed to provide 2.5 million tons of \nwheat to these people, and the Administration has now disbursed about \n25 percent of that. We need to do better.\n  We are already hearing reports of malnutrition in Indonesia; and our \nfarmers are watching prices decline by the week. When people need food \nand farmers need relief, we need to act fast and we need to act boldly.\n  Second, we in Congress ought immediately to pass our contribution to \nthe International Monetary Fund.\n\n\n                        results of imf programs\n\n  Last year, the IMF organized recovery programs for Thailand, \nIndonesia, Korea, the Philippines, and Russia. And while even the best-\noff among these countries still face difficult times ahead, it's clear \nthat those which have implemented IMF programs most efficiently now \nhave the best prospects for early recovery.\n  The Philippines, which under Presidents Aquino and Ramos carried out \nfinancial reform monitored by the IMF, has suffered less than any other \naffected country.\n  Thailand, where the present Democrat Party government has overseen \nthe closure of 56 finance companies and the nationalization of four \nbanks, has seen the baht recover from a low of 57 to the dollar this \nFebruary to a stable band around 40 since March. This means a reduced \ndebt burden for Thai companies and an earlier recovery.\n  Korea, where President Kim Dae-jung has committed to breaking up the \nmonopolies and closed markets many of us have protested in the past, \nhas also seen currency rates rise.\n  By contrast, those countries which did not implement reforms early--\nin particular Russia and Indonesia--now face a far more difficult \nfuture.\n  The Indonesians--including the government as well as the citizen \nmovements which sparked last spring's ``reformasi''--have on the whole \npeacefully changed a 30-year-old government; and moved on to open the \npress, set an election time-table, and begin economic reform. They \ndeserve our support.\n\n\n                       criticisms of imf funding\n\n  Some of course have criticised the IMF programs on the merits. And it \nis true that these programs have not always been flawless.\n  For example, some have criticised them as ``austerity programs'' \nrequiring too much economic sacrifice. To some extent I have shared \nthat criticism. For example, I said last February that their Korea and \nSoutheast Asia programs were mistaken in asking for budget cuts during \na deep recession.\n  But they have learned and improved over time. In Thailand, the \ninitial IMF requirement for a budget surplus at 1 percent of GDP has \nbeen dropped and replaced with a deficit of 3.5 percent GDP.\n  And in a larger sense, had the IMF not been there to provide loans \nwhen Thailand and Korea were threatened with default, we would be much \nworse off today.\n  Others have expressed fears that these programs will create a ``moral \nhazard.'' That is, emergency IMF loans will encourage other countries \nto make the same types of mistakes later. I find this theory completely \nuntenable.\n  A glance at daily papers--let alone a visit to Southeast Asia or \nKorea--will show you families pulling their children out of school \nbecause they can't afford to pay tuition; men spending all day in local \nparks because they are ashamed to tell heir families they have lost \ntheir jobs; governments choosing between money for schools and money \nfor food relief.\n  No country anywhere in the world will want to repeat their \nexperience.\n\n\n                            need to act now\n\n  Thus, our experience with these programs is clear. Those countries \nwhich have implemented reforms are by no means in good shape, but their \nsituation is much better than those which have not.\n  And as we face the prospects that the crisis may spread beyond Asia, \nwe must make sure the IMF has the resources it needs to address any new \nemergencies. If we do not, we run a tremendous risk.\n  Imagine how much worse, for example, the crisis in rural America will \nbecome if we do nothing in the face of threats to Mexico, Brazil or \nother critical Latin American markets. The pressure we are under \nbecause of the decline in our Asian markets could double overnight.\n  After bailing out Russia, the Fund's coffers are nearly empty, the \nIMF having had to draw on a credit line not used since 1978. If the \nHouse does not act soon, it risks jeopardizing global and American \neconomic viability by rendering the IMF broke and unable to deal with \nfuture crises.\n  To quote the Economist Magazine:\n\n       If the Fund runs out of money--a real possibility if \n     Congress remains obdurate--the next emerging market collapse \n     could trigger a default that would spill over, fatally, to \n     all other emerging markets. And since rich countries now \n     account for barely half of world output, that could easily \n     mean a global slump. Even the most isolationist congressman \n     would hardly welcome that.\n\n  Madam President, it should be noted here that allocating funds for \nthe IMF has no budgetary impact. A capital increase in the IMF is paid \nfor with an exchange of assets, not cash. Any country has a right to \ndemand that its contribution to the Fund be returned--at any time.\n  So we need to act now. We need to put political disputes aside and \nfocus on our larger responsibilities. Thus, on a bipartisan basis and \nwith particular credit due to Senator Hagel, the Senate has now twice \nvoted to approve our full IMF quota. The House, however, has approved \nonly a bill providing $3.4 billion for the IMF's New Arrangements to \nBorrow.\n  This is very disappointing in itself. And I am even more troubled \nthat some in the House have apparently decided to link this issue to \nsupport for family planning overseas. That goes beyond disappointing to \nirresponsible.\n  Abortion is, as we all know, among the most heated and emotional \nissues we have. We can debate our views and the right way to support \nfamily planning on its own merits. But to link this question to IMF \nfunding threatens our ability to address a financial crisis of world \nmagnitude.\n\n\n                         u.s. responsibilities\n\n  Madam President, those affected by this crisis are democracies and \ntreaty allies: Thailand, the Philippines, and Korea. They are countries \nattempting to build democracy in the face of enormous challenges: \nIndonesia and Russia. They are Montana farmers and factory workers. And \nwe must do the right thing.\n  As Surin Pitsuwan, the immensely capable Thai Foreign Minister, said \nin his recent visit to Capitol Hill:\n  ``We look to Washington for leadership. We need the dynamism, the \nenergy, the focus from Washington. There is a need for leadership, and \nthat leadership is only here.'' That is the United States. ``That is \nthe expectation of the world.''\n  Madam President, let us prove him right. It is time to act; it is \ntime to lead.\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\n  Let us search, carefully but seriously, for financial reforms that \nwill create a more stable world economy.\n  Let us push ahead more quickly and globally with food relief, pay our \nU.N. dues, pass fast track, and, above all, I urge the House to act \nwithout any further delay to pass our IMF quota. That is the very least \nwe can do now in exerting responsible American leadership in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11409-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AG CRISIS IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I stand before you today with a heavy \nheart.\n  Why? Because I am extremely disappointed and terribly frustrated that \ndespite our best efforts, the Agriculture appropriations conference \nreport has completely missed the mark in responding to the crisis in \nfarm and ranch country.\n  As I see it, we had four issues that were worthy of bipartisan \nsupport in this conference.\n  Proposals that would have delivered immediate support to our \nproducers suffering from unusually low prices and natural disasters.\n  Disaster assistance is necessary; uncapping those market assistance \nloans is necessary; mandatory price reporting; and, improved meat \nlabeling--all would have helped just a little but would still have \nhelped tremendously in view of the depths of the situation.\n  Perhaps we've come to a meeting of the minds on natural disaster \nassistance. And, we should. No one can argue that drought, disease, \nflooding, and now hurricanes have devastated crops across the board and \nacross the country. But what brought us to this point in the first \nplace; that is, the crisis facing rural America? Extraordinarily low \nprices, prices rivaling the disaster of the 1980s, with no end in \nsight. And what did our Republican ag conferees deliver? Thirteen cents \na bushel for wheat.\n\n  To be honest, it is an outrage, it is an insult, it is a slap in the \nface to every hard-working, struggling, desperate grain farmer. And the \nso-called ``relief'' is equally inadequate for every commodity.\n  The agriculture conference committee looked at the options, including \na package offered by Senators Daschle and Harkin that would have lifted \nloan caps and extended the term of the marketing loan. But they shot it \nthrough the heart.\n  We should have laid aside our partisan politics and done what was \nright for folks back home--giving them relief enough to make it through \nthe crisis so they don't lose their family farm this year. The Daschle-\nHarkin plan to lift loan caps would give our producers roughly 60 cents \na bushel--not 13 cents but 60 cents--a far cry from the pittance \nincluded in the conference report.\n  I think we can do better. We must do better. In the 1980s we spent \nnearly $16 billion in just 1 year to get through that agriculture \ncrisis. Now we are asking for half of that on a one-time, 1-year bases. \nIs that too much to ask? Too much to ask to help provide some relief?\n  In Montana, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the \nDaschle-Harkin plan would provide Montana producers with $100 million \nmore than the plan of 13 cents proposed by the other side. Every \nprecious dollar counts to those in Montana's largest industry.\n  What happened to the other parts of the package that passed the \nSenate--price reporting and mandatory imported meat labeling? We lost \nthe fight to the House--an easy fight, a bipartisan fight. The result \nnow is that we have a 6-month study on both price reporting and meat \nlabeling--just a study.\n  You tell me how I can tell folks back home that they have to wait for \na report when they already know things aren't right in the market. They \nsee it every day. I hear it every day in telephone calls I make to \nhome. When I go home and talk to producers worried about holding onto \nthe farm, or the ranch, or passing it on to their children, these \npeople aren't complainers, they are hard workers who believe in the \nland and doing what is best for their community.\n  If we do not help them, no one will. We don't need to study the \nproblem more. Rather, we need to fix it. What will this conference \nreport send home? It will send home rhetoric, not help them as they \nneed help.\n  Madam President, we still have time. The clock is ticking. But I say \nlet's get to work. We have to work together on both sides of the aisle \nto help people in our country, people who are not Democrats, people who \nare not Republicans, people who are not Independents--people who are \nAmerica's farmers.\n  A decent cash influx for bad prices should be part of a bipartisan \npackage; adequate disaster assistance and real price reporting and meat \nlabeling. That is not asking much at all. That is what we should \ntogether agree to. Then together we can send a message from both sides \nof the aisle that we won't go home emptyhanded; that we are here to \nhelp our people; that this Congress did something right. It is simple. \nWe should have sent this bill back to conference and crafted a package \nthat would have really done something to halt this crisis. That is no \nlonger an option.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote against the conference report which \nwill be before us. If the report is not adopted, that is, the vote is \nnot successful, then I say let's go back to work and do the right \nthing. On the other hand, if the vote on the conference report is \nsuccessful, as it may well be, then I expect the President will veto \nit, as he should. Maybe then we can sit down and roll up our sleeves \nand figure out a way to adequately help our people.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11411-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11411-S11437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AGRICULTURAL, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the report will be \nstated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4101), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 2, 1998.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, pending before the Senate at this time \nis the conference report on the fiscal year 1999 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act. We present this conference report for the Senate's \napproval this afternoon.\n  The agreement provides total new budget authority of $55.7 billion \nfor programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture--\nexcept for the Forest Service, which is funded by the Interior \nappropriations bill--the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and expenses and payments of the farm \ncredit system. This is $6 billion more than the fiscal year 1998 \nenacted level; it is $1.9 billion less than the President's request \nlevel; it is $192 million less than the House-passed bill, and it is \n$1.1 billion less than the Senate-passed bill level.\n  The changes that were made in conference on mandatory funding \nrequirements account for the overall increase from the fiscal year 1998 \nenacted level, principally reflecting a $2.6 billion lower estimate for \nFood Stamp Program funding requirements, higher Child Nutrition Program \nexpenses, and a $7.6 billion increase in the payment to reimburse the \nCommodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses. The conference \nreport also provides an additional $4.2 billion in emergency \nappropriations to assist agricultural producers and others who have \nsuffered financial hardship due to adverse weather conditions and loss \nof markets.\n  Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\nyear spending actions, this conference agreement provides total \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 1999 of $13.651 billion in \nbudget authority and $14.050 billion in outlays. These amounts are \nconsistent with the revised discretionary spending allocations \nestablished for this conference agreement under the Budget Act.\n  It was a very difficult conference. As Members may recall, a number \nof legislative provisions were added to the bill when it was considered \nin the Senate in July. Not only did the conference committee have to \nreach agreement with the House on these issues, but it had to resolve \nfunding differences within a more constrained discretionary spending \nallocation for the conference than originally established in the Senate \nbill.\n  Special recognition is due and deserved by the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers. In \naddition, the chairman of the House subcommittee, Congressman Skeen \nfrom New Mexico, and ranking minority member of the House subcommittee, \nCongresswoman Kaptur from Ohio, turned in hard work and cooperated with \nour efforts to make this conference agreement possible.\n  The report includes credit relief for farmers, a 6-month extension of \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact, sanctions relief for exports to India and \nPakistan, a waiver of the statute of limitations for certain \ndiscrimination claims filed against the Department of Agriculture, and \na number of other legislative provisions that were included in the \nSenate and House-passed bills.\n  In addition, at the request of the House and Senate Agriculture \nCommittees, chaired by Senator Lugar here and Congressman Smith in the \nHouse, the conference report includes a moratorium on the rulemaking \nauthority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over swaps and \nderivatives, as well as language requested by the administration \nauthorizing the creation of an Under Secretary for Marketing and \nRegulatory Programs position at the Department of Agriculture. That \nchange also had the approval of the legislative committees with \njurisdiction over that subject.\n  During consideration of the bill in the Senate, an amendment was \nadopted providing increased funding for the President's Food Safety \nInitiative. A major portion of this additional spending was offset by \nan ``assessment'' on the purchasers and importers of tobacco. This was \nsubsequently determined by the House Ways and Means Committee to be a \n``tax,'' and therefore off limits to the Appropriations Committee and \nwas not included in the conference report. I am pleased to report to \nthe Senate, however, that the conference report provides increased \nfunding of $51.9 million for activities and programs which are part of \nthe administration's Food Safety Initiative.\n  In addition, the conference report provides $609 million for the Food \nSafety and Inspection Service, an agency critical to maintaining the \nsafety of our food supply. That is $20 million more than the fiscal \nyear 1998 level, and $460 million more than the President requested in \nhis budget.\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, one of the major differences \nbetween the House and Senate-passed bill was a House bill provision to \nprevent fiscal year 1999 funding for the new Competitive Agriculture \nResearch Program established by the Agricultural Research, Extension, \nand Education Reform Act of 1998. I did not support the proposal to \nremove or prevent the funding going forward as directed in that \nlegislation. However, with a total discretionary budget authority \nallocation for the conference that was $64 million below the level we \nhad for the Senate bill, it was a House position that the Senate \nconferees had little choice but to accept.\n  Without that offset, drastic cuts would have been necessary in \nfunding for other discretionary programs and activities in the bill. In \nview of this 1-year delay in funding for the new Agriculture Research \nCompetitive Grant Program, the conference provided increased \nappropriations for existing agricultural research programs.\n  Here are some examples: There is an appropriation of $782 million for \nthe Agriculture Research Service. That represents a $38 million \nincrease from the 1998 fiscal year level, and it is $14 million more \nthan was included in the Senate-passed bill.\n  There is total funding of $481 million for research and education \nactivities of the Cooperative Research, Education and Extension \nService. That is $50 million more than the fiscal year 1998 level, and \nit is $48 million more than was in the Senate-passed bill. Included in \nthis amount is a 7-percent increase from the fiscal year 1998 level for \npayments under the Hatch Act, cooperative forestry research, payments \nto the 1890 and 1994 institutions, including Tuskegee and animal and \nhealth disease grants.\n  Also included is a $22.1 million increase for the National Research \nInitiative Competitive Grants Program.\n  In addition, the bill recommends $434 million for extension \nactivities which preserves the 3-percent increase recommended by the \nSenate for Smith-Lever formula funds, as well as extension payments to \nthe 1994 and 1890 institutions, including Tuskegee University.\n  Approximately $36.1 billion, close to 65 percent of the total new \nbudget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic \nfood programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These \ninclude food stamps; commodity assistance; the special supplemental \nfood program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and the school \nlunch and breakfast programs. The Senate receded to the House-\nrecommended appropriations level for the WIC program because recent \ndata on actual participation rates and food package costs indicate that \nthis amount should be sufficient to maintain current program \nparticipation levels in fiscal year 1999.\n  For farm assistance programs, including the Farm Service Agency and \nfarm ownership and operation loan subsidies, the conference report \nprovides $1.1 billion in appropriations.\n  Appropriations for conservation programs administered by the Natural \nResources Conservation Service total $793 million, $9 million more than \nthe House bill level and $1 million more than the level recommended by \nthe Senate.\n  For rural economic and community development programs, the conference \nreport provides appropriations of $2.2 billion to support a total loan \nlevel of $6.2 billion. Included in this amount is $723 million for the \nRural Community Advancement Program, $583 million for the rental \nassistance program, and a total rural housing loan program level of \n$4.25 billion.\n  A total of $1.2 billion is provided for foreign assistance and \nrelated programs of the Department of Agriculture, including $136 \nmillion in new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service \nand a total program level of $1.1 billion for the P.L. 480 Food for \nPeace Program.\n  Total new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration is \n$977 million, $11.5 million more than the level recommended by the \nHouse and $24.5 million more than the Senate bill level, along with an \nadditional $132 million in Prescription Drug Act and $14 million in \nmammography clinics user fee collections. Included in the appropriation \nfor salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration is a $20 \nmillion increase for food safety.\n  For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $61 million is \nprovided; and a limitation of $35.8 million is established on \nadministrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration.\n  Titles XI-XIII of this conference report provide emergency relief to \nagricultural producers and others who have suffered weather-related and \neconomic losses. As Members will recall, a number of amendments were \nadopted to this bill when the Senate considered it in July to address \ndisaster-related requirements with the understanding that additional \nrelief would be necessary once actual losses were determined by the \nDepartment of Agriculture and a supplemental request was submitted by \nthe Administration. No request was submitted to the Congress until \nSeptember 23. On September 23, the Administration submitted a $1.8 \nbillion budget authority request to support $2.3 billion in emergency \nagricultural programs. In the interim, the Republicans released a $3.9 \nbillion relief package to assist agricultural producers. This emergency \nagricultural relief package is included in this conference report, \nalong with additional\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\nemergency supplemental appropriations, to make a total of $4.2 billion \nin emergency assistance available.\n  A total of $1.5 billion is made available to assist producers who \nhave been hit by crop losses in 1998, and an additional $675 million \nfor producers who have suffered from multiple-year crop losses. Also \nincluded is $175 million for emergency livestock feed assistance, and \n$1.65 billion to assist producers with market losses. In addition, the \nconference report provides temporary recourse loans for honey and \nmohair; $5 million for cotton indemnity payments; an increase of $25 \nmillion for the Food for Progress program to help move more grain out \nof the country; and expanded non-insured crop assistance for raisin \nproducers. Additional supplemental emergency appropriations provided by \nthe conference report include the $40 million to cover additional costs \nto the Farm Service Agency of administering this assistance, $10 \nmillion for the Forestry Incentives Program; and $31 million in subsidy \nappropriations to fund an additional $541 million in farm operating \nloans.\n  Madam President, this conference report was filed on Friday and was \npassed by the House of Representatives that day by an overwhelming vote \nof 333 yeas to 53 nays. Senate passage of this conference report today \nis the final step necessary to send this fiscal year 1999 \nappropriations bill to the President for signature into law.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report. Many of our \nfarmers and ranchers are facing the worst crisis in agriculture that \nthey can remember. The economic collapse in Asia has resulted in lost \nmarkets. Producers in some states have suffered severe weather \nconditions. Others have been hit hard by crop diseases. The farmers \nneed help now, and it is time to quit playing politics with disaster \nrelief and adopt this conference report.\n  Madam President, this is the last Agriculture Appropriations bill my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Arkansas, will manage in the \nSenate after serving on the Appropriations Committee for 20 years and \nthis Subcommittee for 13 years. Senator Bumpers has been an advocate of \nAmerican agriculture and a proponent of the programs in this bill to \nimprove the quality of life and help bring jobs to rural areas. His \nexpertise and many contributions to this process and this bill will \nindeed be missed.\n  In summary, let me point out, Madam President, that there has been \nraised the specter of a Presidential veto over this conference report \nbecause of the inadequacy of the provision relating to disaster \nassistance payments. I am very disturbed by that suggestion, and I hope \nthat it is more rumor than promise. I know the President spent some \ntime on Saturday in his weekly radio address speaking to that subject.\n  I recall that 2 weeks ago, I was asked to deliver the Republican \nresponse to the President's weekly radio address, and my subject was \nthe need for a more aggressive and meaningful disaster assistance \nprogram for farmers.\n  I think everyone can agree that both the President and the Congress \nhave been speaking out and making very clear the fact that we need a \nhelpful, sensitive, generous program of disaster assistance to help \ndeal with the realities of weather-related disasters that have struck \nmany parts of the country, market loss problems because of the Asian \neconomic crisis, and other factors that have worked together to make \nthis a very difficult year for agriculture.\n  The question is, Are we going to resolve this in a way that is \nconsistent with the legislative process that makes sense for farmers, \nthat serves to establish policies that are thoughtful and consistent \nwith the needs of American agriculture, or are we going to continue to \ntreat this as a political football and just kick it around and have us \nskirmish every day or every week over this issue, leading to delay, \nleading to uncertainties, leading to anxieties? Farmers in America \ncertainly deserve better.\n  I would like just for a moment or two to think back on the date when \nwe had the bill on the floor of the Senate and the subject of disaster \nassistance was first raised. We adopted in the Senate a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution calling on the President and the Congress to work \ntogether to come up with a proposal that would meet the needs for \nemergency action to respond ``to the economic hardships facing \nagriculture producers and their communities.'' The Senate adopted that \non July 15 by a vote of 99 to 0.\n  The next day, there was an amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad, and others who suggested we establish a $500 \nmillion indemnity program to compensate farmers for income losses that \nhad been suffered due to various adverse conditions--weather and \notherwise--throughout the country, although mainly the benefits were \ndirected to the upper plains and other selected areas, not countrywide \nbenefits or a program designed to be national in scope.\n  During my remarks on that occasion, I recall on the Senate floor \nsaying that we needed to have the President and the Department of \nAgriculture get involved and provide the Congress with a complete and \naccurate assessment of the funds that were needed for a program of this \nkind. We hadn't had a proposal from the administration for any specific \nbenefit program for agriculture, although there had been meetings on \nthe Hill with farm groups, with Senators and Congressmen trying to, \nfirst, get the facts and get a sense of what the agriculture leadership \nthroughout the country thought would be an appropriate response by the \nFederal Government.\n  There was no question at the time we were debating the bill that \nthere was great interest in developing a disaster assistance program to \nmeet the needs of American agriculture. As a matter of fact, during the \ndiscussion, I asked Senators if they had any better ideas, if they had \nsuggestions for anything other than this $500 million indemnity \nprogram, and no one came forward to offer any amendments and no one \nexpressed opposition to adopting that amendment. We checked with the \nlegislative chairman in the Senate, and others, and without objection, \nwe suggested that the Senate adopt the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on a voice vote, and that is what we did. We accepted the \namendment.\n  After that was done, it became clear that through gathering \ninformation, that the situation was more widespread. I remember going \nto Georgia, for example, with the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Coverdell. I had an opportunity to meet with farmers in southern \nGeorgia and became convinced that we had a problem that was bigger than \nthe upper plains and Texas. Everybody knew about the drought in Texas \nand the severe complications that were resulting from that for \nagriculture producers and ranchers in that area. But I do not think it \nwas well known that in south Georgia, which had had a series of \nweather-related disasters over a period of years, the agriculture \nsector there was really hurting. And the $500 million indemnity \nprogram, suggested by the Senators from North Dakota and others, was \nnot going to be sufficient to deal with that problem and others as \nwell.\n\n  I know in my State of Mississippi, for example, when I was home right \nafter we adopted this bill in July--we had a break during the August \nrecess--I had an opportunity to visit some areas of my State that were \ndevastated because of isolated weather patterns that had ruined corn \ncrops in the northwest part of Mississippi, and others had been damaged \nto the extent that diseases were infesting the crops. Aflatoxin was \nattacking the corn crops.\n  There was no provision in any Federal disaster assistance program for \nyield losses, for crop losses. Those who were suggesting an indemnity \nprogram based on lifting loan caps had to realize that was not going to \nhelp somebody who had a total crop failure. It would not help them a \nbit.\n  So we came back, started working on a new proposal, got with the \nleadership of the House and Senate, and asked the administration they \nwere going to request supplemental funding. They did come back with a \n$1.8 billion supplemental budget authority request to support $2.3 \nbillion in emergency agricultural programs, without a lot of \nspecificity about how those benefits would be determined, how the \neligibility would be determined, who would administer the program. But, \nnonetheless, it was a step in the right direction, and I applauded the \nPresident for responding in that way.\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\n  But based on that supplemental request--and working with the \nknowledge that other Members had generated from their States--we \nproposed to the conference committee a $4.1 billion disaster assistance \nprogram, and it was accepted in the conference committee with some \nchanges. We accepted some amendments proposed by House Members in \nconference. We added some money proposed by the Senate in response to \nspecific amendments that were urged in conference to the managers' \nproposal. So the end result was the conference committee agreed to \nprovide emergency benefits totaling about $4.2 billion.\n  So I come to the Senate today very pleased to be able to report that, \ninstead of a $500 million indemnity program that the Senate adopted as \na way to deal with the crisis in agriculture, working with farmers, \nproducers, and ranchers from around the country, and other Members of \nthe Congress, including the House, we now have a conference report that \nis much more generous, much more responsive to the real needs that \nexist in our country today in production agriculture, and designed to \nmore nearly bring farmers to a point where they can continue to operate \nwithout going broke, without the devastating effects that would have \nbeen the reality of the situation had not this package of changes been \nagreed upon.\n  We hear now that the Democratic leadership has urged the President to \nveto the bill. And I got a letter suggesting that he would if the \nconference agreement on disaster assistance was inconsistent with the \nproposal just recently made by the Democratic leader of the Senate to \nremove the loan caps under the current farm program for the commodities \nthat are subsidized, in effect, by the Federal Government--no ifs, \nands, buts about it.\n  The letter said--and I took this up with the Secretary of Agriculture \nto be sure I understood that that was the meaning--that the President \nsaid he would veto the bill if the conference report was inconsistent \nwith a proposal made by the Democratic leader to remove the loan caps \nfor those commodities that are subsidized by the Government.\n  I am very disappointed by that. I certainly hope that there is room \nfor the President to change his mind on that subject, because it seems \nto me that rather than argue over whether or not this program is really \ngoing to do a good job and is thoughtfully crafted to try to put \nfarmers back on their feet who have been devastated by bad weather and \nmarket conditions beyond their control, it just seems to me that this \nis not an appropriate response for the President to be making, given \nthe other opportunities for positive things.\n  Here are some examples of positive things that I think could be done \nwhich are beyond the jurisdiction of this committee today that brings \nyou this conference report. The House of Representatives just passed \nrecently a tax bill making a lot of changes in the Tax Code, but I \nspecifically recall that some of those tax changes are designed to \nbenefit farmers and farm families, and I am told that we are not going \nto have a chance to vote on that tax bill here in the Senate because we \ncannot get the bill cleared to bring up. We cannot get the House-passed \ntax bill cleared.\n  So in order to bring it up, the majority leader would have to move to \nthe consideration of the bill, the motion would become debatable, and \nthen in order to get the bill on the floor for consideration and debate \nand passage, 60 votes to invoke cloture would have to be undertaken \nbecause the Democrats are promising to filibuster the bill.\n  Here are the changes that it bothers me we will not even get a chance \nto approve that would help farmers.\n  There is a 5-year net loss carryback of losses that you can carry \nback and set against income for 5 previous years. That is in the House-\npassed bill. The House-passed bill makes permanent income averaging, \nwhich permits farmers and ranchers to average income, high years \nagainst low years, and even out the tax burden, which is very \nbeneficial to many.\n  There is a provision that makes deductible, to 100 percent of the \ncost, health insurance premiums by those who are self-employed. If you \nare in agriculture and you have a farm and you are your own boss, under \nthis change you will be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost of your \nhealth insurance. That helps farmers. That helps farm families.\n  There is also an acceleration of the exemption for death taxes and \ngift taxes. One of the most difficult things facing agriculture today \nis the obligation to come up with cash money to pay the Federal \nGovernment so-called inheritance taxes on the death of a family member \nwho has an interest in the land or the other property that goes into \nmaking up the decedent's estate.\n  We have passed rules that phase in some higher exemptions for small \nfarms and for businesses. What this House-passed bill does is \naccelerate the phasing in of those exemptions. That would be a big help \nto many farm families who are going to have to liquidate assets in real \nestate to pay death taxes.\n  Another thing that this administration has been slow to react to is \nthe trade problems that we are having in this hemisphere, with Canada, \nwith Mexico, and beyond, barriers to trade so that our farmers and our \nexporters are having to deal with unfair tariff situations and other \ndifficulties that are erected to keep America from selling what we are \nproducing in the world marketplace and at the same time importing, in \nviolation of some existing rules, I am told, some foodstuffs, live \ncattle, from other countries.\n  Finally the administration is beginning to act. We see the Trade \nRepresentative engaging Canada in trade talks now about steps that can \nbe taken to solve the problems that have developed in that area. But we \nwere hearing this on the Senate floor and urging the administration to \ntake action. Being the chief negotiator in the executive branch, the \nPresident has an obligation to assume some leadership. Frankly, there \nhas been a breakdown in leadership on that subject.\n\n  We hope we haven't waited too late to make changes and reach \nagreements and work out problems in the trade area for the farmers who \nhave suffered this year. That is one of the reasons why we felt it \nnecessary to include direct payments that are bonus payments under the \ntransition.\n  We think the market transition program to compensate producers \ndirectly for income losses due to the economic crisis and trade \nproblems that we have is very important. The administration does not \npropose and has not suggested that as an appropriate step to aid \nAmerica's farmers.\n  I make those comments, Madam President, not to pick a fight with \nanybody here on the floor of the Senate today, but to simply express my \nconcern that we not see this bill held up, delayed, postponed, vetoed, \nwhatever may happen to it, because of an interest in being able to say \nthe Democrats are for a $7 billion disaster program, the Republican \nbill is only $4 billion. I bet it will be the same folks who said we \nwant $500 million in an indemnity program to help meet the needs of the \nagriculture crisis. That is what the story was in July. We all agreed \nat that time that was probably temporary, that more needs to be done. \nSo I am not belittling that suggestion. It was the suggestion on the \nfloor of the Senate at the time and no one had any better idea at that \ntime.\n  Since then it seems we have been engaged in a show of one-upsmanship. \nThe Republicans then come up with, with Democrat input in many cases, \nthis $4 billion program of disaster assistance. Now, all of a sudden, \nthat is not enough; we need $7 billion.\n  How much has the President requested? I have the exact amount: $1.76 \nbillion in budget authority has been requested by the President for \nagriculture producers and ranchers. That will support $2.3 billion \nprogram level. The other suggestion is removing the loan caps. Then CBO \nis called on to answer the question, what will that cost? The answer is \nthat will probably cost--and it is speculation, it is a guess, nobody \nknows because nobody knows what commodity prices will be in the \nfuture--it is guessed it will be $5.5 billion.\n  The proponents of that proposal say we are for spending $5.5 billion \nplus $2.3 billion, so we are for spending almost $8 billion. So this is \na more generous plan. What is not disclosed is the effect that policy \nchange of raising the loan caps will have on prices of those \ncommodities next year or the next. The\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\nfact is there are many who tell us that we are buying into a program \nthat is going to have a continuing depressing effect on market price of \nthese commodities that are covered by the loan programs.\n  I don't know if that is true or not. I don't think anybody could have \nguessed that corn and wheat prices would have been as low as they are \nright now a year ago. So nobody knows what the prices are going to be \nin the future. I am told they will be lower because of that change in \npolicy. So are we doing farmers a favor by making that policy change?\n  It is really not a question, in my view, of who is willing to spend \nmore money on farmers, the Republicans or the Democrats. Both are being \nvery generous. That is the fact. Both are being very, very generous in \nterms of where we started, existing programs, precedent, previous \ndisaster benefit efforts. The fact is the Democrats are in favor of \nmaking a policy change and substituting a change for an existing farm \nbill provision that set up the market transition payments and the \nphasing in to a market economy. We are in the second year of that farm \nbill. There are 3 more years left under the authority of the 1996 bill. \nI m hopeful that we can find a way to provide the benefits to American \nagriculture producers without rewriting or trying to rewrite portions \nof the 1996 farm bill. So we have a difference of opinion on that.\n  Let me simply conclude my remarks by thanking everyone who helped us \nwrite this conference report. It has been a very challenging \nexperience. I don't know that we had a more contentious or at least \nlong drawn out conference on agriculture appropriations since I have \nbeen in the Congress. I don't recall having any more difficult time \nputting the bill together. We had a lot of disagreements that were \ndiscussed, but we worked them all out. We have a conference agreement. \nThat is the good news. The other body has passed the conference report \nby a very large vote.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing members of the staff of the Appropriations Committee be \ngranted the privilege of the floor during consideration of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 4101, and during any votes that may \noccur in relation to this measure: Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott \nPoindexter, and Rachelle Graves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, first of all, let me compliment the \nSenator from Mississippi for his usual articulate and persuasive \nfashion--always a gentleman, always wanting to work with us, regardless \nof momentary disagreements. I regret to say this is one of those \nmomentary disagreements.\n  I come to the floor today to offer arguments against this conference \nreport. I had initially intended to offer a motion to recommit the \nreport back to conference, but now that motion would be out of order \nsince the House has reported it. I prefer that it go back to the \nconference rather than going on to the President.\n  I appreciate very much the President indicating he will veto this \nbill. Perhaps if we can dispose of this conference report in a hurry, \nget the President's veto, the conferees can direct their attention to \nthe objections the President has raised. Those objections are similar \nto the ones I will offer here this afternoon.\n  Let me say, first of all, I do appreciate that there is bipartisan \nagreement that rural America is facing a real crisis. That is very good \nnews. What the Senator from Mississippi said is quite right. There has \nbeen, throughout the year, a process of developing proposals, but there \nhas been significant disagreement on one particular point; that is, \ntaking the caps off the loan rate. We voted twice on that. It did not \npass here in the Senate. I will talk about that later. I think, \nunfortunately, that ideological argument is getting in the way of our \nability to be able to reach agreement.\n  This conference report, I believe, fails in two areas: First, it does \nnot achieve the goal of providing support, both to the farmers who grow \nthe crop who are in serious trouble due to the prices, and those who \nare in trouble as a consequence of weather disasters. For livestock, \nthis conference report fails to put the law on the sides of the \nproducers and take action to make our markets work better.\n  First, as to the amount of income support for grains, it is simply \nnot enough. It is not targeted as it should be to the people growing \nour food.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nthat appeared in the Lincoln Journal Star praising Congressman Doug \nBereuter, a Republican from Nebraska, who represents the First \nCongressional District. Congressman Bereuter also objected to the plan \nin the conference report as not sufficiently generous to meet the needs \nof agriculture under current economic conditions; that the $4 billion \nin aid should be closer to $7 billion in aid that the budget has \nrequested. I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Lincoln Journal Star, Oct. 2, 1998]\n\n                Bereuter Path on Farm Aid Best Approach\n\n       First District Rep. Doug Bereuter has a sound, responsible \n     approach to helping farmers at a time when commodity prices \n     have plunged to lows not seen since the 1980s.\n       Breaking with his GOP cohorts, Bereuter said this week the \n     Republican plan ``is not sufficiently generous'' to meet the \n     needs of agriculture under current economic conditions.\n       House and Senate conferees Wednesday chose the Republican \n     plan, which would provide $4 billion in aid, over a \n     Democratic plan which would have provided $7.1 billion in tax \n     subsidies to farmers.\n       Agriculture was one of the first sectors of the economy to \n     be buffeted by the Asian financial crisis. Export markets in \n     some Asian nations have virtually evaporated. Now markets in \n     Latin America also are being affected.\n       In addition to providing a cushion against low prices, the \n     aid package under consideration in Congress is intended to \n     help farmers who have been hit by drought and other adverse \n     weather conditions.\n       Debate over the size of an aid package for farmers \n     unfortunately has bogged down in partisan rhetoric and a \n     running debate over the five-year Freedom to Farm act \n     approved by Congress in 1996.\n       The Republican aid package unfortunately also rejects other \n     measures that would provide substantial benefit to \n     agriculture. For example, it does not require mandatory price \n     reporting, which would allow cattle producers to know what \n     packing plants are paying for beef.\n       It also does not include a provision to require labeling \n     showing the national origin of meat. The measure would allow \n     consumers to select beef produced in the U.S. rather than \n     other countries. While pushing for more financial help for \n     farmers, Bereuter rightly resists a return to previous ag \n     policies that are part of the Democratic approach, which \n     would base subsidies for grain farmers on the so-called loan \n     rate.\n       Previous farm policy was based on a heavily bureaucratic \n     approach with strict government dictates. Proponents of the \n     Freedom to Farm act left more decision-making to farmers, at \n     the same time leaving them more subject to market pressures.\n       In the long run, the market-oriented approach under Freedom \n     to Farm will benefit agriculture, although it certainly \n     should be open for modification and improvement.\n       But now, while farmers are facing a double whammy of record \n     harvests and low prices, is not the time to get bogged down \n     in partisan debate over basic philosophy.\n       Providing aid under the payment system of the existing farm \n     bill makes sense. But, as Bereuter suggested, the amount \n     should be more generous than Republicans have agreed to so \n     far to preserve the stability and capability of the sector of \n     the economy that feeds the nation.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, as to the income, the proposal in the \nconference report would be, approximately, for corn, 7 cents a bushel. \nThat does not get the farmer much closer to either recovering the cost \nof production nor providing his banker confidence to lend him money \nagain next year, and significantly, of all the tests that I trust as to \nwhether or not the President's proposal should be a part of the \nconference report or not, economists will come forward and argue on \nboth sides of practically any proposal you come out with. The \nIndependent Bankers of America have endorsed taking the caps off the \nloan rate, not because it provides more income, and by no means does it \nprovide a sufficient amount of income that we won't still have \nsignificant people going broke, but because it is attached to a \nmarketing loan, it increases the chances that farmers who will need \noperating loans will be able to get them.\n\n  Likewise, this conference report is inadequate because provisions \nwere dropped that were passed in the Senate\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\nin July, which were to require price reporting for beef, and meat \nlabeling requirements as well. The conferees have said to farmers and \nranchers that they think the livestock markets work just fine. But I am \nhere in a brief period of time to say that the markets are not working.\n  Cattle feeders and ranchers have lost more than $2 billion in equity \nthis year, with millions more being lost every week. When I am home--\ntypically every weekend--the people in Nebraska are worried about their \nfinancial stability and they believe that this Agriculture \nappropriations bill, with the disaster package attached to it, will be \nterribly important for their financial stability. More deeply than just \nthe money, they are worried about their way of life, because, in the \nfinal analysis, this debate is about much more than just the size and \nmakeup of a relief package; it is about the future of rural America.\n  We can see the future of our small towns and rural areas very clearly \nright now, and it doesn't look good, with prices low and economic \nconditions as hard as they are on our farms and ranches.\n  Those who are not driven off the land in this crisis have already \nfound that their children are not interested in the life farming has to \noffer. Two weeks ago, in Scottsbluff, I held a town hall meeting, and \n60 people were in the room who are involved directly in production \nagriculture. I asked how many of them had children who would take over \nthe farms, and I didn't get a single affirmative answer. Those with \ngrown children had already lost them to the cities. Others said, \n``There is no opportunity out here.''\n  That is what this Congress has the ability to change, and we can \nstart with this piece of legislation. We need an agricultural sector \nthat offers some opportunity, but first we must bring some stability to \nthat agricultural sector.\n  Again, I am pleased the President is going to veto it. Let me talk of \nthe differences, specifically to our States. Again, I heard the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi talk about economists who are \nsaying taking the caps off of loan rates could have a depressing impact \non price. I have not come to the floor and said that Freedom to Farm \nproduced these lower prices. I think the lower prices are clearly there \nas a consequence of a declining demand in the international \nmarketplace. Nobody is forecasting that demand is going to come back in \n1999. Nobody expects the decline in exports to increase. I wish this \nCongress had been able to pass fast-track legislation. I have supported \nit in the past. I believe that, long term, it would help. But in the \nshort term, we see substantial declines in income that are there as a \nconsequence of this decline in demand and increased production that has \noccurred here in America.\n  This package in the conference report versus what the President asked \nfor is substantially different. I pointed this out before, and it bears \nrepeating. In Nebraska, the difference is $434 million of income--this \ndoes not go to State government or county government; it goes to \nindividual farm families--versus $177 million, almost a quarter of a \nmillion dollars. In Mississippi, it is $145 million versus $71 million. \nIn Minnesota, it is $483 million versus $227 million.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this table, which shows the differences \nbetween the package in the conference report and what the President has \nasked for be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     DEMOCRATIC VERSUS REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS, BY STATE (CBO ESTIMATE)\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              State                 Democratic   Republican   Difference\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama..........................           96           64           32\nArizona..........................           39           19           20\nArkansas.........................          194          105           89\nCalifornia.......................          227          142           85\nColorado.........................          120           53           67\nConnecticut......................            2            1            1\nDelaware.........................            6            2            4\nFlorida..........................           58           47           11\nGeorgia..........................          218          147           71\nIdaho............................          127           37           90\nIllinois.........................          527          186          341\nIndiana..........................          277           95          182\nIowa.............................          600          235          365\nKansas...........................          371          176          195\nKentucky.........................           65           30           35\nLouisiana........................           99           84           16\nMaine............................            3            2            1\nMaryland.........................           21            7           14\nMassachusetts....................            1            1            0\nMichigan.........................          109           47           62\nMinnesota........................          483          227          256\nMississippi......................          145           71           74\nMissouri.........................          205           81          124\nMontana..........................          160           71           89\nNebraska.........................          434          177          257\nNevada...........................            1            0            1\nNew Hampshire....................            1            0            1\nNew Jersey.......................            5            1            4\nNew Mexico.......................           40           27           14\nNew York.........................           41           12           29\nNorth Carolina...................          185          115           70\nNorth Dakota.....................          431          316          115\nOhio.............................          197           64          133\nOklahoma.........................          170          109           60\nOregon...........................           74           14           60\nPennsylvania.....................           46           10           36\nSouth Carolina...................           46           28           18\nSouth Dakota.....................          363          214          149\nTennessee........................           73           29           44\nTexas............................          896          813           83\nUtah.............................           11            3            8\nVermont..........................           26           11           16\nVirginia.........................           39           19           20\nWest Virginia....................          153           42          111\nWashington.......................           12            2           10\nWisconsin........................          139           60           79\nWyoming..........................           10            4            6\n                                  --------------------------------------\n  Total..........................        7,546        4,000        3,546\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, again, not only are our grain farmers \nadversely affected, but cattle producers and cattle processors have \nbeen as well. We have met extensively with our ranchers and our \nfeeders, and they say to us two things need to happen, and they need to \nhappen in order to improve our prices and increase the chances that we \nare going to get a market bid that is higher than what we are getting \nnow.\n  The first is mandatory reporting of prices, regardless of whether the \nprices occur in cattle that are owned by the feeder or cattle \ncontrolled through formula feeding, or some other contract by the \npackinghouse. Those prices today are not reported. We had extensive \ndebate here on the floor about that issue. Unfortunately, the conferees \ndropped that. I believe that provision, all by itself, would increase \nprices for cattle in the United States, for beef, and would have a very \npositive impact as a consequence on our rural communities.\n  Likewise, the meat labeling requirement included in the Senate bill \nwas dropped by the conferees, and it is supported by almost all of the \ncattle organizations. There is some dispute on price reporting, \nalthough I think we can deal with the changes that we had in the \nconference language. There is almost no dispute, from the standpoint of \nthe producer, on the need to put on the label information that allows \nthe consumer to determine from where that product came. It is allowing \nthe market to work. Rather than saying that the Government is going to \nimpose a solution, we say inform the consumer where the product came \nfrom and let them decide.\n  I hope, as I said in the beginning, that the President's veto of this \nconference report will lead to the conferees coming back quickly and \nlooking, as no doubt they will, for ways to improve it along the lines \nof what the President has recommended. Not only are there tens of \nthousands of farmers who will survive if we can get this legislation \npassed and on to the President for his signature, as he has asked us \nto, but it will give us a chance to take a step in the direction of \ngiving our rural communities a chance to survive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is a custom in the Senate to speak \nwell of someone you are about to oppose. So let me speak well of the \nSenator from Mississippi. We have worked together on a wide range of \nissues. He is a very effective Senator and somebody I enjoy working \nwith a great deal. He has a very effective staff and we work on a lot \nof issues together. But I come to the floor today opposing the \nconference report and to do so as aggressively as I possibly can. I \nwant to explain to him and other Members why I feel so strongly about \nthis.\n  First of all, it is not the case that all that was offered in July \nwas the $500 million indemnity program that was introduced as an \namendment by Senator Conrad and myself. It is the case that we also \nproposed, and had a vote on an amendment to increase the price supports \nby lifting the caps on the loan rate. We did it then; and we did it a \nsecond time. We lost twice in those efforts. We proposed a series of \nsteps, one of which was lifting the loan rate, and another of which \ndealt with disaster issues.\n  I want to describe why I feel so strongly about this. I received a \nletter from the head of the Farm Service Agency in our State. I asked \nhim, ``If things don't change, what should we\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nexpect in the next few months in North Dakota with respect to family \nfarms?'' He points out that North Dakota in the judgment of the Farm \nService Agency, will lose over 3,500 farms by this spring without some \nsignificant assistance. That is probably some 14,000 people. I assume \nthere is an average of three or four persons on each of those family \nfarmers, including a spouse and a couple of children. So at least 3,500 \nfamily farms will not get credit and will not be able to continue \nfarming this coming year. That means 12,000 to 14,000 North Dakota farm \npeople will be told that their dream is over. They tried, but they \nfailed.\n  Let me describe the reasons they are not making it. There are two \nmain reasons. One, is the disaster. We had the 500-year flood of the \nRed River, and people know about that. They remember the flood at Grand \nForks. For a number of years we have been in a wet weather cycle in \neastern North Dakota. We have had massive quantities of standing water \nthat have inundated acres and acres of farmland in North Dakota. This \nwet cycle has caused and exacerbated a crop disease known as fusarium \nhead blight, or scab. This combination has devastated the quality of \nfarm life in North Dakota.\n  I have a chart here. If you are a North Dakota farmer and you are in \nthese red counties on this chart in the eastern part of the State, you \nhave had 5 straight years of disaster declaration. The red counties are \nnot 1, 2, or 3, but every year for 5 straight years that these counties \nhave been declared a disaster. Why? Because of weather-related events, \nand other events, their production has been devastated. So that is the \ndisaster portion of this problem. You can see that with the orange \ncounties and yellow counties, that these counties have had disasters 3 \nout of 5 years. In fact two thirds of the counties in my State have \nbeen declared a disaster area 3, 4 or 5 years out of 5 years.\n  Now, in addition to the disaster, what also has happened to these \nfarmers is that Congress passed a new farm bill. The Senator from \nNebraska might be right that this might have nothing at all to do with \nprice. The new farm bill might not be related to the collapse in \nprice. But it might be; I don't know. I am not asserting that today, I \nam just saying that we passed a new farm bill. This chart shows what \nhas happened to the price of wheat since Congress passed the farm bill. \nIt is down by almost 60 percent. There has been a 60-percent drop in \nthe price of wheat since Congress passed the new farm bill. The price \nof wheat has fallen from $5.75 a bushel to $2.36.\n\n  Add together the significant disasters year after year and the \ncollapse of prices and here is what you have. In my State, in North \nDakota, which is the hardest hit, in 1 year there was a 98-percent drop \nin net farm income. These are U.S. Government figures. We had a 98-\npercent drop in net farm income. With respect to this group of North \nDakotans, their income has virtually been wiped away.\n  Is it any wonder they are in deep trouble? We are not a State of big \ncorporate agrifactories. We are a State largely composed of family \nfarms. When they suffer a loss of virtually all of their income, many \nof them just do not make it.\n  The current farm bill doesn't provide a bridge across price valleys. \nThe philosophy of the current farm bill is that you ought to operate in \nthe free market. If there is a price valley, the farmer is told, \n``Tough luck; try and find your way across the valley.''\n  So because we don't have that pricing bridge under this economic \nphilosophy, family farmers certainly don't get to the other side. The \nhead of our Farm Service Agency says 3,500 farms will not be in the \nfield next spring in North Dakota.\n  I am betting that if any other Member of this body had the same set \nof statistics in front of them concerning what is happening to their \nfamily farmers would also be here. They would be here with as much \nenergy and as much passion as I have to see if we can't change this \nresult and to do whatever we need to do to change it.\n  The underlying bill has disaster assistance. I am very appreciative \nof that. We might argue about who provides more. But overall, frankly, \nI think the underlying bill, and the administration, and virtually \neveryone who is party to this has offered a fairly decent package with \nrespect to disaster assistance.\n  The Senator from Mississippi correctly pointed out that he and \nSenator Lott accepted the $500 million indemnity program amendment that \nwe put into in the bill in the Senate in the first instance to deal \nwith the initial estimate of damages from the disaster in the Northern \nPlains. That amendment was done prior to the almost complete collapse \nof the cotton crop in Texas and the devastation in Louisiana, Oklahoma \nand other States. At that time we all understood that the disaster \nindemnity program was going to have to be increased at some point along \nthe way. The disaster package in this appropriations bill started with \nthe acceptance by the Senator from Mississippi to put in the $500 \nmillion indemnity for the Northern Plains. I appreciate that.\n  I am not here to argue about which disaster proposal for this bill is \nbetter than the other. Both the President and the conference report \naddressed this disaster issue in a very significant way. But, I am here \nto say that is not enough.\n  On top of the disaster provision, as the Senator from Mississippi \nindicated, the majority party added a 18-cents-a-bushel payment for \nwheat. This additional AMTA payment really only means that farmers will \nget 13 cents a bushel for wheat when it is all figured out. That is \nbecause AMTA payments are made on only 85 percent of contract acreage \non the frozen historic yields. So the real assistance to deal with \nprice collapse in this bill amounts to 13 cents a bushel for wheat. And \nit is not enough.\n  It won't allow farmers enough cashflow. It won't allow their bankers \nto decide that they will get another loan to go to the fields next \nspring to plant crops. They simply won't be able to do it. That is the \ndilemma. This is not enough. And there isn't any way to argue to say \nthat it is enough, or that it will solve this problem.\n  If numbers are to be believed with respect to the estimates in North \nDakota, at least 3,500 farm families are going to be washed away. These \nfarm families are not going to be able to farm next spring. I am not \nwilling to accept that result. It is not a fair result. Family farmers \nare not getting their share of this country's national income. They \nshould be expected to get a decent share of that.\n  Let me show you what family farms face. They are told that they \nshould just go ahead and operate in the free market and whatever \nhappens, happens. What is that free market about? Everywhere they look, \nthey confront near monopolies, or at least enormous concentrations of \neconomic power. The top four firms in this country control 62 percent \nof flour milling. The top four firms in dry corn milling control 57 \npercent. In wet corn milling, the top four control 76 percent. In \nsoybean crushing, the top four have 76 percent.\n  If a farmer happens to produce livestock and he markets that cow, he \nfinds that 87 percent of the beef slaughter is controlled by the top \nfour firms. The top four control 73 percent of sheep slaughter. It is \n60 percent for pork. Or, if farmers want to haul their grain to market \non a railroad--and most of them have to--they stick it on a rail car \nsomewhere in my State, and they get double charged at least because \nthere is no competition.\n  I have mentioned this before and I will say it again. If you put a \ncarload of wheat on the rail track in Bismarck and haul it to \nMinneapolis, they charge you $2,300. If you put it on a car in \nMinneapolis, and haul it to Chicago, which is about the same distance, \nit costs you $1,000. Why do we get double charged? Because there is no \nrail competition in North Dakota, while there are multiple lines \nbetween Minneapolis and Chicago.\n  So it is not just concentration among processors. It is also the \ntransportation components of the grain trade that are highly \nconcentrated. This isn't a circumstance where there is a free market. \nYet farmers are told to operate in the free market. If prices collapse, \nthey are told tough luck, and we will give you 13 cents. If they can't \nmake it with that, tougher luck.\n  Those want to pass this bill also contemplate tax cuts that they say \nwill help farmers. Tax cuts don't help people without income. The \nproblem in\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\nfarm country is lack of income. The first thing we should do is to \nrestore income.\n  I happen to support most of those tax proposals that I have heard \nabout. In fact, some that the Senator from Mississippi described today \nhave great merit. I support fully deductible health insurance for sole \nproprietorships and income averaging. I can go down a whole list of \nproposals that I support. My point is that first we need to restore \nincome to these family farmers. They need to get a fair share of this \nNation's income.\n  The fact is that everybody who touches products produced by these \nfarmers is virtually making record profits. The railroads? You bet your \nlife they are doing fine. They haul the farmers' products. How about \nthe slaughterhouses? Are they doing fine? You bet they have solid \nprofits. They are the ones who slaughter the livestock that is sent to \nmarket by those farmers.\n  How about the cereal manufacturers who put the snap, crackle and pop \ninto a cereal. They take a kernel of wheat, put it in a plant some \nplace, put it in a bright-colored box, ship it to a grocery store, and \nsell it at $4 a box. The company that puts the puff in puffed wheat \nmakes far more than the person who gassed the tractor, planted the \nseed, and harvested that wheat. In fact, the person that harvested the \nwheat that they planted is going broke. And the people who are puffing \nit, crackling it, and snapping it are having record profits.\n  I don't understand the notion that somehow, if we just do nothing, \nthings will work out. When we look at all of the evidence here, we are \ngoing to lose tens and tens of thousands of family farmers across this \ncountry unless this Congress does what it needs to do now. We need to \nprovide some decent price supports to get farmers across this price \nvalley.\n  I am not standing here asking that we tip the current farm program \nupside down. I didn't vote for the current farm program. I am not going \nto stand here and provide a litany of why I think it is not a good \nprogram. I am not suggesting we tip it upside down. I am simply saying \nwhat this farm program did in the big print it took away in the small \nprint. This farm program, passed by this Congress, said we would \nprovide farmers 85 percent of the five-year Olympic average price as a \nprice support in the form of a loan rate. That is what it said in the \nbig print. In the small print it said that the 85 percent of the five-\nyear Olympic average price would be capped. The small print says we \nwill put an artificial cap on it to bring the loan rates way down.\n  All we are saying is that we should take the artificial cap off. Do \nwhat the big print said the farm bill will do. Get rid of the small \nprint that took away that help to the family farmers.\n  In North Dakota it means a $156 million difference just on the price \nsupport mechanism. The difference for the farmers in my State alone is \n$156 million. That could well mean the difference between making it and \nnot making it. It can mean the difference between succeeding and \nfailing.\n  A young fellow wrote to me recently. I have referred to his letter \npreviously in the last couple of days. His name is Wyatt. He is a \nsophomore in high school at Stanley, ND. He wrote this plaintive cry \nfor help on behalf of his family farm. He is a young boy who loves to \nfarm. He knows his dad and mom do as well. He wrote me a letter that \nsays, ``My dad can feed 180 people. And he can't feed his family.'' He \nwas describing a circumstance where his family's income has been washed \nout. Their family farm may not be able to make it and he wonders \nwhether that is fair, and whether that is good economic policy for this \ncountry. The answer clearly is no, that is not fair. And clearly it is \nnot good economic policy for our country.\n  Both the independent community bankers in my State and the North \nDakota Bankers Association tell me that if we don't pass some \nmeaningful assistance this year these farmers won't be in the field \nnext spring. That is from the lenders.\n\n  This weekend, I was reading some of President Truman's speeches in \n1948. I want to read a couple of pieces from President Truman in 1948. \nOld Harry was doing a whistle stop tour on a train back then. I like \nHarry Truman. Harry spoke plainly and never minced any words. I thought \nmaybe we would celebrate just a bit of what Harry Truman said about \nfamily farmers and what this debate is about today.\n  Harry Truman said at the National Plowing Match in Dexter, IA, \nSeptember 18, 1948:\n\n       [I] believe that farmers are entitled to share equally with \n     others in our national income. [I] believe a prosperous and \n     productive agriculture is essential to [this country's] \n     national welfare.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Those who are wilfully trying to discredit the price \n     support program for farmers don't want the farmers to be \n     prosperous. They believe in low prices for farmers, cheap \n     wages for labor, and high profits for big corporations.\n\n  And then he said:\n\n       The big money [interests look] on agriculture and labor as \n     merely an expense item in a business venture. [They try] to \n     push their share of the national income down as low as \n     possible and increase [their] own profits. And [they] look \n     upon the Government as a tool to accomplish this purpose.\n\n  That was 1948, 50 years ago. Isn't it interesting that as we stand \nhere debating agriculture, in North Dakota there are probably 12,000 to \n14,000 citizens who will not get into the fields next spring unless \nthis Congress does the right thing. At least 3,500 farms will go belly \nup. That is 12,000 to 14,000 people, who will lose their livelihood \nunless we do the right thing. Yet, surrounding those farmers are the \nbigger economic interests that are all making money. There are the \nrailroads, slaughterhouses, grain trader, cereal manufacturers, grocery \nmanufacturers, and you can name all the others that are all making \nrecord profits.\n  Does that say something about whether the system is fair? And you \nmight say, well, what business is it of ours? The business for this \ncountry is that if we do not act, we will not have people living in the \ncountry. We will not have people living out on the land. We won't have \nyard lights illuminating those family farms. We won't have the \nJeffersonian notion of broad-based economic democracy in America if we \ndon't start caring a bit about whether we have family farmers in our \nfuture.\n  Instead, we will end up having big agribusiness in control in rural \nAmerica from California to Maine. When they do that, the price of food \nwill go way up, and then they will have cornered everything. I guess \nthey can haul it, process it, slaughter it, and make money off of that \nand then finally they can grow it because they got rid of mom and pop \non the family farm. You ask them, would that be good for the country? I \ndon't think so.\n  So this issue is very simple. Is what the conference committee \nbrought to the Senate floor enough? The answer is clearly no. It is not \nnearly good enough. Do we have the resources in this country to do \nbetter and do what we should? The answer is yes, clearly yes. For those \nwho believe in this as a priority, there are clearly enough resources \nto make the difference. I hope that if the Congress falls short, the \nPresident will veto the legislation as he indicated earlier. He should \nsend it back and say let us do better. We can do better and work \ntogether.\n  We must understand that there are two components, one of which is a \ndisaster component. For that portion I commend the Senator from \nMississippi and the entire conference. But the second portion is the \nprice support component. These two components added together must be \nenough to give farmers some hope and some opportunity. This bill falls \nfar short of that.\n  As I mentioned in my opening statement, it is not the case that \nsomehow the proposal to increase the price supports that are available \nto family farmers has just emerged from some mysterious corner of \npolicy making. That is not the case at all. We have already had two \nvotes in the Senate on this issue of raising price supports. We have \nlost by a handful of votes both times, and we may lose again. But, I \nwill be here through the last breath of legislative effort to see that \nthis Congress is persuaded to do the right thing for these family \nfarmers.\n  These 3,500 farm families deserve a chance. They didn't cause the \nAsian financial crisis. They didn't cause the crisis in Asia which \nmeans that this country can export fewer agricultural goods to Asia. \nFamily farmers didn't cause crop disease. Family farmers didn't cause \nthe collapse of grain\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\nprices. Family farmers didn't cause the incessant wet cycle in our part \nof the country that has helped exacerbate crop disease. Family farmers \ndidn't cause these problems. And this Congress should not say to family \nfarmers, ``Well, you deal with it. And if you can't, you don't \nmatter.''\n  This Congress ought to extend a helping hand to say to family \nfarmers, ``We want to help you over this trouble spot. We want to help \nyou survive because you are important to this country.''\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, first of all, I would like to start out thanking my \ncolleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. Above and beyond his \nability as Senator, I think probably the best thing about him is his \ncivility, and I wish I wasn't in profound disagreement with my \ncolleague, but I am. I do wish to thank him for some of the good things \nin this bill. In this appropriations bill, we are talking about farm \nprograms; we are talking about nutrition programs, forestry, and also \nthere is a great deal of research money. In particular, I am very \npleased that we are going to see additional funding for research of the \nscab disease which is a terribly important problem for my State and \ncertainly for North Dakota as well. The faculty at the University of \nMinnesota is doing some very important research in this area.\n  Madam President, I talked to our FSA director, Wally Sparby, and he \nsent me some information that I might just start out with. Mr. Sheldon \nErickson from Roseau, MN at Border State Bank is talking about the \nsituation of bankers: 90 percent of his farmers can't repay in 1998; 25 \npercent he won't be able to lend to in 1999; he says more equity \nlending is required but less is available. Percy Blake of Bremer Bank \nin Crookston, MN: 75 percent of borrowers won't be able to meet their \nobligations in 1998; 50 percent are in jeopardy of not being financed \nin the coming year; he says that regulators are trying to pressure them \naway from equity financing.\n  We have a plea and cry from not just family farmers in our \ncommunities, but from the lenders and small businesses and from the \ncitizens, I say to my colleague from Mississippi.\n  I have here petitions from all over the State of Minnesota. People \nwho signed these petitions did this with some hope. It says:\n\n       We, the people of rural Minnesota, exercising our \n     constitutional right to petition the Government for redress \n     of grievances, hereby state and declare: That the \n     exceptionally low prices being paid for farm commodities in \n     the State of Minnesota constitute a dire threat, a crisis \n     imperiling residents, businesses and institutions of rural \n     communities who are demanding an immediate response from our \n     Federal Government; that without action by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to increase the support prices for corn, \n     soybeans, wheat, small grains, hogs, cattle and dairy \n     products and to extend loans and increase loan rates and to \n     make crop insurance coverage effective, thousands of families \n     relying on farming and rural businesses will lose their \n     livelihoods; that the 1996 Federal farm bill must be revised \n     this year in order to restore an economic safety net for \n     family farmers and allow them to support rural small \n     businesses and community institutions; that these destructive \n     policies must be reversed to ensure healthy main streets, \n     full schools and full churches in rural communities of the \n     State of Minnesota.\n\n  I say to the Chair, I don't know how many signatures there are here, \nbut this is just a sample of the people. Let me show you those who have \nsigned their names to this with the hope that it will make a \ndifference.\n  Madam Chair, the differences between this bill's $4 billion package \nand the $7 billion package that we proposed are ones that make a \ndifference.\n  Part of it has to do with the amount of assistance, but the big issue \nis the price crisis. I am actually not going to speak that long on the \nfloor of the Senate because my colleagues, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska \nand Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, have already spoken about this. \nIn many ways what we are struggling with is not just the wet weather \nand not just the scab disease, but disastrously low prices. It is hard \nto believe that we really want to have such a low cap as that in the \nFreedom to Farm bill--I call it the ``Freedom to Fail'' bill--at a time \nwhen prices are so low.\n  In our proposal we talked about taking the current cap off the loan \nrate. As I hear from people in our communities--not just the farmers \nbut the lenders as well--this is the most direct and dramatic way that \nwe can get some income to these families. We would raise the loan rate \nabout 57 cents a bushel for wheat, about 27 cents a bushel for corn, \nand over 20 cents a bushel for soybeans. That would be what would \nhappen if we would lift the cap.\n  What was not anticipated--I think my colleague from Mississippi would \nagree with me on this point--when the Freedom to Farm bill, or \n``Freedom to Fail'' bill, was passed, was that the prices would \nplummet. I do not think Senators realized that, although I think \nfarmers have always known that prices go up and down. What happened is \nwe basically eliminated the leverage the farmers have in the \nmarketplace --where the loan rate helps them in their dealing with \ngrain companies. In addition there was a safety net that was extremely \nimportant. At least it provided some direct assistance to people. We \nhave eliminated that.\n  I say to my colleagues today, I appreciate their work, but this \nrelief package will not do the job. It is impossible for me as a \nSenator to come out here and speak for it or to vote for it. It is very \nimportant that the President veto this. The President said he will. It \nis important that we get back to negotiations and work out a package \ntogether. It has to be a bipartisan package.\n  Just in terms of corn growers who currently are receiving $1.50 a \nbushel for corn or less, they cannot cash flow on that. The same is \ngoing on with our wheat farmers--low prices.\n  I think surely we will hear from Senator Feingold from Wisconsin. \nSenator Kohl actually has just come out on the floor. Our dairy farmers \nin the upper Midwest have been going under. We have a federal milk \nmarketing order system that is absolutely discriminatory, and there is \na legislative rider in this appropriations bill which effectively \nextends that discrimination another half a year. That is completely \nunsatisfactory, at the very time the Secretary of Agriculture has put a \nprocess into effect to examine and reform this system. That reform \nprocess is not enough for many of us, but we appreciate it as a \npositive step, moving forward. Now that reform process will be \npostponed for an additional 6 months under the provision of this \nlegislative rider, which in addition has the effect of extending for 6 \nmonths the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, another policy which has \na discriminatory effect upon dairy producers and the dairy industry of \nthe upper Midwest.\n  So, as a Senator from Minnesota, I cannot in good conscience support \nan appropriations bill that will not provide the needed assistance to \nfamily farmers in rural communities in my State. It would amount to \nbetrayal. People are in desperate shape. That is the ``why'' of all \nthese petitions. That is the ``why'' of all the meetings I have \nattended: in Crookston, East Grand Forks, Granite Falls, Fulda, \nWorthington. That is the ``why'' of grown men and women crying because \nthey are being driven off their farms. They work there, they live \nthere, it is everything that they have ever worked for.\n  Nobody can say we are talking about a group of citizens who do not \nwork hard, but this just seems beyond their control. Now we have an \nappropriations bill that does not deal with the price crisis, that does \nnot get enough relief out there, that is not going to enable these \npeople to stay on the farms. It does not do the job.\n  I think family farmers in rural America know that. We have to do \nbetter. Senator Cochran has done all that he can do. I think he has \npushed hard for what he thinks is right. But some of the rest of us \nhave to come out here and we have to fight hard for what we think is \nright. The President has to stay strong, and he has said he will veto \nthis bill. We need to go back to the table and put negotiations on a \nfast-track to get a farm crisis relief package that will do the job.\n  For my State, the differences between the two packages amount to a \nquarter of a billion dollars. That is $250 million more for family \nfarmers and small businesses in rural communities. This is a decisive \nmoment for the State\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nof Minnesota, for agriculture and for family farmers.\n  In many parts of our country we hardly have a family farm structure \nof agriculture any longer, where the people who live on the land make \nthe investments and work on the land. In the Midwest I think we \nunderstand a very sound economic point, which is also, I think, a \nsocial message: the health and vitality of our communities are not \nbased upon the number of acres that are farmed or the number of animals \nthat are owned. Somebody will always farm that land or own that land. \nThe question is, Are we going to have family farmers? The health and \nvitality of our communities are based upon the number of farmers--I say \nto the Senator from Wisconsin--the number of family dairy farmers.\n  We have a crisis, and that crisis deserves a strong and effective \nresponse from the U.S. Congress. This appropriations bill--and I say \nthis not in a shrill way but in a very determined way--is not an \nadequate response to that crisis.\n  Therefore, I will vote against it. I call on the President to veto \nit. And I call on my colleagues please to work together and do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to discuss the conference report \nthat is before us as well. I want to start by acknowledging the efforts \nof the chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran. Senator Cochran, I \nthink, is really one of the most decent Members in this Chamber. He is \nsomebody I respect, somebody I like, somebody who has made a real \ncontribution in the Agriculture Committee in previous years as well as \nbeing chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee. So I \nacknowledge right up front he is someone, I think, who has the best \ninterests of American agriculture at heart.\n  But he is not the only one to make the decisions. He has to make the \ndecision, not only in the Senate Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, but in a conference committee. It is a conference between \nthe Senate and the House. And what has been brought back to this \nChamber is inadequate.\n  I represent North Dakota. North Dakota has been absolutely devastated \nby what I call the triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather and bad \npolicy. That triple whammy has washed away farm income.\n  This chart shows the Government's own figures. From 1996 to 1997, we \nsaw a 98-percent drop in farm income in the State of North Dakota. That \nis a crisis by any definition. It is a combination of terrible prices--\nwe have the lowest prices in 50 years--coupled with natural disasters--\nwe have had an outbreak of scab and other fungi because of continuing \noverly wet conditions--and then we have, on top of it, bad policy.\n  The last farm bill, I don't know how else to say it, is bad policy. \nIt is its own disaster, because, in previous times, if prices would \nhave collapsed, there would have been an automatic adjustment \nmechanism. That automatic adjustment mechanism has been taken away, and \nthe result is now, when prices collapse and you have a natural \ndisaster, there is not much there. The result is literally thousands of \nfarmers in our State being forced off the land.\n  When the Secretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota, his crisis \nresponse team told him over the next 2 years we could lose 30 percent \nof the farmers in North Dakota--30 percent. That would change the face \nof our State forever.\n  We have no choice but to fight. We have no choice but to come out and \nplead with our colleagues to do better and to do more, because if we \nfail, there will be dire consequences, not only in our State, but in \nother farm-belt States as well.\n  It is not just conditions in North Dakota, although we have had the \nworst conditions. The price collapse is affecting everybody in the farm \nbelt. This chart shows what has happened to spring wheat prices over a \nvery extended period. This shows what has happened to prices from 1946 \nto 1998, 52 years of prices. You can see we are at an all-time low. In \n52 years, this is the lowest they have ever been, adjusted for \ninflation. This is it. At no time in 52 years have prices been lower \nthan they are today.\n  It is not just spring wheat prices. We lead the Nation in production \nof spring wheat, or at least in many years we do. Barley is also a \nmajor crop in North Dakota. Again, 52 years of history, and here we are \ntoday, the lowest prices in 52 years. When I talk about the triple \nwhammy of bad prices, bad weather and bad policy, the bad prices are \nabundantly clear. We have the worst prices in 52 years.\n  We have looked at spring wheat. We looked at barley. This chart shows \ndurum prices. Does it look familiar? It is exactly the same pattern, \nthe lowest prices in 52 years. You can look back on the whole period of \n52 years, and prices have never been lower.\n  When we then look at what our colleagues have brought before us from \nthe conference committee, we can see that the Republican plan does not \nmeasure up. The Democratic plan is $7.5 billion. Some estimates are as \nhigh as $7.8 billion. The Republican plan is $4.1 billion.\n  I must say to you, Madam President, and say to my colleagues, \nhonestly, even the Democratic plan will not solve this problem. If you \ngo back to 1986, the Federal Government spent $26 billion because we \nwere faced with a similar farm economy.\n  We are not going to be anywhere close to that. We will be less than \nhalf of that level of funding this year, even if the Democratic plan \npasses. Make no mistake, the Democratic plan does not solve the \nproblem, but what our Republican colleagues are offering is totally \ninadequate. It is not going to stem the tide. It is not going to \nprevent literally thousands of family farmers from being forced off the \nland.\n  I just had a series of meetings all across my State, and every town I \ngo to, there are large meetings of farmers. It is very interesting \nbecause usually when I hold meetings like this, it is just farmers. Not \nthis year. Now it is Main Street businesspeople. The mayors and city \ncouncilmen in the cities and the bankers are all coming to these \nmeetings, many of whom have never attended a farm meeting in my 12 \nyears in the U.S. Senate, stopping me afterwards and saying, ``Senator, \nthere's something radically, radically wrong, and unless something is \ndone and done quickly, not only is that farmer going to fail, but the \nMain Street businesses are going to fail and the towns themselves are \ngoing to fail.''\n  For the first time ever in my experience, mayors and city councilmen \nare coming to my meetings and telling me that the cities are going to \nfail unless something dramatic is done and done quickly.\n  If we look at the constituent elements of the plan, the first part \ninvolves support on the income side. The Democrats call for removing \nthe marketing loan rate caps. The Republicans call for increased \ntransition payments. There is a dramatic difference here. The \nDemocratic plan costs over $5 billion; the Republican plan, less than \none-third of that.\n  The difference here is the Democratic plan says that the loan rate \ncaps that were put in the last farm bill at a very low level, \nartificially low level, especially on the commodities that we produce \nin our part of the country, leave farmers in a circumstance in which if \nprices collapse, they have no protection.\n  Some have said, ``Gee, you're going to give a loan to farmers who \nhave an income problem? Isn't that just digging the hole deeper?'' Let \nme explain for those who may be listening that a marketing loan in \nagriculture is not like a normal loan.\n  A marketing loan in agriculture works this way: A farmer gets a \nloan--and in the farm bill, on wheat it is $2.58, but if the price goes \nbelow that, if the farmer sells for not $2.58 but sells for $2, he \ndoesn't have to pay back the difference between the market price and \nthe loan rate. That is why it is called a marketing loan. He only pays \nall of it back if prices exceed the amount of the loan level. This \ndoesn't build debt. This is a floor under income. It is to guard \nagainst the kind of price collapse that we have occurring now.\n  Unfortunately, in the new farm bill, the loan rates were capped at an \nartificially low level. They did that because of a budget \nconsideration. That is why these loan levels were set at such low \nrates, because, frankly, agriculture was cut dramatically at the same \ntime the\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nnew farm bill was put in place. In fact, much of the problem that we \nare experiencing with the new farm bill is not the specifics of the \nfarm bill as much as the budget limitation that we were under when the \nfarm bill was written.\n  In fact, the support for agriculture was cut in half at the time the \nlast farm bill was written. In the previous 5 years, we had been \ngetting about $10 billion a year to support agriculture. Under the new \nbudget agreement, that was cut in half, to about $5 billion a year. \nThat is one reason we are in such desperate shape, because our major \ncompetitors, the Europeans, are spending almost $50 billion a year, 10 \ntimes as much as we are to support our producers. It is not too hard to \nunderstand that the Europeans are on the move, they are on the march, \nthey are gaining market share because they are doing it the old-\nfashioned way: They are buying these markets.\n  Madam President, one thing we have to ask ourselves is do we want to \nroll over, do we want to play dead, do we want to fly the white flag of \nsurrender when our major competitors are spending 10 times as much as \nwe are to support their producers?\n  I said at the time I thought it represented unilateral disarmament, \nthat the United States was making a profound mistake, because the \nEuropeans have a strategy and they have a plan. And, oh, how well that \nstrategy and plan are working. Their strategy and their plan is to \ndominate world agricultural trade.\n  If you look at the trend lines in agriculture, you can see that their \nstrategy and their plan are working very well. They have gone from \nbeing major importers to being major exporters in just 10 years. In the \nUnited States we are going backwards. If you look at our world \nposition, it is slipping. And it is slipping in part because we are not \nin this fight. We have ceded it to our competitors.\n  Why do they have a different view? In part, because they have been \nhungry twice in Europe. They do not intend to be hungry again. But more \nthan that, they have decided it makes sense to have people out across \nthe land. They do not want everybody forced into the cities. And we \nhave to make a decision in this country. Do we want everybody to go to \nthe cities? Because if that is what we want, we are on schedule. We are \nright on track because that is what is going to happen. We are going to \nsee the people from the farms move into the cities because you cannot \nmake a living on the farm.\n  So the first part of the difference between these two plans is on the \nincome side of the house. The Democrats have a plan of over $5 billion \nof assistance. The Republicans are offering $1.6 billion.\n  If you look at the specifics between the two, you again see that the \nRepublican plan just does not measure up. The Democratic plan on wheat \nwould provide 57 cents a bushel.\n  When prices are at the lowest they have ever been--prices in my State \nare down to $2.50 a bushel on wheat. That is the least they have ever \nbeen, at least in the 52 years we have looked at putting these records \ntogether--the lowest prices in 52 years. The Democrats have a rescue \nplan of 57 cents a bushel. The Republican plan would provide 13 cents a \nbushel on wheat. And 13 cents a bushel is not going to pay many bills, \nvery frankly.\n  When I tell the farmers back home that the Republican plan would \nprovide 13 cents a bushel, the reaction is a combination of \nmystification, anger, and disbelief. They cannot believe in this \ncircumstance that the best we can do is 13 cents a bushel.\n  On barley, the Democratic plan is 23 cents; in the Republican plan it \nis 6 cents a bushel.\n  On corn, the Democratic plan is 28 cents a bushel; the Republican \nplan one-quarter of that, 7 cents a bushel.\n  And on soybeans, the Democratic plan is 28 cents a bushel; the \nRepublican plan is 2 cents.\n  Madam President, that is the income side of this proposal to deal \nwith the crisis.\n  On the indemnity relief plan, that part of the plan that is designed \nto deal with the natural disasters that are occurring around the \ncountry, the Democratic plan is $2.48 billion of money that would go \nout to farmers; the Republican plan, $2.43 billion. And you can see the \ndifferences in the two plans.\n  The Democratic plan has $935 million for multiyear loss indemnity; \n$960 million for the 1998 loss indemnity--that would go primarily to \nthe South, the second part there, because those are folks that have \njust suffered losses in 1998. In our part of the country, we have \nmultiple-year losses--3, 4, or 5 bad years in a row because of natural \ndisasters.\n  The third element of the Democratic plan is for noninsurable, \nuninsured crops, $250 million. There is a fourth element, $50 million \nfor flood compensation. These are for folks who do not qualify for \nanything. Their land is under water. And we have people in North \nDakota, northeastern North Dakota whose land has been under water now \nfor 5 years. They have no income --none. The Republican plan is silent \nwith respect to those people. They get nothing. They have been getting \nnothing; they continue to get nothing. I guess there is at least a \nconsistency to that--nothing; that is what they get.\n  Those people--I just talked to one fellow who has put in everything \nhe has. He had an insurance settlement--put that in--and his lifetime \nsavings. This fellow used to be a world champion bull rider. He put all \nhis lifetime winnings in. Every single thing his family had he has put \ninto the pot. He is a remarkable, remarkable man. Five years in a row \nhe sees more and more of his land going under water, and his response \nis really remarkable. He is just hopeful that something good is going \nto happen. He is just happy to be alive. But he is really counting on \nus to do something. The Republican plan does nothing.\n  Emergency livestock assistance, there is $200 million in the \nDemocratic plan. There is $31 million for farm operating loans. There \nis $40 million for an FSA increased workload; $10 million for U.S. \nForest Service assistance; $10 million for tree assistance--for a total \nof $2.48 billion. You can see the comparable elements to the Republican \nplan, which is roughly equivalent.\n  Madam President, another way to look at this is to look at individual \nfarmers. What happens in these different plans? So we took three \nexamples from North Dakota and looked at individual producers with \nindividual situations and compared what the two plans would provide the \nindividual farmer.\n  Chart A relates to our first producer. We are not using names here \nbecause we thought it would be more appropriate to label them A, B and \nC. This chart represents a typical North Dakota producer who farms 500 \nacres of wheat, 300 acres of barley and is suffering only from low \nprices. He has not been affected by the bad weather. And we look at \nwhat he would receive under the Democratic plan, which is $12,630. In \nthe Republican plan it is about one-quarter of that. This is a \ncircumstance in which somebody has not been affected by bad weather, \njust the very low prices.\n  Producer B represents a circumstance that shows a typical North \nDakota producer, what they can expect to receive from suffering not \nonly low prices, but also has repeated years of crop loss due to \nnatural disasters, such things as flooding or the crop disease scab. So \nthis is producer B who is suffering from low prices and from natural \ndisaster. And under the Democratic plan this farmer would get $22,130; \nunder the Republican plan they get $12,686.\n  Producer C is somebody who has really got the triple whammy. This \nproducer is not only affected by low prices, he has also had repeated \nyears of disaster and has flooded land. Under the Democratic plan they \nwould get $28,000 of assistance; under the Republican plan $12,686.\n  Madam President, these are specific examples of what people would \nexperience under the two plans. I say to you that neither one of them \nare going to solve the problem. I mean, that is the truth of the \nmatter. This problem in my State is so deep and so serious that neither \nof these plans is going to solve the problem. In fact, if we do not do \na lot more next year, there are going to be thousands of farmers who \nnever get into the fields because their bankers will not finance them.\n  If you are looking at what we are doing, we are shoring them up to \ntry to get them to next year, trying to allow them to survive the \nwinter. But the\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\nhard reality is--the harsh reality is if we do not do something \ndramatically more this year and next year, those farmers are not going \nto plant because if you look at what the Republican plan does and what \nthe Democratic plan does, it provides money this year.\n  I guess we are all praying that prices increase. I hope that happens. \nI hope that happens. But with the collapse in Asia, I think, frankly--\nthe collapse in Russia as well--it is probably unlikely that prices \nwill increase substantially. And that means when the banker looks at \nthe income statement for a farmer, under the Republican plan what they \nsee is that we have moved forward the AMTA payments. We all agreed to \ndo that. Republicans are providing 13 cents more a bushel this year in \nassistance, but there is nothing for next year. The AMTA payments that \nare supposed to be paid next year have been pulled into this year.\n\n  So when the banker looks at the income payments for the farmer for \nnext year, all he looks at are the price projections for the \ncommodities that are going to be produced on that farm. Bankers are \ntelling me they are not going to be able to extend loans to farmers \nnext year if either one of these packages passes because we are not \ndoing anything about next year. The families are going to their bankers \nin February and March to get operating money for next year.\n  I had blown up a letter I got from a constituent back home that \nexplains it very well. This is from Steve and Stephanie Johnson. \nStephanie wrote the letter from Luverne, ND:\n\n       I am writing in hopes that it will encourage you to quickly \n     push forward the farm assistance program that is in the \n     works.\n\n  She goes on to describe that they are farming near Luverne, ND, they \nhave 90 head of cattle, 13 head of horses. They raise corn, wheat, \nbarley, sunflowers, and canola. She works as an RN outside the home, 24 \nto 40 hours a week, which pays part of their health insurance and most \nof their bills. Her husband works usually 12 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a \nweek, and he works 24 hours a day during calving time in February or \nMarch. He made $12,000 of farm income this year, of which $2,000 and an \nincome tax return of $1,000 went to pay part of the 1997 operating loan \nbalance. So that leaves her husband with $10,000 for the entire year of \n1998. As she points out, that is $833 a month without benefits. That \namounts to $2.30 an hour. That doesn't include the labor that she and \nher son have put into the farm either. She says:\n\n       The really sad part of this is we didn't have to take \n     operating loans in the 12 years my husband has been farming \n     until 4 years ago.\n       The cattle and the horses have helped us break even in the \n     past, but in these last few years we can't even do that.\n\n  She says in capital letters:\n\n       With skyrocketing production costs and plummeting prices it \n     is obvious that you can't quite break even. Something needs \n     to be done quickly.\n\n  Madam President, she goes on to say:\n\n       We are in no way asking for handouts, only fair prices. We \n     have to pay whatever price the retailers put on our products, \n     but we have no way to set our prices on our products.\n\n  She concludes by saying:\n\n       We are not sure if we will farm next year, my husband \n     doesn't want to lose everything he has worked for in the past \n     12 years. Nor do I think either of us can take any more \n     stress. We are losing numerous family farmers in our area, in \n     the past few years, 4 of our neighbors quit or were forced to \n     quit. Isn't it time to do something?\n\n  Madam President, it is time to do something and it is time to do \nsomething that is much more significant than what is in this conference \nreport. The truth is, it is not going to solve this problem. It isn't \neven a Band-Aid on the problem. At least a Band-Aid covers a wound. I \ncan say if this is the best we do, then we are consigning thousands of \nfarmers--thousands of farmers--to the auction block, because that is \nexactly what is going to happen in our State.\n  Finally, to put this in perspective, this chart shows what we are \nspending to support our producers and what the Europeans are spending \nto support theirs. We are spending $5 billion a year; they are spending \nnearly $50 billion a year. If we add $7 billion to that total, we are \nstill being outspent nearly 4-1. I submit that it is pretty hard to win \na fight when the other side is outspending you 4-1, much less the 10-1 \nthat is currently happening.\n  I hope before we are done with this legislative session that we will \ngo back to the drawing boards and substantially strengthen the package \nthat is before the Senate. It is absolutely critically important to the \nState I represent, and I think it is fair to say that there are many \nother States whose farm producers are in much the same shape as the \npeople who are farming in North Dakota. Bedeviled by the triple whammy \nof bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy--not much we can do about \nthe weather; perhaps not much we can do in the short run about prices; \nwe can do something about the policy that is passed on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I implore my colleagues to join with others of us who really want to \nmake certain that farmers have a fighting chance, a chance to get \nthrough this winter, a chance to be out plowing those fields again next \nspring.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the fiscal year 1999 \nAgricultural appropriations conference report. This bill would delay \nreform of the current milk pricing system and extend the life of the \ncontroversial Northeast Dairy Compact. Both policies would cost \nconsumers and hurt dairy farmers in the Midwest.\n  Most of the debate on this bill has rightly been about how we can \nhelp farmers devastated by drought and low crop yields. But just as we \nmust act to help them, we should not act to harm the dairy farmers of \nWisconsin and other Midwestern states.\n  It is not as if there is support for the damaging dairy policies in \nthis bill. Twenty-five Senators have signed a letter opposing extension \nof the current milk pricing system and the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. The Judiciary Committee has requested that no action be taken \nto renew the Compact without their review.\n  And it is by no means certain that the Compact could survive \nscrutiny. The higher prices ordered by the Compact are leading to \nhigher consumer prices and a continued decline in fluid milk \nconsumption. Worse yet, these higher prices are primarily benefiting \nlarge dairy farms. In Vermont the largest 7 percent of farms receive 30 \npercent of the Compact revenues.\n  As for extending the USDA's time to review the milk pricing system, \nthat is unnecessary. By delaying reform, this legislation does exactly \nwhat the authors of the 1996 Farm Bill were trying to prevent. Congress \ndeliberately gave the job of reform to the Secretary of Agriculture so \nit could be done in a more analytical and less political environment. \nOur actions today put the antiquated dairy pricing system back into the \npolitical arena that created it in the first place.\n  To many of you, this may seem to be an arcane debate with little real \nimpact. But in Wisconsin, and through the Midwest region, the current \ninequitable pricing system is destroying family farms--not because they \nare uncompetitive, but because of a system that closes off regional \nmarkets and prices milk based on where it is made, not on its quality \nor its cost. Our actions today punish a traditional and successful \nindustry. We are making the Midwest dairy farmers the victims of \nregional infighting and inside-the beltway politics. That is wrong. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n\n\n                             long park dam\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to raise an issue addressed in the Senate \nreport language regarding the Long Park Dam in Daggett County, Utah. \nDaggett County is the smallest county in Utah, with a population of \njust over 700 people. It is also the home of the Flaming Gorge \nRecreation Area, which is host to over 2 million visitors annually.\n  I appreciate the committee's efforts to provide some assistance in \nrepairing the dam through the water and waste disposal loans and grants \nprogram under RCAP. The city of Manila already has acquired a loan for \na new treatment plant for Long Park Dam water, which has now been put \nin jeopardy because of the structural problems in the Long Park Dam. \nThe city has a very limited capacity to assume more debt to repair the \ndam.\n  Once the repairs on the dam are completed, the city would use as much \nas 50 percent of the water stored in Long\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\nPark Dam. Given the size of the communities involved and the limited \nability to assume new debt, would it be appropriate to remind the \nDepartment of the special circumstances in Daggett County and encourage \nthe Department to consider the community's current financial \nobligations when it reviews the grant application?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from Utah is correct that here are some \nunique circumstances in this situation. I hope the Department will take \ninto consideration the impacts of visitation on the local communities \nand the limited tax base in Daggett County, as well as the current \nfinancial obligations of the communities involved. The Department \nshould be as flexible as possible when considering this application in \norder to provide a safe source of culinary water for the community as \nwell as the visitors to the area.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman for his comments.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport of the conference report on H.R. 4101, which is being discussed \non the floor and has been discussed on the floor by my colleagues from \nthe northern plains.\n  I also rise today to express my serious concerns with President \nClinton's threatened veto of this conference report, the agriculture \nappropriations bill--the bill that contains the spending for all of the \nessential programs that are of great benefit to farmers and ranchers. I \nwant to pay, as my colleagues have, very deserved tribute to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, who down through \nthe years has been a champion on behalf of America's agriculture \nproducers and basically serves as an oversight commissioner in regard \nto the spending we desperately need for research and development for \nour farmers to be competitive. He has done another outstanding job \nunder very, very difficult circumstances, because we are going through \nsome tough times in farm country. So I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, it is not my intent to get partisan in this debate. \nGoodness knows we have enough of that going around in this session. But \nI do think it is time for a little candor. In so doing, I noticed a \nreport from World Perspectives, Inc., which is a publication that comes \nout every day that provides Members of Congress and subscribers very \npertinent information regarding the global marketplace and worldwide \nagriculture. There is a young man that writes for them by the name of \nGregg Doud. Last week, he pretty well summarized, I think, what this \ndebate is all about. He said this:\n\n       On the legislative calendar, Christmas doesn't always come \n     on 25 December. When a sector of the U.S. economy is \n     faltering or votes are up for grabs, it usually means that \n     politicians will come bearing gifts sometime before the \n     November election.\n\n  Now, that is a little harsh. I am not too sure I would buy all of \nthat. He went on to say:\n\n       This year's low commodity prices, world financial \n     difficulties, and serious drought means that both U.S. \n     political parties are currently in a bidding war over how \n     much to spend in farm country.\n\n  Obviously, we are doing that because we think we have severe \nproblems. Those are my words, not his.\n\n       In their minds, the votes will eventually go to the highest \n     bidder. As a result, considerations about an appropriate \n     strategy for U.S. domestic farm policy could end up last on \n     the list of a policymaker's priorities.\n  In other words, if we are going to provide emergency assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers, that is one thing in the short term. But for \ngoodness' sake, let's not turn the firehose on and let it get away and \ndestroy a policy that makes sense over the long term.\n  Then Mr. Doud pointed out the history of these two proposals that had \nbeen discussed on the floor. He said, ``The announcement by \ncongressional Republicans of their package came only 2 days after \nAgriculture Secretary Glickman''--Mr. Glickman of Kansas, my former \ncolleague, and my good friend--``announced that he was reversing his \nstance to be in favor of lifting the cap on the nonrecourse marketing \nloan rate''--that is the basis of the Democrat plan--and then stated, \n``This flip-flop was likely an effort to avoid the appearance of \nconflicting policy positions within the Democratic Party.''\n  He continues, ``Secretary Glickman's announcement was coordinated \nwith an amendment offered by Senator Tom Harkin''--my colleague and \nfriend in Iowa who is the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and long a voice in regard to farm program policy advice and \ncounsel to his Iowa constituents and the Nation as well. But, at any \nrate, that was ``. . . to the Interior Department's appropriations \nbill.''\n  By my count, I think we debated this--I don't know how many hours had \nbeen devoted on the other side, because in the northern plains the \nsituation is much more severe. I don't know if the Senator from \nMississippi has tallied up the hours. There must be 50, 75 or 100 hours \non this side. We have spoken to the issue probably not as much as we \nshould have. But this is an issue that has been debated. As a matter of \nfact, I think we have had five votes. I think this is No. 5 in regard \nto a vote that we are going to have on this issue. So we have done \nquite a bit of debating.\n  I will continue with what I think is a candid assessment, and this is \nin regard to the Democratic plan to raise the commodity marketing loan \nrate.\n  Mr. Doud points out, however: ``It is not well suited to providing \ndisaster relief. How did the Government make a larger loan deficiency \npayment to a farmer who hasn't raised a crop?''\n  That is a good question.\n  ``In addition, this delivery mechanism does not reach livestock \nproducers and other nonprogram commodity producers.''\n  That certainly is a good quote.\n  Then he goes on to mention one thing, and this is sort of an aside. I \nam going to have to skip over here to a point that has been made by \nsome of my good Democrat colleagues, more especially the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, who, to be very candid, has never been too \nsupportive of the current farm bill.\n  The Senator from North Dakota decried the fact that under the new \nfarm bill, Freedom to Farm, in what he describes as the ``Freedom to \nFail'' bill, ``farmers were told to plant fence row to fence row.''\n  As Mr. Doud pointed out, and others of us would like to point out: \n``. . . but WPI thought farmers were told to respond to market signals, \nrather than Federal programs.''\n  Let me point out that in regard to wheat, the farmers made the \ndecision. They made that decision. They responded to the market \nsignals, and we haven't gone fence row to fence row. What happened was \nwe had 11 percent fewer acres planted to wheat under the new farm bill \nthan the old farm bill. That means this fence row to fence row business \nis not accurate.\n  What happened, of course, is the farmer put the seed in the ground, \nand it was better seed. And with better farming practices and precision \nagriculture, we knocked their socks off. We had great yields.\n  In the northern plains, they have all sorts of problems, wheat scab, \nweather, unfair trading practices, across the board, border contagion, \nyou name it, they have had it. Quite frankly, a Federal farm program in \nregard to sugar makes the land prices a little high and raises their \nprice and cost of production. It is high risk up there. Everybody knows \nthat. But not any of these things have anything to do with the farm \nbill.\n  The extra production came that drove the market prices lower--from \nChina, 200 million bushels more in regard to wheat production; the \nEuropean Union was about 300 million bushels more. I don't know of any \nU.S. farm law that can restrict China, or the European Union, or, for \nthat matter, Australia that has a record crop. It is not all in yet. We \ndon't know yet. But the global supply situation has changed \ndramatically.\n  That has nothing to do with the current farm bill. It has everything \nto do with our export strategy in regard to being competitive and using \nall of the tools we would like to have in regard to the \nadministration's conducting an aggressive export policy.\n  As a matter of fact, the president of the Wheat Growers said we have \nto quit taking a knife to a gun fight. We have to really get tough. And \nwe haven't done that. That is one of the problems. So I guess that \nwould be an accurate statement.\n  Let me get back to the article. This is by Mr. Doud, again:\n\n       Is the term ``crisis'' an appropriate way to describe the \n     situation in farm country today?\n\n  I will tell you one thing. If you are a farmer and you can't get a \nloan from\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nyour banker, and the price is about half of what it was several years \nago, it sure is a crisis. It is 100 percent.\n  ``At least one question needs to be answered before deciding how \nserious this situation really is.'' --I am back to Mr. Doud's \ncomments--``Will prices stay at the current (a 10-20-year low) level \ninto next crop year? If so, next year may bring reopened discussions, \nleave no stone unturned, on a major overhaul of U.S. farm policy.''\n  I think that is appropriate.\n  And I will be right in line with the rest of the people who are \nprivileged to represent agriculture States, if, in fact, that is the \ncase.\n  We have the unfair trading practice. We can't get our exports \ncracking. We don't pass the trade legislation that we should pass that \nthe President continues to sort of hunker down in the weeds in regard \nto fast track and other things.\n  Then he went on to say: ``In a Congressional election year, the \ndebate isn't about whether or not money should be allocated to farm \ncountry. It's about the delivery mechanism itself.''\n  Then he lists some information that ``. . . suggests that, even in \nWashington, DC, terms, the amount of Government expenditures in farm \ncountry this year is serious money.''\n  ``The potential direct U.S. Government outlays to U.S. producers are \nas follows:\n  No, it is not the $5.3 billion that showed up on the chart over there \nfrom my colleagues. But, in September 1998, this year, the second half \nof the transition payments will come to farmers.\n  Transition payments, called AMTA payments--that is the Agriculture \nMarketing Transition Assistance payments.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Mississippi raising his head. \nThe reason I wanted to point that out is that it has been ignored in \nthe debate. Hardly any Member on the other side mentions that we even \nhave transition payments. Everybody says, ``The bridge is washed out. I \ncan't swim. My farmers are on the other side.'' That is country western \nmusic. It has the wrong notes. We have the transition payments here. \nThey ignore that.\n  ``In September 1998, the second half of FY 1998 transition . . . \npayment''--by the way, that transition payment is the highest of any \npayment during the entire 6-year period of the farm bill. And I know it \nis the highest as of this year because I helped write the bill. I \nthought at the end of 2 years that we probably would be going through \nsome kind of a price swing. And I thought that assessment should be the \ngreatest in this particular year, and it is. How much? $5.7 billion is \nthe total with the first half having already been paid in December of \n1997, or January of 1998.\n  ``In October 1998, $5.5 billion will be made available in FY 1999 \ntransition . . . payments.''\n  That is next year. Farmers probably wouldn't want to accept that. I \nwouldn't, if I can get by with my lender and I can tighten up, because \nof the world markets and the situation. I probably wouldn't want to \ntake that. But it is available. And that is $5.5 billion.\n  ``Emergency assistance programs that are currently being discussed . \n. .''\n  That is what this debate is all about here. That is in addition to \nthose two transition payments that many of my colleagues are ignoring. \nThat is going to be about $4.1 billion. You add that up.\n  Then our Senate Agriculture Committee chairman, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Dick Lugar, recently put \nthe possible marketing year price tag for the loan deficiency payment.\n  I am not going to get into a description of that payment. As a matter \nof fact, I talked about all of these payments. People wonder. My \ngoodness. How many payments are we making to farmers, and what kind and \nshape and form? But those will be about $2 or $3 billion. And then, \nfinally, crop insurance for the entire marketing year is $2 billion.\n\n  According to Mr. Doud, that totals up to $16.4 billion. That is a lot \nof money. Yes, the farm crisis is very serious. I understand that. But \n$16.4 billion is quite an investment in regard to agriculture.\n  Let me see if I can find a closer here. In regard to Mr. Doud's \narticle:\n\n       Policymakers should not ignore the message this [debate] \n     sends to trading partners and the WTO regarding U.S. domestic \n     farm policy, particularly as it applies to the next round of \n     trade negotiations. Once again, [we want to emphasize] that \n     in an even-numbered election year, the debate isn't about \n     whether or not money should be allocated to farm country. It \n     is about the delivery mechanism and whether or not ``Freedom \n     to Farm'' will be maintained. U.S. agricultural trading \n     partners will be paying [very] close attention to see if \n     ``Freedom to Farm'' survives.\n\n  Now, as the principal author of Freedom to Farm, I have an interest \nin this, but I said it didn't come down from the mountain on any tablet \nsaying this was the only farm bill; if the farm bill didn't work, you \nought to change it. And I think once this emergency assistance is \nprovided, if we can see what happens in 1999--and I hope the global \ncontagion gets better and I hope all the other factors improve--why, \nperhaps we won't have to do this. And if we can enact some of the \npromises we made in conjunction with Freedom to Farm, we shouldn't have \nto do it. But Congress has not done that and the administration has not \ndone that.\n  I want to now return to the threat of a Presidential veto.\n  The President has sent a letter to Congress stating he will not \nsupport legislation that does not include agricultural relief \nprovisions similar to the plan to uncap loan rates as proposed by \nSenators Harkin, Daschle, Wellstone, Kerrey, Conrad, Baucus, and \nJohnson.\n  He, as a matter of fact, took time out in his Saturday radio address \nto talk about two things--well, three; one, we have a serious farm \ncrisis. Right. Second, we need to uncap the loan rates. Wrong, because \nof what it will do that will be counterproductive to long-term policy \nto farmers and ranchers. Three, we ought to pass IMF. Yes. Yes, I am \nfor that. And I am just as unhappy with Members of my own party in the \nother body who oppose that. I think we need IMF. So the President was \nright about two out of three.\n  Let me talk about the plan that is promoted by the northern plains' \nSenators--not trying to pick on them; they have a very legitimate point \nof view--that would uncap the marketing loan rates and provide \napproximately $1 billion in disaster assistance to the northern plains. \nBut the other side of the story is that their proposal provides less \nthan $500 million for the rest of the United States, from New Mexico to \nMaryland, which has experienced drought, flooding, or a combination of \nboth.\n  I really find the President's arguments for his threatened veto \nrather frustrating and difficult because the administration really \nthreatens to veto this package--I am quoting here.\n\n       . . . if the bill presented to the President includes \n     agriculture disaster provisions that provide inadequate \n     indemnity assistance or are inconsistent with the Daschle-\n     Harkin proposal.\n\n  It is obvious the President really believes we need to provide \nassistance to our producers. I believe that as well. Yet he threatens \nto veto a bill that provides $4.1 billion in assistance to our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  And as long as we are mentioning vetoes, he has also threatened to \nveto a House-passed tax bill that also provides very needed relief to \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  As to the two vetoes, one on the emergency assistance and the tax \nbill, let me just list all of the provisions that have been passed by \nthe House of Representatives in its tax bill: 100 percent deductibility \nof health insurance--every farm association I have ever been associated \nwith has passed this in their resolution; permanent extension of income \naveraging for farmers--God bless Conrad Burns, the distinguished \nSenator from Montana, for putting it in originally with a tax bill; an \nimmediate $25,000 expense deduction for small businesses; and an \nadditional net operating loss carryback period.\n  These are steps that, when combined with the $4.1 billion in income \nassistance, would immediately put money in the pockets of farmers and \nranchers and, most importantly, they are positive answers for the long \nterm as opposed to the Democrat plan which I personally think would be \nvery, very counterproductive.\n  On several occasions earlier this year Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman made the comment that trade is the ``safety net'' for \nAmerica's farmers\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\nand ranchers, yet I am concerned that the Secretary and the \nadministration refused to support fast-track legislation when it was \nconsidered in the House. I said they were AWOL during the debate. And \nthey even asked, as I recall, some of my colleagues across the aisle in \nthe other body to vote against the legislation. ``Not this time,'' \n``not the proper time,'' that was the quote, to pass fast track. \nMeanwhile, our foreign markets for agriculture products have collapsed \nand we know that. And, Latin American countries are waiting for fast \ntrack to pass before entering into agricultural trade with the United \nStates.\n  I went with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to Latin America. Every \ncountry we visited asked, ``When are you going to pass fast track? The \nEuropean Union is knocking on our door. And we need this particular \nprovision.''\n  I do not know; I would like to ask the President, if now is not the \nproper time to open up new markets for our producers, when will the \nproper time be?\n  I agree with him on IMF. I do not agree with the decision to hunker \ndown in the weeds with regard to fast track. And I must say the failure \nto pass fast track holds the potential to become one of the most \nserious U.S. agriculture foreign policy blunders since the shattered \nglass embargo policy of the late 1970s and early 1980s. When we \nwithdrew, it may have been a mistake. And when it went down to defeat, \nit was a terrible mistake.\n  Consequently, I should also add that I am not very happy with my \nRepublican colleagues over in the House of Representatives who decided \nnot to vote for fast track. That was a very bad mistake as well.\n  So the President apparently has refused to support these trade and \ntax and income assistance initiatives that I believe will help our \nfarmers and ranchers in both the short and long term, but he continues \nto support a proposal that will provide virtually no assistance to \nproducers who have suffered losses in 1998.\n  We can raise the loan rates as high as we want. As a matter of fact, \nin the six or seven farm bills I have been associated with, there was \nalways the debate, do you use the loan rate as a market clearing device \nor income support? And several farm bills ago we agreed that when you \nraise the loan rate to the degree you really interfere with markets, \nthat is not the proper way to do it. And we used to have deficiency \npayments to assist farmers during the tough times when their markets \nwould decline due to unfair trading practices or some other reason. We \nchanged those to transition payments.\n  What will raising a loan rate do for producers in Oklahoma, Texas, \nLouisiana and Maryland who have lost all or most of their crop to some \nkind of a weather situation? What about the farmer in Louisiana or \nMississippi who lost most of his rice crop due to drought and had his \ncotton crop get hit with 16 inches of rain from a tropical storm \nearlier this year and then was hit by Hurricane Georges in late \nSeptember? That was incredible. These producers are facing a serious \nsituation. They will receive virtually no assistance from higher loan \nrates, and the Harkin-Daschle proposal provides less than $500 million \nfor 1998 losses, but it contains almost $1 billion for multiple year \nlosses in the northern plains. I am not trying to pick on them. But I \nthink it is skewed just a bit. I don't question the problems suffered \nby producers in the northern plains in recent years, nor do I question \nthat prices are low. We have heard time and time again about the \npainful crop losses experienced in the northern plains over the past \nyears, but, ``thank goodness, South Dakotans are expecting a good crop \nthis year--that is a welcome change--after the blizzards and flooding \nof 1996 and 1997, scab disease, and unfair trading practices.'' That \nquote comes from a September 1998 edition of the National Farmer Union \nNews. Thank goodness they do at least have a crop.\n\n  But let me get back to the plan that is within the Ag appropriation \nbill and why I think it is the proper course. The plan to be included \nwill provide $4.1 billion to producers. Of this amount, $1.65 billion, \n29 percent of the transition payments--the infamous transition payments \nthat are ignored and forgotten or somehow have disappeared in the \ndebate on the other side--will be provided to farmers as payments for \nlost export markets caused by world economic pneumonia, the global \ncontagion, the Asian Flu. Not to mention U.S. sanction policies that \nshut out our producers, out of world markets, and the inadequate \nagricultural trade initiatives of this administration--compounded by \nsome in this Congress.\n  Any farmer who received AMTA payments--the transition payments that \ndo not exist, on the other side of the aisle--in 1998 will receive an \nadditional 29 percent of this amount. Those receiving payments will \ninclude southern cotton, wheat, corn and rice farmers who had little or \nno crop to harvest. The Harkin-Daschle plan leaves them empty-handed. \nThe plan in the agriculture appropriations bill includes $1.5 billion \nfor losses and $675 million for multiple year losses.\n  The Daschle-Harkin plan provides approximately $1 billion for the \nnorthern plains, $500 million for the south. Again, I am not trying to \ncriticize problems in the north. But the plan does not do much for any \ngrower suffering losses in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Florida, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland--and the list goes on.\n  Senators from those States, wake up. Here is the real issue that is \nnow being debated. The northern plains Senators, and now the President, \nhave stated repeatedly that we have yanked the rug out from underneath \nthe producer--no safety net.\n  ``Tough luck,'' I think it was described by my good friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from North Dakota. As they have said, there is \nno bridge, nothing. But they fail to mention that the Government has \nprovided approximately $17.5 billion--$17.5 billion in transition \npayments since the inception of the new farm bill in 1996 through 1998. \nIt is estimated the old bill, the old supply/demand bill, the old \ncommand and control bill where the USDA would tell the farmer what seed \nto put in the ground and maybe he would qualify for a subsidy--that \nbill would have provide only around $10 billion during this time. That \nis a difference of $7.5 billion. They are getting more money under the \nnew bill, less money under the old bill, but the new bill is the \nproblem? Hello.\n  It is estimated, as I said, the old bill would have provided only \nabout $10 billion during this time. They forget to mention the \nestimated $4 billion the producers will receive in loan deficiency \npayments in 1998. And, what about the $5.5 billion in advance 1999 \npayments? Again, if I'm a farmer I'd be mighty careful with that. And \nif you add these together and include the additional $4.1 billion \nincluded in the agriculture appropriation bill as put on the floor by \nthe distinguished Senator from Mississippi, total funding provided over \nthe 3-year period is $31 billion. Mr. President $31 billion; that is \nnothing? That is tough luck? That is a bridge that has been washed out, \n$31 billion?\n  Still, the Senators on the other side of the aisle from the northern \nand great plains argue this is not enough. It may well not be, over the \nlong term. I understand that. If things do not improve, with all the \nthings that have gone wrong it may well not be. They say their \nproducers have been forgotten. They even cited this on the floor in a \nCongressional Budget Office table. This is going to get a little tricky \nhere. The table that is called the CBO study showing a side-by-side \ncomparison of the two plans--we have all seen it in regard to this \ndebate. In addition, I think the CBO plan was sent with a letter \nattached to numerous State Governors, certainly trying to gain support \nfor their plan. But there was only one problem with these actions and \nthis CBO study. It is my understanding, and I think I am right, it is \nnot a CBO study. In fact, CBO was not even involved in running these \nnumbers. Rather, they were put together by staff members of the \nappropriate Senators who have proposed the Democratic plan.\n  I don't want to play this business of, ``How much is enough?'' I have \nsaid before, the problem is very serious in the northern plains, and \nfor that matter all over the country, where we have had these \nunprecedented problems in regards to farm country. But I thought \nperhaps we should do some ``truth in\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\nspending'' and take a look at the level of payments the States of North \nDakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa have actually \nreceived under the 1996 farm bill. It may not be enough. But with all \nof this talk about, ``no bridge, tough luck, you are just out of luck, \nwe are not going to support you''--Here we go: North Dakota in 1996, \nNorth Dakota farmers and ranchers received $309.7 million; 1997 $245.1 \nmillion and 1998, $245.2 million. Total, $800 million. That is more \nthan nothing.\n  The yearly State average in Government payments in 1991-1995--the old \nfarm bill which has been defended saying this might be the foundation \nfor the next farm bill, this one is not working--what would have that \nprovided? That average, 1991-1995, $265.4 million.\n  In 1996 through 1998 the average was $266.6 million. In July, the \nHouse Agriculture Committee estimated North Dakota farmers will be \neligible to receive $215.1 million in advanced 1999 payments. Again, I \nam not sure I would take that, but some may have to.\n  The 29 percent bonus payments for 1998 crops will equal approximately \n$71 million. Adding the 1998 payments to the 1998 bonus payments and \nthe advanced 1999 payments together, North Dakota farmers could receive \nup to $531.3 million during the calendar year 1998, this year.\n  South Dakota, 1996, $161.8 million; 1997, $183.1; 1998, $161.3--\ntotal, $506.2 million.\n  The yearly State average in Government payments in 1991-1995 under \nthe old farm bill, $149.7. The 1996 through 1998 average was 168.76 \nmillion--19 million more per year. In July the House Agriculture \nCommittee estimated South Dakota farmers will be eligible to receive \n$160.7 million in advance 1999 payments. The 29 percent bonus payment \nfor 1998 crops will equal approximately $46.7 million. When you add \nthem all up, South Dakota farmers could receive $368.9 million during \ncalendar year 1998.\n  I am going to skip Montana. Nothing personal, I just think we ought \nto shorten it up.\n  Minnesota, the Democratic Senator from Minnesota has been on the \nfloor indicating that times are tough in Minnesota. They are. It is a \ncrisis. He is entitled to say that. In 1996, $261.5 million; 1997, \n$383.8 million; 1998, $322.6 million; total, $968.1 million--almost $1 \nbillion. That is not nothing? Is that a double negative?\n  The yearly State average in Government payments in 1991-1995 under \nthe farm bill--you haven't heard one word on the other side about the \nfailures of the old farm bill and people standing in line waiting on \nthe USDA to issue all the paperwork so they could fill out the \npaperwork to plant less, not at least respond to market signals but so \nthat they might get a subsidy. Not one word. That was $270.2 million.\n  In 1996 through 1998, the average was $322.7 million--over $50 \nmillion more. In July, the House Agriculture Committee estimated \nMinnesota farmers will be able to receive $336.8 million in advanced \n1999 payments. The 29 percent bonus for 1998 crops will equal \napproximately $93.5 million. Add them all up, $753.08 million during \ncalendar year 1998. That is a lot of money. It is, perhaps not enough \nfor the dire situation they face and in absentia of other things that \nwe should be doing. The question is not how much is enough, but the \nclaim, again, by the other side, that we are not providing any \nassistance.\n  Nebraska: 1996, $303.2 million; 1997, $490.082 million; 1998, \napproximately $400 million. Total: $1.193 billion.\n  The yearly State average in government payments in 1991-1995 was \n$349.9 million. That was back under the old farm bill.\n  The 1996 through 1998 average was $397 million; $349 million to $397 \nmillion, about $50 million more. I am not going to go through the \nadvanced payments and the 29-percent bonus. I will add them all.\n  Nebraska farmers, as well as being No. 2 in the Nation in football, \ncould receive up to $830 million during the calendar year 1998.\n  Iowa--Senator Harkin, my good friend on the Ag Committee who has a \nvery honest and sincere difference of opinion about the direction of \nthe farm policy program: 1996, $350.2 million; 1997, $680 million; \n1998, $535 million. Total: $1.566 billion.\n  The yearly State average under the old farm program was about $449 \nmillion; under the new farm program, $522 million. Madam President, \n$522 million is more; $449 million is less.\n  OK. Advanced payments, the bonus payment, add them all up: Iowa \nfarmers could get about $1.288 billion during calendar year 1998.\n  Madam President, I apologize to my colleagues for taking this much \ntime and going over all the figures. The facts are clear. The rug has \nnot been yanked out from producers in the northern plains. In fact, \nthese States have fared quite well under the 1996 act's payments. When \ncompared to the old farm bill--I realize we have extenuating and very \ndire circumstances now--the farmers who need assistance the worst--\nthose without a crop--receive nothing--nothing--from higher loan rates. \nYet, this is the situation many southern farmers will face under the \nproposal that is the alternative to the conference report.\n  I have made some remarks on the floor on several occasions against \nthe loan rate proposal, uncapping loan rates. I don't disagree with my \ncolleagues across the aisle that we need to provide assistance to \nfarmers; that is a given. But history has shown us that their plan will \nnot work, and I believe several myths should be addressed about their \nproposal.\n  Myth No. 1: Higher loan rates will put more money into the pockets of \nall producers and do not lead to excess stocks and lower prices in the \nlong run. It is also argued that higher loan rates will not eventually \nlead us back to Government set-asides.\n  Contrary to these assertions, history has shown us that higher loan \nrates lead to excess stocks, greater production, a long-run depressing \neffect on price, and uncompetitiveness in the world market.\n  In addition, due to the difficulty in predicting budget outlays with \nmarketing loans, it inevitably leads us back to command-and-control \npolicies in an attempt to limit the budget exposure.\n  Again, some in the House and Senate do not feel we should spend $4.1 \nbillion in emergency funding. How are we going to pay for $7 billion? \nAnd, more to the point, if you encourage more Government stocks and a \ntie-up of the transportation system and more production, you are going \nto extend that loan beyond the 15 months and you are going to get into \nmore expenditures. We have been down that road before and farmers \noverwhelmingly tell me they do not want to retrace the journey. I think \nwe should look forward and not backwards.\n  Myth No. 2: There is no safety net.\n  I have gone over the payment numbers. I have mentioned previously \nthat there is a safety net. How can an extra $7.5 billion, at a \nminimum, over the last 3 years, compared to the old program, be hurting \nfarmers and ranchers? I want a safety net that is a trampoline, not a \nhammock. If we go down this loan rate trail, it will be a hammock--we \nwill sag in the middle.\n  On the other hand, if we can get our export policy straightened out, \nour trade policy straightened out, and our tax policy changes and \nregulatory reform, and get cracking, it may well be a trampoline with \nthis assistance we are providing.\n  Myth No. 3: New trade markets will not help us get out of this \nproblem.\n  There are, indeed, some in this body who argue that trade is not the \nanswer to avoiding these problems in the future. How can you discount \nthe importance of trade when we have to export a large proportion of \nour ag products? We must continue to work toward trade agreements and \nsanctions reforms that do not continue to shoot our producers in the \nfoot and lock them out of world markets. And we must encourage \nproducers to maintain the flexibility that allows them to plant \naccording to the demands of the world market. Raising loan rates won't \nachieve these goals.\n  Several weeks ago, Senator Craig--the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, who has been a very aggressive and constant champion of the \nAmerican farmer and rancher and all the commodities and all the \nproducers of those commodities in his great State of Idaho--and I sat \ndown, along with others, in a small group, and we made a list of what \nwe thought would be appropriate to address this farm crisis.\n  We decided on lost market payments and disaster payments. That is in \nthis\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\nbill. We decided on crop insurance reform. Got some. Not enough. Need \nto make it better. First order of priority in the next session. Wish we \ncould have done it this year.\n  We decided on tax relief. I have already mentioned that. It is in the \nHouse bill. The President says he is going to veto it. That will be the \nbest long-term--perhaps not the best--one of the best long-term things \nwe could do for farmers and ranchers in 1999, 2000, and the year \nbeyond.\n  Trade expansion. I have gone over that. Folks, you have to sell it or \nyou are going to smell it, and we are smelling it right now. We need \nfast track and normal trading status with China, we need IMF, and we \nneed sanctions reform. As I said before, we have to quit taking a knife \nto a gunfight.\n  Full enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  The agriculture appropriations bill contains $4.1 billion in payments \nand also protects the sanctity of crop insurance. The bill does not \ninclude the important reforms that are needed, but I am pleased the \nprotections included in the bill, and we are going to work for that \nreform next year.\n  I mentioned tax relief, and Senator Craig, who is on the floor now, \nand I sent a letter to the Secretary requesting full enrollment in the \nCRP program. This is an administrative action. The Secretary doesn't \nneed any congressional action. We don't need to debate this and delay \nit. He can undertake it right now. It will provide an important tool to \naddress the problem of marginally productive land that repeatedly \nsuffers from natural disasters or disease problems, land like the \nnorthern plains. One of the things he can do right away is enroll the \nCRP in that part of the country. He can do it with the stroke of a pen.\n  Madam President, it appears that we will not be able to achieve all \nof the goals that Senator Craig and others of us have proposed in this \nCongress. However, this agriculture appropriations bill, combined with \nthe House tax bill and the trade tools the administration already has \navailable, will provide an important step in addressing the economic \nproblems throughout our rural areas. But the President must be willing \nto step up and work with us, if he is serious about helping our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  Webster's defines a ``statesman'' as one who exercises the political \nleadership at his disposal wisely and without narrow partisanship. I am \nhopeful that we will see the President and my colleagues across the \naisle act as statesmen on this issue and that we will not prevent \nfarmers and ranchers from receiving this much-needed assistance. This \nagriculture appropriations bill is too important--too important--for \nour producers. I urge the President to reconsider his veto threat on \nthis bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report to the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill. This \nlegislation includes much needed economic assistance for Georgia \nfarmers. The disaster and market loss assistance proposal, which totals \nover $4 billion, includes $1.5 billion for one time payment to person \nwith a crop loss in 1998, $675 million for multiple year crop loss and \ncrops impacted by disease, $175 million for livestock feed assistance, \n$1.65 billion for a one time payment to offset financial hardship \ncaused by the loss of markets, and $10 million for tree farmers through \nthe Forestry Incentive Program.\n  I would like to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Cochran, Senator \nLugar, Senator Roberts, and others involved in the crafting of this \nimportant legislation. For months I have been stressing the need for \nCongress to address the current financial crisis facing farmers in \nGeorgia and across the nation. I am pleased that our collective efforts \nbring us here to discuss this legislation. This disaster package is one \nstep in many that is needed to get these farmers back on their feet.\n  Under this proposal the Secretary of Agriculture is given broad \nauthority to define and implement these provisions. I am hopeful that \nwhen deciding how to distribute these funds, the Secretary does not \nforget Georgia farmers. President Clinton and Secretary Glickman should \nnot help farmers in one section of the country by neglecting farmers in \nthe Southeast. Georgia farmers have suffered disasters 2 out of the \nlast 5 years and should be eligible for assistance under the multi-year \nlosses program. In addition, the Secretary should include all crops, \ninsured and uninsured, when considering who should be eligible for \nassistance under this disaster and market assistance proposal. Georgia \nfarmers who produce peaches, onions, blueberries, watermelons, pecans, \nand other speciality crops, have just as much right to be eligible for \nthis disaster assistance as farmers who produce major program crops \nsuch as corn, wheat, and cotton. Those who bought crop insurance should \nnot be unnecessarily penalized and left out of receiving any assistance \nunder this legislation. The current crop insurance program does not \nwork and needs to be completely overhauled by Congress. We need a crop \ninsurance program which is affordable and factors in the cost of \nproduction.\n  Secretary Glickman needs to also look at ways to provide assistance \nfor peanut producers, either through a market loss assistance payment \nor under one of the other disaster assistance programs. The cost of \nproduction for peanuts continues to remain high while income for \nfarmers continues to fall. Disease, weather, government regulations, \ntaxes, increased costs for equipment and supplies, reduction in yields, \nand other problems have all contributed to this situation.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Glickman and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture in making sure these funds are distributed in \na fair and equitable manner.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nagriculture appropriations conference report.\n  This bill includes critical assistance for farmers. It helps all \nfarmers, not just Midwestern grain farmers, and that is why I believe \nthat this is the right bill.\n  I urge President Clinton to withdraw his veto threat and to support \nthis critical disaster relief bill. It is outrageous that the President \nis playing politics with the fate of American farmers. I was astonished \nto see Jacob J. Lew, the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, write that the President's ``senior advisers would recommend \nthat he veto the bill'' unless the House and Senate craft a bill for \nthe Midwest rather than for the whole nation.\n  I find it incredible that the Clinton Administration can oppose a \npackage that includes $4.3 billion for increased AMTA payments, \nweather-related crop damage relief, ``multi-year'' disasters, livestock \nassistance, and assistance for tree farmers. This is about farmers, not \npolitics, and it is time for the White House to put policy first.\n  This is a good bill for North Carolina and for all farmers. I \ncongratulate the Committee for a job well done.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise to express in part my profound \ndisappointment with the contents of the agricultural appropriations \nconference report, recognizing that there are many in this body--in \nparticular, that there are numerous instances, thanks to the leadership \nof the Senator from Mississippi, and others--who have brought together \na sense of bipartisanship on some key issues. And there are other \nissues and other needs that I believe this body needs to address \noutside of this agricultural appropriations bill, as my very good \nfriend and colleague from Kansas has made reference to a string of \nextraneous other issues that are urgent.\n  On the issue of trade, I believe that there is fairly good agreement \nin this body relative to where we need to go next. There is support in \nthis body for funding for the International Monetary Fund. That is \nperhaps the single thing we could do that would have the greatest \nimmediate impact on stabilizing currencies and opening markets and \nstabilizing economies in Asia, and increasingly in Russia and Latin \nAmerica. Unfortunately, that issue has been held up in the other body, \nnot this one; but it is an issue that should be dealt with before we \nadjourn for the year.\n  My colleague raises the issue of fast track. On that issue I share \nhis concern that we ought to have fast-track authority. This body does \nas well. The House does not. I think in all fairness, though, it ought \nto be kept in mind\n\n[[Page S11428]]\n\nthat if we were to pass fast track, that would have a consequence years \ndown the road but not next month, not the next 6 months. It would \nsimply put our trade representative back in at the negotiating table \nfor trade negotiations. That would bear fruit probably years down the \nroad from now, but it would not have an immediate consequence.\n  Certainly, in the case of relief of unilateral sanctions and the \nsanctions reform legislation that our colleague, the chairman of our \nSenate Ag Committee, Senator Lugar, has championed, we ought to be \nmoving forward with that. Unfortunately, we have not. But I think there \nis broad-based bipartisan consensus that we ought to do that. And \ncertainly MFN, now having normal trade relations with China as well, is \nsomething that we should go forward with.\n  I think all these issues are concurred upon by this President and by \nthe majority of both political parties in the Senate. Those are issues \nwe should proceed with. We should not use them, however, as an excuse \nfor a lack of action, for inaction on key disaster issues before us \ntoday.\n  On the tax agenda, as well, I think that there is broad-based support \nin both political parties for tax relief targeted to middle-class and \nworking families, certainly for those in the agricultural sectors of \nour economy. But again in fairness, it ought to be kept in mind that \nthe tax package that arrived in this body from the other body is funded \n100 percent out of the Social Security trust fund surplus. That is \nunacceptable to a great many of us in this body. It is utterly \nunacceptable to the President of the United States who has expressed \nhis veto intent if that were to reach his desk. I think there is a \ngreat likelihood it will reach his desk, but if he were to veto it, he \nwould do the right thing.\n  And we talk about statesmanship, that is what we are talking about--\ndoing the right thing, rejecting what seems on the surface to be \npopular, recognizing that in too many instances the underlying premise \nthat allows that action to go forward is, in fact, simply wrong. \nStealing money, raiding, plundering the Social Security trust fund is \nnot acceptable for any of us. Regardless of how great the crisis might \nbe that we have in agricultural today, how much we would like to have \ntax relief for every sector of our economy, that is not where we need \nto go.\n  To his great credit, Senator Daschle, with the help of numerous \nothers, has put together a tax package which provides most of the same \nkinds of relief that my friend from Kansas was making reference to, but \nis funded exclusively out of efficiencies, out of savings, out of the \nclosure of tax loopholes in the existing Tax Code and budget. So it is \nnot a question of whether we can have tax relief or whether we cannot \nhave tax relief; we can so long as it is carefully targeted, so long as \nit is focused on those areas where it is most in need, and so long as \nit is truly offset by savings, by efficiencies, by loophole closures--\nother places--and not premised on a raid on Social Security.\n  So, again, I think we ought to be able to find bipartisan agreement \nbefore we leave here on those issues as well.\n  I want to say that we did reach some concurrence on some important \nissues in this body. The pain and the hurt that is going on across much \nof rural America today is too great to allow for the kind of finger \npointing and partisanship that too often characterizes the debate in \nthis Congress, especially as we draw near an election as we reach the \nend of this Congress.\n  I am pleased that in this body we were able to find bipartisan \nagreement on my particular amendment that was incorporated in the \nSenate version of the agricultural appropriations bill on meat \nlabeling. The Senator from Idaho was a champion on the meat labeling \nissue. And I was pleased that the chairman, the Senator from \nMississippi, was supportive of our concern in the conference committee \nin that regard.\n\n  I am disappointed in what turned out to be a party-line vote from our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives that thwarted the will of \nthe U.S. Senate in that regard--a measure which has the support of the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Farmers Union, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, and the American Sheep Industry \nAssociation.\n  The underlying bill, which had the sponsorship of eight Republican \nSenators and eight Democratic Senators, along with myself--this was a \nbipartisan effort to, for the first time, allow consumers to know the \norigin of their food products which they serve their families, much as \nthey do virtually every other consumer item that they purchase. Yet \neven this commonsense measure was turned down in the conference \ncommittee, to my great disappointment. And I want to confirm that this \nissue simply will not go away. It will be revisited and revisited until \nit becomes law.\n  We also found bipartisan support on the Senate agricultural \nappropriations bill--again, with the support of the Senator from Idaho, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, and a great many others --in a bipartisan \nfashion, to allow price transparency in the livestock industry to go \nforward, to put our individual livestock producers on the same footing \nas the packing industry to give them a better marketing opportunity. \nAnd yet even that which would have seemed, again, to be common sense we \nlost, unfortunately, on a partisan, party-line vote on the part of the \nHouse conferees, over the objections of the Senate.\n  I want to express my disappointment at the loss of both of those \nprovisions which would not have meant night or day, would not have \nturned around overnight the price crisis that we have in the livestock \nindustry, but we would have contributed, I think, in a very \nconstructive fashion to lay the groundwork for a long-term recovery, \nand it would have been a constructive, positive step in the right \ndirection. We reached some bipartisan agreement, I think, in this body \nearly on, again, on the need for disaster relief.\n  I think we all recognized as time went on, as disasters struck the \nSouth and the West, other parts of the country, that the amount of \nmoney, the $500 million we had placed in the Senate agriculture \nappropriations bill simply was not going to be adequate from anyone's \nperspective, and that needed to be augmented in a significant way. I \nthink the President is right that if we are going to realistically \naddress the real pain all across rural America, that a final level of \ndisaster relief approximating the funding in the President's \nrecommendation rather than in the House proposal and imposed on the \nconference report on ag appropriations is more appropriate.\n  I think we all recognize that there needs to be some give-and-take, \nthat the final version of whatever we do probably will not meet the 100 \npercent satisfaction of any of us here, should not be 100 percent what \nthe Republican leadership in the House was offering, probably will not \nbe completely what the President is offering; but we need to come \ntogether somewhere in the middle in a way which more effectively deals \nwith the disaster that is national in scope and deals with it in a \nmeaningful way, all within the context of, obviously, a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  I believe we can do that, but we need to take, I believe, some of the \ndirection that is coming from the White House to moderate the \nprovisions which have been imposed in the ag appropriations bill by our \nHouse colleagues.\n  This should not turn into a bidding war. It has been suggested that \ncould occur. That would be wrong. That is not where we need to go. But \nwe do need to step back, and with some careful deliberation and some \ncare, evaluate the scope of the relief that needs to be made in order \nto have a meaningful consequence in the context of this national \ndisaster.\n  One area where we were not able to reach bipartisan consensus in this \nbody--and I certainly respect the views of those who differ with me and \nwith many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle--is on the wisdom \nof utilizing a strategy which would take the cap off the existing \nmarketing loan provisions in the freedom to market legislation.\n  Now, it is suggested by some that that is an attack on Freedom to \nFarm, that this is on the part of those who would go back to the old \ndays of the previous farm bill. I think that simply is untrue. That is \na straw man that is easily knocked down but one that does not \ncharacterize the goals and the perspective of those of us who believe \nthat it makes a lot of sense to take the caps off the existing \nmarketing loan. Keep in mind, the current bill has marketing loan \nprovisions in it. It is not a turning inside out of that legislation.\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\n  The problem with the existing legislation, the existing farm bill, is \nthat the loan rates established in that farm bill are unrealistically \nlow. They are too low to be meaningful given the kind of crisis that we \nhave today. And taking the caps off that loan rate and tying it to a 5-\nyear Olympic average is a moderate but responsible step in the right \ndirection. In fact, if we were to do that--and we are talking about \ndoing this for 1 year only, so it would have no consequence whatever on \nplanting decisions made by others because the crops have already been \nplanted and are about to be harvested--it would have a 57-cent-per-\nbushel increase for wheat, 28 cents for corn, 28 cents for beans, if we \nwere to follow the proposal in the President's recommendation.\n  That won't make anyone rich, that won't bring the price back to \nanywhere near where a lot of us think in an ideal world it ought to be, \nbut it will stave off in so many ways the crisis that is upon us. It \nwill give a decent return. It will treat renters more fairly than \nalternative proposals would. It will not turn the clock back. It will \nnot abandon the existing farm bill. It will be done within the context \nof that farm bill and we will preserve the marketing flexibility that I \nthink a great many of us value in that farm legislation.\n  I think there is room for bipartisan concurrence. This is not a \nmatter of one political party rolling the other or stiffing the other \nor coming away 100 percent victorious. I think in good faith everybody \nin this body wants to do what reasonably can be done to create the \nframework whereby family producers can at least survive the current era \nand emerge from the other side with an opportunity for prosperity in \nthe future.\n  If we do nothing and if we take steps that are simply wholly \ninadequate, we are going to see the loss of thousands upon thousands of \nagricultural producers both in the grain and livestock sectors of our \neconomy. The FSA leadership in my State tells us that we could lose as \nmany as a third of the farmers and ranchers in my home State of South \nDakota. That is unacceptable. That has consequences not only for the \nlives of those families, many of whom have been on the land for 100 \nyears or more, going back to homesteading days, but it has consequences \nup and down the main streets of every community as well--not just the \nsmall farm community but the larger communities--as well as the ripple \neffect that takes hold, affecting the medium and large communities. I \nthink this has global consequences. We need to recognize that as we \naddress the situation.\n  I think we ought to avoid the pride of authorship and the temptation \nto subscribe to partisan warfare and find the middle ground. It makes \nmeaningful, constructive, positive relief a ``doable'' sort of thing. I \nam hopeful we can send this conference report back to committee, not to \nemerge with a radically different approach, but to emerge with \nsomething looking more like what the President has recommended, more \nlike what many of us on this side of the aisle would like to see \nhappen. The veto threat is there and people can argue whether it ought \nto be there or not. I believe that the President is correct. I believe \nthat the President is doing the responsible thing and doing the \nstatesmanlike thing under these dire circumstances.\n  In the end, it is going to require both sides coming together. I \nthink that is what our constituents want to see. I think they want to \nsee us during these closing days of this 105th Congress reach that \nconsensus that would allow for some substantially higher level of \ndisaster relief than is currently being posed, utilized in a way that \nmore efficiently gets to the people who need it, which addresses the \nnational nature of the disaster which we face, and which sets a \nframework for prosperity in future years rather than simply being a \nBand-Aid for now.\n  Again, it is my hope that the issue of labeling country of origin on \nmeat products--a compromise version which the Senator from Idaho and I \nsubscribe to and went to great lengths to propose--could be revisited. \nSecondly, it is my hope that price transparency in the livestock \nindustry can be revisited before we leave at the end of this week.\n  Much remains to be done. There is too much to be done to fall victim \nto partisanship and to finger pointing. We need a greater level of \nstatesmanship, a greater level of cooperation than, frankly, has been \nthe case all these past months. We are dealing with the very lives and \nthe very future of thousands of hard-working, honest people in rural \nAmerica who want nothing more than an opportunity to survive the year \nand to live by the sweat of their brow and the hard work of their \nfamilies in years to come.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the Senator \nfrom South Dakota for those kind words. I enjoyed working with him on \nthe meat labeling issue. While the legislation before the Senate \nadvances it only slightly through a study as it relates to the country \nof origin, I do believe in this country the consumers have a right to \nknow. I believe the consumers have a right to understand whether they \nare buying foreign or domestic beef. I think the livestock industry \ndeserves, also, that opportunity.\n  I thank my colleague from South Dakota for his leadership in the \narea. We will continue to work on this. This is an issue that will not \ngo away. I certainly understand the difficulties of those in the retail \nindustry. We can work those differences out. The compromise the Senator \nfrom South Dakota spoke to, that he and I worked on, moved a lot in \nthat direction. I am sorry that they finally, in the end, felt they had \nto gang up on us a bit during the conference, but we will be back and \nthe issue will be resolved.\n  I must also tell you that I support a compromise in livestock \nreporting. I think there must be a transparency in that market for all \nthe world to see. There isn't at this time. We are going to have to \nwork to get to that. I am disappointed that the bill delays the \nimplementation of a Federal milk marketing order reform that I \nsupported.\n  Now, while I have expressed my disappointment, I will stop with that \nbecause those are the areas that I had some concern about. Let me \ndiscuss the positive things that are in this very important bill. \nFirst, I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee of the full Appropriations Committee, the Senator from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, for his leniency, his cooperation, his \nunderstanding, but most importantly, his dedication to the American \nfarmer--whether in his State of Mississippi or whether in my State of \nIdaho--in ensuring that there is fair play in the balance of \nappropriating the Nation's resources, tax dollars, for the purpose of \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I do believe that this agriculture appropriations bill contains \nimportant funding for America's farm families. I am proud of it. I will \nvote for it. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the \nsame. It is an excellent effort on the part of the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Compromise is what we work at. I am disappointed that the President, \nat the last moment, would send a signal of veto. I am amazed that this \nis a President who didn't say agriculture twice in his first campaign, \nbut promised to say it three times in his second campaign. He never \ncame with an agriculture policy, and now, in the last minute, after \nthey discovered there was a farm crisis 3 months ago, he wants to veto \nan effort that has been underway for months to try to not only be \nsensitive to the issues that are down on the farm at this moment, \ncausing great consternation, but would do so by saying, ``let's veto.''\n\n  The reason he says ``let's veto'' is because it is a habitual kind of \nthing for the President to want to fall backward into old policy that \ndidn't work, that bound America's agricultural producers into a \nlockstep Government program offering no flexibility to the marketplace, \nbut more importantly, having to ask the producer to turn to Government \nevery year to decide what they were going to produce and what they were \ngoing to get in return.\n  Now, that is not what the American farmer wanted, and even today, \nwhile those in production agriculture recognize the importance of some \nadjustment, some change in the current program, they are still saying \nleave the new farm bill program in place. Yet, this President is \nthreatening a veto because we will not fall back to the policy of the \nold.\n  What does the bill do that we are talking about here on the floor? \nLet me\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\ntell you what it does and let me tell you what it does for my State of \nIdaho. I will use it as an example. It funds research at America's \ncolleges and universities in agriculture, at a time when agriculture \nand yields were dropping nationwide because we weren't investing in the \nfuture of American agriculture.\n  Well, in my State of Idaho, the bill contains $500,000 for peas and \nlentils research; $500,000 for grass seed research; $500,000 for barley \nresearch; $550,000 for research on canola, a new and important crop in \nour area of Idaho; $1.7 million for research in small fruits; and $1.2 \nmillion for research in potatoes and potato disease, the blight that \ndevastated production in the Idaho potato crops last year. Those are \nall part of a new research initiative the Senator from Mississippi \nworked to assure that we would get funded so we can invest in the \nproductive future of American agriculture. It funds food stamps and \nother nutrition programs.\n  Very little has been said about that today by those on the other \nside. Yet, that is critically important to America's poor and \ndisadvantaged. It funds conservation and environmental programs, and \nsome very good ones. It contains important biodiesel legislation, a new \nprogram for a very important part of a new and emerging market for \nproduction agriculture in the oilseed industry. It contains important \nsanction reform legislation and exempts agricultural products from \nsanctions on India and Pakistan.\n  Why, then, if all of these good things are in there, do we have a \nPresident that threatens a veto? I have to believe it is because they \ndidn't come with a policy; they don't have one today, and they have \nthis habitual problem of wanting to fall back into the past. Freedom to \nFarm is everything about the future and very little about the past. \nThat is where we ought to be.\n  Now, there is a problem in weather-related disasters. There are \ncertainly problems with world markets, as we increasingly tie \nproduction agriculture and its profitability to the world markets. Well \nover 40 percent of everything a farmer in America produces today has to \nsell in the world market, and we have to be sensitive to that. When \nthose markets go south, prices go south. Does that mean the policy is \nbad, or does it mean we have a world economic problem? I think it is \nthe latter. We recognize that and we have pumped billions of dollars \ninto that. It won't go to the trader and it won't go to the exporter; \nit goes right to the bank account of the American farmer--$2.35 billion \nin disaster-related programs, weather-related programs.\n\n  We turn to the Secretary of Agriculture and say: You have the tools, \nyou implement it. We even gave him money to hire more staff to do so--\n$1.65 billion in income assistance directly to the farmer. This \nassistance will help provide America's farmers with economic stability \nthat they need to talk to their banker this fall and to talk to their \nbanker next spring, to get a line of credit to put the seed in the \nground. And the cycle goes on.\n  What does it mean in my State of Idaho? I will break it out for you. \nToday, the price of wheat at the Port of Lewiston, ID, is $2.75. So in \nthe 1998 crop-year, if you add the transition payment of 65 cents, \nanother transition of 45 cents, a loan deficiency payment of 55 cents, \nand the aid package I just talked about of $1.65 billion, that is 19 \ncents--that is $1.85 per bushel, Government assistance, to a $2.78 \nprice at the Port of Lewiston today. That is $4.62 per bushel, and \n$4.62 is, under the current domestic and world market situation, a fair \nif not a good price in Idaho for wheat.\n  Idaho wheat hit the bottom in early September when the price hit \n$2.26 at the Port of Lewiston--although the price was lower further \ninland in my State, which is more dependent upon rail traffic. Today, \nwheat is sold at $2.78; that is up 50 cents from its low. The market \nhas assessed the production, and it is making its adjustments. We are \nhelping stabilize that. That is probably why the bill that I am talking \nabout, the current legislation, is supported by the National Farm \nBureau and a majority of Idaho's farmers. Is it enough? Well, it is \nenough to get by on, especially when Government should not be the sole \nprovider of the well-being of production agriculture. But it should \nunderstand when there is a crisis and respond to the crisis. That is \nwhat we are doing. That response is $1.84 a bushel in assistance.\n  Now, some keep talking about the loan caps. We voted and voted, and \nwe voted once again on that issue. A majority of Congress said leave \nthe loan caps alone. I believe that the farmers don't want current \npolicy changed. And while some would agree that the loan caps ought to \nbe changed, when I talk to my farmers back home and we walk them \nthrough all that this appropriation bill offers, they say: That is \nfair, Senator. That is as much as we could expect you to do, and thank \nyou for doing it.\n  We have worked hard on this bill. The Senator from Kansas explained \nthe coalition that came together before the July 4 break. We met with \nall of the commodity groups and asked, ``What do you need?'' They said, \n``Don't change the policy, but we have to have some transitional \nassistance.'' Times are tough, and we understood that. Many of us went \nhome in August and listened to our farmers and came back with the mind \nof putting a package like this together to offer assistance.\n  The President wasn't listening then and he wasn't focused then. Mr. \nPresident, why did you quit your travels and come back this week and \nsay you are going to veto the bill? I don't understand that. I don't \nunderstand why you have not been focused on this; yet, all of a sudden, \nit is time to veto it. You said, ``I support Senator Harkin's \nprograms''; yet, you offer a supplemental that is billions of dollars \nless. You have taken two positions on the issue and now you have a \nthird. You say, ``I will veto what you send me.'' I don't understand \nthat. I don't think America's farmers understand that very well. \nGovernment isn't the end-all to production agriculture. It should be of \nassistance when assistance is needed. It should care, and it should be \nconcerned, and that is what this bill is reflective of this evening. We \nshould knock down the political barriers and boundaries to enhanced \ntrade. What has this administration done this year? They have not sold \nor given away one kernel of wheat in the name of humanity. Yet, they \nhave hundreds of millions of dollars to buy wheat in the world and move \nit into the world hunger areas. Mr. President, why are you not doing \nthat? Why do you come home from your world travels and political \ntravels and say it is time to veto this effort? I don't understand \nthat, Mr. President. I don't understand it.\n  What we do understand, what Congress understands, and what this bill \nis reflective of is that you don't change policy; you work to adjust \nit. You make it fit the marketplace. When there is a national \nenvironmental or weather-directed disaster, when there is a downturn in \nworld markets, you make adjustments, you care about production \nagriculture, and you darn well make sure the money gets home to the \nbank account of the farmer.\n  That is what this appropriations bill offers. That is why the House \nvoted on it 333 to 53. That is a big bipartisan vote for the House. \nSomehow there has to be some good in this legislation, if it drew that \nkind of a vote in the House. I hope it draws a bipartisan vote here \nwhen we vote on it. It deserves it, because it is reflective of the \nconcerns of the current agricultural situation in our country, and, \nmost importantly, it is reflective of the concern of production \nagriculture when production agriculture says don't change the policy \nover some transition, make sure that you are sensitive to what we are \nconcerned about.\n  But what is important to all of us is that we listen to production \nagriculture. And we know that there are times when a safety net is \nnecessary. This year, as in past years, we have offered one of the \nlargest safety nets in the history of our Government, and we will \ncontinue to do that. But let us not change the policy and drive our \nGovernment into the business of being the partner of production \nagriculture, drive it into the business of not ever determining the \nacreage that should be farmed, or the amount that should be farmed, but \ninto the business of knocking down political barriers, into the \nbusiness of working as a partner in selling in the world markets \ninstead of simply sitting back with hands folded saying, ``Oh, gee, we \nhave an agriculture problem.''\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\n  I think we ought to do something about it. We ought to control \nproduction. We ought to squeeze down on production in the rest of the \nnations of the world, save time to gear up and time to increase our \nacreage. If we are going to pull away, if the United States is going to \npull away from its spot in the world market, we are going to fill it. \nThat is what the policies of the past offered, and we had to fight for \ndecades to gain them back.\n  I hope that in the end, when the rhetoric cools, when the President \ndevelops an understanding of production agriculture--and I give him 24 \nhours to do it--that he will sign the bill, offer up the kind of \nassistance that this bill recognizes is important for our producers, \nand get on with the business of being a cooperating partner with \nproduction agriculture, and not a barrier, or not a hindrance, or not a \nJohnny-come-lately.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Yvonne Byrne and Maureen \nKnightly, members of my staff, be granted floor privileges during the \ndebate of the agriculture appropriations conference report and the vote \nthat is taking place at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I was listening to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho was saying. He raised one question. He \nasked the question, What do farmers want? That is a fair question. But \nthere is an answer.\n  A poll was prepared by Rock Wood Research, a subsidiary of the Farm \nJournal, Inc.--we are all familiar with Farm Journal--for the Nebraska \nWheat Growers Association, the American Corn Growers Association, and \nthe Nebraska Farmers Union. It was a widely disseminated poll. It was \ndone between September 4 and September 10 of this year. And 1,000 \nfarmers, actual producers, were interviewed--500 corn growers and 500 \nwheat growers.\n  There were a number of questions. One of the questions asked was \nwhether Congress should lift loan caps and raise loan rates 59 cents \nper bushel on wheat and 32 cents on corn, and 72.5 percent of the \nfarmers polled said yes, they wanted the loan rates raised; only 19 \npercent said no.\n  So if you are asking the question about what farmers want, I have a \nscientific poll done of 1,000 farmers, a pretty good cross section, and \n72.5 percent said they wanted the loan rates raised.\n  Another question: A farm program should retain planting flexibility, \nincluding farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserves; 85.9 \npercent of the farmers interviewed said they would support that \nproposal. Only 9.9 percent opposed it.\n  Yet the Republicans in this body and in the House would never vote to \ngive farmers a farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserve. We \nhave had that in the past. I, for one, happen to be in favor of \nreinstituting it. But, obviously, the party in power will not \ncountenance that. So when you ask what farmers want, it is here in this \npoll; it is as plain as can be. If we were voting on what farmers \nwanted, we would have lifted the caps from the commodity marketing \nassistance loan rates and we would have a farmer-owned and farmer-\ncontrolled grain reserve.\n  So much for that question.\n  It has also been said that our marketing loan proposals are \nundermining Freedom to Farm. That is not so. What has undermined \nFreedom to Farm is external events, which is weak export demand from \nthe Asian markets, along with the strong dollar, generally favorable \nweather and bumper crops in many areas. Those are the factors that have \nundermined the hoped-for success of Freedom to Farm.\n  Actually, the proposal that we have made would in some ways help \nFreedom to Farm. It is kind of odd that I find myself, who was opposed \nto Freedom to Farm because of its lack of income protection, saying \nthat our proposal probably will help save it more than what is being \ndone in this conference report. But, be that as it may, I still think \nthat, looking at it both in the short and the long term, raising the \ncaps on the marketing loans is the way to go.\n  One other point that I wanted to raise is that I really take issue \nwith any suggestion that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has flip-\nflopped on loan rates. I don't believe that assertion is supported by \nthe facts. Secretary Glickman for some time has talked about the need \nto restore a farm income safety net. In fact, he said that when the \nPresident signed the 1996 farm bill into law. He was not saying that he \nopposed taking the loan rate caps off; he just said there needed to be \na safety net. When a specific proposal to lift the caps on loan rates \nwas made, he endorsed it, as did President Clinton. So I can't see that \nas any kind of a flip-flop.\n  A lot has been said here about generosity and how generous the \nRepublican proposal in the conference report is for farmers, for \ndisaster-related assistance. I divide the conference report in this \nregard into two areas. There is the part that goes for the natural \ndisaster assistance and the part that goes for the income losses \nrelated to commodity prices.\n  On the disaster side, the proposal that we offered in conference \nwould provide $2.486 billion in disaster assistance. The conference \nreport has $2.350 billion. Actually, the proposal that we offered would \nhave been more generous overall to farmers suffering from disasters \nthan the conference report in front of us.\n  Mr. President, having said all of that, I must also say that there \nare many good features in this conference report. I commend the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member for their outstanding work \nunder very difficult constraints to pull this conference report \ntogether. It has a number of provisions important not only to my State \nof Iowa but to the Nation that I am pleased to see included. So there \nare a lot of good things in the bill.\n  But there is one overriding shortcoming in the bill that will, of \ncourse, compel me to oppose the conference report. And that is what we \nhave been speaking about most of the afternoon, those of us who have \nbeen on the floor; that is, what I feel to be the lack of adequate \nassistance to help our farmers--our farm families--deal with the worst \neconomic devastation in over a decade. It is a matter that is simply \ntoo important to let go. I regret that I must urge my colleagues to \nvote against the adoption of the conference report.\n  Again, just to refresh my colleagues about the seriousness of the \ncrisis facing American farm families and rural communities, in July, \nwhen this legislation was last on the Senate floor, 99 Senators voted \nin favor of a resolution recognizing the severity of the crisis that \nconfronts us in agriculture and calling for immediate action. What was \nbad then has become even worse since.\n  Commodity prices have fallen even further. In the period of 11 weeks, \ncorn and soybean prices at Central Illinois Terminal Elevators have \ndeclined 39 cents a bushel for corn and $1.49 a bushel for soybeans. At \nIowa Interior Elevators, prices have fallen by similar amounts to about \n$1.53 a bushel for corn, and about $4.65 a bushel for soybeans. And on \nthe livestock side, hog prices have continued at low levels, remaining \nat or below $30 a hundredweight in southern Iowa markets since early \nSeptember. Country elevator prices are expected to fall even lower as \nthe fall harvest gets fully in swing. Cattle prices remain low. Wheat \nprices have been depressed for a long time and are expected to continue \nso.\n  In addition to the low commodity prices, farmers in several regions \nof the country have suffered devastating losses from damaging weather, \ncrop diseases, and other natural disasters. There has been severe \ndrought in the South, Southwest, Southeast, and now followed by \ndevastating hurricanes.\n  In the northern plains, several years of crop disease have put \nfarmers on the ropes. As a result of all of these forces, farm income \nis falling drastically. It is estimated that this year net farm income \nwill be down by more than $11 billion from last year.\n  That is over a 20-percent drop in farm income in 1 year. Again, this \nloss of income is having a horrendous effect on farm families and their \ncommunities. And there appears to be no relief in the market on the \nhorizon.\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\n  We are all talking about the market. The theory of Freedom to Farm \nsupposedly was that farmers can plant for the market. Well, there is no \nmarket to speak of now. We have too large a quantity of commodities for \nthe market. We have a glut on the market, and our Asian markets and \nother markets are suffering. I don't know when they are going to come \nback. So if the response is that farmers can plant for the market, I \nassume the advice to farmers is not to plant because there is no \nmarket.\n  Well, how can that be when the farmer has his fixed costs. He has \nland. He has his equipment. He has all this money tied up. He has to \nplant. He has to plant his crops to try to make something. In fact, \neconomically, that farmer will try to plant more. He will try to get \nmore out of his fixed asset base to make up for his losses. He will try \nto get more production out of his fixed base to make up for lower \nprices. Therefore, we look again next year for another bumper crop \ncoming on and continued low prices. The Asian economy is not expected \nto turn around quickly, the Russian economy is in the tank, and the \nrelative strength of the U.S. dollar means that other exporting \ncountries can offer more competitive prices than we can.\n  So we are now in what appears to be a prolonged period of low \ncommodity prices. And unless we take some action, action that is truly \neffective, we are headed into another round of farm foreclosures and \nfamilies forced out of business and off the land.\n  A recent Iowa State University study, for example, concluded that 2 \nto 3 straight years of low prices could push as many as a third of Iowa \nfarmers into restructuring or liquidation with disastrous consequences \nfor Iowa's economy.\n  I want also to underscore the broad ramifications of this farm crisis \non the wider economy. Agriculture is the largest industry in my State \nof Iowa, as it is in a number of States. When agriculture is in a \ndownturn in Iowa, the entire State economy feels it.\n  If we consider the drop in corn and soybean prices alone this year, \nleaving aside the precipitous drop in hog prices, Iowa's economy this \nyear is going to take a hit of about $1.4 billion. Chopping that much \nout of Iowa's economy could cost upwards of 26,000 jobs, jobs that we \ncan ill-afford to lose in my State.\n  Again, I want to make it clear exactly what part of the conference \nreport I disagree with--the part dealing with loss of income caused by \nlow commodity prices.\n  Again, I am not opposing that part of the conference report dealing \nwith disaster assistance, although I did point out that what we had in \nour package was a little bit more generous to those farmers hard hit by \nthe disasters than what is in this conference report.\n  We had worked, Senator Daschle and a number of my colleagues and I \nhad worked on an emergency request sent up by the administration. We \nmade some modifications and additions to the administration's request. \nWe came up with what we considered to be a well-balanced bill. The \nemergency package that we put together would have provided about $130 \nmillion more in disaster-related assistance than the provisions now in \nthe conference report.\n  The other essential part of the package, apart from the disaster \nassistance, is to restore some of the farm income safety net. If we \nconsider those two aspects of the emergency package in tandem, then \nevery State in the United States would have come out better under our \nproposal than under what is now in the conference report, and that \nincludes the States hard hit by natural disasters.\n  Let me explain further why what is in this conference report is \ninadequate to deal with the problem of low commodity prices. The \nconference report includes $1.65 billion that would be added to the \nAgriculture Market Transition Act, otherwise known as AMTA, payments \nthat farmers will receive for fiscal 1999. I understand that these \npayments would mean an addition of about 19 cents a bushel for wheat \nand about 11 cents a bushel for corn when considered on the basis of \nprogram payment yield.\n  Keep in mind there are no payments directed for soybeans or oilseeds \nin this conference report even though soybean prices have dropped \ndramatically.\n  Also, keep in mind that actual yields are greater than the program \npayment yields used for calculating the AMTA payments. So if we \nconsider the actual production on farms, the conference report would \nprovide about 13 cents a bushel for wheat and about 7 cents a bushel \nfor corn. Again, no direct assistance for soybeans.\n  These levels of assistance are totally inadequate. In fact, a \nspokesman for one Member of this body said it better than I could. He \nsaid the proposal is a ``slap in the face'' to farmers. Well, it really \nis. I likened it to giving a person dying of thirst a thimbleful of \nwater; it might relieve suffering momentarily but it really doesn't \nsolve the problem of the person dying of thirst.\n  The proposal that Senator Daschle and I along with others put forward \nis different. This proposal, which has been talked about by others this \nafternoon, simply would lift the caps from the commodity marketing \nassistance loan rates. If that was done, our proposal would add about \n57 cents a bushel in added income protection for wheat, compared to 13 \ncents in the conference report, 28 cents a bushel for corn compared to \n7 cents a bushel for corn in the conference report, and about 28 cents \na bushel for soybeans compared to zero for soybeans in the conference \nreport. I might also point out it would provide higher loan rates for \nboth cotton and rice.\n  Our proposal obviously was rejected in conference. That is very \nunfortunate because it goes much further than what is in the conference \nreport toward addressing the devastating loss of farm income due to low \ncommodity prices. Again, if we have low commodity prices caused by a \nglut, bumper crops, combined with the loss of foreign markets we are \ngoing to have to enact some reasonable income protection to help \nfarmers make it through this economic disaster--a disaster not of their \nown making. I know there has been a lot of discussion about fast track \nas though that is the magical solution to everything that is wrong in \nthe farm economy. If only we had fast track, it is suggested, \neverything would be beautiful. Let's be honest and let's be real about \nit. Fast track could help us 5 or 7 years from now, which is how long \nit took to get the Uruguay Round completed. But fast track doesn't help \nus now. Not in any way does it help the farm families who face \nforeclosure in the next few months. I say that as someone who has voted \nfor fast track in the past, who voted for NAFTA and voted for the \nUruguay Round agreement. I defy anyone to come to the floor and tell me \nhow, if fast track were passed right now, it could possibly help \nfarmers who are in dire straits this year and next year. So fast track \nmay have some benefits down the pike, depending on what comes out of \nthe negotiations, but none in the immediate future.\n  Again, I and others who have proposed lifting the caps on marketing \nloan rates have been accused of going beyond the scope of the farm \nbill, of reopening the farm bill. Well, the fact is marketing loan are \nin the farm bill. The bill set a formula for loan rates, but then put \nan arbitrary cap on the loan rates for budgetary reasons. Taking off \nthe caps and letting the formula already in the bill work, as we are \nproposing, is not really reopening the farm bill. We are simply taking \nwhat is in the farm bill, a tool that is in there, and using the tool \nto enhance the farm income protections within the basic structure of \nthe 1996 farm bill--simply by removing the caps. That change, combined \nwith extending the loan period, will help farmers well into next year--\nand next year and the year after if the policy were adopted for the \nlong term as I believe would be desirable. Added AMTA payments will go \nout this year, and that is it. A lot of the new AMTA payments will go \nto farmers who will not be farming next year. A lot of that AMTA \npayment will go to farmers whose landlords will seize the opportunity \nto increase the rent and take it back in rent payments. So basically \nthe AMTA payment is sort of a one-time payment to farmers, but it \nreally is not going to solve the problem.\n  Again, I would like to illustrate the difference between the \nconference report and what the Democratic plan was. For a 650-acre corn \nand soybean farm in Iowa with 390 acres of corn\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\nbase, 260 acres of soybeans, the conference report will provide a \n$4,230 payment to that farmer. The Democratic proposal, in removing the \nmarketing loan caps, would provide increased income protection of \n$18,455 or a difference of $14,225 to the farmer with 390 acres of corn \nand 260 acres of soybeans in Iowa.\n  So again, that is a very substantial difference, and it is a \ndifference that would carry through into next year because of the \nimproved income safety net aspect of the marketing assistance loan. The \nsmall AMTA supplement is a short term one-time payment.\n  So again, I just ask my colleagues from the Corn Belt whether 7 cents \na bushel paid out now, but soon gone, is anywhere near enough to \naddress severe farm income problems. Is 13 cents a bushel enough even \nto begin to address the economic devastation in wheat country? And I \nask my colleagues whether a proposal with no direct support for \nsoybeans is adequate to address the steep decline in soybean prices.\n  So that is really the question today. The question is whether or not \nthose very small cash payments are going to be adequate for the \ntremendous farm income problems that are out there. I do not believe \nso. I do not believe that will help nearly enough--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the hour of 5:30 \nhaving arrived, the clerk is to report the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 10.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I just be \nallowed 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask for 1 \nadditional minute at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from \nIowa before the rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, this conference report needs to be \nrejected and sent back for further work to restore farm income \nprotection by removing the marketing loan rate caps. There are also two \nother areas in which the conference report is not acceptable.\n  I would mention the labeling of beef and lamb for country of origin. \nThe House Republicans rejected this idea. It is too bad, because under \nthe WTO it is allowed, to have country of origin labeling. It is not \njust for our beef and lamb producers in this country. I believe our \nconsumers have the right to know, when they buy a steak or chop or \nother cut of beef or lamb at the meat counter, what its country of \norigin is.\n  Second, we had mandatory price reporting in the Senate bill so \nlivestock producers will have information to help them evaluate packer \nbids for fairness. The conference report converted that bill language \ninto weak report language. We have had study after study after study on \npricing practices in the livestock and meat business and the need for \nmore openness and transparency. It is time we have real action, not \nanother study on that.\n  For those reasons I believe the conference report ought to be \nrejected and sent back for further work. If it is not, then I am afraid \nwe will have a one-time payment to farmers this fall and we will be \nback again here next year with fewer farmers and even more economic \ndevastation in rural America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \n``Suggested Changes in Farm Policy for the 21st Century,'' submitted by \nDr. Neil Harl of Iowa State University, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Suggested Changes in Farm Policy for the 21st Century\n\n\n                    fine tuning ``freedom to farm''\n\n                             (By Neil Harl)\n\n       Farmer-owned storage program for major commodities.\n       Long-term land idling (up to 20 years) in marginal areas \n     (contracts terminate if prices rise above a specified level).\n       Standby authority to implement acreage set aside (if prices \n     remain for a specified period below a designated level).\n       Adequate funding for FSA direct lending and loan guarantees \n     for limited resource borrowers.\n       Continue LDP and marketing loans with slightly higher loan \n     rate (not higher than cost of production on marginal lands).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, under a previous \nunanimous consent request, is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to express my surprise and dismay \nabout what occurred in the conference committee on the agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  During debate on this bill in July, Mr. President, the Senate \naccepted an amendment I offered to waive the statute of limitations for \ndiscrimination complaints filed by many small and minority farmers \nagainst the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This amendment addresses an \nurgent and shameful problem, Mr. President, and we worked with farmers, \nthe White House, the USDA, the Department of Justice, and the \nCongressional Black Caucus to develop language that would protect the \nlegal rights of farmers' and be implementable by USDA.\n  Mr. President, similar language was included in the House bill, but \nit was drafted more quickly and with less consensus. It was more \nnarrowly defined and had less aggressive time limits for USDA to \nresolve discrimination complaints. And it cost $5 million less.\n  And even though Representative Maxine Waters, the chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus lobbied the conferees in support of the \nSenate version of this amendment, Mr. President, the Senate lost on \nalmost all counts.\n  To give my colleagues some background, the investigative unit at \nUSDA's Office of Civil Rights was abolished in 1983. Farmers whose \ncomplaints were pending at the time were led to believe their \ncomplaints were still being investigated, when they were not. Farmers \nwho filed complaints after the abolition of the unit were also led to \nbelieve that their complaints would be processed and investigated, \ndespite the fact that the USDA had no resources with which to conduct \nsuch investigations. The bottom line is that none of these complaints \nwere ever considered--but none of the farmers were told that was the \ncase.\n  When Secretary Glickman learned of this problem, Mr. President, he \ndirected that the complaints be resolved quickly. In fact, I offered an \namendment to last year's appropriations bill to fund the investigative \nunit.\n  But when USDA was finally prepared to enter into settlement \nagreements on some of these cases, Mr. President, the Department of \nJustice stepped in to claim that the statute of limitations for the \ncomplaints--despite USDA's deception in the matter--had expired. The \namendment I offered to this year's appropriations bill eliminates this \nlegal obstacle and allows farmers to pursue their claims of \ndiscrimination. It allows them to have their day in court, so to speak.\n  As we approached conference, however, I learned through staff that \nobjections to accepting the Senate version of this amendment were \nraised based on cost. Our version was scored at $15 million, while the \nHouse version was scored at $10 million. Mr. President, there's no \nquestion the two amendments were slightly different. But the $15 \nmillion in the Senate amendment was to compensate Americans for \ndiscrimination perpetuated by their own government. It was a figure \ndetermined by CBO, conferring with USDA, about which of the pending \ncomplaints would have likely resulted in legitimate and provable cases \nof government discrimination. It is money that our government owes to \nfarmers who have been treated in such an unjust and morally \nreprehensible manner.\n\n  Mr. President, during conference deliberations, I learned that the \nHouse conferees objected to the scope of the Senate amendment. As I've \nalluded to before, the House version addressed only discrimination \ncomplaints against the Farm Service Agency. My amendment addressed \ncomplaints filed against not only the Farm Service Agency, but also the \nRural Housing Service. We know that discrimination has occurred in both \nagencies, and study after study has clearly illustrated this. Unless we \naddress complaints against both agencies, we allow justice to continue \nto elude a number of minority farmers in America who deserve at long \nlast to be treated fairly.\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\n  To my dismay, Mr. President, the conferees accepted the House version \nof the civil rights amendment, adding only a small portion of the \nSenate version.\n  The Senate version of the civil rights amendment allowed for the \nwaiver of the statute of limitations for discrimination complaints made \nagainst both the Farm Service Agency and the Rural Housing Service. The \nHouse version only allowed the FSA claims.\n  While the conference language allows farmers to file suit in federal \ncourt if their claims for relief are denied by USDA, the Senate \nlanguage specified that the federal court shall apply a de novo \nstandard of review. This standard would have allowed a federal court to \nreview USDA's findings and rationales with a fresh eye, so to speak. In \nother words, a court would not be required to give as much deference to \nUSDA's decisions. This is obviously a protection that would have given \naggrieved farmers a degree of legal protection that is imminently \njustified. Yet no such protection exists in the conference language.\n  To make matters worse, Mr. President, the one protective provision \nthat I was told would be included in the conference language--the \nexpedited review provision--was somehow omitted from the conference \nreport. When the conferees reached a compromise on this amendment, it \nis my understanding that they specifically agreed to include a \nprovision of my amendment which limited USDA to 180 days in which to \ninvestigate complaints, issue findings, and propose settlement awards, \nwhere applicable. This provision was supposed to be included, but it \nwas not.\n  Mr. President, I am at a loss to explain why we can't do a better job \nof rectifying such a grevious history of overt, admitted discrimination \nfor so little money. Our Minority farmers deserved better conference \nlanguage from this Congress than they got. It just underscores the \nenormous obstacle we face in resolving this issue--and that is that too \nfew members care enough about this problem to give it the attention and \nthe priority it calls for.\n\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I'd like to share with my \ncolleagues some updated news. Last week, the Office of Inspector \nGeneral issued a report which lambasted the Office of Civil Rights' \nhandling of the backlog of discrimination complaints. The report \ncharacterized the Office's case files as ``too slovenly to ensure the \navailability of critical documents.'' It further berated the Office for \nits failure to implement the majority of recommendations made to the \nDepartment in a February 1997 report.\n  I am not sure why this Department has had so many problems, not only \nwith eliminating unjust and inexcusable behavior, but also with \nefficiently resolving complaints of discrimination. These are symptoms \nof an overwhelming and inexcusable problem. As many of my colleagues \nknow, this is a problem that I have been working to solve for almost \ntwo years, from the moment it was first brought to my attention by a \ngroup of minority farmers headed by a Virginian.\n  Mr. President, I have heard account after account of inexcusable \nbehavior on the part of various officials at USDA, primarily those in \npositions of authority who process farmers' applications for loans. \nSome farmers have had trouble even getting loan applications, much less \nhaving their applications processed in a timely manner. Many farmers \nhave cited stories in which their applications have been purposely \nprocessed later than those of non-minority farmers. The loan money \nthen, in effect, was dispersed to non-minority farmers first. Then, \nwhen many minority farmers checked the status of their applications, \nthe USDA officials responded by stating that there wasn't any money \nleft. Another farmer told me that a USDA official was permitted to keep \na noose in his office, despite repeated complaints about the message it \nsent to minority farmers wishing to do business in that office.\n  I know that Secretary Glickman is committed to stemming this pattern, \nbut ultimately Congress is responsible for overseeing our government \nagencies. In the two years that I've been working on this issue, \ntalking with farmers, meeting with the Secretary and the President, we, \nas a Congress, have not taken a sufficiently forceful approach to stem \nthis shameful pattern of discrimination. In my view, that makes us part \nof the problem as well.\n  When the conferees chose not to accept the Senate language, they made \na choice that sends a disquieting message to minority farmers across \nthis country. The message they sent was that they were willing to do \nthe bare minimum for minority farmers who have suffered discrimination \nat the hands of government officials. It is a message that we, the \nCongress, are not willing to get fully invested in eliminating \ndiscrimination within our own government.\n  The President has indicated that he will veto this bill, and I am \nhopeful that my colleagues will take another opportunity to look at the \ndifferences between the Senate language and the conference language. We \nwill have another opportunity to correct a critical error in our \npriorities. The farmers deserve our best oversight efforts, and they \ndeserve the strongest civil rights amendment that we can craft. I will \ncontinue to push all of our colleagues to do so. A lack of attention to \nthis issue means not only failure on our part, but a perpetuation of a \nproblem for which we should all be ashamed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask unanimous consent that this \nletter and executive summary from the Inspector General to the \nSecretary of Agriculture dated September 30, 1998 be included in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                  Office of Inspector General,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1998.\n\n        Report to the Secretary on Civil Rights Issues--Phase V\n\n     From: Roger C. Viadero, Inspector General.\n     Subject: Evaluation of the Office of Civil Rights' Efforts to \n         Reduce the Backlog of Program Complaints, Evaluation \n         Report No. 60801-1-Hq.\n\n       In July 1998, your Assistant Secretary for Administration \n     asked the Office of Inspector General to review the efforts \n     by the Office of Civil Rights (CR) to reduce the backlog of \n     program complaints in USDA. Attached is a copy of the results \n     of this review. This represents our fifth evaluation of the \n     Department's efforts to reduce the program complaints backlog \n     and to improve the overall complaint processing system, \n     including the investigative process.\n       We found that the Department, through CR, has not made \n     significant progress in reducing the complaints backlog. \n     Whereas the backlog stood at 1,088 complaints on November 1, \n     1997, it still remains at 616 complaints as of September 11, \n     1998.\n       The problems we noted before in the complaints resolution \n     process also continue. CR's data base remains an unreliable \n     repository of information, and its casefiles are too slovenly \n     to ensure the availability of critical documents. A \n     disaffected staff and a leadership vacuum have contributed to \n     a system that cannot ensure complainants a timely hearing of \n     their grievances.\n       Of considerable concern to us is CR's lack of progress in \n     reforming its operations in accordance with our previous \n     recommendations. Few corrective actions have been taken to \n     increase the efficiency of the complaints resolution process. \n     We also noted that CR staff members have not always been \n     honest in portraying the actual level of their performance. \n     Some of the information they gave us proved to be inaccurate. \n     Some of the information they gave you on earlier occasions \n     proved likewise to be inaccurate.\n       Because of continuing problems in the complaints resolution \n     process, we are recommending that you convene a Complaints \n     Resolution Task Force (independent of CR) to immediately \n     assume control of the backlog and have full authority to \n     resolve complaints, including entering into settlement \n     agreements. We are also recommending that the civil rights \n     function within the Department be elevated to the level of \n     Assistant Secretary.\n       At your request, we will be continuing our work with CR, \n     giving special emphasis to its management of settlement \n     agreements.\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n     Purpose\n       The Assistant Secretary for Administration asked us to \n     perform a followup review of the operations of USDA's Office \n     of Civil Rights (CR), the office responsible for resolving \n     complaints made against the Department for alleged civil \n     rights violations in the administration of its programs. \n     During four previous reviews of the Department's civil rights \n     program complaints system, we determined that the system was \n     not functioning properly and that the Department had amassed \n     a growing backlog of complaints that required immediate \n     attention. Although CR itself could not accurately determine \n     how large the backlog was at the time of our first review, it \n     later identified 1,088 outstanding unresolved complaints \n     before November 1, 1997.\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\n     Results in brief\n       Our past reviews had questioned the productivity of CR; we \n     had found a disaffected staff and a leadership vacuum. Little \n     was being accomplished by USDA agencies to respond to citizen \n     complaints of discrimination and little was done by CR to \n     manage the resolution process. Some complaints in CR's \n     backlog had languished for over 2 years. After our February \n     1997 report, CR made the resolution of its backlog its first \n     priority.\n       Our current review disclosed that the backlog of complaints \n     of civil rights violations, although reduced, still stands at \n     616 cases as of September 11, 1998. Of these 616 cases, 80 \n     are under investigation, 310 are awaiting adjudication, 23 \n     are undergoing a legal sufficiency review, and 103 are \n     pending closure. The remaining 100 cases still await a \n     preliminary analysis. (Because 164 complaints are involved in \n     lawsuits against the Department, their cases cannot currently \n     be processed. Of these 164 cases, 147 are included in the \n     remaining backlog.)\n       The backlog is not being resolved at a faster rate because \n     CR itself has not attained the efficiency it needs to \n     systematically reduce the caseload. Few of the deficiencies \n     we noted in our previous reviews have been corrected. The \n     office is still in disarray, providing no decisive leadership \n     and making attempt to correct the mistakes of the past. We \n     noted with considerable concern that after 20 months, CR has \n     made virtually no progress in implementing the corrective \n     actions we thought essential to the viability of its \n     operations. The following table summarizes the key areas for \n     which our recommendations were made and in which the \n     uncorrected deficiencies persist.\n\n  TABLE 1.--AREAS OF DEFICIENCY PREVIOUSLY NOTED BY OIG AND STILL UNCORRECTED--RECURRING OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS\n                                                     ISSUES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             OIG Evaluation Phases\n                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Issue             Alert (02/25/                II (09/29/   Memo (12/18/   IV (03/04/\n                                   97)      I (02/27/97)       97)           97)           98)      V (09/30/98)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReview State foreclosure                X             X             X             X             X             X\n actions....................\nSend letters of               ............

X Condition continues.  X Corrective action taken but not\n  adequately implemented. See exhibits B and C for the Secretary's memoranda regarding Phases I and II.\n\n       We estimate that if CR continues to operate under its \n     current methods and at its current rate, the backlog of \n     complaints existing on November 1, 1997, will not be \n     completely resolved for at least another year.\n       Most conspicuous among the uncorrected problems is the \n     continuing disorder within CR. The data base CR uses to \n     report the status of cases is unreliable and full of errors, \n     and the files it keeps to store needed documentation are \n     slovenly and unmanaged. Forty complaint files could not be \n     found, and another 130 complaints that were listed in USDA \n     agency files were not recorded in CR's data base. Management \n     controls were so poor that we could not render an opinion on \n     the quality of CR's investigations and adjudications.\n       Of equal significance is the absence of written policy and \n     procedures. It is incumbent upon CR to revise department \n     policy to ensure it complies with civil rights laws and to \n     establish the framework of its own activities. We believe \n     standardized, written guidelines are essential to CR's \n     operation, and it is a matter of concern to us that CR has, \n     over the space of 20 months, produced nothing to lay the \n     foundation for good management controls.\n       The absence of formal procedures and accurate records \n     raises questions about due care within the complaints \n     resolution process. We found critical quality control steps \n     missing at every stage of the process. Staffmembers with \n     little training and less experience were put to judging \n     matters that carry serious legal and moral implications. Many \n     of CR's adjudicators, who must determine whether \n     discrimination occurred, were student interns. Legal \n     staffmembers with the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), \n     who review CR's decisions for legal sufficiency, have had to \n     return over half of them because they were based on \n     incomplete data or faulty analysis. We noted that a \n     disproportionately large percent of the 616 cases of \n     unresolved backlog had bottlenected in the adjudication unit.\n       Furthermore, CR may not understand the full scope of its \n     authority. CR has concentrated its oversight on federally-\n     conducted programs; it has largely ignored a host of \n     federally-assisted programs (e.g., crop insurance, research \n     grants) in which complaints of discrimination may have been \n     made.\n       CR's unsuccessful efforts to resolve the backlog of civil \n     rights complaints are in part the symptom of an insecurity \n     that has affected office morale. The many reorganizations the \n     complaints resolution staff has undergone, the high turnover \n     the staff has experienced within the last several years, and \n     the inadequate training afforded both managers and \n     staffmembers, have left the staff unfocused and without \n     clear direction. The staff we found at the civil rights \n     offices was not a coherent team of dedicated professionals \n     with a shared vision but a fragmented order of individual \n     fiefdoms, each mindful only of its own borders and its own \n     responsibilities. Low office morale has contributed to a \n     lack of productivity. CR's data base shows that since \n     January 1997, CR closed only 19 cases through \n     adjudication, 8 of which were not even investigated by CR. \n     Through this inefficiency, complainants are being denied a \n     timely hearing of their civil rights complaints.\n       Also disturbing was the evasiveness we encountered at CR. \n     We found discrepancies between what we were told by \n     staffmembers and what we were subsequently able to verify. We \n     found similar discrepancies in information CR communicated to \n     the Secretary. These discrepancies, in the number of open and \n     closed complaints, were repeated at congressional hearings \n     and other public forums.\n       We concluded that in order to complete the backlog of cases \n     expeditiously, the Secretary needs to transfer resolution of \n     the backlog to a complaints resolution task force, composed \n     of seasoned adjudicators and well qualified civil rights \n     personnel from Federal agencies outside USDA. The task force \n     should have full authority to review and resolve all \n     complaints.\n       To increase CR's efficiency in the long term, the Secretary \n     should create an Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights with \n     subcabinet-level status. Concurrently, the CR Director should \n     emphasize hiring managers who have a solid background in \n     civil rights and a good knowledge of Department programs.\n       Once in operation, the task force would provide CR with the \n     opportunity to focus on its own structure and implement the \n     reforms it needs to function efficiently. We believe CR is \n     capable of these reforms and that it is in the best position \n     within the Department to act objectively in resolving civil \n     rights complaints. Consequently it should retain Department \n     authority to investigate future complaints. We believe that \n     when CR has taken the corrective actions we previously \n     recommended, as well as the steps outlined in this followup \n     report, it will provide more efficient service.\n     Key recommendations\n       We recommend that the Secretary take the following actions \n     to ensure that citizens who have complained of discrimination \n     by USDA receive a timely hearing:\n       Immediately convene a complaints resolution task force, \n     composed of well qualified civil rights personnel from other \n     Federal agencies and senior USDA program personnel with \n     decision-making authority. The task force, under the \n     direction of an Executive Director who reports directly to \n     the Secretary, should immediately assume control of the \n     backlog and have full authority to review and resolve \n     complaints.\n       The complaints resolution task force could also assist the \n     CR Director in reviewing new complaints that have exceeded \n     the 180-day resolution deadline set by the Civil Rights \n     Implementation Team.\n       The OGC and the CR Director should be available to assist \n     the task force in its efforts.\n       The task force should perform a case-by-case, document-by-\n     document sweep of the casefiles to restore retrievability to \n     the information contained in the files.\n       Elevate the Department's civil rights functions to the \n     level of Assistant Secretary with full authority across \n     agency lines.\n       Require CR to (a) issue needed operational policies and \n     procedures within a 2-month timeframe, (b) resolve within 2 \n     months all other recommendations that we made in our previous \n     reports but that CR has failed to implement, (c) keep open \n     all cases with settlement agreements so the agreements may be \n     tracked, and (d) institute other operational improvements \n     that will ensure the efficient operation of the civil rights \n     functions within the Department and ensure due care in the \n     resolution of all civil rights complaints as well as a timely \n     hearing for all complainants.\n     Statistical data on complaints\n       According to CR's data base as of September 11, 1998, the \n     Department's inventory of\n\n[[Page S11436]]\n\n     complaints totals 1,439 that are open and 582 that are \n     closed. Of the total open and closed cases, 383 are part of 2 \n     lawsuits brought against the Department; 77 from the \n     Brewington lawsuit, and 256 from the Pigford lawsuit. These \n     cases are identified separately because the court prohibited \n     CR from processing the cases as long as they were under \n     litigation.\n       CR categorizes complaints that have not yet been reviewed \n     as ``intend-to-file'' cases. Normally these cases are \n     considered ``unperfected.'' However, if the complainant has \n     indicated an intent to go forward with the complaint once \n     Congress waives the 2-year statute of limitations, the case \n     is identified separately.\n       The three tables on the next page identify the status of \n     all cases in the inventory.\n\n                                                           TABLE 2--STATUS OF CIVIL RIGHTS PROGRAM COMPLAINTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 1998\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                       Not in Lawsuit                Pigford Lawsuit \\1\\             Brewington Lawsuit \\2\\                   Total\n                                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Intend      Open      Closed     Intend      Open      Closed     Intend      Open      Closed     Intend      Open      Closed\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBacklog.....................................................  .........        469        455  .........        144         16  .........          3          1  .........        616        472\nNew.........................................................  .........        138        106  .........         19          2  .........          6          1  .........        163        109\nUnperfected.................................................        271  .........          1          6  .........  .........          7  .........  .........        284  .........          1\nStatute of Limitations......................................        248  .........  .........         69  .........  .........         59  .........  .........        376  .........  .........\n                                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Totals................................................        519        607        562         75        163         18         66          9          2        660        779       582\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Actual total number of complainants in the Pigford lawsuit as of 08/06/98 is 481.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed for 2 minutes prior to the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, when Senator Cochran and I reported the \nfiscal year 1999 appropriations bill for agriculture, rural development \nand related agencies to the Senate earlier this year, our \nrecommendation included maintaining the studies and evaluations \nactivities for USDA's food programs with the Food and Nutrition Service \n(FNS). This recommendation was consistent with the President's budget \nrequest.\n  The studies and evaluations activities are important for a number of \nreasons. These activities enable better program management of the \nseveral domestic feeding programs administered through USDA. We should \nremember that USDA's nutrition programs comprise the lions' share of \nthe USDA budget and are often all that stands between many of our \npeople and abject hunger. Because of the long-term health implications \nassociated with a healthy, nutritious diet, it is absolutely vital that \nprogram administrators have access to relevant and updated information \nregarding nutrition and program delivery.\n  Mr. HARKINS. I agree with the Senator from Arkansas' explanation of \nthe importance of these research functions at USDA. Although the Senate \nposition going into conference was to fund the food program studies and \nevaluations through FNS, the House insisted on their provision which \nwould place these functions with the Economic Research Service (ERS). \nWe were able to reach an agreement with the House conferees, as \nincluded in this Conference Report, to transfer $2 million from the ERS \nback to the FNS for this purpose. It is our expectation that the ERS \nwill continue its working relationship with the FNS in order for that \nagency to conduct the same type of studies and evaluations as in the \ncurrent fiscal year.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to note the importance of \ncoordinating the research agenda for the food program studies and \nevaluations between USDA's research and nutrition subcabinet officers. \nI cannot understate the importance of these two branches of USDA \ncontinuing to work together, as they have done this year, to ensure \nthat FNS' research agenda meets the needs of program managers to have \nadequate information to guide their program decisions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Senator Bumpers is correct. I strongly urge the Under \nSecretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Service and the Under \nSecretary for Research, Education and Economics to continue working \ntogether to establish a reasonable division of effort consistent with a \nsound research agenda.\n\n\n                         National swine center\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to engage my colleague, Senator Bumpers, the \nranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies in a colloquy \nregarding the pending legislation. For clarification, I would like the \nSenator to provide further explanation of language included in the \nStatement of Managers accompanying the conference report to H.R. 4101.\n  It is my understanding that language under the heading of the \nAgricultural Research Service imposes a limitation on funding for the \nNational Swine Research Center at Ames, Iowa, but is related to \noperational and maintenance costs for that facility beyond those \nnormally associated with assignments of ARS personnel. This \ninterpretation would not be inconsistent with the general provision of \nthe conference report that prohibits the transfer of title of the \nCenter to USDA.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Iowa is correct. While the conference \nreport does not allow for the transfer of title of the facility to \nUSDA, and the Statement of Managers includes language limiting the use \nof funds for operational costs, that limitation does not apply to the \nallocation of funds pursuant to normal ARS scientist assignments. The \nStatement of Managers includes direction that an increase of $2 million \nfor ARS research at Ames, Iowa, is included as reflected in the \naccompanying table. That table indicates an increase of $1 million for \nthe National Animal Disease Center and an additional $1 million for \nLivestock Management. The latter amount is available for use at the \nNational Swine Research Center consistent with normal ARS personnel \nfunding allocations.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his further explanation.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say, and I would be remiss if I \ndid not say it at this point, I think, one of the things I will miss \ndeeply when I leave the U.S. Senate will be the excellent relationship \nI have had with the chairman of this committee. He has been, probably, \nmuch more generous to me through the years that he was chairman than I \nwas to him when I was chairman. But I want the whole Senate to know of \nmy deep admiration for him. I want the whole country to know it. He is \na consummate gentleman. He is a man of impeccable integrity. He is \naccommodating to a fault to his colleagues. And one of the things I \nwill miss is his counsel, advice and common sense.\n  He is the personification of what public service should be. I have \nbeen most honored to serve with him and I will cherish his friendship \nalways.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11411-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11411-S11437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AGRICULTURAL, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n      RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the report will be \nstated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4101), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 2, 1998.)\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, pending before the Senate at this time \nis the conference report on the fiscal year 1999 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act. We present this conference report for the Senate's \napproval this afternoon.\n  The agreement provides total new budget authority of $55.7 billion \nfor programs and activities of the U.S. Department of Agriculture--\nexcept for the Forest Service, which is funded by the Interior \nappropriations bill--the Food and Drug Administration, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and expenses and payments of the farm \ncredit system. This is $6 billion more than the fiscal year 1998 \nenacted level; it is $1.9 billion less than the President's request \nlevel; it is $192 million less than the House-passed bill, and it is \n$1.1 billion less than the Senate-passed bill level.\n  The changes that were made in conference on mandatory funding \nrequirements account for the overall increase from the fiscal year 1998 \nenacted level, principally reflecting a $2.6 billion lower estimate for \nFood Stamp Program funding requirements, higher Child Nutrition Program \nexpenses, and a $7.6 billion increase in the payment to reimburse the \nCommodity Credit Corporation for net realized losses. The conference \nreport also provides an additional $4.2 billion in emergency \nappropriations to assist agricultural producers and others who have \nsuffered financial hardship due to adverse weather conditions and loss \nof markets.\n  Including congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\nyear spending actions, this conference agreement provides total \ndiscretionary spending for fiscal year 1999 of $13.651 billion in \nbudget authority and $14.050 billion in outlays. These amounts are \nconsistent with the revised discretionary spending allocations \nestablished for this conference agreement under the Budget Act.\n  It was a very difficult conference. As Members may recall, a number \nof legislative provisions were added to the bill when it was considered \nin the Senate in July. Not only did the conference committee have to \nreach agreement with the House on these issues, but it had to resolve \nfunding differences within a more constrained discretionary spending \nallocation for the conference than originally established in the Senate \nbill.\n  Special recognition is due and deserved by the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers. In \naddition, the chairman of the House subcommittee, Congressman Skeen \nfrom New Mexico, and ranking minority member of the House subcommittee, \nCongresswoman Kaptur from Ohio, turned in hard work and cooperated with \nour efforts to make this conference agreement possible.\n  The report includes credit relief for farmers, a 6-month extension of \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact, sanctions relief for exports to India and \nPakistan, a waiver of the statute of limitations for certain \ndiscrimination claims filed against the Department of Agriculture, and \na number of other legislative provisions that were included in the \nSenate and House-passed bills.\n  In addition, at the request of the House and Senate Agriculture \nCommittees, chaired by Senator Lugar here and Congressman Smith in the \nHouse, the conference report includes a moratorium on the rulemaking \nauthority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over swaps and \nderivatives, as well as language requested by the administration \nauthorizing the creation of an Under Secretary for Marketing and \nRegulatory Programs position at the Department of Agriculture. That \nchange also had the approval of the legislative committees with \njurisdiction over that subject.\n  During consideration of the bill in the Senate, an amendment was \nadopted providing increased funding for the President's Food Safety \nInitiative. A major portion of this additional spending was offset by \nan ``assessment'' on the purchasers and importers of tobacco. This was \nsubsequently determined by the House Ways and Means Committee to be a \n``tax,'' and therefore off limits to the Appropriations Committee and \nwas not included in the conference report. I am pleased to report to \nthe Senate, however, that the conference report provides increased \nfunding of $51.9 million for activities and programs which are part of \nthe administration's Food Safety Initiative.\n  In addition, the conference report provides $609 million for the Food \nSafety and Inspection Service, an agency critical to maintaining the \nsafety of our food supply. That is $20 million more than the fiscal \nyear 1998 level, and $460 million more than the President requested in \nhis budget.\n  As most of my colleagues are aware, one of the major differences \nbetween the House and Senate-passed bill was a House bill provision to \nprevent fiscal year 1999 funding for the new Competitive Agriculture \nResearch Program established by the Agricultural Research, Extension, \nand Education Reform Act of 1998. I did not support the proposal to \nremove or prevent the funding going forward as directed in that \nlegislation. However, with a total discretionary budget authority \nallocation for the conference that was $64 million below the level we \nhad for the Senate bill, it was a House position that the Senate \nconferees had little choice but to accept.\n  Without that offset, drastic cuts would have been necessary in \nfunding for other discretionary programs and activities in the bill. In \nview of this 1-year delay in funding for the new Agriculture Research \nCompetitive Grant Program, the conference provided increased \nappropriations for existing agricultural research programs.\n  Here are some examples: There is an appropriation of $782 million for \nthe Agriculture Research Service. That represents a $38 million \nincrease from the 1998 fiscal year level, and it is $14 million more \nthan was included in the Senate-passed bill.\n  There is total funding of $481 million for research and education \nactivities of the Cooperative Research, Education and Extension \nService. That is $50 million more than the fiscal year 1998 level, and \nit is $48 million more than was in the Senate-passed bill. Included in \nthis amount is a 7-percent increase from the fiscal year 1998 level for \npayments under the Hatch Act, cooperative forestry research, payments \nto the 1890 and 1994 institutions, including Tuskegee and animal and \nhealth disease grants.\n  Also included is a $22.1 million increase for the National Research \nInitiative Competitive Grants Program.\n  In addition, the bill recommends $434 million for extension \nactivities which preserves the 3-percent increase recommended by the \nSenate for Smith-Lever formula funds, as well as extension payments to \nthe 1994 and 1890 institutions, including Tuskegee University.\n  Approximately $36.1 billion, close to 65 percent of the total new \nbudget authority provided by this conference report, is for domestic \nfood programs administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These \ninclude food stamps; commodity assistance; the special supplemental \nfood program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and the school \nlunch and breakfast programs. The Senate receded to the House-\nrecommended appropriations level for the WIC program because recent \ndata on actual participation rates and food package costs indicate that \nthis amount should be sufficient to maintain current program \nparticipation levels in fiscal year 1999.\n  For farm assistance programs, including the Farm Service Agency and \nfarm ownership and operation loan subsidies, the conference report \nprovides $1.1 billion in appropriations.\n  Appropriations for conservation programs administered by the Natural \nResources Conservation Service total $793 million, $9 million more than \nthe House bill level and $1 million more than the level recommended by \nthe Senate.\n  For rural economic and community development programs, the conference \nreport provides appropriations of $2.2 billion to support a total loan \nlevel of $6.2 billion. Included in this amount is $723 million for the \nRural Community Advancement Program, $583 million for the rental \nassistance program, and a total rural housing loan program level of \n$4.25 billion.\n  A total of $1.2 billion is provided for foreign assistance and \nrelated programs of the Department of Agriculture, including $136 \nmillion in new budget authority for the Foreign Agricultural Service \nand a total program level of $1.1 billion for the P.L. 480 Food for \nPeace Program.\n  Total new budget authority for the Food and Drug Administration is \n$977 million, $11.5 million more than the level recommended by the \nHouse and $24.5 million more than the Senate bill level, along with an \nadditional $132 million in Prescription Drug Act and $14 million in \nmammography clinics user fee collections. Included in the appropriation \nfor salaries and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration is a $20 \nmillion increase for food safety.\n  For the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $61 million is \nprovided; and a limitation of $35.8 million is established on \nadministrative expenses of the Farm Credit Administration.\n  Titles XI-XIII of this conference report provide emergency relief to \nagricultural producers and others who have suffered weather-related and \neconomic losses. As Members will recall, a number of amendments were \nadopted to this bill when the Senate considered it in July to address \ndisaster-related requirements with the understanding that additional \nrelief would be necessary once actual losses were determined by the \nDepartment of Agriculture and a supplemental request was submitted by \nthe Administration. No request was submitted to the Congress until \nSeptember 23. On September 23, the Administration submitted a $1.8 \nbillion budget authority request to support $2.3 billion in emergency \nagricultural programs. In the interim, the Republicans released a $3.9 \nbillion relief package to assist agricultural producers. This emergency \nagricultural relief package is included in this conference report, \nalong with additional\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\nemergency supplemental appropriations, to make a total of $4.2 billion \nin emergency assistance available.\n  A total of $1.5 billion is made available to assist producers who \nhave been hit by crop losses in 1998, and an additional $675 million \nfor producers who have suffered from multiple-year crop losses. Also \nincluded is $175 million for emergency livestock feed assistance, and \n$1.65 billion to assist producers with market losses. In addition, the \nconference report provides temporary recourse loans for honey and \nmohair; $5 million for cotton indemnity payments; an increase of $25 \nmillion for the Food for Progress program to help move more grain out \nof the country; and expanded non-insured crop assistance for raisin \nproducers. Additional supplemental emergency appropriations provided by \nthe conference report include the $40 million to cover additional costs \nto the Farm Service Agency of administering this assistance, $10 \nmillion for the Forestry Incentives Program; and $31 million in subsidy \nappropriations to fund an additional $541 million in farm operating \nloans.\n  Madam President, this conference report was filed on Friday and was \npassed by the House of Representatives that day by an overwhelming vote \nof 333 yeas to 53 nays. Senate passage of this conference report today \nis the final step necessary to send this fiscal year 1999 \nappropriations bill to the President for signature into law.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this conference report. Many of our \nfarmers and ranchers are facing the worst crisis in agriculture that \nthey can remember. The economic collapse in Asia has resulted in lost \nmarkets. Producers in some states have suffered severe weather \nconditions. Others have been hit hard by crop diseases. The farmers \nneed help now, and it is time to quit playing politics with disaster \nrelief and adopt this conference report.\n  Madam President, this is the last Agriculture Appropriations bill my \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Arkansas, will manage in the \nSenate after serving on the Appropriations Committee for 20 years and \nthis Subcommittee for 13 years. Senator Bumpers has been an advocate of \nAmerican agriculture and a proponent of the programs in this bill to \nimprove the quality of life and help bring jobs to rural areas. His \nexpertise and many contributions to this process and this bill will \nindeed be missed.\n  In summary, let me point out, Madam President, that there has been \nraised the specter of a Presidential veto over this conference report \nbecause of the inadequacy of the provision relating to disaster \nassistance payments. I am very disturbed by that suggestion, and I hope \nthat it is more rumor than promise. I know the President spent some \ntime on Saturday in his weekly radio address speaking to that subject.\n  I recall that 2 weeks ago, I was asked to deliver the Republican \nresponse to the President's weekly radio address, and my subject was \nthe need for a more aggressive and meaningful disaster assistance \nprogram for farmers.\n  I think everyone can agree that both the President and the Congress \nhave been speaking out and making very clear the fact that we need a \nhelpful, sensitive, generous program of disaster assistance to help \ndeal with the realities of weather-related disasters that have struck \nmany parts of the country, market loss problems because of the Asian \neconomic crisis, and other factors that have worked together to make \nthis a very difficult year for agriculture.\n  The question is, Are we going to resolve this in a way that is \nconsistent with the legislative process that makes sense for farmers, \nthat serves to establish policies that are thoughtful and consistent \nwith the needs of American agriculture, or are we going to continue to \ntreat this as a political football and just kick it around and have us \nskirmish every day or every week over this issue, leading to delay, \nleading to uncertainties, leading to anxieties? Farmers in America \ncertainly deserve better.\n  I would like just for a moment or two to think back on the date when \nwe had the bill on the floor of the Senate and the subject of disaster \nassistance was first raised. We adopted in the Senate a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution calling on the President and the Congress to work \ntogether to come up with a proposal that would meet the needs for \nemergency action to respond ``to the economic hardships facing \nagriculture producers and their communities.'' The Senate adopted that \non July 15 by a vote of 99 to 0.\n  The next day, there was an amendment offered by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Mr. Conrad, and others who suggested we establish a $500 \nmillion indemnity program to compensate farmers for income losses that \nhad been suffered due to various adverse conditions--weather and \notherwise--throughout the country, although mainly the benefits were \ndirected to the upper plains and other selected areas, not countrywide \nbenefits or a program designed to be national in scope.\n  During my remarks on that occasion, I recall on the Senate floor \nsaying that we needed to have the President and the Department of \nAgriculture get involved and provide the Congress with a complete and \naccurate assessment of the funds that were needed for a program of this \nkind. We hadn't had a proposal from the administration for any specific \nbenefit program for agriculture, although there had been meetings on \nthe Hill with farm groups, with Senators and Congressmen trying to, \nfirst, get the facts and get a sense of what the agriculture leadership \nthroughout the country thought would be an appropriate response by the \nFederal Government.\n  There was no question at the time we were debating the bill that \nthere was great interest in developing a disaster assistance program to \nmeet the needs of American agriculture. As a matter of fact, during the \ndiscussion, I asked Senators if they had any better ideas, if they had \nsuggestions for anything other than this $500 million indemnity \nprogram, and no one came forward to offer any amendments and no one \nexpressed opposition to adopting that amendment. We checked with the \nlegislative chairman in the Senate, and others, and without objection, \nwe suggested that the Senate adopt the amendment of the Senator from \nNorth Dakota on a voice vote, and that is what we did. We accepted the \namendment.\n  After that was done, it became clear that through gathering \ninformation, that the situation was more widespread. I remember going \nto Georgia, for example, with the distinguished Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Coverdell. I had an opportunity to meet with farmers in southern \nGeorgia and became convinced that we had a problem that was bigger than \nthe upper plains and Texas. Everybody knew about the drought in Texas \nand the severe complications that were resulting from that for \nagriculture producers and ranchers in that area. But I do not think it \nwas well known that in south Georgia, which had had a series of \nweather-related disasters over a period of years, the agriculture \nsector there was really hurting. And the $500 million indemnity \nprogram, suggested by the Senators from North Dakota and others, was \nnot going to be sufficient to deal with that problem and others as \nwell.\n\n  I know in my State of Mississippi, for example, when I was home right \nafter we adopted this bill in July--we had a break during the August \nrecess--I had an opportunity to visit some areas of my State that were \ndevastated because of isolated weather patterns that had ruined corn \ncrops in the northwest part of Mississippi, and others had been damaged \nto the extent that diseases were infesting the crops. Aflatoxin was \nattacking the corn crops.\n  There was no provision in any Federal disaster assistance program for \nyield losses, for crop losses. Those who were suggesting an indemnity \nprogram based on lifting loan caps had to realize that was not going to \nhelp somebody who had a total crop failure. It would not help them a \nbit.\n  So we came back, started working on a new proposal, got with the \nleadership of the House and Senate, and asked the administration they \nwere going to request supplemental funding. They did come back with a \n$1.8 billion supplemental budget authority request to support $2.3 \nbillion in emergency agricultural programs, without a lot of \nspecificity about how those benefits would be determined, how the \neligibility would be determined, who would administer the program. But, \nnonetheless, it was a step in the right direction, and I applauded the \nPresident for responding in that way.\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\n  But based on that supplemental request--and working with the \nknowledge that other Members had generated from their States--we \nproposed to the conference committee a $4.1 billion disaster assistance \nprogram, and it was accepted in the conference committee with some \nchanges. We accepted some amendments proposed by House Members in \nconference. We added some money proposed by the Senate in response to \nspecific amendments that were urged in conference to the managers' \nproposal. So the end result was the conference committee agreed to \nprovide emergency benefits totaling about $4.2 billion.\n  So I come to the Senate today very pleased to be able to report that, \ninstead of a $500 million indemnity program that the Senate adopted as \na way to deal with the crisis in agriculture, working with farmers, \nproducers, and ranchers from around the country, and other Members of \nthe Congress, including the House, we now have a conference report that \nis much more generous, much more responsive to the real needs that \nexist in our country today in production agriculture, and designed to \nmore nearly bring farmers to a point where they can continue to operate \nwithout going broke, without the devastating effects that would have \nbeen the reality of the situation had not this package of changes been \nagreed upon.\n  We hear now that the Democratic leadership has urged the President to \nveto the bill. And I got a letter suggesting that he would if the \nconference agreement on disaster assistance was inconsistent with the \nproposal just recently made by the Democratic leader of the Senate to \nremove the loan caps under the current farm program for the commodities \nthat are subsidized, in effect, by the Federal Government--no ifs, \nands, buts about it.\n  The letter said--and I took this up with the Secretary of Agriculture \nto be sure I understood that that was the meaning--that the President \nsaid he would veto the bill if the conference report was inconsistent \nwith a proposal made by the Democratic leader to remove the loan caps \nfor those commodities that are subsidized by the Government.\n  I am very disappointed by that. I certainly hope that there is room \nfor the President to change his mind on that subject, because it seems \nto me that rather than argue over whether or not this program is really \ngoing to do a good job and is thoughtfully crafted to try to put \nfarmers back on their feet who have been devastated by bad weather and \nmarket conditions beyond their control, it just seems to me that this \nis not an appropriate response for the President to be making, given \nthe other opportunities for positive things.\n  Here are some examples of positive things that I think could be done \nwhich are beyond the jurisdiction of this committee today that brings \nyou this conference report. The House of Representatives just passed \nrecently a tax bill making a lot of changes in the Tax Code, but I \nspecifically recall that some of those tax changes are designed to \nbenefit farmers and farm families, and I am told that we are not going \nto have a chance to vote on that tax bill here in the Senate because we \ncannot get the bill cleared to bring up. We cannot get the House-passed \ntax bill cleared.\n  So in order to bring it up, the majority leader would have to move to \nthe consideration of the bill, the motion would become debatable, and \nthen in order to get the bill on the floor for consideration and debate \nand passage, 60 votes to invoke cloture would have to be undertaken \nbecause the Democrats are promising to filibuster the bill.\n  Here are the changes that it bothers me we will not even get a chance \nto approve that would help farmers.\n  There is a 5-year net loss carryback of losses that you can carry \nback and set against income for 5 previous years. That is in the House-\npassed bill. The House-passed bill makes permanent income averaging, \nwhich permits farmers and ranchers to average income, high years \nagainst low years, and even out the tax burden, which is very \nbeneficial to many.\n  There is a provision that makes deductible, to 100 percent of the \ncost, health insurance premiums by those who are self-employed. If you \nare in agriculture and you have a farm and you are your own boss, under \nthis change you will be able to deduct 100 percent of the cost of your \nhealth insurance. That helps farmers. That helps farm families.\n  There is also an acceleration of the exemption for death taxes and \ngift taxes. One of the most difficult things facing agriculture today \nis the obligation to come up with cash money to pay the Federal \nGovernment so-called inheritance taxes on the death of a family member \nwho has an interest in the land or the other property that goes into \nmaking up the decedent's estate.\n  We have passed rules that phase in some higher exemptions for small \nfarms and for businesses. What this House-passed bill does is \naccelerate the phasing in of those exemptions. That would be a big help \nto many farm families who are going to have to liquidate assets in real \nestate to pay death taxes.\n  Another thing that this administration has been slow to react to is \nthe trade problems that we are having in this hemisphere, with Canada, \nwith Mexico, and beyond, barriers to trade so that our farmers and our \nexporters are having to deal with unfair tariff situations and other \ndifficulties that are erected to keep America from selling what we are \nproducing in the world marketplace and at the same time importing, in \nviolation of some existing rules, I am told, some foodstuffs, live \ncattle, from other countries.\n  Finally the administration is beginning to act. We see the Trade \nRepresentative engaging Canada in trade talks now about steps that can \nbe taken to solve the problems that have developed in that area. But we \nwere hearing this on the Senate floor and urging the administration to \ntake action. Being the chief negotiator in the executive branch, the \nPresident has an obligation to assume some leadership. Frankly, there \nhas been a breakdown in leadership on that subject.\n\n  We hope we haven't waited too late to make changes and reach \nagreements and work out problems in the trade area for the farmers who \nhave suffered this year. That is one of the reasons why we felt it \nnecessary to include direct payments that are bonus payments under the \ntransition.\n  We think the market transition program to compensate producers \ndirectly for income losses due to the economic crisis and trade \nproblems that we have is very important. The administration does not \npropose and has not suggested that as an appropriate step to aid \nAmerica's farmers.\n  I make those comments, Madam President, not to pick a fight with \nanybody here on the floor of the Senate today, but to simply express my \nconcern that we not see this bill held up, delayed, postponed, vetoed, \nwhatever may happen to it, because of an interest in being able to say \nthe Democrats are for a $7 billion disaster program, the Republican \nbill is only $4 billion. I bet it will be the same folks who said we \nwant $500 million in an indemnity program to help meet the needs of the \nagriculture crisis. That is what the story was in July. We all agreed \nat that time that was probably temporary, that more needs to be done. \nSo I am not belittling that suggestion. It was the suggestion on the \nfloor of the Senate at the time and no one had any better idea at that \ntime.\n  Since then it seems we have been engaged in a show of one-upsmanship. \nThe Republicans then come up with, with Democrat input in many cases, \nthis $4 billion program of disaster assistance. Now, all of a sudden, \nthat is not enough; we need $7 billion.\n  How much has the President requested? I have the exact amount: $1.76 \nbillion in budget authority has been requested by the President for \nagriculture producers and ranchers. That will support $2.3 billion \nprogram level. The other suggestion is removing the loan caps. Then CBO \nis called on to answer the question, what will that cost? The answer is \nthat will probably cost--and it is speculation, it is a guess, nobody \nknows because nobody knows what commodity prices will be in the \nfuture--it is guessed it will be $5.5 billion.\n  The proponents of that proposal say we are for spending $5.5 billion \nplus $2.3 billion, so we are for spending almost $8 billion. So this is \na more generous plan. What is not disclosed is the effect that policy \nchange of raising the loan caps will have on prices of those \ncommodities next year or the next. The\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\nfact is there are many who tell us that we are buying into a program \nthat is going to have a continuing depressing effect on market price of \nthese commodities that are covered by the loan programs.\n  I don't know if that is true or not. I don't think anybody could have \nguessed that corn and wheat prices would have been as low as they are \nright now a year ago. So nobody knows what the prices are going to be \nin the future. I am told they will be lower because of that change in \npolicy. So are we doing farmers a favor by making that policy change?\n  It is really not a question, in my view, of who is willing to spend \nmore money on farmers, the Republicans or the Democrats. Both are being \nvery generous. That is the fact. Both are being very, very generous in \nterms of where we started, existing programs, precedent, previous \ndisaster benefit efforts. The fact is the Democrats are in favor of \nmaking a policy change and substituting a change for an existing farm \nbill provision that set up the market transition payments and the \nphasing in to a market economy. We are in the second year of that farm \nbill. There are 3 more years left under the authority of the 1996 bill. \nI m hopeful that we can find a way to provide the benefits to American \nagriculture producers without rewriting or trying to rewrite portions \nof the 1996 farm bill. So we have a difference of opinion on that.\n  Let me simply conclude my remarks by thanking everyone who helped us \nwrite this conference report. It has been a very challenging \nexperience. I don't know that we had a more contentious or at least \nlong drawn out conference on agriculture appropriations since I have \nbeen in the Congress. I don't recall having any more difficult time \nputting the bill together. We had a lot of disagreements that were \ndiscussed, but we worked them all out. We have a conference agreement. \nThat is the good news. The other body has passed the conference report \nby a very large vote.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing members of the staff of the Appropriations Committee be \ngranted the privilege of the floor during consideration of the \nconference report to accompany H.R. 4101, and during any votes that may \noccur in relation to this measure: Rebecca Davies, Martha Scott \nPoindexter, and Rachelle Graves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, first of all, let me compliment the \nSenator from Mississippi for his usual articulate and persuasive \nfashion--always a gentleman, always wanting to work with us, regardless \nof momentary disagreements. I regret to say this is one of those \nmomentary disagreements.\n  I come to the floor today to offer arguments against this conference \nreport. I had initially intended to offer a motion to recommit the \nreport back to conference, but now that motion would be out of order \nsince the House has reported it. I prefer that it go back to the \nconference rather than going on to the President.\n  I appreciate very much the President indicating he will veto this \nbill. Perhaps if we can dispose of this conference report in a hurry, \nget the President's veto, the conferees can direct their attention to \nthe objections the President has raised. Those objections are similar \nto the ones I will offer here this afternoon.\n  Let me say, first of all, I do appreciate that there is bipartisan \nagreement that rural America is facing a real crisis. That is very good \nnews. What the Senator from Mississippi said is quite right. There has \nbeen, throughout the year, a process of developing proposals, but there \nhas been significant disagreement on one particular point; that is, \ntaking the caps off the loan rate. We voted twice on that. It did not \npass here in the Senate. I will talk about that later. I think, \nunfortunately, that ideological argument is getting in the way of our \nability to be able to reach agreement.\n  This conference report, I believe, fails in two areas: First, it does \nnot achieve the goal of providing support, both to the farmers who grow \nthe crop who are in serious trouble due to the prices, and those who \nare in trouble as a consequence of weather disasters. For livestock, \nthis conference report fails to put the law on the sides of the \nproducers and take action to make our markets work better.\n  First, as to the amount of income support for grains, it is simply \nnot enough. It is not targeted as it should be to the people growing \nour food.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an editorial \nthat appeared in the Lincoln Journal Star praising Congressman Doug \nBereuter, a Republican from Nebraska, who represents the First \nCongressional District. Congressman Bereuter also objected to the plan \nin the conference report as not sufficiently generous to meet the needs \nof agriculture under current economic conditions; that the $4 billion \nin aid should be closer to $7 billion in aid that the budget has \nrequested. I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Lincoln Journal Star, Oct. 2, 1998]\n\n                Bereuter Path on Farm Aid Best Approach\n\n       First District Rep. Doug Bereuter has a sound, responsible \n     approach to helping farmers at a time when commodity prices \n     have plunged to lows not seen since the 1980s.\n       Breaking with his GOP cohorts, Bereuter said this week the \n     Republican plan ``is not sufficiently generous'' to meet the \n     needs of agriculture under current economic conditions.\n       House and Senate conferees Wednesday chose the Republican \n     plan, which would provide $4 billion in aid, over a \n     Democratic plan which would have provided $7.1 billion in tax \n     subsidies to farmers.\n       Agriculture was one of the first sectors of the economy to \n     be buffeted by the Asian financial crisis. Export markets in \n     some Asian nations have virtually evaporated. Now markets in \n     Latin America also are being affected.\n       In addition to providing a cushion against low prices, the \n     aid package under consideration in Congress is intended to \n     help farmers who have been hit by drought and other adverse \n     weather conditions.\n       Debate over the size of an aid package for farmers \n     unfortunately has bogged down in partisan rhetoric and a \n     running debate over the five-year Freedom to Farm act \n     approved by Congress in 1996.\n       The Republican aid package unfortunately also rejects other \n     measures that would provide substantial benefit to \n     agriculture. For example, it does not require mandatory price \n     reporting, which would allow cattle producers to know what \n     packing plants are paying for beef.\n       It also does not include a provision to require labeling \n     showing the national origin of meat. The measure would allow \n     consumers to select beef produced in the U.S. rather than \n     other countries. While pushing for more financial help for \n     farmers, Bereuter rightly resists a return to previous ag \n     policies that are part of the Democratic approach, which \n     would base subsidies for grain farmers on the so-called loan \n     rate.\n       Previous farm policy was based on a heavily bureaucratic \n     approach with strict government dictates. Proponents of the \n     Freedom to Farm act left more decision-making to farmers, at \n     the same time leaving them more subject to market pressures.\n       In the long run, the market-oriented approach under Freedom \n     to Farm will benefit agriculture, although it certainly \n     should be open for modification and improvement.\n       But now, while farmers are facing a double whammy of record \n     harvests and low prices, is not the time to get bogged down \n     in partisan debate over basic philosophy.\n       Providing aid under the payment system of the existing farm \n     bill makes sense. But, as Bereuter suggested, the amount \n     should be more generous than Republicans have agreed to so \n     far to preserve the stability and capability of the sector of \n     the economy that feeds the nation.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, as to the income, the proposal in the \nconference report would be, approximately, for corn, 7 cents a bushel. \nThat does not get the farmer much closer to either recovering the cost \nof production nor providing his banker confidence to lend him money \nagain next year, and significantly, of all the tests that I trust as to \nwhether or not the President's proposal should be a part of the \nconference report or not, economists will come forward and argue on \nboth sides of practically any proposal you come out with. The \nIndependent Bankers of America have endorsed taking the caps off the \nloan rate, not because it provides more income, and by no means does it \nprovide a sufficient amount of income that we won't still have \nsignificant people going broke, but because it is attached to a \nmarketing loan, it increases the chances that farmers who will need \noperating loans will be able to get them.\n\n  Likewise, this conference report is inadequate because provisions \nwere dropped that were passed in the Senate\n\n[[Page S11416]]\n\nin July, which were to require price reporting for beef, and meat \nlabeling requirements as well. The conferees have said to farmers and \nranchers that they think the livestock markets work just fine. But I am \nhere in a brief period of time to say that the markets are not working.\n  Cattle feeders and ranchers have lost more than $2 billion in equity \nthis year, with millions more being lost every week. When I am home--\ntypically every weekend--the people in Nebraska are worried about their \nfinancial stability and they believe that this Agriculture \nappropriations bill, with the disaster package attached to it, will be \nterribly important for their financial stability. More deeply than just \nthe money, they are worried about their way of life, because, in the \nfinal analysis, this debate is about much more than just the size and \nmakeup of a relief package; it is about the future of rural America.\n  We can see the future of our small towns and rural areas very clearly \nright now, and it doesn't look good, with prices low and economic \nconditions as hard as they are on our farms and ranches.\n  Those who are not driven off the land in this crisis have already \nfound that their children are not interested in the life farming has to \noffer. Two weeks ago, in Scottsbluff, I held a town hall meeting, and \n60 people were in the room who are involved directly in production \nagriculture. I asked how many of them had children who would take over \nthe farms, and I didn't get a single affirmative answer. Those with \ngrown children had already lost them to the cities. Others said, \n``There is no opportunity out here.''\n  That is what this Congress has the ability to change, and we can \nstart with this piece of legislation. We need an agricultural sector \nthat offers some opportunity, but first we must bring some stability to \nthat agricultural sector.\n  Again, I am pleased the President is going to veto it. Let me talk of \nthe differences, specifically to our States. Again, I heard the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi talk about economists who are \nsaying taking the caps off of loan rates could have a depressing impact \non price. I have not come to the floor and said that Freedom to Farm \nproduced these lower prices. I think the lower prices are clearly there \nas a consequence of a declining demand in the international \nmarketplace. Nobody is forecasting that demand is going to come back in \n1999. Nobody expects the decline in exports to increase. I wish this \nCongress had been able to pass fast-track legislation. I have supported \nit in the past. I believe that, long term, it would help. But in the \nshort term, we see substantial declines in income that are there as a \nconsequence of this decline in demand and increased production that has \noccurred here in America.\n  This package in the conference report versus what the President asked \nfor is substantially different. I pointed this out before, and it bears \nrepeating. In Nebraska, the difference is $434 million of income--this \ndoes not go to State government or county government; it goes to \nindividual farm families--versus $177 million, almost a quarter of a \nmillion dollars. In Mississippi, it is $145 million versus $71 million. \nIn Minnesota, it is $483 million versus $227 million.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this table, which shows the differences \nbetween the package in the conference report and what the President has \nasked for be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     DEMOCRATIC VERSUS REPUBLICAN PROPOSALS, BY STATE (CBO ESTIMATE)\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              State                 Democratic   Republican   Difference\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama..........................           96           64           32\nArizona..........................           39           19           20\nArkansas.........................          194          105           89\nCalifornia.......................          227          142           85\nColorado.........................          120           53           67\nConnecticut......................            2            1            1\nDelaware.........................            6            2            4\nFlorida..........................           58           47           11\nGeorgia..........................          218          147           71\nIdaho............................          127           37           90\nIllinois.........................          527          186          341\nIndiana..........................          277           95          182\nIowa.............................          600          235          365\nKansas...........................          371          176          195\nKentucky.........................           65           30           35\nLouisiana........................           99           84           16\nMaine............................            3            2            1\nMaryland.........................           21            7           14\nMassachusetts....................            1            1            0\nMichigan.........................          109           47           62\nMinnesota........................          483          227          256\nMississippi......................          145           71           74\nMissouri.........................          205           81          124\nMontana..........................          160           71           89\nNebraska.........................          434          177          257\nNevada...........................            1            0            1\nNew Hampshire....................            1            0            1\nNew Jersey.......................            5            1            4\nNew Mexico.......................           40           27           14\nNew York.........................           41           12           29\nNorth Carolina...................          185          115           70\nNorth Dakota.....................          431          316          115\nOhio.............................          197           64          133\nOklahoma.........................          170          109           60\nOregon...........................           74           14           60\nPennsylvania.....................           46           10           36\nSouth Carolina...................           46           28           18\nSouth Dakota.....................          363          214          149\nTennessee........................           73           29           44\nTexas............................          896          813           83\nUtah.............................           11            3            8\nVermont..........................           26           11           16\nVirginia.........................           39           19           20\nWest Virginia....................          153           42          111\nWashington.......................           12            2           10\nWisconsin........................          139           60           79\nWyoming..........................           10            4            6\n                                  --------------------------------------\n  Total..........................        7,546        4,000        3,546\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, again, not only are our grain farmers \nadversely affected, but cattle producers and cattle processors have \nbeen as well. We have met extensively with our ranchers and our \nfeeders, and they say to us two things need to happen, and they need to \nhappen in order to improve our prices and increase the chances that we \nare going to get a market bid that is higher than what we are getting \nnow.\n  The first is mandatory reporting of prices, regardless of whether the \nprices occur in cattle that are owned by the feeder or cattle \ncontrolled through formula feeding, or some other contract by the \npackinghouse. Those prices today are not reported. We had extensive \ndebate here on the floor about that issue. Unfortunately, the conferees \ndropped that. I believe that provision, all by itself, would increase \nprices for cattle in the United States, for beef, and would have a very \npositive impact as a consequence on our rural communities.\n  Likewise, the meat labeling requirement included in the Senate bill \nwas dropped by the conferees, and it is supported by almost all of the \ncattle organizations. There is some dispute on price reporting, \nalthough I think we can deal with the changes that we had in the \nconference language. There is almost no dispute, from the standpoint of \nthe producer, on the need to put on the label information that allows \nthe consumer to determine from where that product came. It is allowing \nthe market to work. Rather than saying that the Government is going to \nimpose a solution, we say inform the consumer where the product came \nfrom and let them decide.\n  I hope, as I said in the beginning, that the President's veto of this \nconference report will lead to the conferees coming back quickly and \nlooking, as no doubt they will, for ways to improve it along the lines \nof what the President has recommended. Not only are there tens of \nthousands of farmers who will survive if we can get this legislation \npassed and on to the President for his signature, as he has asked us \nto, but it will give us a chance to take a step in the direction of \ngiving our rural communities a chance to survive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is a custom in the Senate to speak \nwell of someone you are about to oppose. So let me speak well of the \nSenator from Mississippi. We have worked together on a wide range of \nissues. He is a very effective Senator and somebody I enjoy working \nwith a great deal. He has a very effective staff and we work on a lot \nof issues together. But I come to the floor today opposing the \nconference report and to do so as aggressively as I possibly can. I \nwant to explain to him and other Members why I feel so strongly about \nthis.\n  First of all, it is not the case that all that was offered in July \nwas the $500 million indemnity program that was introduced as an \namendment by Senator Conrad and myself. It is the case that we also \nproposed, and had a vote on an amendment to increase the price supports \nby lifting the caps on the loan rate. We did it then; and we did it a \nsecond time. We lost twice in those efforts. We proposed a series of \nsteps, one of which was lifting the loan rate, and another of which \ndealt with disaster issues.\n  I want to describe why I feel so strongly about this. I received a \nletter from the head of the Farm Service Agency in our State. I asked \nhim, ``If things don't change, what should we\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nexpect in the next few months in North Dakota with respect to family \nfarms?'' He points out that North Dakota in the judgment of the Farm \nService Agency, will lose over 3,500 farms by this spring without some \nsignificant assistance. That is probably some 14,000 people. I assume \nthere is an average of three or four persons on each of those family \nfarmers, including a spouse and a couple of children. So at least 3,500 \nfamily farms will not get credit and will not be able to continue \nfarming this coming year. That means 12,000 to 14,000 North Dakota farm \npeople will be told that their dream is over. They tried, but they \nfailed.\n  Let me describe the reasons they are not making it. There are two \nmain reasons. One, is the disaster. We had the 500-year flood of the \nRed River, and people know about that. They remember the flood at Grand \nForks. For a number of years we have been in a wet weather cycle in \neastern North Dakota. We have had massive quantities of standing water \nthat have inundated acres and acres of farmland in North Dakota. This \nwet cycle has caused and exacerbated a crop disease known as fusarium \nhead blight, or scab. This combination has devastated the quality of \nfarm life in North Dakota.\n  I have a chart here. If you are a North Dakota farmer and you are in \nthese red counties on this chart in the eastern part of the State, you \nhave had 5 straight years of disaster declaration. The red counties are \nnot 1, 2, or 3, but every year for 5 straight years that these counties \nhave been declared a disaster. Why? Because of weather-related events, \nand other events, their production has been devastated. So that is the \ndisaster portion of this problem. You can see that with the orange \ncounties and yellow counties, that these counties have had disasters 3 \nout of 5 years. In fact two thirds of the counties in my State have \nbeen declared a disaster area 3, 4 or 5 years out of 5 years.\n  Now, in addition to the disaster, what also has happened to these \nfarmers is that Congress passed a new farm bill. The Senator from \nNebraska might be right that this might have nothing at all to do with \nprice. The new farm bill might not be related to the collapse in \nprice. But it might be; I don't know. I am not asserting that today, I \nam just saying that we passed a new farm bill. This chart shows what \nhas happened to the price of wheat since Congress passed the farm bill. \nIt is down by almost 60 percent. There has been a 60-percent drop in \nthe price of wheat since Congress passed the new farm bill. The price \nof wheat has fallen from $5.75 a bushel to $2.36.\n\n  Add together the significant disasters year after year and the \ncollapse of prices and here is what you have. In my State, in North \nDakota, which is the hardest hit, in 1 year there was a 98-percent drop \nin net farm income. These are U.S. Government figures. We had a 98-\npercent drop in net farm income. With respect to this group of North \nDakotans, their income has virtually been wiped away.\n  Is it any wonder they are in deep trouble? We are not a State of big \ncorporate agrifactories. We are a State largely composed of family \nfarms. When they suffer a loss of virtually all of their income, many \nof them just do not make it.\n  The current farm bill doesn't provide a bridge across price valleys. \nThe philosophy of the current farm bill is that you ought to operate in \nthe free market. If there is a price valley, the farmer is told, \n``Tough luck; try and find your way across the valley.''\n  So because we don't have that pricing bridge under this economic \nphilosophy, family farmers certainly don't get to the other side. The \nhead of our Farm Service Agency says 3,500 farms will not be in the \nfield next spring in North Dakota.\n  I am betting that if any other Member of this body had the same set \nof statistics in front of them concerning what is happening to their \nfamily farmers would also be here. They would be here with as much \nenergy and as much passion as I have to see if we can't change this \nresult and to do whatever we need to do to change it.\n  The underlying bill has disaster assistance. I am very appreciative \nof that. We might argue about who provides more. But overall, frankly, \nI think the underlying bill, and the administration, and virtually \neveryone who is party to this has offered a fairly decent package with \nrespect to disaster assistance.\n  The Senator from Mississippi correctly pointed out that he and \nSenator Lott accepted the $500 million indemnity program amendment that \nwe put into in the bill in the Senate in the first instance to deal \nwith the initial estimate of damages from the disaster in the Northern \nPlains. That amendment was done prior to the almost complete collapse \nof the cotton crop in Texas and the devastation in Louisiana, Oklahoma \nand other States. At that time we all understood that the disaster \nindemnity program was going to have to be increased at some point along \nthe way. The disaster package in this appropriations bill started with \nthe acceptance by the Senator from Mississippi to put in the $500 \nmillion indemnity for the Northern Plains. I appreciate that.\n  I am not here to argue about which disaster proposal for this bill is \nbetter than the other. Both the President and the conference report \naddressed this disaster issue in a very significant way. But, I am here \nto say that is not enough.\n  On top of the disaster provision, as the Senator from Mississippi \nindicated, the majority party added a 18-cents-a-bushel payment for \nwheat. This additional AMTA payment really only means that farmers will \nget 13 cents a bushel for wheat when it is all figured out. That is \nbecause AMTA payments are made on only 85 percent of contract acreage \non the frozen historic yields. So the real assistance to deal with \nprice collapse in this bill amounts to 13 cents a bushel for wheat. And \nit is not enough.\n  It won't allow farmers enough cashflow. It won't allow their bankers \nto decide that they will get another loan to go to the fields next \nspring to plant crops. They simply won't be able to do it. That is the \ndilemma. This is not enough. And there isn't any way to argue to say \nthat it is enough, or that it will solve this problem.\n  If numbers are to be believed with respect to the estimates in North \nDakota, at least 3,500 farm families are going to be washed away. These \nfarm families are not going to be able to farm next spring. I am not \nwilling to accept that result. It is not a fair result. Family farmers \nare not getting their share of this country's national income. They \nshould be expected to get a decent share of that.\n  Let me show you what family farms face. They are told that they \nshould just go ahead and operate in the free market and whatever \nhappens, happens. What is that free market about? Everywhere they look, \nthey confront near monopolies, or at least enormous concentrations of \neconomic power. The top four firms in this country control 62 percent \nof flour milling. The top four firms in dry corn milling control 57 \npercent. In wet corn milling, the top four control 76 percent. In \nsoybean crushing, the top four have 76 percent.\n  If a farmer happens to produce livestock and he markets that cow, he \nfinds that 87 percent of the beef slaughter is controlled by the top \nfour firms. The top four control 73 percent of sheep slaughter. It is \n60 percent for pork. Or, if farmers want to haul their grain to market \non a railroad--and most of them have to--they stick it on a rail car \nsomewhere in my State, and they get double charged at least because \nthere is no competition.\n  I have mentioned this before and I will say it again. If you put a \ncarload of wheat on the rail track in Bismarck and haul it to \nMinneapolis, they charge you $2,300. If you put it on a car in \nMinneapolis, and haul it to Chicago, which is about the same distance, \nit costs you $1,000. Why do we get double charged? Because there is no \nrail competition in North Dakota, while there are multiple lines \nbetween Minneapolis and Chicago.\n  So it is not just concentration among processors. It is also the \ntransportation components of the grain trade that are highly \nconcentrated. This isn't a circumstance where there is a free market. \nYet farmers are told to operate in the free market. If prices collapse, \nthey are told tough luck, and we will give you 13 cents. If they can't \nmake it with that, tougher luck.\n  Those want to pass this bill also contemplate tax cuts that they say \nwill help farmers. Tax cuts don't help people without income. The \nproblem in\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\nfarm country is lack of income. The first thing we should do is to \nrestore income.\n  I happen to support most of those tax proposals that I have heard \nabout. In fact, some that the Senator from Mississippi described today \nhave great merit. I support fully deductible health insurance for sole \nproprietorships and income averaging. I can go down a whole list of \nproposals that I support. My point is that first we need to restore \nincome to these family farmers. They need to get a fair share of this \nNation's income.\n  The fact is that everybody who touches products produced by these \nfarmers is virtually making record profits. The railroads? You bet your \nlife they are doing fine. They haul the farmers' products. How about \nthe slaughterhouses? Are they doing fine? You bet they have solid \nprofits. They are the ones who slaughter the livestock that is sent to \nmarket by those farmers.\n  How about the cereal manufacturers who put the snap, crackle and pop \ninto a cereal. They take a kernel of wheat, put it in a plant some \nplace, put it in a bright-colored box, ship it to a grocery store, and \nsell it at $4 a box. The company that puts the puff in puffed wheat \nmakes far more than the person who gassed the tractor, planted the \nseed, and harvested that wheat. In fact, the person that harvested the \nwheat that they planted is going broke. And the people who are puffing \nit, crackling it, and snapping it are having record profits.\n  I don't understand the notion that somehow, if we just do nothing, \nthings will work out. When we look at all of the evidence here, we are \ngoing to lose tens and tens of thousands of family farmers across this \ncountry unless this Congress does what it needs to do now. We need to \nprovide some decent price supports to get farmers across this price \nvalley.\n  I am not standing here asking that we tip the current farm program \nupside down. I didn't vote for the current farm program. I am not going \nto stand here and provide a litany of why I think it is not a good \nprogram. I am not suggesting we tip it upside down. I am simply saying \nwhat this farm program did in the big print it took away in the small \nprint. This farm program, passed by this Congress, said we would \nprovide farmers 85 percent of the five-year Olympic average price as a \nprice support in the form of a loan rate. That is what it said in the \nbig print. In the small print it said that the 85 percent of the five-\nyear Olympic average price would be capped. The small print says we \nwill put an artificial cap on it to bring the loan rates way down.\n  All we are saying is that we should take the artificial cap off. Do \nwhat the big print said the farm bill will do. Get rid of the small \nprint that took away that help to the family farmers.\n  In North Dakota it means a $156 million difference just on the price \nsupport mechanism. The difference for the farmers in my State alone is \n$156 million. That could well mean the difference between making it and \nnot making it. It can mean the difference between succeeding and \nfailing.\n  A young fellow wrote to me recently. I have referred to his letter \npreviously in the last couple of days. His name is Wyatt. He is a \nsophomore in high school at Stanley, ND. He wrote this plaintive cry \nfor help on behalf of his family farm. He is a young boy who loves to \nfarm. He knows his dad and mom do as well. He wrote me a letter that \nsays, ``My dad can feed 180 people. And he can't feed his family.'' He \nwas describing a circumstance where his family's income has been washed \nout. Their family farm may not be able to make it and he wonders \nwhether that is fair, and whether that is good economic policy for this \ncountry. The answer clearly is no, that is not fair. And clearly it is \nnot good economic policy for our country.\n  Both the independent community bankers in my State and the North \nDakota Bankers Association tell me that if we don't pass some \nmeaningful assistance this year these farmers won't be in the field \nnext spring. That is from the lenders.\n\n  This weekend, I was reading some of President Truman's speeches in \n1948. I want to read a couple of pieces from President Truman in 1948. \nOld Harry was doing a whistle stop tour on a train back then. I like \nHarry Truman. Harry spoke plainly and never minced any words. I thought \nmaybe we would celebrate just a bit of what Harry Truman said about \nfamily farmers and what this debate is about today.\n  Harry Truman said at the National Plowing Match in Dexter, IA, \nSeptember 18, 1948:\n\n       [I] believe that farmers are entitled to share equally with \n     others in our national income. [I] believe a prosperous and \n     productive agriculture is essential to [this country's] \n     national welfare.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Those who are wilfully trying to discredit the price \n     support program for farmers don't want the farmers to be \n     prosperous. They believe in low prices for farmers, cheap \n     wages for labor, and high profits for big corporations.\n\n  And then he said:\n\n       The big money [interests look] on agriculture and labor as \n     merely an expense item in a business venture. [They try] to \n     push their share of the national income down as low as \n     possible and increase [their] own profits. And [they] look \n     upon the Government as a tool to accomplish this purpose.\n\n  That was 1948, 50 years ago. Isn't it interesting that as we stand \nhere debating agriculture, in North Dakota there are probably 12,000 to \n14,000 citizens who will not get into the fields next spring unless \nthis Congress does the right thing. At least 3,500 farms will go belly \nup. That is 12,000 to 14,000 people, who will lose their livelihood \nunless we do the right thing. Yet, surrounding those farmers are the \nbigger economic interests that are all making money. There are the \nrailroads, slaughterhouses, grain trader, cereal manufacturers, grocery \nmanufacturers, and you can name all the others that are all making \nrecord profits.\n  Does that say something about whether the system is fair? And you \nmight say, well, what business is it of ours? The business for this \ncountry is that if we do not act, we will not have people living in the \ncountry. We will not have people living out on the land. We won't have \nyard lights illuminating those family farms. We won't have the \nJeffersonian notion of broad-based economic democracy in America if we \ndon't start caring a bit about whether we have family farmers in our \nfuture.\n  Instead, we will end up having big agribusiness in control in rural \nAmerica from California to Maine. When they do that, the price of food \nwill go way up, and then they will have cornered everything. I guess \nthey can haul it, process it, slaughter it, and make money off of that \nand then finally they can grow it because they got rid of mom and pop \non the family farm. You ask them, would that be good for the country? I \ndon't think so.\n  So this issue is very simple. Is what the conference committee \nbrought to the Senate floor enough? The answer is clearly no. It is not \nnearly good enough. Do we have the resources in this country to do \nbetter and do what we should? The answer is yes, clearly yes. For those \nwho believe in this as a priority, there are clearly enough resources \nto make the difference. I hope that if the Congress falls short, the \nPresident will veto the legislation as he indicated earlier. He should \nsend it back and say let us do better. We can do better and work \ntogether.\n  We must understand that there are two components, one of which is a \ndisaster component. For that portion I commend the Senator from \nMississippi and the entire conference. But the second portion is the \nprice support component. These two components added together must be \nenough to give farmers some hope and some opportunity. This bill falls \nfar short of that.\n  As I mentioned in my opening statement, it is not the case that \nsomehow the proposal to increase the price supports that are available \nto family farmers has just emerged from some mysterious corner of \npolicy making. That is not the case at all. We have already had two \nvotes in the Senate on this issue of raising price supports. We have \nlost by a handful of votes both times, and we may lose again. But, I \nwill be here through the last breath of legislative effort to see that \nthis Congress is persuaded to do the right thing for these family \nfarmers.\n  These 3,500 farm families deserve a chance. They didn't cause the \nAsian financial crisis. They didn't cause the crisis in Asia which \nmeans that this country can export fewer agricultural goods to Asia. \nFamily farmers didn't cause crop disease. Family farmers didn't cause \nthe collapse of grain\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\nprices. Family farmers didn't cause the incessant wet cycle in our part \nof the country that has helped exacerbate crop disease. Family farmers \ndidn't cause these problems. And this Congress should not say to family \nfarmers, ``Well, you deal with it. And if you can't, you don't \nmatter.''\n  This Congress ought to extend a helping hand to say to family \nfarmers, ``We want to help you over this trouble spot. We want to help \nyou survive because you are important to this country.''\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, first of all, I would like to start out thanking my \ncolleague from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. Above and beyond his \nability as Senator, I think probably the best thing about him is his \ncivility, and I wish I wasn't in profound disagreement with my \ncolleague, but I am. I do wish to thank him for some of the good things \nin this bill. In this appropriations bill, we are talking about farm \nprograms; we are talking about nutrition programs, forestry, and also \nthere is a great deal of research money. In particular, I am very \npleased that we are going to see additional funding for research of the \nscab disease which is a terribly important problem for my State and \ncertainly for North Dakota as well. The faculty at the University of \nMinnesota is doing some very important research in this area.\n  Madam President, I talked to our FSA director, Wally Sparby, and he \nsent me some information that I might just start out with. Mr. Sheldon \nErickson from Roseau, MN at Border State Bank is talking about the \nsituation of bankers: 90 percent of his farmers can't repay in 1998; 25 \npercent he won't be able to lend to in 1999; he says more equity \nlending is required but less is available. Percy Blake of Bremer Bank \nin Crookston, MN: 75 percent of borrowers won't be able to meet their \nobligations in 1998; 50 percent are in jeopardy of not being financed \nin the coming year; he says that regulators are trying to pressure them \naway from equity financing.\n  We have a plea and cry from not just family farmers in our \ncommunities, but from the lenders and small businesses and from the \ncitizens, I say to my colleague from Mississippi.\n  I have here petitions from all over the State of Minnesota. People \nwho signed these petitions did this with some hope. It says:\n\n       We, the people of rural Minnesota, exercising our \n     constitutional right to petition the Government for redress \n     of grievances, hereby state and declare: That the \n     exceptionally low prices being paid for farm commodities in \n     the State of Minnesota constitute a dire threat, a crisis \n     imperiling residents, businesses and institutions of rural \n     communities who are demanding an immediate response from our \n     Federal Government; that without action by the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to increase the support prices for corn, \n     soybeans, wheat, small grains, hogs, cattle and dairy \n     products and to extend loans and increase loan rates and to \n     make crop insurance coverage effective, thousands of families \n     relying on farming and rural businesses will lose their \n     livelihoods; that the 1996 Federal farm bill must be revised \n     this year in order to restore an economic safety net for \n     family farmers and allow them to support rural small \n     businesses and community institutions; that these destructive \n     policies must be reversed to ensure healthy main streets, \n     full schools and full churches in rural communities of the \n     State of Minnesota.\n\n  I say to the Chair, I don't know how many signatures there are here, \nbut this is just a sample of the people. Let me show you those who have \nsigned their names to this with the hope that it will make a \ndifference.\n  Madam Chair, the differences between this bill's $4 billion package \nand the $7 billion package that we proposed are ones that make a \ndifference.\n  Part of it has to do with the amount of assistance, but the big issue \nis the price crisis. I am actually not going to speak that long on the \nfloor of the Senate because my colleagues, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska \nand Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, have already spoken about this. \nIn many ways what we are struggling with is not just the wet weather \nand not just the scab disease, but disastrously low prices. It is hard \nto believe that we really want to have such a low cap as that in the \nFreedom to Farm bill--I call it the ``Freedom to Fail'' bill--at a time \nwhen prices are so low.\n  In our proposal we talked about taking the current cap off the loan \nrate. As I hear from people in our communities--not just the farmers \nbut the lenders as well--this is the most direct and dramatic way that \nwe can get some income to these families. We would raise the loan rate \nabout 57 cents a bushel for wheat, about 27 cents a bushel for corn, \nand over 20 cents a bushel for soybeans. That would be what would \nhappen if we would lift the cap.\n  What was not anticipated--I think my colleague from Mississippi would \nagree with me on this point--when the Freedom to Farm bill, or \n``Freedom to Fail'' bill, was passed, was that the prices would \nplummet. I do not think Senators realized that, although I think \nfarmers have always known that prices go up and down. What happened is \nwe basically eliminated the leverage the farmers have in the \nmarketplace --where the loan rate helps them in their dealing with \ngrain companies. In addition there was a safety net that was extremely \nimportant. At least it provided some direct assistance to people. We \nhave eliminated that.\n  I say to my colleagues today, I appreciate their work, but this \nrelief package will not do the job. It is impossible for me as a \nSenator to come out here and speak for it or to vote for it. It is very \nimportant that the President veto this. The President said he will. It \nis important that we get back to negotiations and work out a package \ntogether. It has to be a bipartisan package.\n  Just in terms of corn growers who currently are receiving $1.50 a \nbushel for corn or less, they cannot cash flow on that. The same is \ngoing on with our wheat farmers--low prices.\n  I think surely we will hear from Senator Feingold from Wisconsin. \nSenator Kohl actually has just come out on the floor. Our dairy farmers \nin the upper Midwest have been going under. We have a federal milk \nmarketing order system that is absolutely discriminatory, and there is \na legislative rider in this appropriations bill which effectively \nextends that discrimination another half a year. That is completely \nunsatisfactory, at the very time the Secretary of Agriculture has put a \nprocess into effect to examine and reform this system. That reform \nprocess is not enough for many of us, but we appreciate it as a \npositive step, moving forward. Now that reform process will be \npostponed for an additional 6 months under the provision of this \nlegislative rider, which in addition has the effect of extending for 6 \nmonths the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, another policy which has \na discriminatory effect upon dairy producers and the dairy industry of \nthe upper Midwest.\n  So, as a Senator from Minnesota, I cannot in good conscience support \nan appropriations bill that will not provide the needed assistance to \nfamily farmers in rural communities in my State. It would amount to \nbetrayal. People are in desperate shape. That is the ``why'' of all \nthese petitions. That is the ``why'' of all the meetings I have \nattended: in Crookston, East Grand Forks, Granite Falls, Fulda, \nWorthington. That is the ``why'' of grown men and women crying because \nthey are being driven off their farms. They work there, they live \nthere, it is everything that they have ever worked for.\n  Nobody can say we are talking about a group of citizens who do not \nwork hard, but this just seems beyond their control. Now we have an \nappropriations bill that does not deal with the price crisis, that does \nnot get enough relief out there, that is not going to enable these \npeople to stay on the farms. It does not do the job.\n  I think family farmers in rural America know that. We have to do \nbetter. Senator Cochran has done all that he can do. I think he has \npushed hard for what he thinks is right. But some of the rest of us \nhave to come out here and we have to fight hard for what we think is \nright. The President has to stay strong, and he has said he will veto \nthis bill. We need to go back to the table and put negotiations on a \nfast-track to get a farm crisis relief package that will do the job.\n  For my State, the differences between the two packages amount to a \nquarter of a billion dollars. That is $250 million more for family \nfarmers and small businesses in rural communities. This is a decisive \nmoment for the State\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nof Minnesota, for agriculture and for family farmers.\n  In many parts of our country we hardly have a family farm structure \nof agriculture any longer, where the people who live on the land make \nthe investments and work on the land. In the Midwest I think we \nunderstand a very sound economic point, which is also, I think, a \nsocial message: the health and vitality of our communities are not \nbased upon the number of acres that are farmed or the number of animals \nthat are owned. Somebody will always farm that land or own that land. \nThe question is, Are we going to have family farmers? The health and \nvitality of our communities are based upon the number of farmers--I say \nto the Senator from Wisconsin--the number of family dairy farmers.\n  We have a crisis, and that crisis deserves a strong and effective \nresponse from the U.S. Congress. This appropriations bill--and I say \nthis not in a shrill way but in a very determined way--is not an \nadequate response to that crisis.\n  Therefore, I will vote against it. I call on the President to veto \nit. And I call on my colleagues please to work together and do better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to discuss the conference report \nthat is before us as well. I want to start by acknowledging the efforts \nof the chairman of the committee, Senator Cochran. Senator Cochran, I \nthink, is really one of the most decent Members in this Chamber. He is \nsomebody I respect, somebody I like, somebody who has made a real \ncontribution in the Agriculture Committee in previous years as well as \nbeing chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee. So I \nacknowledge right up front he is someone, I think, who has the best \ninterests of American agriculture at heart.\n  But he is not the only one to make the decisions. He has to make the \ndecision, not only in the Senate Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee, but in a conference committee. It is a conference between \nthe Senate and the House. And what has been brought back to this \nChamber is inadequate.\n  I represent North Dakota. North Dakota has been absolutely devastated \nby what I call the triple whammy of bad prices, bad weather and bad \npolicy. That triple whammy has washed away farm income.\n  This chart shows the Government's own figures. From 1996 to 1997, we \nsaw a 98-percent drop in farm income in the State of North Dakota. That \nis a crisis by any definition. It is a combination of terrible prices--\nwe have the lowest prices in 50 years--coupled with natural disasters--\nwe have had an outbreak of scab and other fungi because of continuing \noverly wet conditions--and then we have, on top of it, bad policy.\n  The last farm bill, I don't know how else to say it, is bad policy. \nIt is its own disaster, because, in previous times, if prices would \nhave collapsed, there would have been an automatic adjustment \nmechanism. That automatic adjustment mechanism has been taken away, and \nthe result is now, when prices collapse and you have a natural \ndisaster, there is not much there. The result is literally thousands of \nfarmers in our State being forced off the land.\n  When the Secretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota, his crisis \nresponse team told him over the next 2 years we could lose 30 percent \nof the farmers in North Dakota--30 percent. That would change the face \nof our State forever.\n  We have no choice but to fight. We have no choice but to come out and \nplead with our colleagues to do better and to do more, because if we \nfail, there will be dire consequences, not only in our State, but in \nother farm-belt States as well.\n  It is not just conditions in North Dakota, although we have had the \nworst conditions. The price collapse is affecting everybody in the farm \nbelt. This chart shows what has happened to spring wheat prices over a \nvery extended period. This shows what has happened to prices from 1946 \nto 1998, 52 years of prices. You can see we are at an all-time low. In \n52 years, this is the lowest they have ever been, adjusted for \ninflation. This is it. At no time in 52 years have prices been lower \nthan they are today.\n  It is not just spring wheat prices. We lead the Nation in production \nof spring wheat, or at least in many years we do. Barley is also a \nmajor crop in North Dakota. Again, 52 years of history, and here we are \ntoday, the lowest prices in 52 years. When I talk about the triple \nwhammy of bad prices, bad weather and bad policy, the bad prices are \nabundantly clear. We have the worst prices in 52 years.\n  We have looked at spring wheat. We looked at barley. This chart shows \ndurum prices. Does it look familiar? It is exactly the same pattern, \nthe lowest prices in 52 years. You can look back on the whole period of \n52 years, and prices have never been lower.\n  When we then look at what our colleagues have brought before us from \nthe conference committee, we can see that the Republican plan does not \nmeasure up. The Democratic plan is $7.5 billion. Some estimates are as \nhigh as $7.8 billion. The Republican plan is $4.1 billion.\n  I must say to you, Madam President, and say to my colleagues, \nhonestly, even the Democratic plan will not solve this problem. If you \ngo back to 1986, the Federal Government spent $26 billion because we \nwere faced with a similar farm economy.\n  We are not going to be anywhere close to that. We will be less than \nhalf of that level of funding this year, even if the Democratic plan \npasses. Make no mistake, the Democratic plan does not solve the \nproblem, but what our Republican colleagues are offering is totally \ninadequate. It is not going to stem the tide. It is not going to \nprevent literally thousands of family farmers from being forced off the \nland.\n  I just had a series of meetings all across my State, and every town I \ngo to, there are large meetings of farmers. It is very interesting \nbecause usually when I hold meetings like this, it is just farmers. Not \nthis year. Now it is Main Street businesspeople. The mayors and city \ncouncilmen in the cities and the bankers are all coming to these \nmeetings, many of whom have never attended a farm meeting in my 12 \nyears in the U.S. Senate, stopping me afterwards and saying, ``Senator, \nthere's something radically, radically wrong, and unless something is \ndone and done quickly, not only is that farmer going to fail, but the \nMain Street businesses are going to fail and the towns themselves are \ngoing to fail.''\n  For the first time ever in my experience, mayors and city councilmen \nare coming to my meetings and telling me that the cities are going to \nfail unless something dramatic is done and done quickly.\n  If we look at the constituent elements of the plan, the first part \ninvolves support on the income side. The Democrats call for removing \nthe marketing loan rate caps. The Republicans call for increased \ntransition payments. There is a dramatic difference here. The \nDemocratic plan costs over $5 billion; the Republican plan, less than \none-third of that.\n  The difference here is the Democratic plan says that the loan rate \ncaps that were put in the last farm bill at a very low level, \nartificially low level, especially on the commodities that we produce \nin our part of the country, leave farmers in a circumstance in which if \nprices collapse, they have no protection.\n  Some have said, ``Gee, you're going to give a loan to farmers who \nhave an income problem? Isn't that just digging the hole deeper?'' Let \nme explain for those who may be listening that a marketing loan in \nagriculture is not like a normal loan.\n  A marketing loan in agriculture works this way: A farmer gets a \nloan--and in the farm bill, on wheat it is $2.58, but if the price goes \nbelow that, if the farmer sells for not $2.58 but sells for $2, he \ndoesn't have to pay back the difference between the market price and \nthe loan rate. That is why it is called a marketing loan. He only pays \nall of it back if prices exceed the amount of the loan level. This \ndoesn't build debt. This is a floor under income. It is to guard \nagainst the kind of price collapse that we have occurring now.\n  Unfortunately, in the new farm bill, the loan rates were capped at an \nartificially low level. They did that because of a budget \nconsideration. That is why these loan levels were set at such low \nrates, because, frankly, agriculture was cut dramatically at the same \ntime the\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nnew farm bill was put in place. In fact, much of the problem that we \nare experiencing with the new farm bill is not the specifics of the \nfarm bill as much as the budget limitation that we were under when the \nfarm bill was written.\n  In fact, the support for agriculture was cut in half at the time the \nlast farm bill was written. In the previous 5 years, we had been \ngetting about $10 billion a year to support agriculture. Under the new \nbudget agreement, that was cut in half, to about $5 billion a year. \nThat is one reason we are in such desperate shape, because our major \ncompetitors, the Europeans, are spending almost $50 billion a year, 10 \ntimes as much as we are to support our producers. It is not too hard to \nunderstand that the Europeans are on the move, they are on the march, \nthey are gaining market share because they are doing it the old-\nfashioned way: They are buying these markets.\n  Madam President, one thing we have to ask ourselves is do we want to \nroll over, do we want to play dead, do we want to fly the white flag of \nsurrender when our major competitors are spending 10 times as much as \nwe are to support their producers?\n  I said at the time I thought it represented unilateral disarmament, \nthat the United States was making a profound mistake, because the \nEuropeans have a strategy and they have a plan. And, oh, how well that \nstrategy and plan are working. Their strategy and their plan is to \ndominate world agricultural trade.\n  If you look at the trend lines in agriculture, you can see that their \nstrategy and their plan are working very well. They have gone from \nbeing major importers to being major exporters in just 10 years. In the \nUnited States we are going backwards. If you look at our world \nposition, it is slipping. And it is slipping in part because we are not \nin this fight. We have ceded it to our competitors.\n  Why do they have a different view? In part, because they have been \nhungry twice in Europe. They do not intend to be hungry again. But more \nthan that, they have decided it makes sense to have people out across \nthe land. They do not want everybody forced into the cities. And we \nhave to make a decision in this country. Do we want everybody to go to \nthe cities? Because if that is what we want, we are on schedule. We are \nright on track because that is what is going to happen. We are going to \nsee the people from the farms move into the cities because you cannot \nmake a living on the farm.\n  So the first part of the difference between these two plans is on the \nincome side of the house. The Democrats have a plan of over $5 billion \nof assistance. The Republicans are offering $1.6 billion.\n  If you look at the specifics between the two, you again see that the \nRepublican plan just does not measure up. The Democratic plan on wheat \nwould provide 57 cents a bushel.\n  When prices are at the lowest they have ever been--prices in my State \nare down to $2.50 a bushel on wheat. That is the least they have ever \nbeen, at least in the 52 years we have looked at putting these records \ntogether--the lowest prices in 52 years. The Democrats have a rescue \nplan of 57 cents a bushel. The Republican plan would provide 13 cents a \nbushel on wheat. And 13 cents a bushel is not going to pay many bills, \nvery frankly.\n  When I tell the farmers back home that the Republican plan would \nprovide 13 cents a bushel, the reaction is a combination of \nmystification, anger, and disbelief. They cannot believe in this \ncircumstance that the best we can do is 13 cents a bushel.\n  On barley, the Democratic plan is 23 cents; in the Republican plan it \nis 6 cents a bushel.\n  On corn, the Democratic plan is 28 cents a bushel; the Republican \nplan one-quarter of that, 7 cents a bushel.\n  And on soybeans, the Democratic plan is 28 cents a bushel; the \nRepublican plan is 2 cents.\n  Madam President, that is the income side of this proposal to deal \nwith the crisis.\n  On the indemnity relief plan, that part of the plan that is designed \nto deal with the natural disasters that are occurring around the \ncountry, the Democratic plan is $2.48 billion of money that would go \nout to farmers; the Republican plan, $2.43 billion. And you can see the \ndifferences in the two plans.\n  The Democratic plan has $935 million for multiyear loss indemnity; \n$960 million for the 1998 loss indemnity--that would go primarily to \nthe South, the second part there, because those are folks that have \njust suffered losses in 1998. In our part of the country, we have \nmultiple-year losses--3, 4, or 5 bad years in a row because of natural \ndisasters.\n  The third element of the Democratic plan is for noninsurable, \nuninsured crops, $250 million. There is a fourth element, $50 million \nfor flood compensation. These are for folks who do not qualify for \nanything. Their land is under water. And we have people in North \nDakota, northeastern North Dakota whose land has been under water now \nfor 5 years. They have no income --none. The Republican plan is silent \nwith respect to those people. They get nothing. They have been getting \nnothing; they continue to get nothing. I guess there is at least a \nconsistency to that--nothing; that is what they get.\n  Those people--I just talked to one fellow who has put in everything \nhe has. He had an insurance settlement--put that in--and his lifetime \nsavings. This fellow used to be a world champion bull rider. He put all \nhis lifetime winnings in. Every single thing his family had he has put \ninto the pot. He is a remarkable, remarkable man. Five years in a row \nhe sees more and more of his land going under water, and his response \nis really remarkable. He is just hopeful that something good is going \nto happen. He is just happy to be alive. But he is really counting on \nus to do something. The Republican plan does nothing.\n  Emergency livestock assistance, there is $200 million in the \nDemocratic plan. There is $31 million for farm operating loans. There \nis $40 million for an FSA increased workload; $10 million for U.S. \nForest Service assistance; $10 million for tree assistance--for a total \nof $2.48 billion. You can see the comparable elements to the Republican \nplan, which is roughly equivalent.\n  Madam President, another way to look at this is to look at individual \nfarmers. What happens in these different plans? So we took three \nexamples from North Dakota and looked at individual producers with \nindividual situations and compared what the two plans would provide the \nindividual farmer.\n  Chart A relates to our first producer. We are not using names here \nbecause we thought it would be more appropriate to label them A, B and \nC. This chart represents a typical North Dakota producer who farms 500 \nacres of wheat, 300 acres of barley and is suffering only from low \nprices. He has not been affected by the bad weather. And we look at \nwhat he would receive under the Democratic plan, which is $12,630. In \nthe Republican plan it is about one-quarter of that. This is a \ncircumstance in which somebody has not been affected by bad weather, \njust the very low prices.\n  Producer B represents a circumstance that shows a typical North \nDakota producer, what they can expect to receive from suffering not \nonly low prices, but also has repeated years of crop loss due to \nnatural disasters, such things as flooding or the crop disease scab. So \nthis is producer B who is suffering from low prices and from natural \ndisaster. And under the Democratic plan this farmer would get $22,130; \nunder the Republican plan they get $12,686.\n  Producer C is somebody who has really got the triple whammy. This \nproducer is not only affected by low prices, he has also had repeated \nyears of disaster and has flooded land. Under the Democratic plan they \nwould get $28,000 of assistance; under the Republican plan $12,686.\n  Madam President, these are specific examples of what people would \nexperience under the two plans. I say to you that neither one of them \nare going to solve the problem. I mean, that is the truth of the \nmatter. This problem in my State is so deep and so serious that neither \nof these plans is going to solve the problem. In fact, if we do not do \na lot more next year, there are going to be thousands of farmers who \nnever get into the fields because their bankers will not finance them.\n  If you are looking at what we are doing, we are shoring them up to \ntry to get them to next year, trying to allow them to survive the \nwinter. But the\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\nhard reality is--the harsh reality is if we do not do something \ndramatically more this year and next year, those farmers are not going \nto plant because if you look at what the Republican plan does and what \nthe Democratic plan does, it provides money this year.\n  I guess we are all praying that prices increase. I hope that happens. \nI hope that happens. But with the collapse in Asia, I think, frankly--\nthe collapse in Russia as well--it is probably unlikely that prices \nwill increase substantially. And that means when the banker looks at \nthe income statement for a farmer, under the Republican plan what they \nsee is that we have moved forward the AMTA payments. We all agreed to \ndo that. Republicans are providing 13 cents more a bushel this year in \nassistance, but there is nothing for next year. The AMTA payments that \nare supposed to be paid next year have been pulled into this year.\n\n  So when the banker looks at the income payments for the farmer for \nnext year, all he looks at are the price projections for the \ncommodities that are going to be produced on that farm. Bankers are \ntelling me they are not going to be able to extend loans to farmers \nnext year if either one of these packages passes because we are not \ndoing anything about next year. The families are going to their bankers \nin February and March to get operating money for next year.\n  I had blown up a letter I got from a constituent back home that \nexplains it very well. This is from Steve and Stephanie Johnson. \nStephanie wrote the letter from Luverne, ND:\n\n       I am writing in hopes that it will encourage you to quickly \n     push forward the farm assistance program that is in the \n     works.\n\n  She goes on to describe that they are farming near Luverne, ND, they \nhave 90 head of cattle, 13 head of horses. They raise corn, wheat, \nbarley, sunflowers, and canola. She works as an RN outside the home, 24 \nto 40 hours a week, which pays part of their health insurance and most \nof their bills. Her husband works usually 12 hours a day, 6 to 7 days a \nweek, and he works 24 hours a day during calving time in February or \nMarch. He made $12,000 of farm income this year, of which $2,000 and an \nincome tax return of $1,000 went to pay part of the 1997 operating loan \nbalance. So that leaves her husband with $10,000 for the entire year of \n1998. As she points out, that is $833 a month without benefits. That \namounts to $2.30 an hour. That doesn't include the labor that she and \nher son have put into the farm either. She says:\n\n       The really sad part of this is we didn't have to take \n     operating loans in the 12 years my husband has been farming \n     until 4 years ago.\n       The cattle and the horses have helped us break even in the \n     past, but in these last few years we can't even do that.\n\n  She says in capital letters:\n\n       With skyrocketing production costs and plummeting prices it \n     is obvious that you can't quite break even. Something needs \n     to be done quickly.\n\n  Madam President, she goes on to say:\n\n       We are in no way asking for handouts, only fair prices. We \n     have to pay whatever price the retailers put on our products, \n     but we have no way to set our prices on our products.\n\n  She concludes by saying:\n\n       We are not sure if we will farm next year, my husband \n     doesn't want to lose everything he has worked for in the past \n     12 years. Nor do I think either of us can take any more \n     stress. We are losing numerous family farmers in our area, in \n     the past few years, 4 of our neighbors quit or were forced to \n     quit. Isn't it time to do something?\n\n  Madam President, it is time to do something and it is time to do \nsomething that is much more significant than what is in this conference \nreport. The truth is, it is not going to solve this problem. It isn't \neven a Band-Aid on the problem. At least a Band-Aid covers a wound. I \ncan say if this is the best we do, then we are consigning thousands of \nfarmers--thousands of farmers--to the auction block, because that is \nexactly what is going to happen in our State.\n  Finally, to put this in perspective, this chart shows what we are \nspending to support our producers and what the Europeans are spending \nto support theirs. We are spending $5 billion a year; they are spending \nnearly $50 billion a year. If we add $7 billion to that total, we are \nstill being outspent nearly 4-1. I submit that it is pretty hard to win \na fight when the other side is outspending you 4-1, much less the 10-1 \nthat is currently happening.\n  I hope before we are done with this legislative session that we will \ngo back to the drawing boards and substantially strengthen the package \nthat is before the Senate. It is absolutely critically important to the \nState I represent, and I think it is fair to say that there are many \nother States whose farm producers are in much the same shape as the \npeople who are farming in North Dakota. Bedeviled by the triple whammy \nof bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy--not much we can do about \nthe weather; perhaps not much we can do in the short run about prices; \nwe can do something about the policy that is passed on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I implore my colleagues to join with others of us who really want to \nmake certain that farmers have a fighting chance, a chance to get \nthrough this winter, a chance to be out plowing those fields again next \nspring.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and their patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the fiscal year 1999 \nAgricultural appropriations conference report. This bill would delay \nreform of the current milk pricing system and extend the life of the \ncontroversial Northeast Dairy Compact. Both policies would cost \nconsumers and hurt dairy farmers in the Midwest.\n  Most of the debate on this bill has rightly been about how we can \nhelp farmers devastated by drought and low crop yields. But just as we \nmust act to help them, we should not act to harm the dairy farmers of \nWisconsin and other Midwestern states.\n  It is not as if there is support for the damaging dairy policies in \nthis bill. Twenty-five Senators have signed a letter opposing extension \nof the current milk pricing system and the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. The Judiciary Committee has requested that no action be taken \nto renew the Compact without their review.\n  And it is by no means certain that the Compact could survive \nscrutiny. The higher prices ordered by the Compact are leading to \nhigher consumer prices and a continued decline in fluid milk \nconsumption. Worse yet, these higher prices are primarily benefiting \nlarge dairy farms. In Vermont the largest 7 percent of farms receive 30 \npercent of the Compact revenues.\n  As for extending the USDA's time to review the milk pricing system, \nthat is unnecessary. By delaying reform, this legislation does exactly \nwhat the authors of the 1996 Farm Bill were trying to prevent. Congress \ndeliberately gave the job of reform to the Secretary of Agriculture so \nit could be done in a more analytical and less political environment. \nOur actions today put the antiquated dairy pricing system back into the \npolitical arena that created it in the first place.\n  To many of you, this may seem to be an arcane debate with little real \nimpact. But in Wisconsin, and through the Midwest region, the current \ninequitable pricing system is destroying family farms--not because they \nare uncompetitive, but because of a system that closes off regional \nmarkets and prices milk based on where it is made, not on its quality \nor its cost. Our actions today punish a traditional and successful \nindustry. We are making the Midwest dairy farmers the victims of \nregional infighting and inside-the beltway politics. That is wrong. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n\n\n                             long park dam\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to raise an issue addressed in the Senate \nreport language regarding the Long Park Dam in Daggett County, Utah. \nDaggett County is the smallest county in Utah, with a population of \njust over 700 people. It is also the home of the Flaming Gorge \nRecreation Area, which is host to over 2 million visitors annually.\n  I appreciate the committee's efforts to provide some assistance in \nrepairing the dam through the water and waste disposal loans and grants \nprogram under RCAP. The city of Manila already has acquired a loan for \na new treatment plant for Long Park Dam water, which has now been put \nin jeopardy because of the structural problems in the Long Park Dam. \nThe city has a very limited capacity to assume more debt to repair the \ndam.\n  Once the repairs on the dam are completed, the city would use as much \nas 50 percent of the water stored in Long\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\nPark Dam. Given the size of the communities involved and the limited \nability to assume new debt, would it be appropriate to remind the \nDepartment of the special circumstances in Daggett County and encourage \nthe Department to consider the community's current financial \nobligations when it reviews the grant application?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Senator from Utah is correct that here are some \nunique circumstances in this situation. I hope the Department will take \ninto consideration the impacts of visitation on the local communities \nand the limited tax base in Daggett County, as well as the current \nfinancial obligations of the communities involved. The Department \nshould be as flexible as possible when considering this application in \norder to provide a safe source of culinary water for the community as \nwell as the visitors to the area.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman for his comments.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport of the conference report on H.R. 4101, which is being discussed \non the floor and has been discussed on the floor by my colleagues from \nthe northern plains.\n  I also rise today to express my serious concerns with President \nClinton's threatened veto of this conference report, the agriculture \nappropriations bill--the bill that contains the spending for all of the \nessential programs that are of great benefit to farmers and ranchers. I \nwant to pay, as my colleagues have, very deserved tribute to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, who down through \nthe years has been a champion on behalf of America's agriculture \nproducers and basically serves as an oversight commissioner in regard \nto the spending we desperately need for research and development for \nour farmers to be competitive. He has done another outstanding job \nunder very, very difficult circumstances, because we are going through \nsome tough times in farm country. So I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, it is not my intent to get partisan in this debate. \nGoodness knows we have enough of that going around in this session. But \nI do think it is time for a little candor. In so doing, I noticed a \nreport from World Perspectives, Inc., which is a publication that comes \nout every day that provides Members of Congress and subscribers very \npertinent information regarding the global marketplace and worldwide \nagriculture. There is a young man that writes for them by the name of \nGregg Doud. Last week, he pretty well summarized, I think, what this \ndebate is all about. He said this:\n\n       On the legislative calendar, Christmas doesn't always come \n     on 25 December. When a sector of the U.S. economy is \n     faltering or votes are up for grabs, it usually means that \n     politicians will come bearing gifts sometime before the \n     November election.\n\n  Now, that is a little harsh. I am not too sure I would buy all of \nthat. He went on to say:\n\n       This year's low commodity prices, world financial \n     difficulties, and serious drought means that both U.S. \n     political parties are currently in a bidding war over how \n     much to spend in farm country.\n\n  Obviously, we are doing that because we think we have severe \nproblems. Those are my words, not his.\n\n       In their minds, the votes will eventually go to the highest \n     bidder. As a result, considerations about an appropriate \n     strategy for U.S. domestic farm policy could end up last on \n     the list of a policymaker's priorities.\n  In other words, if we are going to provide emergency assistance to \nfarmers and ranchers, that is one thing in the short term. But for \ngoodness' sake, let's not turn the firehose on and let it get away and \ndestroy a policy that makes sense over the long term.\n  Then Mr. Doud pointed out the history of these two proposals that had \nbeen discussed on the floor. He said, ``The announcement by \ncongressional Republicans of their package came only 2 days after \nAgriculture Secretary Glickman''--Mr. Glickman of Kansas, my former \ncolleague, and my good friend--``announced that he was reversing his \nstance to be in favor of lifting the cap on the nonrecourse marketing \nloan rate''--that is the basis of the Democrat plan--and then stated, \n``This flip-flop was likely an effort to avoid the appearance of \nconflicting policy positions within the Democratic Party.''\n  He continues, ``Secretary Glickman's announcement was coordinated \nwith an amendment offered by Senator Tom Harkin''--my colleague and \nfriend in Iowa who is the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and long a voice in regard to farm program policy advice and \ncounsel to his Iowa constituents and the Nation as well. But, at any \nrate, that was ``. . . to the Interior Department's appropriations \nbill.''\n  By my count, I think we debated this--I don't know how many hours had \nbeen devoted on the other side, because in the northern plains the \nsituation is much more severe. I don't know if the Senator from \nMississippi has tallied up the hours. There must be 50, 75 or 100 hours \non this side. We have spoken to the issue probably not as much as we \nshould have. But this is an issue that has been debated. As a matter of \nfact, I think we have had five votes. I think this is No. 5 in regard \nto a vote that we are going to have on this issue. So we have done \nquite a bit of debating.\n  I will continue with what I think is a candid assessment, and this is \nin regard to the Democratic plan to raise the commodity marketing loan \nrate.\n  Mr. Doud points out, however: ``It is not well suited to providing \ndisaster relief. How did the Government make a larger loan deficiency \npayment to a farmer who hasn't raised a crop?''\n  That is a good question.\n  ``In addition, this delivery mechanism does not reach livestock \nproducers and other nonprogram commodity producers.''\n  That certainly is a good quote.\n  Then he goes on to mention one thing, and this is sort of an aside. I \nam going to have to skip over here to a point that has been made by \nsome of my good Democrat colleagues, more especially the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, who, to be very candid, has never been too \nsupportive of the current farm bill.\n  The Senator from North Dakota decried the fact that under the new \nfarm bill, Freedom to Farm, in what he describes as the ``Freedom to \nFail'' bill, ``farmers were told to plant fence row to fence row.''\n  As Mr. Doud pointed out, and others of us would like to point out: \n``. . . but WPI thought farmers were told to respond to market signals, \nrather than Federal programs.''\n  Let me point out that in regard to wheat, the farmers made the \ndecision. They made that decision. They responded to the market \nsignals, and we haven't gone fence row to fence row. What happened was \nwe had 11 percent fewer acres planted to wheat under the new farm bill \nthan the old farm bill. That means this fence row to fence row business \nis not accurate.\n  What happened, of course, is the farmer put the seed in the ground, \nand it was better seed. And with better farming practices and precision \nagriculture, we knocked their socks off. We had great yields.\n  In the northern plains, they have all sorts of problems, wheat scab, \nweather, unfair trading practices, across the board, border contagion, \nyou name it, they have had it. Quite frankly, a Federal farm program in \nregard to sugar makes the land prices a little high and raises their \nprice and cost of production. It is high risk up there. Everybody knows \nthat. But not any of these things have anything to do with the farm \nbill.\n  The extra production came that drove the market prices lower--from \nChina, 200 million bushels more in regard to wheat production; the \nEuropean Union was about 300 million bushels more. I don't know of any \nU.S. farm law that can restrict China, or the European Union, or, for \nthat matter, Australia that has a record crop. It is not all in yet. We \ndon't know yet. But the global supply situation has changed \ndramatically.\n  That has nothing to do with the current farm bill. It has everything \nto do with our export strategy in regard to being competitive and using \nall of the tools we would like to have in regard to the \nadministration's conducting an aggressive export policy.\n  As a matter of fact, the president of the Wheat Growers said we have \nto quit taking a knife to a gun fight. We have to really get tough. And \nwe haven't done that. That is one of the problems. So I guess that \nwould be an accurate statement.\n  Let me get back to the article. This is by Mr. Doud, again:\n\n       Is the term ``crisis'' an appropriate way to describe the \n     situation in farm country today?\n\n  I will tell you one thing. If you are a farmer and you can't get a \nloan from\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nyour banker, and the price is about half of what it was several years \nago, it sure is a crisis. It is 100 percent.\n  ``At least one question needs to be answered before deciding how \nserious this situation really is.'' --I am back to Mr. Doud's \ncomments--``Will prices stay at the current (a 10-20-year low) level \ninto next crop year? If so, next year may bring reopened discussions, \nleave no stone unturned, on a major overhaul of U.S. farm policy.''\n  I think that is appropriate.\n  And I will be right in line with the rest of the people who are \nprivileged to represent agriculture States, if, in fact, that is the \ncase.\n  We have the unfair trading practice. We can't get our exports \ncracking. We don't pass the trade legislation that we should pass that \nthe President continues to sort of hunker down in the weeds in regard \nto fast track and other things.\n  Then he went on to say: ``In a Congressional election year, the \ndebate isn't about whether or not money should be allocated to farm \ncountry. It's about the delivery mechanism itself.''\n  Then he lists some information that ``. . . suggests that, even in \nWashington, DC, terms, the amount of Government expenditures in farm \ncountry this year is serious money.''\n  ``The potential direct U.S. Government outlays to U.S. producers are \nas follows:\n  No, it is not the $5.3 billion that showed up on the chart over there \nfrom my colleagues. But, in September 1998, this year, the second half \nof the transition payments will come to farmers.\n  Transition payments, called AMTA payments--that is the Agriculture \nMarketing Transition Assistance payments.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Mississippi raising his head. \nThe reason I wanted to point that out is that it has been ignored in \nthe debate. Hardly any Member on the other side mentions that we even \nhave transition payments. Everybody says, ``The bridge is washed out. I \ncan't swim. My farmers are on the other side.'' That is country western \nmusic. It has the wrong notes. We have the transition payments here. \nThey ignore that.\n  ``In September 1998, the second half of FY 1998 transition . . . \npayment''--by the way, that transition payment is the highest of any \npayment during the entire 6-year period of the farm bill. And I know it \nis the highest as of this year because I helped write the bill. I \nthought at the end of 2 years that we probably would be going through \nsome kind of a price swing. And I thought that assessment should be the \ngreatest in this particular year, and it is. How much? $5.7 billion is \nthe total with the first half having already been paid in December of \n1997, or January of 1998.\n  ``In October 1998, $5.5 billion will be made available in FY 1999 \ntransition . . . payments.''\n  That is next year. Farmers probably wouldn't want to accept that. I \nwouldn't, if I can get by with my lender and I can tighten up, because \nof the world markets and the situation. I probably wouldn't want to \ntake that. But it is available. And that is $5.5 billion.\n  ``Emergency assistance programs that are currently being discussed . \n. .''\n  That is what this debate is all about here. That is in addition to \nthose two transition payments that many of my colleagues are ignoring. \nThat is going to be about $4.1 billion. You add that up.\n  Then our Senate Agriculture Committee chairman, the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Dick Lugar, recently put \nthe possible marketing year price tag for the loan deficiency payment.\n  I am not going to get into a description of that payment. As a matter \nof fact, I talked about all of these payments. People wonder. My \ngoodness. How many payments are we making to farmers, and what kind and \nshape and form? But those will be about $2 or $3 billion. And then, \nfinally, crop insurance for the entire marketing year is $2 billion.\n\n  According to Mr. Doud, that totals up to $16.4 billion. That is a lot \nof money. Yes, the farm crisis is very serious. I understand that. But \n$16.4 billion is quite an investment in regard to agriculture.\n  Let me see if I can find a closer here. In regard to Mr. Doud's \narticle:\n\n       Policymakers should not ignore the message this [debate] \n     sends to trading partners and the WTO regarding U.S. domestic \n     farm policy, particularly as it applies to the next round of \n     trade negotiations. Once again, [we want to emphasize] that \n     in an even-numbered election year, the debate isn't about \n     whether or not money should be allocated to farm country. It \n     is about the delivery mechanism and whether or not ``Freedom \n     to Farm'' will be maintained. U.S. agricultural trading \n     partners will be paying [very] close attention to see if \n     ``Freedom to Farm'' survives.\n\n  Now, as the principal author of Freedom to Farm, I have an interest \nin this, but I said it didn't come down from the mountain on any tablet \nsaying this was the only farm bill; if the farm bill didn't work, you \nought to change it. And I think once this emergency assistance is \nprovided, if we can see what happens in 1999--and I hope the global \ncontagion gets better and I hope all the other factors improve--why, \nperhaps we won't have to do this. And if we can enact some of the \npromises we made in conjunction with Freedom to Farm, we shouldn't have \nto do it. But Congress has not done that and the administration has not \ndone that.\n  I want to now return to the threat of a Presidential veto.\n  The President has sent a letter to Congress stating he will not \nsupport legislation that does not include agricultural relief \nprovisions similar to the plan to uncap loan rates as proposed by \nSenators Harkin, Daschle, Wellstone, Kerrey, Conrad, Baucus, and \nJohnson.\n  He, as a matter of fact, took time out in his Saturday radio address \nto talk about two things--well, three; one, we have a serious farm \ncrisis. Right. Second, we need to uncap the loan rates. Wrong, because \nof what it will do that will be counterproductive to long-term policy \nto farmers and ranchers. Three, we ought to pass IMF. Yes. Yes, I am \nfor that. And I am just as unhappy with Members of my own party in the \nother body who oppose that. I think we need IMF. So the President was \nright about two out of three.\n  Let me talk about the plan that is promoted by the northern plains' \nSenators--not trying to pick on them; they have a very legitimate point \nof view--that would uncap the marketing loan rates and provide \napproximately $1 billion in disaster assistance to the northern plains. \nBut the other side of the story is that their proposal provides less \nthan $500 million for the rest of the United States, from New Mexico to \nMaryland, which has experienced drought, flooding, or a combination of \nboth.\n  I really find the President's arguments for his threatened veto \nrather frustrating and difficult because the administration really \nthreatens to veto this package--I am quoting here.\n\n       . . . if the bill presented to the President includes \n     agriculture disaster provisions that provide inadequate \n     indemnity assistance or are inconsistent with the Daschle-\n     Harkin proposal.\n\n  It is obvious the President really believes we need to provide \nassistance to our producers. I believe that as well. Yet he threatens \nto veto a bill that provides $4.1 billion in assistance to our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  And as long as we are mentioning vetoes, he has also threatened to \nveto a House-passed tax bill that also provides very needed relief to \nfarmers and ranchers.\n  As to the two vetoes, one on the emergency assistance and the tax \nbill, let me just list all of the provisions that have been passed by \nthe House of Representatives in its tax bill: 100 percent deductibility \nof health insurance--every farm association I have ever been associated \nwith has passed this in their resolution; permanent extension of income \naveraging for farmers--God bless Conrad Burns, the distinguished \nSenator from Montana, for putting it in originally with a tax bill; an \nimmediate $25,000 expense deduction for small businesses; and an \nadditional net operating loss carryback period.\n  These are steps that, when combined with the $4.1 billion in income \nassistance, would immediately put money in the pockets of farmers and \nranchers and, most importantly, they are positive answers for the long \nterm as opposed to the Democrat plan which I personally think would be \nvery, very counterproductive.\n  On several occasions earlier this year Secretary of Agriculture Dan \nGlickman made the comment that trade is the ``safety net'' for \nAmerica's farmers\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\nand ranchers, yet I am concerned that the Secretary and the \nadministration refused to support fast-track legislation when it was \nconsidered in the House. I said they were AWOL during the debate. And \nthey even asked, as I recall, some of my colleagues across the aisle in \nthe other body to vote against the legislation. ``Not this time,'' \n``not the proper time,'' that was the quote, to pass fast track. \nMeanwhile, our foreign markets for agriculture products have collapsed \nand we know that. And, Latin American countries are waiting for fast \ntrack to pass before entering into agricultural trade with the United \nStates.\n  I went with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to Latin America. Every \ncountry we visited asked, ``When are you going to pass fast track? The \nEuropean Union is knocking on our door. And we need this particular \nprovision.''\n  I do not know; I would like to ask the President, if now is not the \nproper time to open up new markets for our producers, when will the \nproper time be?\n  I agree with him on IMF. I do not agree with the decision to hunker \ndown in the weeds with regard to fast track. And I must say the failure \nto pass fast track holds the potential to become one of the most \nserious U.S. agriculture foreign policy blunders since the shattered \nglass embargo policy of the late 1970s and early 1980s. When we \nwithdrew, it may have been a mistake. And when it went down to defeat, \nit was a terrible mistake.\n  Consequently, I should also add that I am not very happy with my \nRepublican colleagues over in the House of Representatives who decided \nnot to vote for fast track. That was a very bad mistake as well.\n  So the President apparently has refused to support these trade and \ntax and income assistance initiatives that I believe will help our \nfarmers and ranchers in both the short and long term, but he continues \nto support a proposal that will provide virtually no assistance to \nproducers who have suffered losses in 1998.\n  We can raise the loan rates as high as we want. As a matter of fact, \nin the six or seven farm bills I have been associated with, there was \nalways the debate, do you use the loan rate as a market clearing device \nor income support? And several farm bills ago we agreed that when you \nraise the loan rate to the degree you really interfere with markets, \nthat is not the proper way to do it. And we used to have deficiency \npayments to assist farmers during the tough times when their markets \nwould decline due to unfair trading practices or some other reason. We \nchanged those to transition payments.\n  What will raising a loan rate do for producers in Oklahoma, Texas, \nLouisiana and Maryland who have lost all or most of their crop to some \nkind of a weather situation? What about the farmer in Louisiana or \nMississippi who lost most of his rice crop due to drought and had his \ncotton crop get hit with 16 inches of rain from a tropical storm \nearlier this year and then was hit by Hurricane Georges in late \nSeptember? That was incredible. These producers are facing a serious \nsituation. They will receive virtually no assistance from higher loan \nrates, and the Harkin-Daschle proposal provides less than $500 million \nfor 1998 losses, but it contains almost $1 billion for multiple year \nlosses in the northern plains. I am not trying to pick on them. But I \nthink it is skewed just a bit. I don't question the problems suffered \nby producers in the northern plains in recent years, nor do I question \nthat prices are low. We have heard time and time again about the \npainful crop losses experienced in the northern plains over the past \nyears, but, ``thank goodness, South Dakotans are expecting a good crop \nthis year--that is a welcome change--after the blizzards and flooding \nof 1996 and 1997, scab disease, and unfair trading practices.'' That \nquote comes from a September 1998 edition of the National Farmer Union \nNews. Thank goodness they do at least have a crop.\n\n  But let me get back to the plan that is within the Ag appropriation \nbill and why I think it is the proper course. The plan to be included \nwill provide $4.1 billion to producers. Of this amount, $1.65 billion, \n29 percent of the transition payments--the infamous transition payments \nthat are ignored and forgotten or somehow have disappeared in the \ndebate on the other side--will be provided to farmers as payments for \nlost export markets caused by world economic pneumonia, the global \ncontagion, the Asian Flu. Not to mention U.S. sanction policies that \nshut out our producers, out of world markets, and the inadequate \nagricultural trade initiatives of this administration--compounded by \nsome in this Congress.\n  Any farmer who received AMTA payments--the transition payments that \ndo not exist, on the other side of the aisle--in 1998 will receive an \nadditional 29 percent of this amount. Those receiving payments will \ninclude southern cotton, wheat, corn and rice farmers who had little or \nno crop to harvest. The Harkin-Daschle plan leaves them empty-handed. \nThe plan in the agriculture appropriations bill includes $1.5 billion \nfor losses and $675 million for multiple year losses.\n  The Daschle-Harkin plan provides approximately $1 billion for the \nnorthern plains, $500 million for the south. Again, I am not trying to \ncriticize problems in the north. But the plan does not do much for any \ngrower suffering losses in New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, \nLouisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Florida, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland--and the list goes on.\n  Senators from those States, wake up. Here is the real issue that is \nnow being debated. The northern plains Senators, and now the President, \nhave stated repeatedly that we have yanked the rug out from underneath \nthe producer--no safety net.\n  ``Tough luck,'' I think it was described by my good friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from North Dakota. As they have said, there is \nno bridge, nothing. But they fail to mention that the Government has \nprovided approximately $17.5 billion--$17.5 billion in transition \npayments since the inception of the new farm bill in 1996 through 1998. \nIt is estimated the old bill, the old supply/demand bill, the old \ncommand and control bill where the USDA would tell the farmer what seed \nto put in the ground and maybe he would qualify for a subsidy--that \nbill would have provide only around $10 billion during this time. That \nis a difference of $7.5 billion. They are getting more money under the \nnew bill, less money under the old bill, but the new bill is the \nproblem? Hello.\n  It is estimated, as I said, the old bill would have provided only \nabout $10 billion during this time. They forget to mention the \nestimated $4 billion the producers will receive in loan deficiency \npayments in 1998. And, what about the $5.5 billion in advance 1999 \npayments? Again, if I'm a farmer I'd be mighty careful with that. And \nif you add these together and include the additional $4.1 billion \nincluded in the agriculture appropriation bill as put on the floor by \nthe distinguished Senator from Mississippi, total funding provided over \nthe 3-year period is $31 billion. Mr. President $31 billion; that is \nnothing? That is tough luck? That is a bridge that has been washed out, \n$31 billion?\n  Still, the Senators on the other side of the aisle from the northern \nand great plains argue this is not enough. It may well not be, over the \nlong term. I understand that. If things do not improve, with all the \nthings that have gone wrong it may well not be. They say their \nproducers have been forgotten. They even cited this on the floor in a \nCongressional Budget Office table. This is going to get a little tricky \nhere. The table that is called the CBO study showing a side-by-side \ncomparison of the two plans--we have all seen it in regard to this \ndebate. In addition, I think the CBO plan was sent with a letter \nattached to numerous State Governors, certainly trying to gain support \nfor their plan. But there was only one problem with these actions and \nthis CBO study. It is my understanding, and I think I am right, it is \nnot a CBO study. In fact, CBO was not even involved in running these \nnumbers. Rather, they were put together by staff members of the \nappropriate Senators who have proposed the Democratic plan.\n  I don't want to play this business of, ``How much is enough?'' I have \nsaid before, the problem is very serious in the northern plains, and \nfor that matter all over the country, where we have had these \nunprecedented problems in regards to farm country. But I thought \nperhaps we should do some ``truth in\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\nspending'' and take a look at the level of payments the States of North \nDakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Iowa have actually \nreceived under the 1996 farm bill. It may not be enough. But with all \nof this talk about, ``no bridge, tough luck, you are just out of luck, \nwe are not going to support you''--Here we go: North Dakota in 1996, \nNorth Dakota farmers and ranchers received $309.7 million; 1997 $245.1 \nmillion and 1998, $245.2 million. Total, $800 million. That is more \nthan nothing.\n  The yearly State average in Government payments in 1991-1995--the old \nfarm bill which has been defended saying this might be the foundation \nfor the next farm bill, this one is not working--what would have that \nprovided? That average, 1991-1995, $265.4 million.\n  In 1996 through 1998 the average was $266.6 million. In July, the \nHouse Agriculture Committee estimated North Dakota farmers will be \neligible to receive $215.1 million in advanced 1999 payments. Again, I \nam not sure I would take that, but some may have to.\n  The 29 percent bonus payments for 1998 crops will equal approximately \n$71 million. Adding the 1998 payments to the 1998 bonus payments and \nthe advanced 1999 payments together, North Dakota farmers could receive \nup to $531.3 million during the calendar year 1998, this year.\n  South Dakota, 1996, $161.8 million; 1997, $183.1; 1998, $161.3--\ntotal, $506.2 million.\n  The yearly State average in Government payments in 1991-1995 under \nthe old farm bill, $149.7. The 1996 through 1998 average was 168.76 \nmillion--19 million more per year. In July the House Agriculture \nCommittee estimated South Dakota farmers will be eligible to receive \n$160.7 million in advance 1999 payments. The 29 percent bonus payment \nfor 1998 crops will equal approximately $46.7 million. When you add \nthem all up, South Dakota farmers could receive $368.9 million during \ncalendar year 1998.\n  I am going to skip Montana. Nothing personal, I just think we ought \nto shorten it up.\n  Minnesota, the Democratic Senator from Minnesota has been on the \nfloor indicating that times are tough in Minnesota. They are. It is a \ncrisis. He is entitled to say that. In 1996, $261.5 million; 1997, \n$383.8 million; 1998, $322.6 million; total, $968.1 million--almost $1 \nbillion. That is not nothing? Is that a double negative?\n  The yearly State average in Government payments in 1991-1995 under \nthe farm bill--you haven't heard one word on the other side about the \nfailures of the old farm bill and people standing in line waiting on \nthe USDA to issue all the paperwork so they could fill out the \npaperwork to plant less, not at least respond to market signals but so \nthat they might get a subsidy. Not one word. That was $270.2 million.\n  In 1996 through 1998, the average was $322.7 million--over $50 \nmillion more. In July, the House Agriculture Committee estimated \nMinnesota farmers will be able to receive $336.8 million in advanced \n1999 payments. The 29 percent bonus for 1998 crops will equal \napproximately $93.5 million. Add them all up, $753.08 million during \ncalendar year 1998. That is a lot of money. It is, perhaps not enough \nfor the dire situation they face and in absentia of other things that \nwe should be doing. The question is not how much is enough, but the \nclaim, again, by the other side, that we are not providing any \nassistance.\n  Nebraska: 1996, $303.2 million; 1997, $490.082 million; 1998, \napproximately $400 million. Total: $1.193 billion.\n  The yearly State average in government payments in 1991-1995 was \n$349.9 million. That was back under the old farm bill.\n  The 1996 through 1998 average was $397 million; $349 million to $397 \nmillion, about $50 million more. I am not going to go through the \nadvanced payments and the 29-percent bonus. I will add them all.\n  Nebraska farmers, as well as being No. 2 in the Nation in football, \ncould receive up to $830 million during the calendar year 1998.\n  Iowa--Senator Harkin, my good friend on the Ag Committee who has a \nvery honest and sincere difference of opinion about the direction of \nthe farm policy program: 1996, $350.2 million; 1997, $680 million; \n1998, $535 million. Total: $1.566 billion.\n  The yearly State average under the old farm program was about $449 \nmillion; under the new farm program, $522 million. Madam President, \n$522 million is more; $449 million is less.\n  OK. Advanced payments, the bonus payment, add them all up: Iowa \nfarmers could get about $1.288 billion during calendar year 1998.\n  Madam President, I apologize to my colleagues for taking this much \ntime and going over all the figures. The facts are clear. The rug has \nnot been yanked out from producers in the northern plains. In fact, \nthese States have fared quite well under the 1996 act's payments. When \ncompared to the old farm bill--I realize we have extenuating and very \ndire circumstances now--the farmers who need assistance the worst--\nthose without a crop--receive nothing--nothing--from higher loan rates. \nYet, this is the situation many southern farmers will face under the \nproposal that is the alternative to the conference report.\n  I have made some remarks on the floor on several occasions against \nthe loan rate proposal, uncapping loan rates. I don't disagree with my \ncolleagues across the aisle that we need to provide assistance to \nfarmers; that is a given. But history has shown us that their plan will \nnot work, and I believe several myths should be addressed about their \nproposal.\n  Myth No. 1: Higher loan rates will put more money into the pockets of \nall producers and do not lead to excess stocks and lower prices in the \nlong run. It is also argued that higher loan rates will not eventually \nlead us back to Government set-asides.\n  Contrary to these assertions, history has shown us that higher loan \nrates lead to excess stocks, greater production, a long-run depressing \neffect on price, and uncompetitiveness in the world market.\n  In addition, due to the difficulty in predicting budget outlays with \nmarketing loans, it inevitably leads us back to command-and-control \npolicies in an attempt to limit the budget exposure.\n  Again, some in the House and Senate do not feel we should spend $4.1 \nbillion in emergency funding. How are we going to pay for $7 billion? \nAnd, more to the point, if you encourage more Government stocks and a \ntie-up of the transportation system and more production, you are going \nto extend that loan beyond the 15 months and you are going to get into \nmore expenditures. We have been down that road before and farmers \noverwhelmingly tell me they do not want to retrace the journey. I think \nwe should look forward and not backwards.\n  Myth No. 2: There is no safety net.\n  I have gone over the payment numbers. I have mentioned previously \nthat there is a safety net. How can an extra $7.5 billion, at a \nminimum, over the last 3 years, compared to the old program, be hurting \nfarmers and ranchers? I want a safety net that is a trampoline, not a \nhammock. If we go down this loan rate trail, it will be a hammock--we \nwill sag in the middle.\n  On the other hand, if we can get our export policy straightened out, \nour trade policy straightened out, and our tax policy changes and \nregulatory reform, and get cracking, it may well be a trampoline with \nthis assistance we are providing.\n  Myth No. 3: New trade markets will not help us get out of this \nproblem.\n  There are, indeed, some in this body who argue that trade is not the \nanswer to avoiding these problems in the future. How can you discount \nthe importance of trade when we have to export a large proportion of \nour ag products? We must continue to work toward trade agreements and \nsanctions reforms that do not continue to shoot our producers in the \nfoot and lock them out of world markets. And we must encourage \nproducers to maintain the flexibility that allows them to plant \naccording to the demands of the world market. Raising loan rates won't \nachieve these goals.\n  Several weeks ago, Senator Craig--the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, who has been a very aggressive and constant champion of the \nAmerican farmer and rancher and all the commodities and all the \nproducers of those commodities in his great State of Idaho--and I sat \ndown, along with others, in a small group, and we made a list of what \nwe thought would be appropriate to address this farm crisis.\n  We decided on lost market payments and disaster payments. That is in \nthis\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\nbill. We decided on crop insurance reform. Got some. Not enough. Need \nto make it better. First order of priority in the next session. Wish we \ncould have done it this year.\n  We decided on tax relief. I have already mentioned that. It is in the \nHouse bill. The President says he is going to veto it. That will be the \nbest long-term--perhaps not the best--one of the best long-term things \nwe could do for farmers and ranchers in 1999, 2000, and the year \nbeyond.\n  Trade expansion. I have gone over that. Folks, you have to sell it or \nyou are going to smell it, and we are smelling it right now. We need \nfast track and normal trading status with China, we need IMF, and we \nneed sanctions reform. As I said before, we have to quit taking a knife \nto a gunfight.\n  Full enrollment in the Conservation Reserve Program.\n  The agriculture appropriations bill contains $4.1 billion in payments \nand also protects the sanctity of crop insurance. The bill does not \ninclude the important reforms that are needed, but I am pleased the \nprotections included in the bill, and we are going to work for that \nreform next year.\n  I mentioned tax relief, and Senator Craig, who is on the floor now, \nand I sent a letter to the Secretary requesting full enrollment in the \nCRP program. This is an administrative action. The Secretary doesn't \nneed any congressional action. We don't need to debate this and delay \nit. He can undertake it right now. It will provide an important tool to \naddress the problem of marginally productive land that repeatedly \nsuffers from natural disasters or disease problems, land like the \nnorthern plains. One of the things he can do right away is enroll the \nCRP in that part of the country. He can do it with the stroke of a pen.\n  Madam President, it appears that we will not be able to achieve all \nof the goals that Senator Craig and others of us have proposed in this \nCongress. However, this agriculture appropriations bill, combined with \nthe House tax bill and the trade tools the administration already has \navailable, will provide an important step in addressing the economic \nproblems throughout our rural areas. But the President must be willing \nto step up and work with us, if he is serious about helping our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  Webster's defines a ``statesman'' as one who exercises the political \nleadership at his disposal wisely and without narrow partisanship. I am \nhopeful that we will see the President and my colleagues across the \naisle act as statesmen on this issue and that we will not prevent \nfarmers and ranchers from receiving this much-needed assistance. This \nagriculture appropriations bill is too important--too important--for \nour producers. I urge the President to reconsider his veto threat on \nthis bill.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nconference report to the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill. This \nlegislation includes much needed economic assistance for Georgia \nfarmers. The disaster and market loss assistance proposal, which totals \nover $4 billion, includes $1.5 billion for one time payment to person \nwith a crop loss in 1998, $675 million for multiple year crop loss and \ncrops impacted by disease, $175 million for livestock feed assistance, \n$1.65 billion for a one time payment to offset financial hardship \ncaused by the loss of markets, and $10 million for tree farmers through \nthe Forestry Incentive Program.\n  I would like to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Cochran, Senator \nLugar, Senator Roberts, and others involved in the crafting of this \nimportant legislation. For months I have been stressing the need for \nCongress to address the current financial crisis facing farmers in \nGeorgia and across the nation. I am pleased that our collective efforts \nbring us here to discuss this legislation. This disaster package is one \nstep in many that is needed to get these farmers back on their feet.\n  Under this proposal the Secretary of Agriculture is given broad \nauthority to define and implement these provisions. I am hopeful that \nwhen deciding how to distribute these funds, the Secretary does not \nforget Georgia farmers. President Clinton and Secretary Glickman should \nnot help farmers in one section of the country by neglecting farmers in \nthe Southeast. Georgia farmers have suffered disasters 2 out of the \nlast 5 years and should be eligible for assistance under the multi-year \nlosses program. In addition, the Secretary should include all crops, \ninsured and uninsured, when considering who should be eligible for \nassistance under this disaster and market assistance proposal. Georgia \nfarmers who produce peaches, onions, blueberries, watermelons, pecans, \nand other speciality crops, have just as much right to be eligible for \nthis disaster assistance as farmers who produce major program crops \nsuch as corn, wheat, and cotton. Those who bought crop insurance should \nnot be unnecessarily penalized and left out of receiving any assistance \nunder this legislation. The current crop insurance program does not \nwork and needs to be completely overhauled by Congress. We need a crop \ninsurance program which is affordable and factors in the cost of \nproduction.\n  Secretary Glickman needs to also look at ways to provide assistance \nfor peanut producers, either through a market loss assistance payment \nor under one of the other disaster assistance programs. The cost of \nproduction for peanuts continues to remain high while income for \nfarmers continues to fall. Disease, weather, government regulations, \ntaxes, increased costs for equipment and supplies, reduction in yields, \nand other problems have all contributed to this situation.\n  I look forward to working with Secretary Glickman and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture in making sure these funds are distributed in \na fair and equitable manner.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nagriculture appropriations conference report.\n  This bill includes critical assistance for farmers. It helps all \nfarmers, not just Midwestern grain farmers, and that is why I believe \nthat this is the right bill.\n  I urge President Clinton to withdraw his veto threat and to support \nthis critical disaster relief bill. It is outrageous that the President \nis playing politics with the fate of American farmers. I was astonished \nto see Jacob J. Lew, the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, write that the President's ``senior advisers would recommend \nthat he veto the bill'' unless the House and Senate craft a bill for \nthe Midwest rather than for the whole nation.\n  I find it incredible that the Clinton Administration can oppose a \npackage that includes $4.3 billion for increased AMTA payments, \nweather-related crop damage relief, ``multi-year'' disasters, livestock \nassistance, and assistance for tree farmers. This is about farmers, not \npolitics, and it is time for the White House to put policy first.\n  This is a good bill for North Carolina and for all farmers. I \ncongratulate the Committee for a job well done.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise to express in part my profound \ndisappointment with the contents of the agricultural appropriations \nconference report, recognizing that there are many in this body--in \nparticular, that there are numerous instances, thanks to the leadership \nof the Senator from Mississippi, and others--who have brought together \na sense of bipartisanship on some key issues. And there are other \nissues and other needs that I believe this body needs to address \noutside of this agricultural appropriations bill, as my very good \nfriend and colleague from Kansas has made reference to a string of \nextraneous other issues that are urgent.\n  On the issue of trade, I believe that there is fairly good agreement \nin this body relative to where we need to go next. There is support in \nthis body for funding for the International Monetary Fund. That is \nperhaps the single thing we could do that would have the greatest \nimmediate impact on stabilizing currencies and opening markets and \nstabilizing economies in Asia, and increasingly in Russia and Latin \nAmerica. Unfortunately, that issue has been held up in the other body, \nnot this one; but it is an issue that should be dealt with before we \nadjourn for the year.\n  My colleague raises the issue of fast track. On that issue I share \nhis concern that we ought to have fast-track authority. This body does \nas well. The House does not. I think in all fairness, though, it ought \nto be kept in mind\n\n[[Page S11428]]\n\nthat if we were to pass fast track, that would have a consequence years \ndown the road but not next month, not the next 6 months. It would \nsimply put our trade representative back in at the negotiating table \nfor trade negotiations. That would bear fruit probably years down the \nroad from now, but it would not have an immediate consequence.\n  Certainly, in the case of relief of unilateral sanctions and the \nsanctions reform legislation that our colleague, the chairman of our \nSenate Ag Committee, Senator Lugar, has championed, we ought to be \nmoving forward with that. Unfortunately, we have not. But I think there \nis broad-based bipartisan consensus that we ought to do that. And \ncertainly MFN, now having normal trade relations with China as well, is \nsomething that we should go forward with.\n  I think all these issues are concurred upon by this President and by \nthe majority of both political parties in the Senate. Those are issues \nwe should proceed with. We should not use them, however, as an excuse \nfor a lack of action, for inaction on key disaster issues before us \ntoday.\n  On the tax agenda, as well, I think that there is broad-based support \nin both political parties for tax relief targeted to middle-class and \nworking families, certainly for those in the agricultural sectors of \nour economy. But again in fairness, it ought to be kept in mind that \nthe tax package that arrived in this body from the other body is funded \n100 percent out of the Social Security trust fund surplus. That is \nunacceptable to a great many of us in this body. It is utterly \nunacceptable to the President of the United States who has expressed \nhis veto intent if that were to reach his desk. I think there is a \ngreat likelihood it will reach his desk, but if he were to veto it, he \nwould do the right thing.\n  And we talk about statesmanship, that is what we are talking about--\ndoing the right thing, rejecting what seems on the surface to be \npopular, recognizing that in too many instances the underlying premise \nthat allows that action to go forward is, in fact, simply wrong. \nStealing money, raiding, plundering the Social Security trust fund is \nnot acceptable for any of us. Regardless of how great the crisis might \nbe that we have in agricultural today, how much we would like to have \ntax relief for every sector of our economy, that is not where we need \nto go.\n  To his great credit, Senator Daschle, with the help of numerous \nothers, has put together a tax package which provides most of the same \nkinds of relief that my friend from Kansas was making reference to, but \nis funded exclusively out of efficiencies, out of savings, out of the \nclosure of tax loopholes in the existing Tax Code and budget. So it is \nnot a question of whether we can have tax relief or whether we cannot \nhave tax relief; we can so long as it is carefully targeted, so long as \nit is focused on those areas where it is most in need, and so long as \nit is truly offset by savings, by efficiencies, by loophole closures--\nother places--and not premised on a raid on Social Security.\n  So, again, I think we ought to be able to find bipartisan agreement \nbefore we leave here on those issues as well.\n  I want to say that we did reach some concurrence on some important \nissues in this body. The pain and the hurt that is going on across much \nof rural America today is too great to allow for the kind of finger \npointing and partisanship that too often characterizes the debate in \nthis Congress, especially as we draw near an election as we reach the \nend of this Congress.\n  I am pleased that in this body we were able to find bipartisan \nagreement on my particular amendment that was incorporated in the \nSenate version of the agricultural appropriations bill on meat \nlabeling. The Senator from Idaho was a champion on the meat labeling \nissue. And I was pleased that the chairman, the Senator from \nMississippi, was supportive of our concern in the conference committee \nin that regard.\n\n  I am disappointed in what turned out to be a party-line vote from our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives that thwarted the will of \nthe U.S. Senate in that regard--a measure which has the support of the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Farmers Union, the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, and the American Sheep Industry \nAssociation.\n  The underlying bill, which had the sponsorship of eight Republican \nSenators and eight Democratic Senators, along with myself--this was a \nbipartisan effort to, for the first time, allow consumers to know the \norigin of their food products which they serve their families, much as \nthey do virtually every other consumer item that they purchase. Yet \neven this commonsense measure was turned down in the conference \ncommittee, to my great disappointment. And I want to confirm that this \nissue simply will not go away. It will be revisited and revisited until \nit becomes law.\n  We also found bipartisan support on the Senate agricultural \nappropriations bill--again, with the support of the Senator from Idaho, \nthe Senator from Mississippi, and a great many others --in a bipartisan \nfashion, to allow price transparency in the livestock industry to go \nforward, to put our individual livestock producers on the same footing \nas the packing industry to give them a better marketing opportunity. \nAnd yet even that which would have seemed, again, to be common sense we \nlost, unfortunately, on a partisan, party-line vote on the part of the \nHouse conferees, over the objections of the Senate.\n  I want to express my disappointment at the loss of both of those \nprovisions which would not have meant night or day, would not have \nturned around overnight the price crisis that we have in the livestock \nindustry, but we would have contributed, I think, in a very \nconstructive fashion to lay the groundwork for a long-term recovery, \nand it would have been a constructive, positive step in the right \ndirection. We reached some bipartisan agreement, I think, in this body \nearly on, again, on the need for disaster relief.\n  I think we all recognized as time went on, as disasters struck the \nSouth and the West, other parts of the country, that the amount of \nmoney, the $500 million we had placed in the Senate agriculture \nappropriations bill simply was not going to be adequate from anyone's \nperspective, and that needed to be augmented in a significant way. I \nthink the President is right that if we are going to realistically \naddress the real pain all across rural America, that a final level of \ndisaster relief approximating the funding in the President's \nrecommendation rather than in the House proposal and imposed on the \nconference report on ag appropriations is more appropriate.\n  I think we all recognize that there needs to be some give-and-take, \nthat the final version of whatever we do probably will not meet the 100 \npercent satisfaction of any of us here, should not be 100 percent what \nthe Republican leadership in the House was offering, probably will not \nbe completely what the President is offering; but we need to come \ntogether somewhere in the middle in a way which more effectively deals \nwith the disaster that is national in scope and deals with it in a \nmeaningful way, all within the context of, obviously, a balanced \nFederal budget.\n  I believe we can do that, but we need to take, I believe, some of the \ndirection that is coming from the White House to moderate the \nprovisions which have been imposed in the ag appropriations bill by our \nHouse colleagues.\n  This should not turn into a bidding war. It has been suggested that \ncould occur. That would be wrong. That is not where we need to go. But \nwe do need to step back, and with some careful deliberation and some \ncare, evaluate the scope of the relief that needs to be made in order \nto have a meaningful consequence in the context of this national \ndisaster.\n  One area where we were not able to reach bipartisan consensus in this \nbody--and I certainly respect the views of those who differ with me and \nwith many of my colleagues on this side of the aisle--is on the wisdom \nof utilizing a strategy which would take the cap off the existing \nmarketing loan provisions in the freedom to market legislation.\n  Now, it is suggested by some that that is an attack on Freedom to \nFarm, that this is on the part of those who would go back to the old \ndays of the previous farm bill. I think that simply is untrue. That is \na straw man that is easily knocked down but one that does not \ncharacterize the goals and the perspective of those of us who believe \nthat it makes a lot of sense to take the caps off the existing \nmarketing loan. Keep in mind, the current bill has marketing loan \nprovisions in it. It is not a turning inside out of that legislation.\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\n  The problem with the existing legislation, the existing farm bill, is \nthat the loan rates established in that farm bill are unrealistically \nlow. They are too low to be meaningful given the kind of crisis that we \nhave today. And taking the caps off that loan rate and tying it to a 5-\nyear Olympic average is a moderate but responsible step in the right \ndirection. In fact, if we were to do that--and we are talking about \ndoing this for 1 year only, so it would have no consequence whatever on \nplanting decisions made by others because the crops have already been \nplanted and are about to be harvested--it would have a 57-cent-per-\nbushel increase for wheat, 28 cents for corn, 28 cents for beans, if we \nwere to follow the proposal in the President's recommendation.\n  That won't make anyone rich, that won't bring the price back to \nanywhere near where a lot of us think in an ideal world it ought to be, \nbut it will stave off in so many ways the crisis that is upon us. It \nwill give a decent return. It will treat renters more fairly than \nalternative proposals would. It will not turn the clock back. It will \nnot abandon the existing farm bill. It will be done within the context \nof that farm bill and we will preserve the marketing flexibility that I \nthink a great many of us value in that farm legislation.\n  I think there is room for bipartisan concurrence. This is not a \nmatter of one political party rolling the other or stiffing the other \nor coming away 100 percent victorious. I think in good faith everybody \nin this body wants to do what reasonably can be done to create the \nframework whereby family producers can at least survive the current era \nand emerge from the other side with an opportunity for prosperity in \nthe future.\n  If we do nothing and if we take steps that are simply wholly \ninadequate, we are going to see the loss of thousands upon thousands of \nagricultural producers both in the grain and livestock sectors of our \neconomy. The FSA leadership in my State tells us that we could lose as \nmany as a third of the farmers and ranchers in my home State of South \nDakota. That is unacceptable. That has consequences not only for the \nlives of those families, many of whom have been on the land for 100 \nyears or more, going back to homesteading days, but it has consequences \nup and down the main streets of every community as well--not just the \nsmall farm community but the larger communities--as well as the ripple \neffect that takes hold, affecting the medium and large communities. I \nthink this has global consequences. We need to recognize that as we \naddress the situation.\n  I think we ought to avoid the pride of authorship and the temptation \nto subscribe to partisan warfare and find the middle ground. It makes \nmeaningful, constructive, positive relief a ``doable'' sort of thing. I \nam hopeful we can send this conference report back to committee, not to \nemerge with a radically different approach, but to emerge with \nsomething looking more like what the President has recommended, more \nlike what many of us on this side of the aisle would like to see \nhappen. The veto threat is there and people can argue whether it ought \nto be there or not. I believe that the President is correct. I believe \nthat the President is doing the responsible thing and doing the \nstatesmanlike thing under these dire circumstances.\n  In the end, it is going to require both sides coming together. I \nthink that is what our constituents want to see. I think they want to \nsee us during these closing days of this 105th Congress reach that \nconsensus that would allow for some substantially higher level of \ndisaster relief than is currently being posed, utilized in a way that \nmore efficiently gets to the people who need it, which addresses the \nnational nature of the disaster which we face, and which sets a \nframework for prosperity in future years rather than simply being a \nBand-Aid for now.\n  Again, it is my hope that the issue of labeling country of origin on \nmeat products--a compromise version which the Senator from Idaho and I \nsubscribe to and went to great lengths to propose--could be revisited. \nSecondly, it is my hope that price transparency in the livestock \nindustry can be revisited before we leave at the end of this week.\n  Much remains to be done. There is too much to be done to fall victim \nto partisanship and to finger pointing. We need a greater level of \nstatesmanship, a greater level of cooperation than, frankly, has been \nthe case all these past months. We are dealing with the very lives and \nthe very future of thousands of hard-working, honest people in rural \nAmerica who want nothing more than an opportunity to survive the year \nand to live by the sweat of their brow and the hard work of their \nfamilies in years to come.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, first of all, let me thank the Senator \nfrom South Dakota for those kind words. I enjoyed working with him on \nthe meat labeling issue. While the legislation before the Senate \nadvances it only slightly through a study as it relates to the country \nof origin, I do believe in this country the consumers have a right to \nknow. I believe the consumers have a right to understand whether they \nare buying foreign or domestic beef. I think the livestock industry \ndeserves, also, that opportunity.\n  I thank my colleague from South Dakota for his leadership in the \narea. We will continue to work on this. This is an issue that will not \ngo away. I certainly understand the difficulties of those in the retail \nindustry. We can work those differences out. The compromise the Senator \nfrom South Dakota spoke to, that he and I worked on, moved a lot in \nthat direction. I am sorry that they finally, in the end, felt they had \nto gang up on us a bit during the conference, but we will be back and \nthe issue will be resolved.\n  I must also tell you that I support a compromise in livestock \nreporting. I think there must be a transparency in that market for all \nthe world to see. There isn't at this time. We are going to have to \nwork to get to that. I am disappointed that the bill delays the \nimplementation of a Federal milk marketing order reform that I \nsupported.\n  Now, while I have expressed my disappointment, I will stop with that \nbecause those are the areas that I had some concern about. Let me \ndiscuss the positive things that are in this very important bill. \nFirst, I thank the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee of the full Appropriations Committee, the Senator from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, for his leniency, his cooperation, his \nunderstanding, but most importantly, his dedication to the American \nfarmer--whether in his State of Mississippi or whether in my State of \nIdaho--in ensuring that there is fair play in the balance of \nappropriating the Nation's resources, tax dollars, for the purpose of \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I do believe that this agriculture appropriations bill contains \nimportant funding for America's farm families. I am proud of it. I will \nvote for it. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do the \nsame. It is an excellent effort on the part of the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Compromise is what we work at. I am disappointed that the President, \nat the last moment, would send a signal of veto. I am amazed that this \nis a President who didn't say agriculture twice in his first campaign, \nbut promised to say it three times in his second campaign. He never \ncame with an agriculture policy, and now, in the last minute, after \nthey discovered there was a farm crisis 3 months ago, he wants to veto \nan effort that has been underway for months to try to not only be \nsensitive to the issues that are down on the farm at this moment, \ncausing great consternation, but would do so by saying, ``let's veto.''\n\n  The reason he says ``let's veto'' is because it is a habitual kind of \nthing for the President to want to fall backward into old policy that \ndidn't work, that bound America's agricultural producers into a \nlockstep Government program offering no flexibility to the marketplace, \nbut more importantly, having to ask the producer to turn to Government \nevery year to decide what they were going to produce and what they were \ngoing to get in return.\n  Now, that is not what the American farmer wanted, and even today, \nwhile those in production agriculture recognize the importance of some \nadjustment, some change in the current program, they are still saying \nleave the new farm bill program in place. Yet, this President is \nthreatening a veto because we will not fall back to the policy of the \nold.\n  What does the bill do that we are talking about here on the floor? \nLet me\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\ntell you what it does and let me tell you what it does for my State of \nIdaho. I will use it as an example. It funds research at America's \ncolleges and universities in agriculture, at a time when agriculture \nand yields were dropping nationwide because we weren't investing in the \nfuture of American agriculture.\n  Well, in my State of Idaho, the bill contains $500,000 for peas and \nlentils research; $500,000 for grass seed research; $500,000 for barley \nresearch; $550,000 for research on canola, a new and important crop in \nour area of Idaho; $1.7 million for research in small fruits; and $1.2 \nmillion for research in potatoes and potato disease, the blight that \ndevastated production in the Idaho potato crops last year. Those are \nall part of a new research initiative the Senator from Mississippi \nworked to assure that we would get funded so we can invest in the \nproductive future of American agriculture. It funds food stamps and \nother nutrition programs.\n  Very little has been said about that today by those on the other \nside. Yet, that is critically important to America's poor and \ndisadvantaged. It funds conservation and environmental programs, and \nsome very good ones. It contains important biodiesel legislation, a new \nprogram for a very important part of a new and emerging market for \nproduction agriculture in the oilseed industry. It contains important \nsanction reform legislation and exempts agricultural products from \nsanctions on India and Pakistan.\n  Why, then, if all of these good things are in there, do we have a \nPresident that threatens a veto? I have to believe it is because they \ndidn't come with a policy; they don't have one today, and they have \nthis habitual problem of wanting to fall back into the past. Freedom to \nFarm is everything about the future and very little about the past. \nThat is where we ought to be.\n  Now, there is a problem in weather-related disasters. There are \ncertainly problems with world markets, as we increasingly tie \nproduction agriculture and its profitability to the world markets. Well \nover 40 percent of everything a farmer in America produces today has to \nsell in the world market, and we have to be sensitive to that. When \nthose markets go south, prices go south. Does that mean the policy is \nbad, or does it mean we have a world economic problem? I think it is \nthe latter. We recognize that and we have pumped billions of dollars \ninto that. It won't go to the trader and it won't go to the exporter; \nit goes right to the bank account of the American farmer--$2.35 billion \nin disaster-related programs, weather-related programs.\n\n  We turn to the Secretary of Agriculture and say: You have the tools, \nyou implement it. We even gave him money to hire more staff to do so--\n$1.65 billion in income assistance directly to the farmer. This \nassistance will help provide America's farmers with economic stability \nthat they need to talk to their banker this fall and to talk to their \nbanker next spring, to get a line of credit to put the seed in the \nground. And the cycle goes on.\n  What does it mean in my State of Idaho? I will break it out for you. \nToday, the price of wheat at the Port of Lewiston, ID, is $2.75. So in \nthe 1998 crop-year, if you add the transition payment of 65 cents, \nanother transition of 45 cents, a loan deficiency payment of 55 cents, \nand the aid package I just talked about of $1.65 billion, that is 19 \ncents--that is $1.85 per bushel, Government assistance, to a $2.78 \nprice at the Port of Lewiston today. That is $4.62 per bushel, and \n$4.62 is, under the current domestic and world market situation, a fair \nif not a good price in Idaho for wheat.\n  Idaho wheat hit the bottom in early September when the price hit \n$2.26 at the Port of Lewiston--although the price was lower further \ninland in my State, which is more dependent upon rail traffic. Today, \nwheat is sold at $2.78; that is up 50 cents from its low. The market \nhas assessed the production, and it is making its adjustments. We are \nhelping stabilize that. That is probably why the bill that I am talking \nabout, the current legislation, is supported by the National Farm \nBureau and a majority of Idaho's farmers. Is it enough? Well, it is \nenough to get by on, especially when Government should not be the sole \nprovider of the well-being of production agriculture. But it should \nunderstand when there is a crisis and respond to the crisis. That is \nwhat we are doing. That response is $1.84 a bushel in assistance.\n  Now, some keep talking about the loan caps. We voted and voted, and \nwe voted once again on that issue. A majority of Congress said leave \nthe loan caps alone. I believe that the farmers don't want current \npolicy changed. And while some would agree that the loan caps ought to \nbe changed, when I talk to my farmers back home and we walk them \nthrough all that this appropriation bill offers, they say: That is \nfair, Senator. That is as much as we could expect you to do, and thank \nyou for doing it.\n  We have worked hard on this bill. The Senator from Kansas explained \nthe coalition that came together before the July 4 break. We met with \nall of the commodity groups and asked, ``What do you need?'' They said, \n``Don't change the policy, but we have to have some transitional \nassistance.'' Times are tough, and we understood that. Many of us went \nhome in August and listened to our farmers and came back with the mind \nof putting a package like this together to offer assistance.\n  The President wasn't listening then and he wasn't focused then. Mr. \nPresident, why did you quit your travels and come back this week and \nsay you are going to veto the bill? I don't understand that. I don't \nunderstand why you have not been focused on this; yet, all of a sudden, \nit is time to veto it. You said, ``I support Senator Harkin's \nprograms''; yet, you offer a supplemental that is billions of dollars \nless. You have taken two positions on the issue and now you have a \nthird. You say, ``I will veto what you send me.'' I don't understand \nthat. I don't think America's farmers understand that very well. \nGovernment isn't the end-all to production agriculture. It should be of \nassistance when assistance is needed. It should care, and it should be \nconcerned, and that is what this bill is reflective of this evening. We \nshould knock down the political barriers and boundaries to enhanced \ntrade. What has this administration done this year? They have not sold \nor given away one kernel of wheat in the name of humanity. Yet, they \nhave hundreds of millions of dollars to buy wheat in the world and move \nit into the world hunger areas. Mr. President, why are you not doing \nthat? Why do you come home from your world travels and political \ntravels and say it is time to veto this effort? I don't understand \nthat, Mr. President. I don't understand it.\n  What we do understand, what Congress understands, and what this bill \nis reflective of is that you don't change policy; you work to adjust \nit. You make it fit the marketplace. When there is a national \nenvironmental or weather-directed disaster, when there is a downturn in \nworld markets, you make adjustments, you care about production \nagriculture, and you darn well make sure the money gets home to the \nbank account of the farmer.\n  That is what this appropriations bill offers. That is why the House \nvoted on it 333 to 53. That is a big bipartisan vote for the House. \nSomehow there has to be some good in this legislation, if it drew that \nkind of a vote in the House. I hope it draws a bipartisan vote here \nwhen we vote on it. It deserves it, because it is reflective of the \nconcerns of the current agricultural situation in our country, and, \nmost importantly, it is reflective of the concern of production \nagriculture when production agriculture says don't change the policy \nover some transition, make sure that you are sensitive to what we are \nconcerned about.\n  But what is important to all of us is that we listen to production \nagriculture. And we know that there are times when a safety net is \nnecessary. This year, as in past years, we have offered one of the \nlargest safety nets in the history of our Government, and we will \ncontinue to do that. But let us not change the policy and drive our \nGovernment into the business of being the partner of production \nagriculture, drive it into the business of not ever determining the \nacreage that should be farmed, or the amount that should be farmed, but \ninto the business of knocking down political barriers, into the \nbusiness of working as a partner in selling in the world markets \ninstead of simply sitting back with hands folded saying, ``Oh, gee, we \nhave an agriculture problem.''\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\n  I think we ought to do something about it. We ought to control \nproduction. We ought to squeeze down on production in the rest of the \nnations of the world, save time to gear up and time to increase our \nacreage. If we are going to pull away, if the United States is going to \npull away from its spot in the world market, we are going to fill it. \nThat is what the policies of the past offered, and we had to fight for \ndecades to gain them back.\n  I hope that in the end, when the rhetoric cools, when the President \ndevelops an understanding of production agriculture--and I give him 24 \nhours to do it--that he will sign the bill, offer up the kind of \nassistance that this bill recognizes is important for our producers, \nand get on with the business of being a cooperating partner with \nproduction agriculture, and not a barrier, or not a hindrance, or not a \nJohnny-come-lately.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Yvonne Byrne and Maureen \nKnightly, members of my staff, be granted floor privileges during the \ndebate of the agriculture appropriations conference report and the vote \nthat is taking place at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first, I was listening to what the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho was saying. He raised one question. He \nasked the question, What do farmers want? That is a fair question. But \nthere is an answer.\n  A poll was prepared by Rock Wood Research, a subsidiary of the Farm \nJournal, Inc.--we are all familiar with Farm Journal--for the Nebraska \nWheat Growers Association, the American Corn Growers Association, and \nthe Nebraska Farmers Union. It was a widely disseminated poll. It was \ndone between September 4 and September 10 of this year. And 1,000 \nfarmers, actual producers, were interviewed--500 corn growers and 500 \nwheat growers.\n  There were a number of questions. One of the questions asked was \nwhether Congress should lift loan caps and raise loan rates 59 cents \nper bushel on wheat and 32 cents on corn, and 72.5 percent of the \nfarmers polled said yes, they wanted the loan rates raised; only 19 \npercent said no.\n  So if you are asking the question about what farmers want, I have a \nscientific poll done of 1,000 farmers, a pretty good cross section, and \n72.5 percent said they wanted the loan rates raised.\n  Another question: A farm program should retain planting flexibility, \nincluding farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserves; 85.9 \npercent of the farmers interviewed said they would support that \nproposal. Only 9.9 percent opposed it.\n  Yet the Republicans in this body and in the House would never vote to \ngive farmers a farmer-owned and farmer-controlled grain reserve. We \nhave had that in the past. I, for one, happen to be in favor of \nreinstituting it. But, obviously, the party in power will not \ncountenance that. So when you ask what farmers want, it is here in this \npoll; it is as plain as can be. If we were voting on what farmers \nwanted, we would have lifted the caps from the commodity marketing \nassistance loan rates and we would have a farmer-owned and farmer-\ncontrolled grain reserve.\n  So much for that question.\n  It has also been said that our marketing loan proposals are \nundermining Freedom to Farm. That is not so. What has undermined \nFreedom to Farm is external events, which is weak export demand from \nthe Asian markets, along with the strong dollar, generally favorable \nweather and bumper crops in many areas. Those are the factors that have \nundermined the hoped-for success of Freedom to Farm.\n  Actually, the proposal that we have made would in some ways help \nFreedom to Farm. It is kind of odd that I find myself, who was opposed \nto Freedom to Farm because of its lack of income protection, saying \nthat our proposal probably will help save it more than what is being \ndone in this conference report. But, be that as it may, I still think \nthat, looking at it both in the short and the long term, raising the \ncaps on the marketing loans is the way to go.\n  One other point that I wanted to raise is that I really take issue \nwith any suggestion that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has flip-\nflopped on loan rates. I don't believe that assertion is supported by \nthe facts. Secretary Glickman for some time has talked about the need \nto restore a farm income safety net. In fact, he said that when the \nPresident signed the 1996 farm bill into law. He was not saying that he \nopposed taking the loan rate caps off; he just said there needed to be \na safety net. When a specific proposal to lift the caps on loan rates \nwas made, he endorsed it, as did President Clinton. So I can't see that \nas any kind of a flip-flop.\n  A lot has been said here about generosity and how generous the \nRepublican proposal in the conference report is for farmers, for \ndisaster-related assistance. I divide the conference report in this \nregard into two areas. There is the part that goes for the natural \ndisaster assistance and the part that goes for the income losses \nrelated to commodity prices.\n  On the disaster side, the proposal that we offered in conference \nwould provide $2.486 billion in disaster assistance. The conference \nreport has $2.350 billion. Actually, the proposal that we offered would \nhave been more generous overall to farmers suffering from disasters \nthan the conference report in front of us.\n  Mr. President, having said all of that, I must also say that there \nare many good features in this conference report. I commend the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member for their outstanding work \nunder very difficult constraints to pull this conference report \ntogether. It has a number of provisions important not only to my State \nof Iowa but to the Nation that I am pleased to see included. So there \nare a lot of good things in the bill.\n  But there is one overriding shortcoming in the bill that will, of \ncourse, compel me to oppose the conference report. And that is what we \nhave been speaking about most of the afternoon, those of us who have \nbeen on the floor; that is, what I feel to be the lack of adequate \nassistance to help our farmers--our farm families--deal with the worst \neconomic devastation in over a decade. It is a matter that is simply \ntoo important to let go. I regret that I must urge my colleagues to \nvote against the adoption of the conference report.\n  Again, just to refresh my colleagues about the seriousness of the \ncrisis facing American farm families and rural communities, in July, \nwhen this legislation was last on the Senate floor, 99 Senators voted \nin favor of a resolution recognizing the severity of the crisis that \nconfronts us in agriculture and calling for immediate action. What was \nbad then has become even worse since.\n  Commodity prices have fallen even further. In the period of 11 weeks, \ncorn and soybean prices at Central Illinois Terminal Elevators have \ndeclined 39 cents a bushel for corn and $1.49 a bushel for soybeans. At \nIowa Interior Elevators, prices have fallen by similar amounts to about \n$1.53 a bushel for corn, and about $4.65 a bushel for soybeans. And on \nthe livestock side, hog prices have continued at low levels, remaining \nat or below $30 a hundredweight in southern Iowa markets since early \nSeptember. Country elevator prices are expected to fall even lower as \nthe fall harvest gets fully in swing. Cattle prices remain low. Wheat \nprices have been depressed for a long time and are expected to continue \nso.\n  In addition to the low commodity prices, farmers in several regions \nof the country have suffered devastating losses from damaging weather, \ncrop diseases, and other natural disasters. There has been severe \ndrought in the South, Southwest, Southeast, and now followed by \ndevastating hurricanes.\n  In the northern plains, several years of crop disease have put \nfarmers on the ropes. As a result of all of these forces, farm income \nis falling drastically. It is estimated that this year net farm income \nwill be down by more than $11 billion from last year.\n  That is over a 20-percent drop in farm income in 1 year. Again, this \nloss of income is having a horrendous effect on farm families and their \ncommunities. And there appears to be no relief in the market on the \nhorizon.\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\n  We are all talking about the market. The theory of Freedom to Farm \nsupposedly was that farmers can plant for the market. Well, there is no \nmarket to speak of now. We have too large a quantity of commodities for \nthe market. We have a glut on the market, and our Asian markets and \nother markets are suffering. I don't know when they are going to come \nback. So if the response is that farmers can plant for the market, I \nassume the advice to farmers is not to plant because there is no \nmarket.\n  Well, how can that be when the farmer has his fixed costs. He has \nland. He has his equipment. He has all this money tied up. He has to \nplant. He has to plant his crops to try to make something. In fact, \neconomically, that farmer will try to plant more. He will try to get \nmore out of his fixed asset base to make up for his losses. He will try \nto get more production out of his fixed base to make up for lower \nprices. Therefore, we look again next year for another bumper crop \ncoming on and continued low prices. The Asian economy is not expected \nto turn around quickly, the Russian economy is in the tank, and the \nrelative strength of the U.S. dollar means that other exporting \ncountries can offer more competitive prices than we can.\n  So we are now in what appears to be a prolonged period of low \ncommodity prices. And unless we take some action, action that is truly \neffective, we are headed into another round of farm foreclosures and \nfamilies forced out of business and off the land.\n  A recent Iowa State University study, for example, concluded that 2 \nto 3 straight years of low prices could push as many as a third of Iowa \nfarmers into restructuring or liquidation with disastrous consequences \nfor Iowa's economy.\n  I want also to underscore the broad ramifications of this farm crisis \non the wider economy. Agriculture is the largest industry in my State \nof Iowa, as it is in a number of States. When agriculture is in a \ndownturn in Iowa, the entire State economy feels it.\n  If we consider the drop in corn and soybean prices alone this year, \nleaving aside the precipitous drop in hog prices, Iowa's economy this \nyear is going to take a hit of about $1.4 billion. Chopping that much \nout of Iowa's economy could cost upwards of 26,000 jobs, jobs that we \ncan ill-afford to lose in my State.\n  Again, I want to make it clear exactly what part of the conference \nreport I disagree with--the part dealing with loss of income caused by \nlow commodity prices.\n  Again, I am not opposing that part of the conference report dealing \nwith disaster assistance, although I did point out that what we had in \nour package was a little bit more generous to those farmers hard hit by \nthe disasters than what is in this conference report.\n  We had worked, Senator Daschle and a number of my colleagues and I \nhad worked on an emergency request sent up by the administration. We \nmade some modifications and additions to the administration's request. \nWe came up with what we considered to be a well-balanced bill. The \nemergency package that we put together would have provided about $130 \nmillion more in disaster-related assistance than the provisions now in \nthe conference report.\n  The other essential part of the package, apart from the disaster \nassistance, is to restore some of the farm income safety net. If we \nconsider those two aspects of the emergency package in tandem, then \nevery State in the United States would have come out better under our \nproposal than under what is now in the conference report, and that \nincludes the States hard hit by natural disasters.\n  Let me explain further why what is in this conference report is \ninadequate to deal with the problem of low commodity prices. The \nconference report includes $1.65 billion that would be added to the \nAgriculture Market Transition Act, otherwise known as AMTA, payments \nthat farmers will receive for fiscal 1999. I understand that these \npayments would mean an addition of about 19 cents a bushel for wheat \nand about 11 cents a bushel for corn when considered on the basis of \nprogram payment yield.\n  Keep in mind there are no payments directed for soybeans or oilseeds \nin this conference report even though soybean prices have dropped \ndramatically.\n  Also, keep in mind that actual yields are greater than the program \npayment yields used for calculating the AMTA payments. So if we \nconsider the actual production on farms, the conference report would \nprovide about 13 cents a bushel for wheat and about 7 cents a bushel \nfor corn. Again, no direct assistance for soybeans.\n  These levels of assistance are totally inadequate. In fact, a \nspokesman for one Member of this body said it better than I could. He \nsaid the proposal is a ``slap in the face'' to farmers. Well, it really \nis. I likened it to giving a person dying of thirst a thimbleful of \nwater; it might relieve suffering momentarily but it really doesn't \nsolve the problem of the person dying of thirst.\n  The proposal that Senator Daschle and I along with others put forward \nis different. This proposal, which has been talked about by others this \nafternoon, simply would lift the caps from the commodity marketing \nassistance loan rates. If that was done, our proposal would add about \n57 cents a bushel in added income protection for wheat, compared to 13 \ncents in the conference report, 28 cents a bushel for corn compared to \n7 cents a bushel for corn in the conference report, and about 28 cents \na bushel for soybeans compared to zero for soybeans in the conference \nreport. I might also point out it would provide higher loan rates for \nboth cotton and rice.\n  Our proposal obviously was rejected in conference. That is very \nunfortunate because it goes much further than what is in the conference \nreport toward addressing the devastating loss of farm income due to low \ncommodity prices. Again, if we have low commodity prices caused by a \nglut, bumper crops, combined with the loss of foreign markets we are \ngoing to have to enact some reasonable income protection to help \nfarmers make it through this economic disaster--a disaster not of their \nown making. I know there has been a lot of discussion about fast track \nas though that is the magical solution to everything that is wrong in \nthe farm economy. If only we had fast track, it is suggested, \neverything would be beautiful. Let's be honest and let's be real about \nit. Fast track could help us 5 or 7 years from now, which is how long \nit took to get the Uruguay Round completed. But fast track doesn't help \nus now. Not in any way does it help the farm families who face \nforeclosure in the next few months. I say that as someone who has voted \nfor fast track in the past, who voted for NAFTA and voted for the \nUruguay Round agreement. I defy anyone to come to the floor and tell me \nhow, if fast track were passed right now, it could possibly help \nfarmers who are in dire straits this year and next year. So fast track \nmay have some benefits down the pike, depending on what comes out of \nthe negotiations, but none in the immediate future.\n  Again, I and others who have proposed lifting the caps on marketing \nloan rates have been accused of going beyond the scope of the farm \nbill, of reopening the farm bill. Well, the fact is marketing loan are \nin the farm bill. The bill set a formula for loan rates, but then put \nan arbitrary cap on the loan rates for budgetary reasons. Taking off \nthe caps and letting the formula already in the bill work, as we are \nproposing, is not really reopening the farm bill. We are simply taking \nwhat is in the farm bill, a tool that is in there, and using the tool \nto enhance the farm income protections within the basic structure of \nthe 1996 farm bill--simply by removing the caps. That change, combined \nwith extending the loan period, will help farmers well into next year--\nand next year and the year after if the policy were adopted for the \nlong term as I believe would be desirable. Added AMTA payments will go \nout this year, and that is it. A lot of the new AMTA payments will go \nto farmers who will not be farming next year. A lot of that AMTA \npayment will go to farmers whose landlords will seize the opportunity \nto increase the rent and take it back in rent payments. So basically \nthe AMTA payment is sort of a one-time payment to farmers, but it \nreally is not going to solve the problem.\n  Again, I would like to illustrate the difference between the \nconference report and what the Democratic plan was. For a 650-acre corn \nand soybean farm in Iowa with 390 acres of corn\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\nbase, 260 acres of soybeans, the conference report will provide a \n$4,230 payment to that farmer. The Democratic proposal, in removing the \nmarketing loan caps, would provide increased income protection of \n$18,455 or a difference of $14,225 to the farmer with 390 acres of corn \nand 260 acres of soybeans in Iowa.\n  So again, that is a very substantial difference, and it is a \ndifference that would carry through into next year because of the \nimproved income safety net aspect of the marketing assistance loan. The \nsmall AMTA supplement is a short term one-time payment.\n  So again, I just ask my colleagues from the Corn Belt whether 7 cents \na bushel paid out now, but soon gone, is anywhere near enough to \naddress severe farm income problems. Is 13 cents a bushel enough even \nto begin to address the economic devastation in wheat country? And I \nask my colleagues whether a proposal with no direct support for \nsoybeans is adequate to address the steep decline in soybean prices.\n  So that is really the question today. The question is whether or not \nthose very small cash payments are going to be adequate for the \ntremendous farm income problems that are out there. I do not believe \nso. I do not believe that will help nearly enough--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, the hour of 5:30 \nhaving arrived, the clerk is to report the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 10.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I just be \nallowed 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask for 1 \nadditional minute at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from \nIowa before the rollcall vote on the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, this conference report needs to be \nrejected and sent back for further work to restore farm income \nprotection by removing the marketing loan rate caps. There are also two \nother areas in which the conference report is not acceptable.\n  I would mention the labeling of beef and lamb for country of origin. \nThe House Republicans rejected this idea. It is too bad, because under \nthe WTO it is allowed, to have country of origin labeling. It is not \njust for our beef and lamb producers in this country. I believe our \nconsumers have the right to know, when they buy a steak or chop or \nother cut of beef or lamb at the meat counter, what its country of \norigin is.\n  Second, we had mandatory price reporting in the Senate bill so \nlivestock producers will have information to help them evaluate packer \nbids for fairness. The conference report converted that bill language \ninto weak report language. We have had study after study after study on \npricing practices in the livestock and meat business and the need for \nmore openness and transparency. It is time we have real action, not \nanother study on that.\n  For those reasons I believe the conference report ought to be \nrejected and sent back for further work. If it is not, then I am afraid \nwe will have a one-time payment to farmers this fall and we will be \nback again here next year with fewer farmers and even more economic \ndevastation in rural America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \n``Suggested Changes in Farm Policy for the 21st Century,'' submitted by \nDr. Neil Harl of Iowa State University, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Suggested Changes in Farm Policy for the 21st Century\n\n\n                    fine tuning ``freedom to farm''\n\n                             (By Neil Harl)\n\n       Farmer-owned storage program for major commodities.\n       Long-term land idling (up to 20 years) in marginal areas \n     (contracts terminate if prices rise above a specified level).\n       Standby authority to implement acreage set aside (if prices \n     remain for a specified period below a designated level).\n       Adequate funding for FSA direct lending and loan guarantees \n     for limited resource borrowers.\n       Continue LDP and marketing loans with slightly higher loan \n     rate (not higher than cost of production on marginal lands).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia, under a previous \nunanimous consent request, is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to express my surprise and dismay \nabout what occurred in the conference committee on the agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  During debate on this bill in July, Mr. President, the Senate \naccepted an amendment I offered to waive the statute of limitations for \ndiscrimination complaints filed by many small and minority farmers \nagainst the U.S. Department of Agriculture. This amendment addresses an \nurgent and shameful problem, Mr. President, and we worked with farmers, \nthe White House, the USDA, the Department of Justice, and the \nCongressional Black Caucus to develop language that would protect the \nlegal rights of farmers' and be implementable by USDA.\n  Mr. President, similar language was included in the House bill, but \nit was drafted more quickly and with less consensus. It was more \nnarrowly defined and had less aggressive time limits for USDA to \nresolve discrimination complaints. And it cost $5 million less.\n  And even though Representative Maxine Waters, the chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus lobbied the conferees in support of the \nSenate version of this amendment, Mr. President, the Senate lost on \nalmost all counts.\n  To give my colleagues some background, the investigative unit at \nUSDA's Office of Civil Rights was abolished in 1983. Farmers whose \ncomplaints were pending at the time were led to believe their \ncomplaints were still being investigated, when they were not. Farmers \nwho filed complaints after the abolition of the unit were also led to \nbelieve that their complaints would be processed and investigated, \ndespite the fact that the USDA had no resources with which to conduct \nsuch investigations. The bottom line is that none of these complaints \nwere ever considered--but none of the farmers were told that was the \ncase.\n  When Secretary Glickman learned of this problem, Mr. President, he \ndirected that the complaints be resolved quickly. In fact, I offered an \namendment to last year's appropriations bill to fund the investigative \nunit.\n  But when USDA was finally prepared to enter into settlement \nagreements on some of these cases, Mr. President, the Department of \nJustice stepped in to claim that the statute of limitations for the \ncomplaints--despite USDA's deception in the matter--had expired. The \namendment I offered to this year's appropriations bill eliminates this \nlegal obstacle and allows farmers to pursue their claims of \ndiscrimination. It allows them to have their day in court, so to speak.\n  As we approached conference, however, I learned through staff that \nobjections to accepting the Senate version of this amendment were \nraised based on cost. Our version was scored at $15 million, while the \nHouse version was scored at $10 million. Mr. President, there's no \nquestion the two amendments were slightly different. But the $15 \nmillion in the Senate amendment was to compensate Americans for \ndiscrimination perpetuated by their own government. It was a figure \ndetermined by CBO, conferring with USDA, about which of the pending \ncomplaints would have likely resulted in legitimate and provable cases \nof government discrimination. It is money that our government owes to \nfarmers who have been treated in such an unjust and morally \nreprehensible manner.\n\n  Mr. President, during conference deliberations, I learned that the \nHouse conferees objected to the scope of the Senate amendment. As I've \nalluded to before, the House version addressed only discrimination \ncomplaints against the Farm Service Agency. My amendment addressed \ncomplaints filed against not only the Farm Service Agency, but also the \nRural Housing Service. We know that discrimination has occurred in both \nagencies, and study after study has clearly illustrated this. Unless we \naddress complaints against both agencies, we allow justice to continue \nto elude a number of minority farmers in America who deserve at long \nlast to be treated fairly.\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\n  To my dismay, Mr. President, the conferees accepted the House version \nof the civil rights amendment, adding only a small portion of the \nSenate version.\n  The Senate version of the civil rights amendment allowed for the \nwaiver of the statute of limitations for discrimination complaints made \nagainst both the Farm Service Agency and the Rural Housing Service. The \nHouse version only allowed the FSA claims.\n  While the conference language allows farmers to file suit in federal \ncourt if their claims for relief are denied by USDA, the Senate \nlanguage specified that the federal court shall apply a de novo \nstandard of review. This standard would have allowed a federal court to \nreview USDA's findings and rationales with a fresh eye, so to speak. In \nother words, a court would not be required to give as much deference to \nUSDA's decisions. This is obviously a protection that would have given \naggrieved farmers a degree of legal protection that is imminently \njustified. Yet no such protection exists in the conference language.\n  To make matters worse, Mr. President, the one protective provision \nthat I was told would be included in the conference language--the \nexpedited review provision--was somehow omitted from the conference \nreport. When the conferees reached a compromise on this amendment, it \nis my understanding that they specifically agreed to include a \nprovision of my amendment which limited USDA to 180 days in which to \ninvestigate complaints, issue findings, and propose settlement awards, \nwhere applicable. This provision was supposed to be included, but it \nwas not.\n  Mr. President, I am at a loss to explain why we can't do a better job \nof rectifying such a grevious history of overt, admitted discrimination \nfor so little money. Our Minority farmers deserved better conference \nlanguage from this Congress than they got. It just underscores the \nenormous obstacle we face in resolving this issue--and that is that too \nfew members care enough about this problem to give it the attention and \nthe priority it calls for.\n\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I'd like to share with my \ncolleagues some updated news. Last week, the Office of Inspector \nGeneral issued a report which lambasted the Office of Civil Rights' \nhandling of the backlog of discrimination complaints. The report \ncharacterized the Office's case files as ``too slovenly to ensure the \navailability of critical documents.'' It further berated the Office for \nits failure to implement the majority of recommendations made to the \nDepartment in a February 1997 report.\n  I am not sure why this Department has had so many problems, not only \nwith eliminating unjust and inexcusable behavior, but also with \nefficiently resolving complaints of discrimination. These are symptoms \nof an overwhelming and inexcusable problem. As many of my colleagues \nknow, this is a problem that I have been working to solve for almost \ntwo years, from the moment it was first brought to my attention by a \ngroup of minority farmers headed by a Virginian.\n  Mr. President, I have heard account after account of inexcusable \nbehavior on the part of various officials at USDA, primarily those in \npositions of authority who process farmers' applications for loans. \nSome farmers have had trouble even getting loan applications, much less \nhaving their applications processed in a timely manner. Many farmers \nhave cited stories in which their applications have been purposely \nprocessed later than those of non-minority farmers. The loan money \nthen, in effect, was dispersed to non-minority farmers first. Then, \nwhen many minority farmers checked the status of their applications, \nthe USDA officials responded by stating that there wasn't any money \nleft. Another farmer told me that a USDA official was permitted to keep \na noose in his office, despite repeated complaints about the message it \nsent to minority farmers wishing to do business in that office.\n  I know that Secretary Glickman is committed to stemming this pattern, \nbut ultimately Congress is responsible for overseeing our government \nagencies. In the two years that I've been working on this issue, \ntalking with farmers, meeting with the Secretary and the President, we, \nas a Congress, have not taken a sufficiently forceful approach to stem \nthis shameful pattern of discrimination. In my view, that makes us part \nof the problem as well.\n  When the conferees chose not to accept the Senate language, they made \na choice that sends a disquieting message to minority farmers across \nthis country. The message they sent was that they were willing to do \nthe bare minimum for minority farmers who have suffered discrimination \nat the hands of government officials. It is a message that we, the \nCongress, are not willing to get fully invested in eliminating \ndiscrimination within our own government.\n  The President has indicated that he will veto this bill, and I am \nhopeful that my colleagues will take another opportunity to look at the \ndifferences between the Senate language and the conference language. We \nwill have another opportunity to correct a critical error in our \npriorities. The farmers deserve our best oversight efforts, and they \ndeserve the strongest civil rights amendment that we can craft. I will \ncontinue to push all of our colleagues to do so. A lack of attention to \nthis issue means not only failure on our part, but a perpetuation of a \nproblem for which we should all be ashamed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask unanimous consent that this \nletter and executive summary from the Inspector General to the \nSecretary of Agriculture dated September 30, 1998 be included in the \nRecord immediately following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                  Office of Inspector General,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 1998.\n\n        Report to the Secretary on Civil Rights Issues--Phase V\n\n     From: Roger C. Viadero, Inspector General.\n     Subject: Evaluation of the Office of Civil Rights' Efforts to \n         Reduce the Backlog of Program Complaints, Evaluation \n         Report No. 60801-1-Hq.\n\n       In July 1998, your Assistant Secretary for Administration \n     asked the Office of Inspector General to review the efforts \n     by the Office of Civil Rights (CR) to reduce the backlog of \n     program complaints in USDA. Attached is a copy of the results \n     of this review. This represents our fifth evaluation of the \n     Department's efforts to reduce the program complaints backlog \n     and to improve the overall complaint processing system, \n     including the investigative process.\n       We found that the Department, through CR, has not made \n     significant progress in reducing the complaints backlog. \n     Whereas the backlog stood at 1,088 complaints on November 1, \n     1997, it still remains at 616 complaints as of September 11, \n     1998.\n       The problems we noted before in the complaints resolution \n     process also continue. CR's data base remains an unreliable \n     repository of information, and its casefiles are too slovenly \n     to ensure the availability of critical documents. A \n     disaffected staff and a leadership vacuum have contributed to \n     a system that cannot ensure complainants a timely hearing of \n     their grievances.\n       Of considerable concern to us is CR's lack of progress in \n     reforming its operations in accordance with our previous \n     recommendations. Few corrective actions have been taken to \n     increase the efficiency of the complaints resolution process. \n     We also noted that CR staff members have not always been \n     honest in portraying the actual level of their performance. \n     Some of the information they gave us proved to be inaccurate. \n     Some of the information they gave you on earlier occasions \n     proved likewise to be inaccurate.\n       Because of continuing problems in the complaints resolution \n     process, we are recommending that you convene a Complaints \n     Resolution Task Force (independent of CR) to immediately \n     assume control of the backlog and have full authority to \n     resolve complaints, including entering into settlement \n     agreements. We are also recommending that the civil rights \n     function within the Department be elevated to the level of \n     Assistant Secretary.\n       At your request, we will be continuing our work with CR, \n     giving special emphasis to its management of settlement \n     agreements.\n\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n     Purpose\n       The Assistant Secretary for Administration asked us to \n     perform a followup review of the operations of USDA's Office \n     of Civil Rights (CR), the office responsible for resolving \n     complaints made against the Department for alleged civil \n     rights violations in the administration of its programs. \n     During four previous reviews of the Department's civil rights \n     program complaints system, we determined that the system was \n     not functioning properly and that the Department had amassed \n     a growing backlog of complaints that required immediate \n     attention. Although CR itself could not accurately determine \n     how large the backlog was at the time of our first review, it \n     later identified 1,088 outstanding unresolved complaints \n     before November 1, 1997.\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\n     Results in brief\n       Our past reviews had questioned the productivity of CR; we \n     had found a disaffected staff and a leadership vacuum. Little \n     was being accomplished by USDA agencies to respond to citizen \n     complaints of discrimination and little was done by CR to \n     manage the resolution process. Some complaints in CR's \n     backlog had languished for over 2 years. After our February \n     1997 report, CR made the resolution of its backlog its first \n     priority.\n       Our current review disclosed that the backlog of complaints \n     of civil rights violations, although reduced, still stands at \n     616 cases as of September 11, 1998. Of these 616 cases, 80 \n     are under investigation, 310 are awaiting adjudication, 23 \n     are undergoing a legal sufficiency review, and 103 are \n     pending closure. The remaining 100 cases still await a \n     preliminary analysis. (Because 164 complaints are involved in \n     lawsuits against the Department, their cases cannot currently \n     be processed. Of these 164 cases, 147 are included in the \n     remaining backlog.)\n       The backlog is not being resolved at a faster rate because \n     CR itself has not attained the efficiency it needs to \n     systematically reduce the caseload. Few of the deficiencies \n     we noted in our previous reviews have been corrected. The \n     office is still in disarray, providing no decisive leadership \n     and making attempt to correct the mistakes of the past. We \n     noted with considerable concern that after 20 months, CR has \n     made virtually no progress in implementing the corrective \n     actions we thought essential to the viability of its \n     operations. The following table summarizes the key areas for \n     which our recommendations were made and in which the \n     uncorrected deficiencies persist.\n\n  TABLE 1.--AREAS OF DEFICIENCY PREVIOUSLY NOTED BY OIG AND STILL UNCORRECTED--RECURRING OFFICE OF CIVIL RIGHTS\n                                                     ISSUES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             OIG Evaluation Phases\n                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Issue             Alert (02/25/                II (09/29/   Memo (12/18/   IV (03/04/\n                                   97)      I (02/27/97)       97)           97)           98)      V (09/30/98)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReview State foreclosure                X             X             X             X             X             X\n actions....................\nSend letters of               ............

X Condition continues.  X Corrective action taken but not\n  adequately implemented. See exhibits B and C for the Secretary's memoranda regarding Phases I and II.\n\n       We estimate that if CR continues to operate under its \n     current methods and at its current rate, the backlog of \n     complaints existing on November 1, 1997, will not be \n     completely resolved for at least another year.\n       Most conspicuous among the uncorrected problems is the \n     continuing disorder within CR. The data base CR uses to \n     report the status of cases is unreliable and full of errors, \n     and the files it keeps to store needed documentation are \n     slovenly and unmanaged. Forty complaint files could not be \n     found, and another 130 complaints that were listed in USDA \n     agency files were not recorded in CR's data base. Management \n     controls were so poor that we could not render an opinion on \n     the quality of CR's investigations and adjudications.\n       Of equal significance is the absence of written policy and \n     procedures. It is incumbent upon CR to revise department \n     policy to ensure it complies with civil rights laws and to \n     establish the framework of its own activities. We believe \n     standardized, written guidelines are essential to CR's \n     operation, and it is a matter of concern to us that CR has, \n     over the space of 20 months, produced nothing to lay the \n     foundation for good management controls.\n       The absence of formal procedures and accurate records \n     raises questions about due care within the complaints \n     resolution process. We found critical quality control steps \n     missing at every stage of the process. Staffmembers with \n     little training and less experience were put to judging \n     matters that carry serious legal and moral implications. Many \n     of CR's adjudicators, who must determine whether \n     discrimination occurred, were student interns. Legal \n     staffmembers with the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), \n     who review CR's decisions for legal sufficiency, have had to \n     return over half of them because they were based on \n     incomplete data or faulty analysis. We noted that a \n     disproportionately large percent of the 616 cases of \n     unresolved backlog had bottlenected in the adjudication unit.\n       Furthermore, CR may not understand the full scope of its \n     authority. CR has concentrated its oversight on federally-\n     conducted programs; it has largely ignored a host of \n     federally-assisted programs (e.g., crop insurance, research \n     grants) in which complaints of discrimination may have been \n     made.\n       CR's unsuccessful efforts to resolve the backlog of civil \n     rights complaints are in part the symptom of an insecurity \n     that has affected office morale. The many reorganizations the \n     complaints resolution staff has undergone, the high turnover \n     the staff has experienced within the last several years, and \n     the inadequate training afforded both managers and \n     staffmembers, have left the staff unfocused and without \n     clear direction. The staff we found at the civil rights \n     offices was not a coherent team of dedicated professionals \n     with a shared vision but a fragmented order of individual \n     fiefdoms, each mindful only of its own borders and its own \n     responsibilities. Low office morale has contributed to a \n     lack of productivity. CR's data base shows that since \n     January 1997, CR closed only 19 cases through \n     adjudication, 8 of which were not even investigated by CR. \n     Through this inefficiency, complainants are being denied a \n     timely hearing of their civil rights complaints.\n       Also disturbing was the evasiveness we encountered at CR. \n     We found discrepancies between what we were told by \n     staffmembers and what we were subsequently able to verify. We \n     found similar discrepancies in information CR communicated to \n     the Secretary. These discrepancies, in the number of open and \n     closed complaints, were repeated at congressional hearings \n     and other public forums.\n       We concluded that in order to complete the backlog of cases \n     expeditiously, the Secretary needs to transfer resolution of \n     the backlog to a complaints resolution task force, composed \n     of seasoned adjudicators and well qualified civil rights \n     personnel from Federal agencies outside USDA. The task force \n     should have full authority to review and resolve all \n     complaints.\n       To increase CR's efficiency in the long term, the Secretary \n     should create an Assistant Secretary of Civil Rights with \n     subcabinet-level status. Concurrently, the CR Director should \n     emphasize hiring managers who have a solid background in \n     civil rights and a good knowledge of Department programs.\n       Once in operation, the task force would provide CR with the \n     opportunity to focus on its own structure and implement the \n     reforms it needs to function efficiently. We believe CR is \n     capable of these reforms and that it is in the best position \n     within the Department to act objectively in resolving civil \n     rights complaints. Consequently it should retain Department \n     authority to investigate future complaints. We believe that \n     when CR has taken the corrective actions we previously \n     recommended, as well as the steps outlined in this followup \n     report, it will provide more efficient service.\n     Key recommendations\n       We recommend that the Secretary take the following actions \n     to ensure that citizens who have complained of discrimination \n     by USDA receive a timely hearing:\n       Immediately convene a complaints resolution task force, \n     composed of well qualified civil rights personnel from other \n     Federal agencies and senior USDA program personnel with \n     decision-making authority. The task force, under the \n     direction of an Executive Director who reports directly to \n     the Secretary, should immediately assume control of the \n     backlog and have full authority to review and resolve \n     complaints.\n       The complaints resolution task force could also assist the \n     CR Director in reviewing new complaints that have exceeded \n     the 180-day resolution deadline set by the Civil Rights \n     Implementation Team.\n       The OGC and the CR Director should be available to assist \n     the task force in its efforts.\n       The task force should perform a case-by-case, document-by-\n     document sweep of the casefiles to restore retrievability to \n     the information contained in the files.\n       Elevate the Department's civil rights functions to the \n     level of Assistant Secretary with full authority across \n     agency lines.\n       Require CR to (a) issue needed operational policies and \n     procedures within a 2-month timeframe, (b) resolve within 2 \n     months all other recommendations that we made in our previous \n     reports but that CR has failed to implement, (c) keep open \n     all cases with settlement agreements so the agreements may be \n     tracked, and (d) institute other operational improvements \n     that will ensure the efficient operation of the civil rights \n     functions within the Department and ensure due care in the \n     resolution of all civil rights complaints as well as a timely \n     hearing for all complainants.\n     Statistical data on complaints\n       According to CR's data base as of September 11, 1998, the \n     Department's inventory of\n\n[[Page S11436]]\n\n     complaints totals 1,439 that are open and 582 that are \n     closed. Of the total open and closed cases, 383 are part of 2 \n     lawsuits brought against the Department; 77 from the \n     Brewington lawsuit, and 256 from the Pigford lawsuit.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nproceed for 2 minutes prior to the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, when Senator Cochran and I reported the \nfiscal year 1999 appropriations bill for agriculture, rural development \nand related agencies to the Senate earlier this year, our \nrecommendation included maintaining the studies and evaluations \nactivities for USDA's food programs with the Food and Nutrition Service \n(FNS). This recommendation was consistent with the President's budget \nrequest.\n  The studies and evaluations activities are important for a number of \nreasons. These activities enable better program management of the \nseveral domestic feeding programs administered through USDA. We should \nremember that USDA's nutrition programs comprise the lions' share of \nthe USDA budget and are often all that stands between many of our \npeople and abject hunger. Because of the long-term health implications \nassociated with a healthy, nutritious diet, it is absolutely vital that \nprogram administrators have access to relevant and updated information \nregarding nutrition and program delivery.\n  Mr. HARKINS. I agree with the Senator from Arkansas' explanation of \nthe importance of these research functions at USDA. Although the Senate \nposition going into conference was to fund the food program studies and \nevaluations through FNS, the House insisted on their provision which \nwould place these functions with the Economic Research Service (ERS). \nWe were able to reach an agreement with the House conferees, as \nincluded in this Conference Report, to transfer $2 million from the ERS \nback to the FNS for this purpose. It is our expectation that the ERS \nwill continue its working relationship with the FNS in order for that \nagency to conduct the same type of studies and evaluations as in the \ncurrent fiscal year.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to note the importance of \ncoordinating the research agenda for the food program studies and \nevaluations between USDA's research and nutrition subcabinet officers. \nI cannot understate the importance of these two branches of USDA \ncontinuing to work together, as they have done this year, to ensure \nthat FNS' research agenda meets the needs of program managers to have \nadequate information to guide their program decisions.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Senator Bumpers is correct. I strongly urge the Under \nSecretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Service and the Under \nSecretary for Research, Education and Economics to continue working \ntogether to establish a reasonable division of effort consistent with a \nsound research agenda.\n\n\n                         National swine center\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to engage my colleague, Senator Bumpers, the \nranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies in a colloquy \nregarding the pending legislation. For clarification, I would like the \nSenator to provide further explanation of language included in the \nStatement of Managers accompanying the conference report to H.R. 4101.\n  It is my understanding that language under the heading of the \nAgricultural Research Service imposes a limitation on funding for the \nNational Swine Research Center at Ames, Iowa, but is related to \noperational and maintenance costs for that facility beyond those \nnormally associated with assignments of ARS personnel. This \ninterpretation would not be inconsistent with the general provision of \nthe conference report that prohibits the transfer of title of the \nCenter to USDA.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Iowa is correct. While the conference \nreport does not allow for the transfer of title of the facility to \nUSDA, and the Statement of Managers includes language limiting the use \nof funds for operational costs, that limitation does not apply to the \nallocation of funds pursuant to normal ARS scientist assignments. The \nStatement of Managers includes direction that an increase of $2 million \nfor ARS research at Ames, Iowa, is included as reflected in the \naccompanying table. That table indicates an increase of $1 million for \nthe National Animal Disease Center and an additional $1 million for \nLivestock Management. The latter amount is available for use at the \nNational Swine Research Center consistent with normal ARS personnel \nfunding allocations.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his further explanation.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me say, and I would be remiss if I \ndid not say it at this point, I think, one of the things I will miss \ndeeply when I leave the U.S. Senate will be the excellent relationship \nI have had with the chairman of this committee. He has been, probably, \nmuch more generous to me through the years that he was chairman than I \nwas to him when I was chairman. But I want the whole Senate to know of \nmy deep admiration for him. I want the whole country to know it. He is \na consummate gentleman. He is a man of impeccable integrity. He is \naccommodating to a fault to his colleagues. And one of the things I \nwill miss is his counsel, advice and common sense.\n  He is the personification of what public service should be. I have \nbeen most honored to serve with him and I will cherish his friendship \nalways.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11411-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n           FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT OF 1998--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will take just a couple of minutes. I \nwant to comment on the administration's discussions with us regarding \nKosovo and just make one statement that I feel compelled to make on the \nSenate floor, which I have made to the administration and to a number \nof Senators.\n  First of all, from this Senator's standpoint, it will be extremely \ndifficult to support any kind of military action in Kosovo unless the \nPresident of the United States requests of us significant increases to \nthe defense budget to address the shortfalls in military readiness, \npersonnel, and modernization recently acknowledged by the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff.\n  From my standpoint, we ought not be supporting additional military \naction and putting our men and our equipment in harm's way unless and \nuntil we have a game plan to put adequate resources into our Defense \nDepartment for the readiness shortfalls that already exist.\n  The crisis in military preparedness that has only belatedly been \nacknowledged by the President and his administration is very grave.\n  To support ongoing operations around the world, our men and women in \nuniform are deployed far away from their homes and their families for \nunprecedented lengths of time. Morale among many of our troops is \nsuffering, and recruiting and retention statistics are dangerously low. \nModernization of our force is seriously underfunded across the \nservices. Training in many of the combatant commands must halt well \nbefore the end of the fiscal year due to funding and supply shortfalls. \nNearly 12,000 military families are once again on food stamps. And \nfailing to provide additional funding for potential costly military \noperations in Kosovo while United States forces are about to complete 3 \nyears in Bosnia at a cost of nearly $10 billion will, in my opinion, \nseverely and perhaps irreparably exacerbate the critical readiness \ncrisis that exists.\n  In summary, if the President expects this Senator to support Kosovo \naction--and I am not sure the administration seeks a resolution--I have \njust stated succinctly what I believe is an absolute necessity on the \npart of the President and his administration; that is, tell us how you \nare going to make our military ready again before you send them into \nharm's way again, when we already know that we are short of much of the \nequipment and parts and our military is in many respects lacking and \ndeficient in readiness.\n  I think it is a simple proposition. I think they have time to do it. \nI think it is serious. I think when many Senators find out about the \nreadiness issues, they are going to be saying the same thing: Let's see \nhow we are going to fix that before we engage in another battle.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11437-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11437-S11442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE FINANCIAL SERVICES MODERNIZATION BILL--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend my \ncolleagues for the overwhelming vote on H.R. 10, the financial services \nmodernization bill, which passed 93 to 0, in terms of moving forward. \nIt was a motion to proceed to consider. I know it wasn't on the bill \nitself, and I know that there are some Members who do not agree and \nsome who oppose very strongly various provisions of the bill. That is \nunderstandable, because it is a major piece of legislation.\n  I thank the majority and the minority leaders for their support and \nfor their help in getting this bill to this point, facilitating it, and \nthe members of the Banking Committee and the ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes of Maryland, who have worked in the most constructive of \nmanners, putting the interests and needs of the financial services \ncommunity of this great Nation of ours--the capital formation system \nthat is so important--putting those interests and needs first.\n  I have to tell you that this is not a partisan matter, that the \nSenate has addressed this in the uniquely bipartisan way that reflects \nvery, very credibly upon this institution, again, recognizing the fact \nthat Members certainly cannot agree with all of the provisions that may \nbe contained in this very comprehensive bill.\n  Mr. President, the need for legislation to modernize the financial \nservices industry is obvious. The existing legal framework has been for \nsome time fundamentally outdated, and this body itself has recognized \nthe existing laws are part of the statutory framework built largely in \nthe 1930s and they just do not fit the realities of today's financial \nmarketplace.\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\n  Congress has been attempting to pass legislation to modernize this \nsystem for almost 25 years. The only barrier to success now is the \nSenate of the United States. We really are at a historic moment.\n  Let me cite the views of Paul Volcker, a former Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, to place our deliberations in some kind of historical \nperspective. No one can say it is turf as it relates to Mr. Volcker and \nwhat his position may or a may not be. He says:\n\n       Over the long years of debate, it typically has been the \n     U.S. Senate that has been in the vanguard in seeking reform, \n     and it was the House that could not reach satisfactory \n     consensus. Now, after extended hearings and debate, with \n     strong leadership support, a coherent and responsible bill \n     has emerged from that body. This month the Senate has a \n     unique opportunity to complete the process, ending years of \n     frustration for the markets and for Congress alike. At issue \n     is not just the matter of American banking legislation and \n     certainly not a narrow political calculation of what \n     parochial industry position is most completely satisfied. \n     This is a time for the United States in much easier \n     circumstances to demonstrate that we are capable of enacting \n     ourselves the kind of reforms we press on others.\n\n  Mr. President, how cogent these words and these observations are. \nIndeed, Mr. Volcker wrote this article and submitted it, and it has \nbeen carried in a number of news media across the country some weeks \nbefore the full extent of what is taking place in the world banking \ncommunity and the financial services industry has been understood, \nbefore it has become even more important and paramount that the kinds \nof reforms that are so necessary and that many other countries have \nbeen avoiding are reforms that we ourselves must and should undertake, \ninstead of having a piecemeal approach in a haphazard way, of whether \nthe regulator at the Fed or the Treasury in terms of the Comptroller \nundertaking changes leaves us in a situation where I can truthfully say \nwe have abdicated our responsibility. I hope that we will not lose this \nopportunity to discharge our responsibilities in a manner that will \nreflect credibly on this body and the Congress of the United States and \non each and every Member.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that this bill is a good bill. The fact is \nthat we have been able to get together, for the first time, in an \nunprecedented fashion, a broad consensus for the need for financial \nmodernization by the players themselves, by the people who are actually \nin this area. Virtually all of the financial services community has \nendorsed this legislation.\n  Indeed, let me just list a number of those groups. The American \nCommunity Bankers. How often have we heard it said, ``Oh, the little \nbankers are opposed to this.'' Indeed, the American Community Bankers \nare in favor of this legislation. The American Bankers Association. Now \nwe are talking about the larger banks. They have signed on. So from \ncommunity bankers to large money center banks. The American Council of \nLife Insurance Companies. Imagine, when did we ever have the life \ninsurance industry and the Congress working together with their banking \ncontemporaries? There has been such fierce estrangement of the issues. \nThe Financial Services Council, the Independent Bankers Association of \nAmerica, the Independent Insurance Association. Now we are talking \nabout those people who are out there selling and who heretofore have \nbeen adamantly opposed; we have them supporting this. The Investment \nCompanies Institute, the securities industry, the Bond Market \nAssociation, the National Association of Multiple Insurance Companies, \nand most executives of major financial companies have been strongly \nsupportive.\n  Mr. President, no less than former Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard Volcker--and I read his remarks--is totally supportive because it \nis long overdue. Our present Chairman, Alan Greenspan, one of the \nworld's most respected bankers, says this is a good bill and is \nsupportive. The Securities and Exchange Commission and their Chairman, \nArthur Levitt, are supportive of this bill.\n  Yes, there is room for reasonable people to have differences over \nvarious aspects of this bill. I suggest to you that some of those \ndifferences can and should be debated, the time can be provided, and \nthat we can vote on them, and let the will of the Congress decide and \nnot let the clock of a late session be the enemy of progress. Let's not \nlet the quest for perfection stop that which is an excellent bill. \nLet's not look for 100 percent when we can get 99 and be doing the \nbusiness of the people.\n  I am not going to argue the merits of some of those positions that my \nfriends have--friends on my side of the aisle. Indeed, when it comes to \nvarious issues, reasonable people can disagree, but the question is, \nare we going to undertake our responsibilities in a manner which befits \nthe great office and the prestige of U.S. Senators or are we going to \nsay, no, unless I get it my way 100 percent, dot the i, cross the t, we \nare going to kill that which would otherwise advance the interests of \nall of our people, all of our citizens?\n  I hope that we can move to a higher level. I am not prepared to, nor \nwill I, debate the relative merits of the changes that some of my \ncolleagues are suggesting are necessary to earn their support. Indeed, \nI am not going to defend those who may have used the present law in a \nmanner never intended to gain their way, to gain financial advantage \nfor themselves as opposed to their community. If and when that takes \nplace, it is wrong. It should be stopped.\n  But I suggest that if we look at the totality of this bill, to say \nthat, unless we can deal with this particular abuse, we are not going \nto have financial reform, would be a mistake. I am not going to defend \nthose who have used the law inappropriately, those who in essence \nviolate the spirit, yes, and I think the actual law that exists today.\n  Do I think that we could do better? Yes, if we had sufficient time. \nDo I think we could bring together and put together a coalition that \ncould pass this bill if, indeed, we adopted some of the changes that my \ncolleagues and friends might want to see? And I am talking specifically \nabout the area of CRA, the Community Reinvestment Act. The answer is \nno; it would be the death of the bill.\n  Now, Mr. President, I could understand my colleagues'--and I do \nunderstand--strong revulsion for the manner in which CRA may have been \nused in particular cases that they are conversant with, familiar with, \nand that they have put forth to this body. I understand that. But I do \nhave difficulty understanding how and why at this time, when we can \nachieve such great progress in dealing with 90-plus percent of the \nproblems that exist today, where we can make the kinds of fundamental \nchanges that almost everyone agrees are necessary so that we can meet \nour obligations here at home and in the world of finances, we would \nsacrifice that gain because we can't get perfection at this point in \ntime.\n  Wouldn't it be better to improve the situation dramatically by \npassage of this bill notwithstanding that it may not deal with an area \nthat is as contentious as CRA? I suggest to you that if we had a great \nand strong bill, a platform by which we could see that our financial \nservices could operate without having to go to the regulator, to the \nnameless, faceless regulator day in and day out to get various \nexemptions that may favor one over another, that is not in the interest \nof this country.\n  The piecemeal legislation, day in and day out, how do we better \nourselves by that? What kind of an example do we set for the rest of \nthe world when we say we can't even agree on a fundamental operation? \nBecause we want perfection? Because we want to cure that deficiency \nthat is there, that some have been evil in using and may be, in quoting \nthe words of some of my friends, using to extort? I do not condone \nthat, but you are not going to cure it here. And what we will be doing \nis killing an opportunity to make substantial progress. That is what we \nare doing. And you have to weight that up. Are you going to achieve \nsubstantial progress? And if you can make that cure, I will be with \nyou. But you can't. Understand it.\n  Now, if the managers of the bill said under no circumstances are we \ngoing to permit you to offer amendments, we want to go right to cloture \nto cut off your amendments and your right to offer amendments and your \nright to debate them and to let people hear what is taking place, then \nI could understand using every parliamentary procedure to stop this \nbill.\n  That is not the case. This Senator would be willing to say, and I \nknow because I have discussed it with the ranking member, Senator \nSarbanes, we\n\n[[Page S11439]]\n\nwould offer any reasonable time for Members of this body to offer \namendments dealing with the problems that may exist in CRA, dealing \nwith possible solutions, and having votes, whether they are up or down, \nwithout amendments, to see if we can't get a consensus. I don't believe \nyou can. And if you can't get your position today, at least to give the \npeople of the United States an opportunity to have a banking bill which \npeople understand clearly and not one that is manipulated day in and \nday out by the various needs and exigencies of the financial services \ncommunity so that they have to come pleading: ``Oh, well, will you let \nme sell insurance? Oh, well, will you let me do securities? Oh, well, \ncan I do it in the bank or outside the bank? Oh, well, is this legal or \nis that legal?''\n  While one group is receiving permission to do something, others are \nleft behind. That is not the way for this country to be operating. It \nis wrong, and it is, indeed, an abrogation of our responsibility--an \nabrogation.\n  I hope, even at this late hour, notwithstanding the deep feelings \nthat my colleagues have, related to the abuses that have taken place, \nthat they would say the greater picture is one of doing the most good \nfor the most people. That is what we are talking about.\n  This is an opportunity to do the most good--not for one industry over \nanother but for our great country, and to see to it that there is a law \nthat everyone sees clearly, where we reduce the necessity of having \nmajor financial institutions and parts of our industry being placed at \ncompetitive disadvantages because one gets a certain permission and \nanother is left behind and then quickly must move to deal with that. \nThat is not what competition in America can and should be about.\n  I have heard my colleagues raise this argument. I have been critical, \nyes, of the regulators for what I thought was absolutely going beyond \nwhat Congress had ever given to them. But the courts have said, and I \nthink they have done it on a practical basis, that if you, the \nCongress, do not stop them with legislation, or you do not pass \nlegislation that sets the ground rules, why, it is obvious that is the \nmanner in which the law should be administered.\n  I do not think that is responsible. I really do not believe our \nforefathers ever thought or intended for us to operate in this manner, \nunder these conditions. I certainly think that, looking at the world \neconomic situation today, this does not create stability, if we fail to \ncomplete this. I say ``fail to complete'' because there are those who \ncan run the clock out, run it out on our American citizens, because \nthat is who is going to be deprived. Yes, all of our citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I simply want to, first \nof all, commend the distinguished chairman of the committee for the \nvery effective work I think he has done in bringing this to this point. \nI think it is important to understand we have not reached the bill yet. \nWe are now actually postcloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. I \ndo not think it is clear at this point yet exactly how many of these \nprocedural hoops we will have to go through in order to finally get to \nthe substance of the bill and in order, in the end, to have a vote up \nor down on the bill. I hope the leadership could commit to staying with \nthis process as long as is necessary in order to reach that point, \nbecause I think there is overwhelming support for this legislation in \nthis body--overwhelming support.\n  I think the Financial Services Act of 1998, which has been brought \nout of the Senate Banking Committee, is a carefully balanced piece of \nlegislation. It would finally respond to an issue we have been \nwrestling with for years and years. I say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, we have been dealing with this issue for a very, very long \ntime, and finally we have brought it to the point where we have an \nopportunity, I think, to put into law important legislation for the \noperation of the financial services industry.\n  This legislation would permit banks to affiliate with securities \nfirms and insurance companies within a financial holding company \nstructure, regulated by the Federal Reserve. The Banking Committee held \nfour hearings in preparation for marking up this legislation after it \npassed the House. It passed the House by just one vote. We are \ninformed, and I believe reliably informed, that the vote in the House \non this legislation as is now being presented to the Senate would \nproduce a very substantial majority. In other words, well above, \nclearly well above the vote that it obtained in just managing to get \nthrough the House and coming over to the Senate. The changes we have \nmade have generally been met with favor on the other side of the \nCapitol.\n  We heard from the administration, the financial regulators, the \nvarious industry groups, public interest and consumer groups, and in \nthe end the bill was brought out of the Banking Committee on the 11th \nof September by a broad, bipartisan majority of 16 to 2. The \nlegislation, as I indicated, is balanced. It would expand the range of \npermissible financial activities for commercial banks while preserving \nthe safety and soundness of the financial system, providing adequate \nconsumer protections, and expanding access to the financial system for \nall Americans.\n  This bill has received unprecedented support across the entire range \nof the financial services industry. Just last Wednesday, the American \nBankers Association, the Independent Bankers Association, the American \nCouncil of Life Insurance, the Independent Insurance Agents of America, \nthe American Insurance Association, the Securities Industry \nAssociation, the Investment Company Institute and the Financial \nServices Council sent a joint letter to the two leaders--to Senators \nLott and Daschle--saying:\n\n       The Senate Banking Committee, through its actions on H.R. \n     10, the financial modernization bill, in its discussions with \n     a wide variety of parties including both Members of Congress \n     and representatives of the private sector, has now produced a \n     carefully negotiated product.\n\n  They indicated their very strong support for the package which we are \nbringing to the Senate. Last Friday, the American Community Bankers, \nwho represent the thrift industry, sent a letter to the two leaders \nexpressing support of H.R. 10, and stating:\n\n       ACB supports the bill as a generally constructive measure.\n\n  These letters obviously reflect a very broad consensus that has been \nput together around this bill. Obviously, it is my hope we will be able \nto move it through the Senate over the next few days and move it on \ntowards enactment into law. It is interesting to note, since I have \ncolleagues on the other side who are raising the CRA issue, that the \nindustry groups affected by the CRA issue are in favor of this bill. \nThe community groups, I have to tell you because I am very much aware \nof it, are opposed to this bill, because they think it is inadequate on \nCRA. You know, they are making that concern very clear.\n  So I say to my colleagues on the other side who come along and they \nsay, ``We are going to attack CRA,'' that the very people affected by \nit, the industry groups, say, ``We can live with this.'' The community \ngroups are very unhappy with it. So we have that situation here.\n  In addition, and I am going to talk later in more detail about the \nseparation between banking and commerce, which I think is an important \naspect of this bill and one that Paul Volcker wrote a very thoughtful \nop-ed piece about in the Washington Post, on September 10. Let me just \nquote that and then I will not develop that issue any further tonight:\n\n       A convincing argument can be made for combinations of \n     banking, securities and insurance companies--under \n     appropriate regulatory and supervisory safeguards. What \n     cannot be defended is reshaping the financial services \n     industry by ad hoc regulatory decisions, manipulating or \n     manufacturing loopholes in plain contravention of the intent \n     of the unchanged law.\n       The proposed legislation will maintain and strengthen \n     elements of financial regulation and oversight essential to \n     the overall stability of the system. Specifically, H.R. 10 \n     would reinforce the long-standing policy of the United States \n     against the combination of banking and ``commerce,'' broadly \n     defined.\n\n  As I indicated, I will come back to many other commentators who have \nstressed the importance of that aspect of this legislation, and I think \none of its major accomplishments is to draw that line and draw a clear \nline and avoid this sort of fudging that has been taking place in this \narea.\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\n  On the safety and soundness, let me say I think the regulatory \nstructure put in place by this legislation is important and would \npermit the formation of financial holding companies. These financial \nholding companies would be able to engage in any activity that is \ndetermined to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial \nactivities.\n  Thus, the holding company could include a commercial bank, securities \nfirm, mutual fund or insurance company. Each entity within the holding \ncompany would be regulated by its existing regulator. Thus, a \ncommercial bank would be regulated by its bank regulator, whether that \nis the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC or the Federal Reserve. \nThe securities firm and the mutual fund would be regulated by the SEC \nand by the appropriate State securities regulators, and the insurance \ncompany would be regulated by State insurance regulators, as is now the \ncase. So you have functional regulation of each entity within the new \nfinancial holding company.\n  In addition, the Federal Reserve would serve as the so-called \numbrella regulator of the financial holding company. The Federal \nReserve would have authority to set capital at the holding company \nlevel. It would have authority to conduct examinations and request \nreports from subsidiaries of the financial holding company if it \ndetermines they are necessary to assess a material risk to the bank \nholding company for its subsidiaries.\n  I think this balance is an effective approach to protecting the \nsafety and soundness of the financial system and most independent \nobservers, with respect to safety and soundness questions, agree with \nthat evaluation.\n  There are also important consumer protections contained in the \nlegislation with respect to the sale of uninsured financial products, \nand I am sure we will have a chance to develop those in some detail.\n  Where we find ourselves procedurally is the next vote, obviously, \nwill be on the actual motion to proceed to the bill. At that point, the \nbill would then be before us and open to amendment. I subscribe to the \nposition put forward by the chairman of the committee that Members \nought to have a chance to offer an amendment; we ought to have \nreasonable debate on them and then move to vote on them, one way or \nanother, and work through the legislation in that fashion.\n  It has been a long road to reach this point. I think it is important \nto try now to conclude deliberations on this important legislation in \nan orderly and rational fashion, and I think the approach the chairman \nhas outlined certainly accommodates that.\n  We hear stories or rumors that people are out to simply try to delay \nthis as long as they can in order to, in effect, sink the legislation. \nI very much hope that doesn't happen. An awful lot of work has gone \ninto bringing us to this point, as is reflected by the comments of the \nvarious parties who have been deeply interested and affected by this \nlegislation. I, frankly, think the Congress now has an opportunity to \nfinally come to grips with an issue--this issue is being dealt with on \nan ad hoc basis. No one thinks it should be done that way. No one. At \nleast I don't think anyone. I don't want to speak for all of my \ncolleagues, but that is true of all of the regulators, all of the \ncommentators. They say the way to deal with this is to do it \nstatutorily through enactment by the Congress. So we will just have to \nsee as we move ahead whether we can come to closure on this important \nissue. I very much hope it will be possible to do so. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating the chairman \nof our committee, Senator D'Amato. I have had an opportunity to serve \nboth in the House and in the Senate. I have worked with many great \nlegislators in that process. But I have to say that the job Senator \nD'Amato has done in putting this bill together, in bringing together \npeople with very different starting points to a unity among the variety \nof interests that are concerned about this bill, represents one of the \nmost outstanding and, I think, one of the most miraculous legislative \nachievements that I have seen in my service in the House and the \nSenate. I congratulate him. I congratulate Senator Sarbanes, the \nranking member, for his work.\n  Certainly our colleagues are right when they say that all the \ninterests are for this bill, but I think it is fair to say that Senator \nShelby and I are not here today to represent any particular interest or \neven the collection of all interests. We are here today representing \nwhat we believe is a fundamental principle. Where I come from, when \ninterest comes up against principle, then interest loses.\n  We have a fundamental issue before us. I believe that perhaps the \ngreatest national scandal in America is not the scandal that is being \ncovered every day at the White House. It is a scandal where a law is \nbeing used in such a way as to extract bribes and kickbacks and in such \na way as to mandate the transfer of literally hundreds of millions of \ndollars and to misallocate billions and tens of billions of dollars of \ncredit. I believe that this represents something that should be \nstopped.\n  Perhaps some word of explanation should be given. If the people who \nare being extorted, if the people who are being blackmailed are not \nobjecting, why are we objecting? My response to this is to point out \nthat when the mob was engaged in the protection racket, the little \nmerchant who was afraid generally did not object. But we don't \ngenerally accept that in America anymore because there have been police \nofficers and there have been prosecutors who did object on their \nbehalf.\n  Senator Shelby and I are here to object on behalf of bankers and \nsmall community banks that, in many cases, are afraid to object on \ntheir behalf.\n  I have related to the Senate on many occasions, and we are going to \nhave an opportunity to debate this at length, the abuses under the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act, or CRA. I want to make a couple of points \nrelated to it.\n  No. 1, the so-called Community Reinvestment Act and the provisions \ncontained in it was voted on only once in the Congress. It was voted on \nin 1977 in the Senate Banking Committee on a motion to strip the \nprovision from a proposed housing bill, and that motion failed on a tie \nvote, 7 to 7, in 1977, which means for half of the Members to vote to \nstrip the provision when the Republicans were in the minority, there \nhad to be a bipartisan vote.\n  So far as I have been able to find, that is the only vote that ever \noccurred on this provision of law.\n  The logic of this provision, which came from the former chairman of \nthe Banking Committee, Senator Proxmire, was to require banks to make \nloans in areas where they operated. The concern expressed at the time \nwas that banks weren't serving their communities, and, therefore, the \nGovernment took upon itself to impose on the banks the necessity of \nlending in their local community.\n  I am not going to debate tonight the wisdom or lack of wisdom of \nthat, but as I have pointed out on many occasions, what has happened is \nthat CRA has taken on a meaning that has nothing to do with lending.\n  It has now become common practice in CRA for professional protest \ngroups to protest a bank's ``community service record'' and, in turn, \nuse the leverage of those protests to extract bribes, kickbacks, set-\nasides in purchases and quotas in hiring and promotion, none of which \nhas anything to do with CRA and the lending practices of banks in the \ncommunities they serve.\n  All of this is made possible by the banking regulators in enforcing \nthis law, who respond to the protests by holding up action which banks \nwish to undertake and often are under immense pressure to undertake \nonce it has been announced. Professional groups here in Washington that \nyou can hire will go to your community and protest against the bank, \neven dump garbage on the property, make all kinds of statements, claims \nand demands and, in turn, extract resources for themselves and for \nothers. So strong is the growing resentment against this provision of \nthe law, that when proponents of the provision sought to put it in the \ncredit union bill, it was defeated on the floor of the Senate.\n  When consideration on this bill began in the Senate Banking \nCommittee, Senator Shelby and I, and others, offered an agreement which \nwas--this is\n\n[[Page S11441]]\n\na very contentious issue, so let us call a truce on it an leave it \nalone for now. I want to repeal this provision of law. I want to end \nthis scandal. I want to stop this extortion. Others want to expand it, \nexpand this provision of law.\n  Knowing that we would never be able to compromise on this issue \nwithin the very limited time that we had to enact this important \nfinancial services legislation, I sought to come up with a solution. \nAnd the solution was to treat it as slavery was treated by Abraham \nLincoln in his campaign in 1860. That was, where the evil existed, \nleave it alone, but do not expand it into new areas.\n  On that basis, if we had left CRA out of this bill, we could have \nmoved together, we could be at this moment united for this bill, and \nthis bill, in my opinion, would be on the way to becoming law. But that \nis not what has happened.\n  There has been great confusion about what is actually contained in \nthe bill. So I want to take a few minutes and go over what is in \ncurrent law and what this bill actually does.\n  In current law, there are really only two provisions related to CRA. \nFirst, bank regulators consider how a bank has been meeting the local \ncredit needs only when a bank applies to open a new bank, a branch or \nengage in a merger. Second, bank regulators may deny applications for \nthese activities based on the record of the bank in community lending. \nThat is the current law.\n  Based on this, all over the country banks that have exemplary records \nin community lending and that have received the highest ratings on CRA \nare routinely shaken down every time they want to open a branch, every \ntime they want to start a new bank, every time they want to engage in a \nmerger. They end up having to make cash payments, kickbacks, establish \nquotas in hiring, and many other things, because the regulator simply \nholds up approval of the action, even though the bank may have a \nperfect record on CRA.\n  In fact, we discussed on the floor the record of Bank of America. It \nwas brought up by proponents as an exemplary bank in CRA. I pointed out \nhow professional protest groups had said they were going to shut down \nthe bank in California when it sought to merge with NationsBank if it \ndid not make more concessions to them.\n  Those are the abuses under the current law. But look what is added by \nthis bill. When you listen to proponents of the bill, it is as if there \nare no CRA provisions of any significance in it. In fact, we just heard \nthat the so-called community groups, whoever they are, that they did \nnot get--what?--they did not get enough of what they wanted. I submit \nthey never get enough of what they want nor will they ever get it until \nwe redistribute wealth in America.\n  Here are the provisions that are added:\n  The first provision added, the third that would become a part of the \nlaw, is that officers and directors can be fined up to $1 million per \nday for CRA noncompliance--a totally new provision of law.\n  The new fourth provision that is proposed: Banks can be fined up to \n$1 million a day for CRA noncompliance.\n  The fifth provision: cease and desist authority for CRA \nnoncompliance.\n  Sixth provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restrictions on \nany banking activity for CRA noncompliance.\n  Seventh provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restriction on \nany insurance activity for CRA noncompliance.\n  Eighth provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restrictions on \nsecurities activities for CRA noncompliance.\n  Ninth provision: the Federal Reserve may place any restriction on any \nother activity of the holding company for CRA noncompliance.\n  Tenth provision: Any violation by any one bank in the holding company \ntriggers the penalties that I have listed above against the entire \ncompany.\n  The eleventh provision would place in law sanctions affecting \ninsurance sales.\n  The twelfth provision: CRA is applied to uninsured, wholesale \nfinancial institutions.\n  If we have the abuse that we have under current law with two simple \nprovisions that have no enforcement mechanism whatsoever against a \nbank, unless it is seeking to acquire a new bank, to merge, or to \nbranch, can you imagine what will occur when the officers of a bank can \nbe fined $1 million a day for noncompliance? Or can you imagine the \nperpetual shake down of a national, nationwide bank, with 1,000 \nbranches, when the entire company receive those penalties if one branch \nis found to be or accused to be out of compliance? So this is a very, \nvery big issue.\n  Here is where we are. We have rules in the Senate. And those rules \nwere designed to protect the rights of the minority. And basically, my \nposition, and Senator Shelby's position, is that the expansion of CRA \nby these provisions will greatly increase the opportunity for extortion \nand kickbacks and the imposition of coercive agreements, such as those \nwhereby companies in the past have agreed to give protest groups a \npercentage of their profits, have agreed to hire protesters as advisors \non dealing with these provisions of law--things that turn your stomach \nand that in any other area would call for prosecutors and would send \nthe police out to do something about it.\n  We are now condoning it by law with very weak enforcement provisions. \nIf we have a $1 million-a-day fine, we are going to have an explosion \nof these kinds of activities.\n  I have talked to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan and I \nhave talked to the Secretary of the Treasury about this whole problem \narea. And I have proposed yet another compromise. The easiest thing to \ndo would be to leave CRA out of the bill. But I have recognized that \nthe President has said that he would not support leaving it out. We \nhave colleagues who would not support leaving it out. So here is the \ncompromise that Senator Shelby and I want to propose as an alternative, \nas another option: Expand CRA to the new financial service holding \ncompanies so that the laws that apply now to other banking entities \nwill apply in the same way to the new banking entities. But also add \ntwo provisions of law to check abuses.\n\n  First, we want a simple, well-defined antiextortion, antikickback \nprovision that focuses CRA on lending and not on cash payments, or \nquotas, or set-asides, or giving protesters a percentage of your \nprofits for a certain number of years.\n  Second, if a bank is in compliance with CRA in its last examination, \nthen that compliance should mean something. It should remain in force \nuntil the next regularly scheduled exam. Then we could end the double-\njeopardy situation where the officers and directors are in a position \nwhere they can be extorted--even if they have a perfect CRA record--the \nmoment they apply to open a new bank, to merge, or to open a new \nbranch, even though they have an exemplary CRA record.\n  If we could do these three changes--expand CRA to address the \nrequests those who want to expand it, joined together with those two \nchecks against abuse, one on bribery and extortion, and the other on \neliminating double jeopardy--I believe we could have a bill.\n  Let me make this clear. Obviously, many people are for this bill. All \nthe interests are for this bill. But there is a strong principle at \nstake here, and I am not for this bill. Senator Shelby is not for this \nbill. We believe that using our rights under the rules of the Senate we \ncan probably stop this bill. We will, if we can, stop this bill unless \nsome accommodation is made on the effort to expand CRA. We will not let \nthis bill go forward with these massive expansions in CRA power.\n  We are in a position where one side is not willing to let the bill go \nforward with these massive expansions in CRA; the other side says they \nwill kill the bill if these expansive provisions are taken out. So that \nis where we are.\n  I want people to understand, if you are for this bill, don't waste \nyour time calling Senator Shelby and me. We will not be moved. If you \nare for this bill, call those who are for expansion of CRA and ask them \nwhat is wrong with a simple expansion of CRA and a simple amendment \ndealing with bribery and extortion and a simple provision establishing \nthat if a bank is in compliance, it is in compliance.\n  I urge those that are for this bill to let their views be known on \nthis issue. I understand some banks in this country are willing to go \non paying these\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\nbribes and keep quiet about it because there are other provisions of \nthe bill they want. This is a wrong that is bigger than dollars and \ncents, and it needs to be stopped. I remind my colleagues that the \nclock is running and will run out, and this bill will die unless an \naccommodation is made on this issue.\n  If you care about this bill, if you really believe that this bill is \nimportant--and I believe it is important, but I don't buy into the \nlogic that we are not going to pass the bill early in the next session \nif we don't pass it here this week, but some people believe we won't--\nwhat I am saying is for those who want the bill now, there is one thing \nyou have to do to get this bill. You will have to do something about \nthe expansive CRA provisions.\n  Finally, let me say even if you fix CRA, the clock is running out, \nand if you are going to fix it, you better do it fast. That, I think, \nis the essence of our message.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will take just a minute tonight. I \nassociate myself with Senator Gramm. We worked on this together in the \nBanking Committee and we will be working together on this for a long \ntime. I will take a minute to inform the Senate of my objections to \nH.R. 10.\n  I believe that members of the Senate have not had the proper time to \nstudy and debate this matter. Most do not even know what is in this \nbill. This is a very complicated bill. There are a lot of good things \nin it, but there are some things that Senator Gramm has raised and I \nwill raise as the debate goes along that we need to debate and we need \nto take out of this bill. I believe Senators are just being told \nbasically that this is a historical opportunity, you must pass H.R. 10.\n  Think about it tonight. We make history in this Chamber, the U.S. \nSenate, every day. If we pass H.R. 10 just because everyone on Wall \nStreet tells us to pass H.R. 10, this will, indeed, be a historical \nmoment. But I don't believe that is going to happen, not with a lot of \nthe provisions that are now in the bill.\n  If H.R. 10 is so great, why is everyone reluctant to debate the bill? \nHow come the members of the Senate Banking Committee were not permitted \nto read, study, or share the manager's amendment until the morning of \nthe markup? Is that the way a Committee is supposed to function? What \nis hidden in this bill?\n  I'll tell you one thing that is in this bill--so well hidden, not one \nof the bank trade associations--not the American Bankers Association, \nthe Independent Bankers Association of America, America's Community \nBankers, the Bankers Roundtable or even the Consumer Bankers \nAssociation knew the implications of the CRA expansion in this bill \nuntil Senator Gramm and I sent around a ``Dear Colleague'' about a week \nand a half ago. None of those associations realized that they were \nsubjecting member bank officers and directors to million-dollar-a-day \ncivil money penalties for CRA noncompliance.\n  Why didn't the associations realize this? These associations are \ncaught up in the rush to judgment. They have not given proper \nconsideration to this bill, and neither have we.\n  With less than a week to go in this Congress, H.R. 10 is being jammed \nthrough the Senate. The Senate is supposed to be the deliberative body.\n  There are many good things in H.R. 10, Mr. President, but there are \nalso many bad things in H.R. 10. Currently, community groups and even \nlabor unions use CRA to protest the merger of financial institutions. \nMost of the time, the merging institutions are forced to pay off the \nprotest groups just in order to consummate the merger. Make no mistake \nabout it, this is legalized extortion, one that the U.S. government is \naiding and abetting.\n  The financial institutions who support this bill are used to paying \noff consumer groups. Nationsbank and BankAmerica have committed $350 \nbillion to CRA in order to merge. Citibank and Travelers Group have \ncommitted over $100 billion to CRA in order to merge. These large \ninstitutions are used to paying a toll every time they want to do \nbusiness.\n  That may be fine for Wall Street, but that is not fine for Main \nStreet. Not every financial institution around the country has $350 \nbillion to buy off consumer groups and labor unions.\n  Who do you think pays for this legalized extortion? I'll tell you \nwho: all the paying customers in this country. Everybody is complaining \nabout large institutions charging more and more fees at higher rates, \nATM fees, late fees and the like. It takes a lot of fees to pay for a \n$350 billion CRA commitment.\n  Senator Gramm and I have consistently stated our position since the \nBanking Committee first held a hearing on H.R. 10 several months ago. \nWe will not seek to repeal, reduce or eliminate the CRA as it stands in \nits current form. However, we will not agree to expanding either the \nscope or the enforcement authority of CRA in H.R. 10.\n  Now, some have insisted on expanding both the scope and enforcement \nauthority of CRA in H.R. 10. In this bill, some even delink CRA from \ndeposit insurance and subject bank affiliated wholesale financial \ninstitutions woofies to CRA. The interesting thing about this is the \nwoofies do not take deposits of less than $100,000 and are not insured \nby the Federal Government.\n  I guess, we could roll over like all the banks before us who have \npaid off the consumer groups. But, I for one, will not succumb to that \nkind of extortion, and I will fight this thing as long as it stays in \nthe bill. Government mandated credit allocation is wrong. Legalized \nextortion is wrong.\n  Last week, Senator Gramm said that this is a principled objection. It \nis. We will not be bought off by Wall Street. Wall Street does not have \nthe best interest of Americans in mind in this bill. The only thing \nthey understand is dollars and cents. The principle they understand is \nprofit. The interest of Wall Street is not always the interest of Main \nStreet.\n  Here is a message for Wall Street in terms I hope they can \nunderstand: If you really want to pass financial modernization, in \norder to consummate mergers and make money off of every American by \noffering a vast array of services, go to those that are insisting on \nexpanding CRA and ask them to work with Senator Gramm and myself in \nmaking H.R. 10 CRA neutral. Otherwise, I believe this bill will \nultimately fail. There may be some late nights and strong words, but I, \nfor one, am committed to ensuring this bill will not become law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our Nation's Social Security system, forged \nin a much simpler time and patched and plugged over the years to keep \nit relevant, has been a godsend for millions of Americans over the \nprogram's 63-year history. It doesn't provide a life of luxury, but \nSocial Security offers senior citizens a little bit of certainty during \nwhat is often a very tough time.\n  I have friends and family members who depend on that monthly check \nfrom Social Security, and I am grateful that it is there for them and \nwould never do anything to take it away. But that is not to say we \ncan't do something better, or we should not try to improve a system \nthat will not be able to provide that certainty for retirees in the \nfuture.\n  As a product of the 1930s, it is clear that the Social Security \nsystem is a system that was best suited for yesterday, not tomorrow. \nSocial Security's pay-as-you-go structure fails to meet the challenge \nof a sharp demographic change that is now underway in this country. \nWith fewer and fewer workers supporting each retiree, the program is \nsoon to go broke, or it will be too costly for our children and \ngrandchildren to support, thus creating financial hardship for millions \nof baby boomers and leaving nothing for future generations. In the \nmeantime, Social Security is shortchanging today's workers, denying \nthem the opportunity to expand their personal wealth and control their \nown financial destinies.\n  The coming Social Security crisis is real, and it will shatter our \neconomy and destroy the ability of our children to achieve the American \ndream. The question is, why? Because the only way to save the current \nsystem is to raise taxes by more than double, reduce benefits as much \nas one-third, while raising the age of eligibility to retire as high as \n70 years old. These solutions are unacceptable for the workers of the \nfuture. If you offered this to somebody, why would they want to pay \nmore, get less, and wait longer for retirement? To be honest with our \nfamilies, we have no choice but to pursue real reform of Social \nSecurity. Mr. President, the sooner we act, the easier and less costly \nour choices will be and the more secure our children's future will be.\n  With a strong sense of responsibility, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that I believe will offer the best solution to avoiding the \ncrisis ahead and preserving Social Security, while providing improved \nretirement security for every working American as we now approach the \n21st century.\n  Mr. President, during the past six decades, whenever a Social \nSecurity crisis would arise, Washington's approach was to tinker with \nthe system by either increasing the payroll tax or reducing benefits. \nWhen the tinkering was done, the politicians would slap themselves on \nthe back and claim that Social Security will be solvent for another 50 \nto 75 years. That has happened more than 50 times--always at the \nexpense of the American workers, who found themselves with higher taxes \nor lower benefits. But this is obviously the wrong approach. If it had \nworked before, we would not be where we are today.\n  Social Security, as you will remember, started off taking only one-\nhalf of 1 percent of your income. It is now at 13 percent. One-eighth \nof everything you make goes into a system that, right now, can't \npromise you that you are going to get the benefits that you expect.\n  Unlike any previous crisis, the magnitude of the current situation \nmakes a traditional bailout impossible. Again, under an optimistic \nscenario, it would require a payroll tax increase of at least 50 \npercent or a one-third cut in benefits just to keep Social Security \nfrom bankruptcy. Under a more realistic ``high-cost'' projection, \npaying promised Social Security benefits would require the current 12.4 \npercent payroll tax to be more than doubled to 26 percent. If you \ninclude the additional tax to save Medicare, the total payroll tax \nwould have to increase to an astonishing 46 percent, and even a tax \nhike that massive would be only a temporary fix. The total tax--income \nand payroll--could reach as high as nearly 80 percent for young \nAmericans who enter the workforce today.\n  Payroll tax hikes at this rate will heavily burden working Americans \nwho are already struggling to make ends meet. They will rob our \nchildren of their financial future, and demolish our economy.\n  Reducing benefits is not an acceptable solution. Low-income families \nare increasingly dependent on Social Security; in 1994, Social Security \nbenefits accounted for 92% of the total income received by elderly \nAmericans living alone, beneath the poverty line. A one-third benefit \nreduction will throw more elderly and disadvantaged Americans into \npoverty, and cast those already mired in poverty into further \ndesperation. Again, those benefit cuts could be much deeper under more \nrealistic scenarios.\n  We must abandon the traditional approach to fixing the Social \nSecurity system. We must expand our thinking--explore new opportunities \nto fundamentally change the way we think about Social Security--resolve \nthe problems once and for all and offer the American people nothing \nless than peace of mind when they retire.\n  The best solution to avoiding the imminent crisis is to move from \nSocial Security's pay-as-you-go system to a personalized retirement \nprogram that is fully funded and offers retirement security to every \nAmerican. This is not a new idea. Sixty years ago, during debate in \nthis chamber over creation of the Social Security system, Democratic \nSenator Bennett Clark proposed just such a plan. It passed the Congress \noverwhelmingly but was pulled out in conference with the promise it \nwould be done the next year.\n  Again, back in the 1930's, Democratic Senator Bennett proposed a plan \nfor personal accounts for retirement. It passed the Congress \noverwhelmingly but it was pulled out in conference again with the \npromise that it would be done the next year. That promise was never \nkept by the few who advocated a government-financed and run program. \nDuring each past crisis, similar proposals of personal retirement \naccounts have been discussed--yet never implemented.\n  Today, there are a number of plans that have been introduced by my \ncolleagues from both aisles, favoring diverting anywhere from 1 to 4 \npercent of the Social Security payroll tax to set up a system of \nmarket-based personal retirement accounts. My colleagues are to be \ncommended, Mr. President, and this is a move in the right direction.\n  However, if a market-based personal retirement system works so well, \nand is the right things to do as proven by countries like Britain, \nChile, Australia and others, we should take full advantage of it by \naccelerating the wealth building for retirement security and expediting \nthe transition from a PAYGO system to a fully funded system.\n  Mr. President, this is precisely the reason I am introducing my \nreform plan.\n  My legislation, the ``Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement \nAct,'' is based on six fundamental principles, principles that must \nguide Congress in any effort we undertake to ensure retirement \nsecurity. The primary principle is to protect current and future \nbeneficiaries, including disadvantaged and disabled adults or children, \nwho choose to stay within the traditional Social Security system. The \ngovernment must guarantee their benefits. There should be no change \nthat reduces their benefits, and no retirement age increase.\n  Let me say that again: a guarantee of no change in benefits or age of \nretirement for those who wish to stay within\n\n[[Page S11444]]\n\nthe traditional Social Security system. We must do no less.\n  I emphasize this principle not so much because we want to gain the \nsupport of seniors, nor to neutralize their opposition to Social \nSecurity reform, but because of the sacred covenant the federal \ngovernment has entered into with the American people to provide their \nretirement benefits. It's our contractual duty to honor that \ncommitment. It would be wrong to let current or future beneficiaries \nbear the burden of the government's failure to make the changes needed \nin a system that cannot handle the demographic changes that will begin \nto create huge cracks in our existing program.\n  The second principle my plan upholds is that Social Security reform \nmust give the American people freedom of choice in pursuing retirement \nsecurity. The purpose of Social Security is to provide a basic level of \nbenefits for everyone in case of misfortune. And so if social insurance \nis a safety net to catch those who fall, it does not make sense to \npenalize those who are quite able to stand on their own two feet.\n  The third principle is to preserve a safety net for disadvantaged \nAmericans, so no covered person is forced to live in poverty.\n  My fourth principle is that reform should make every American better \noff, and certainly no worse off, in their retirement than they are \nunder the current system. It should enable workers to build personal \nretirement savings, improve the rate of return on their savings, \nincrease capital ownership, and pass on their savings, as part of their \nestate, to their children.\n  The fifth principle is to replace the current pay-as-you-go financing \nscheme, in which today's workers support today's retirees, with a fully \nfunded program.\n  In other words, one generation will pay for its own retirement and \nnot rely on the second and third generation to pay for it. Social \nSecurity's pay-as-you-go feature is the program's fundamental flaw \nbecause it leaves the system vulnerable to changing demographics, thus \ncreating enormous financial burdens for our children and grandchildren. \nMoving to a fully funded system will not only reduce inequality among \ngenerations, it will greatly increase our nation's savings and \ninvestment rates, and therefore prosperity.\n  The sixth principle is that any reform of the current system must not \nincrease the tax burden of the American people. The taxpayers are \nalready giving up an historic 40 percent in federal, state, and local \ntaxes out of every paycheck they earn. Hiking taxes yet again in the \nname of fixing Social Security would be unfair and unjust to working \nAmericans, and would only pave the way for additional, future tax \nincreases.\n  Mr. President, with the above-mentioned principles as its foundation, \nthe plan I bring before the Senate today is designed to achieve the \ngoal of providing better and improved retirement benefits for all \nAmericans. The proposal I will outline here is carefully designed to \nproduce a highly appealing retirement option by maximizing the freedom \nand prosperity of working people. I have consulted seniors, farmers, \nsmall business owners, as well as large employers. I have made a number \nof revisions in accordance with their views.\n  Now, Mr. President, allow me to present the highlights of the plan \nand explain how it works.\n  The first component of the ``Personal Security and Wealth in \nRetirement Act'' upholds our primary principle by allowing people to \nremain in the current Social Security program if they so choose. In \nfact, my plan clearly stipulates that it is the right of workers to do \nso, and that they will be protected. The government will guarantee the \npromised benefits for those who elect to stay within the traditional \nsystem.\n  Many of the existing reform proposals include components to increase \nthe retirement age to anywhere from 67 to 70, and/or mandate a \nreduction in promised benefits. The polls show that 75 percent of the \nAmerican people oppose the age increase. That is hardly a surprise; the \nAmerican people already work too hard. It is not fair to raise the \nretirement age and force them to extend their work careers. You cannot \npromise one thing and then do another.\n  Nor is it right to reduce their benefits. Such an irresponsible \napproach would serve only to throw more elderly Americans who \nincreasingly depend on Social Security into poverty, and increase the \nhardship dramatically on those who are already suffering under poverty.\n  That is why my plan explicitly protects those who choose to stay \nwithin the current system against an age increase or benefit reduction \nof any kind--again, those who choose to stay within the current system \nare explicitly protected.\n  The key provision of my plan is to allow workers to set up a market-\nbased, fully personalized retirement account, or PRA. Currently, \nworkers and their employers pay a 12.4 percent FICA tax into the Old-\nAge/Survivor and Disability Insurance Trust Funds. Under my plan, we \nwill allow workers to divert 10 percent out of their 12.4 percent FICA \ntax, within the covered earnings, into their PRAs and use the remaining \n2.4 percent to finance transition costs. The responsibility for payment \nof taxes will be equally divided between employers and employees.\n  When the transition is complete, the 2.4 percent will be eliminated \nas tax relief, because under a market-based retirement system, a \nsavings investment of 10 percent will itself provide a generous \nretirement.\n  In fact, with the 2.4 percent tax cut, workers would be paying 20 \npercent less into the fully funded system and they could still expect \nat least twice as much in benefits as they receive under Social \nSecurity. So our plan would actually cost less and it would provide \nmore--much different from the current system.\n  Under this plan, workers would enjoy maximum freedom to control their \nfunds and the resources for their own retirement security. Workers \nwould have at least the freedom to design their own retirement plan, \ninvesting in stocks, equities, bonds, T-bills, or any combination of \nthese or other approved financial instruments with approved investment \nfirms and financial institutions. A worker could even have their funds \nplaced in a traditional savings account, if they would choose.\n  There is no doubt that a market-based retirement system will generate \nmuch better returns than the traditional Social Security system we have \ntoday. Government data show that almost all workers in two-earner \nfamilies receive real returns from their Social Security of \napproximately only 1 percent--a 1-percent or less return on their \ninvestments, with some actually receiving even negative returns. The \nreturn reaches 2 percent only for a family with two low-income working \nspouses. And these returns under Social Security will only diminish \nfurther in the future with benefit reductions and the raises in \nretirement age.\n  Compare that to the performance of the market where, over the 70-year \nperiod from 1926 to 1996, the average annual nominal return was 10.89 \npercent. And if you adjust that for inflation, that is still an average \nannual rate of return of 7.56 percent. So in over 70 years of the \nmarket there has been an average annual return of 7.56 percent. You \ncouple that with Social Security now promising 1 percent or less in \nreturns. It is much sounder, much better benefits for those under the \nnew PRA system.\n  PRAs will put the power of compound interest to work in providing \nbenefits for everyone, and under my plan the average annual benefits \nfor two average-income, full-time working spouses could reach over \n$200,000. Compare that to $33,000 under today's Social Security. For \none spouse earning an average income, the benefit could be $140,000. \nMeanwhile, you provide under Social Security only about $29,000. Low-\nincome families also do better under my plan. The current Social \nSecurity program would provide $18,000 in annual benefits, but under \nthis legislation their benefits could reach as high as $100,000.\n  Now, this isn't a fantasy; it can be achieved, and the proof can be \nfound right here in America. Consider the employees of Galveston \nCounty, TX. They opted out of Social Security back in 1981 to set up a \nprivate retirement plan, an option on which the Federal Government long \nago has shut the door. And here is what they have been able to achieve \nin Galveston County. Under Social Security, the death benefit is only \n$253, while under the Galveston plan the average death benefit\n\n[[Page S11445]]\n\nis $75,000, and the maximum benefit can reach $150,000. What a \ndifference --$253 under Social Security and up to $150,000 in Galveston \nCounty, TX.\n  The disability benefit from Social Security is $1,280 per month, but \nin Galveston County, TX, for its employees, disability benefits are \n$2,749--more than double the disability benefits for their employees in \nGalveston County, TX, than under Social Security.\n  The maximum Social Security retirement benefit is $1,280 per month, \nbut in Galveston County the average monthly retirement benefit for its \nemployees is $4,790 a month--four times, nearly four times greater \nunder the personal retirement plan than under Social Security--$1,280 \nper month under Social Security, and Galveston County, with their \npersonal retirement accounts, $4,790 a month.\n  To their great credit, some in Washington have recognized the power \nof the markets. Their solution, however, has been to suggest we let the \nFederal Government invest the Social Security trust funds for the \nAmerican people, or at least allow the Federal Government to invest a \nportion of it.\n  While appreciating the distance that my colleagues have come in \nreaching this point, I strongly believe that Government investment of \nthe Social Security funds is dangerous and that it could seriously \ndisrupt a market that is performing so well. Even Federal Reserve \nChairman Greenspan agrees that this is an unworkable idea, and in a \nrecent hearing of the Senate Banking Committee he said:\n\n       No, I think it's very dangerous. . . I don't know of any \n     way that you can essentially insulate Government decision \n     makers from having access to what will amount to very large \n     investments in American private industry.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from \n     the political process. They go a long way to try to do that. \n     I have been around long enough to realize that that is just \n     not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line that \n     breach will be broken.\n\n  That was Chairman Greenspan.\n  Studies reveal that the current Social Security system discriminates \nagainst divorced women. If a woman gets married, stays home to care for \nher children, and divorces in less than 10 years, she doesn't get any \nbenefits from Social Security. As a result, women in general receive \nlower benefits than men do. Poverty rates are twice as high among \nelderly women as among elderly men--13.6 percent versus 6.2 percent. \nImagine supporting a retirement system that puts many of our parents \ninto poverty--not security but into poverty.\n  My plan recognizes the need to have some form of protection built \ninto the system to protect nonworking spouses as well, usually women, \nand especially in the event of divorce, and we propose to allow couples \nto treat the worker's retirement account as community property so \ndivorced women would be able to share in the retirement benefits. \nResearch shows that a 10-percent savings contribution rate would \nbenefit women more than a partly personalized two-tiered system. And \nthat is true even for poor women who move in and out of the job market.\n  Critics of a personalized fully funded retirement system often cite \nSocial Security's survivor and disability benefits as a key reason to \ndefend the status quo, but, of course, they often omit the many \nrestrictions that go along with these benefits as well. The fully \nfunded retirement system I am outlining could provide better disability \nbenefits than the current Social Security system offers, and again I \nwill refer back to Galveston County, TX, as a great example. Under my \nplan, for example, when a worker dies, his family would inherit all of \nthe funds accumulated in his PRA. The savings would not disappear into \nthe black hole of the Social Security trust fund.\n  The system would also provide, in addition to the retirement savings, \na survivors benefit package. So imagine, Mr. President, right now--and \nI use my father as an example. When he died at the age of 61, there \nwere no benefits at all from Social Security. So for the whole time \nthat he paid into the system, he got $253 as a death benefit. But under \nour plan, all the money that he had accumulated in his personal \nretirement account would become a part of his estate tax free and go to \nhis heirs--not to the Government but to the family. His heirs would \nbenefit from his investment into his retirement account. Also, the \nsystem, as I said, would also provide, in addition to the retirement \nsavings, a survivors benefit package.\n  Let me share a personal note here to prove that point. Under my \nlegislation, retirement dollars stay right where they belong, and that \nis with the family that faithfully collected them, not with the \nGovernment. The Social Security disability insurance trust fund is most \nimperiled. Currently, workers pay 1.7 percent of their FICA tax for \ndisability insurance. But the DI trust fund will be exhausted in the \nyear 2019. GAO believes the program now to be outdated and that it \ndoesn't reflect today's realities. So my plan requires that fund that \nmanages the PRAs to use part of their annual contribution or yield to \nbuy both life and disability insurance, supplementing their accumulated \nfunds to at least match the promised Social Security survivors and \ndisability benefits.\n  By requiring retirement funds to purchase life and disability \ninsurance for workers, all workers in each individual fund would be \ntreated as a common pool for underwriting purposes and the insurance \nwould be purchased as a group policy; not by individual workers, but by \nthe investment firms or financial institutions, thus avoiding insurance \npolicy underwriting discrimination while providing the largest amount \nof benefits at the lowest possible costs.\n  Mr. President, another special feature in this plan is to allow PRAs \nto be established early on in life, before a child is even out of \ndiapers. The idea is that when a child is born and given a Social \nSecurity number, his or her parents, even grandparents, should be able \nto put money into that child's retirement account and to allow compound \ninterest to work. Mr. President, $1,000 deposited for a newborn could \ngrow to nearly $200,000 by the time that child retires. That would not \nbe a bad start. So, if you put $1,000 into his account when the child \nis born, by the time he or she would retire, that would add an \nadditional $200,000 to that account. Not a bad start, and again it \nshows the power of compound interest.\n  In fact, when Albert Einstein was once asked what is the most \npowerful force on Earth, he answered without delay; he said, ``compound \ninterest.''\n  To supply maximum flexibility and allow workers to tailor their \ninsurance and retirement package according to their needs and financial \nability, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act allows \nworkers to invest up to 20 percent of after-tax income to make \nadditional voluntary contributions to their PRAs. So those who want to \nlook ahead and even maybe plan for an early retirement, they can put \neven more money away, up to 20 percent of their income. That way, funds \nwill be accumulated faster, making early retirement possible. And, \nsince this would be an after-tax contribution within the current income \nlimit, it would not provide a tax shelter for the rich. I do not know \nabout you, but I am hard-pressed to think of a better way to encourage \nsavings, to allow workers to better control their retirement finances.\n  One of the key components and most important parts of my plan is to \nensure that a safety net will be there at all times for disadvantaged \nand unfortunate individuals. This can be done without any Government \nguarantees of investments or overly strict regulation of investment \noptions. Under this legislation, a safety net would be set up and would \nbe involved with a guaranteed minimum level: 150 percent of the poverty \nlevel. When a worker retires, if his or her PRA fails to provide the \nminimum retirement benefits, and for whatever reason, the Government \nthen would make up the difference. It would fill the glass to the top. \nThe same applies to survivor and disability benefits. If a worker dies \nor becomes disabled and his or her PRA doesn't accumulate sufficient \nfunds in order to provide the minimum survivor and disability benefits, \nthe Government would match those shortfalls.\n  The simple safety net is necessary, and the minimum benefit would \nguarantee that no one, no one in our society would be left impoverished \nin retirement while still allowing workers to enjoy the freedom and \nprosperity achievable under a marketed-based retirement system.\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\n  Some of my colleagues may be concerned about the Government financing \nthis type of subsidy. Since the likely performance of the personalized \nretirement system would be far better than today's, Government spending \nfor this minimum benefit is likely to be quite modest. In fact, the \nreform overall would probably allow us to reduce Government income \nassistance spending by far more than we would spend subsidizing the \nminimum benefit.\n  Let me say that again. If this would work out and allow the \nGovernment to help subsidize the minimum benefit, to make sure no one \nretires into poverty--in fact retirement benefits would be 150 percent \nof poverty--that would reduce Government income assistance spending by \nfar more than we would spend to subsidize the minimum benefit. Because \nworkers would retire with far higher benefits through the personalized \nretirement system, they would need less Government assistance than they \nneed today. So, again, there would be savings in the system that would \nhelp to pay for this subsidy.\n  Unlike all other existing proposals, workers under my legislation \ncould retire at any time. So, again, unlike all the other existing \nplans that are out there, workers under my proposal could retire any \ntime they choose and withdraw funds from their PRAs as long as the \nminimum retirement benefit could be guaranteed by the account. So what \nwe are doing is giving control of not only the fund, but also the \nfuture plans of the retired individual. When he wants to retire, rather \nthan the Government saying you have to retire at 65, under my plan you \ncould retire at 55 if you had the money set aside to meet those minimum \nbenefits. Or if you wanted to continue working, you could stop paying \ninto the account and you could work until you are 75 and invest in \nother avenues or other financial instruments.\n  Once workers reach the minimum retirement benefit level they can \ncontinue to contribute to the PRAs, but they would not be required to \ndo so. They could then choose to retire, continue working and invest \nthat portion of income in other accounts, or they could just plain \nchoose to spend their money as they wanted to. The rationale for this \nis simple. When workers accumulate enough funds for their retirement, \nthey are no longer in danger of becoming a burden on society and they \nshould therefore be allowed to retire at any age they choose without \nthe Government telling them when.\n  Why should the Government tell you when you can retire or penalize \nthose who choose to continue working or retire even earlier? Over time, \nearly retirements will surely reduce the ratio of workers per \nbeneficiaries. But because this is a fully funded system, demographic \nchanges will have no effect--they will have no effect--on the solvency \nof the system. A generation would pay for its own retirement. It will \nnot be held hostage to the next generation. And the word \n``independence'' fits right here.\n  Under this plan, workers could use the accumulated funds upon \nretirement to buy an annuity paying promised benefits for the rest of \nthe worker's life. Annuities would be structured to provide benefits \nnot just over the worker's life, but also over the life of their \nspouse. Unlike today, widows would not have to live in poverty. The \nbenefits would not be reduced when one or the other would die. Or the \nworkers could make regular, periodic withdrawals or a lump sum \nwithdrawal of the money not needed to buy the annuity to provide the \nminimum benefits.\n  The bottom line is that these withdrawal options would allow workers \nto basically sit down, to design their own retirement income so they \nwill not be forced to buy an annuity when the market is temporarily \ndown upon their retirement. And what is more, all the withdrawals will \nbe tax free and smart retirement planning will help maximize the \nbenefits.\n  One of the major criticisms of a market-based personal retirement \naccount system is that it inherently is volatile, and again subject to \nthe whims of investors, exposing a worker's retirement income to \nunnecessary risks. My plan has specifically addressed this concern by \nrequiring the approved investment firms and financial institutions that \nwould be there to manage personal retirement accounts to have insurance \nagainst any investment loss. By approximating the role of the FDIC, we \nensure that every PRA would generate a minimum rate of return of at \nleast 2.5 percent to provide no less than the minimum retirement \nbenefits.\n  Regardless of the ups and downs of the markets, workers would still \ndo better under this system than under the current Social Security \nsystem. So even under the minimum benefit of 2.5 percent minimum, that \nis still better than the current system of Social Security today paying \n1 percent or even less. This is another safety net built into the plan \nto give the American people peace of mind when it comes to their \nretirement investment. Further, to reduce risks to a worker's PRA, my \nlegislation also requires that rules, regulations and restrictions \nsimilar to those governing IRA's would apply to personal retirement \naccounts as well. PRA's must be properly structured and they must \nfollow strict, sensible guidelines set forth by the independent Federal \nboard that will be set up to oversee the system.\n  To choose qualified investment firms and financial institutions that \nwill be there to manage the PRAs, the oversight board would be \nresponsible for examining the credibility and ability of the companies \nand approve them as PRA managers accordingly.\n\n  As workers choose the new worker retirement system, this legislation \nrequires the Government to issue also what we call recognition bonds. \nThat is, to help compensate them for past taxes that they have already \npaid into Social Security so that you would not lose any money that you \nhave already paid into the existing Social Security system. The bonds \nwould be credited with real interest for workers over the age of 50. \nThe bonds for workers below 50 and above 30 would be credited with an \ninflation adjustment. So since younger workers would benefit most from \nthe reform, workers under the age of 30 would not get recognition \nbonds.\n  Another important element of the plan is to ensure that a worker's \nPRA remains his or her private property, and also that the holder has \nthe right, as I have said before, to pass it on. So it becomes part of \nthe estate for their family or heirs, not for the Government. When he \nor she dies, the remaining funds would be transferred to any person or \npersons designated by the holder. Their heirs would not pay any estate \ntax on the inheritance as well.\n  So, Mr. President, a major legitimate concern about PRAs is the \ntransition cost. Obviously, this is the most difficult part of every \nPRA plan. Every PRA plan has had to struggle with this. Social \nSecurity, however, has accumulated to date over $20 trillion in \nunfunded liabilities. So, in other words, we have made promises--\nCongress, the Government--has made promises to Americans saying we are \ngoing to pay X amount of benefits to retirees. If you put that into \ndollars--we have underfunded; we have made promises but with no money \nto back it up yet--$20 trillion in unfunded liabilities.\n  The transition from the current system to a personal and fully funded \nretirement system will also be costly. However, my point is we should \nnot focus too much on this issue at the expense of resolving the coming \nSocial Security crisis because if we do not make the tough choices, the \ntrust fund is going to go broke.\n  So we have $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities. The estimates are, \nto transition to a personal retirement account system would take maybe \nabout $13 trillion.\n  We believe it is going to be a less costly, more secure future and \nproviding better benefits if we step up to the plate and make the \ndecisions we need to make. No matter how much we pay for the \ntransition, it is still much cheaper to finance the transition than it \nis to watch Social Security go broke, because once our plan is fully \nsolvent, Social Security will still be facing some of the biggest \nproblems or even greater problems in funding.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, we should also be sensible about the \ntransition costs. We shouldn't increase the overall tax burden or incur \nhuge debt to finance the transition. Again, we shouldn't be out there \nincreasing the overall tax burden. We shouldn't be out there building a \nhuge debt to finance this transition. And since the unfunded liability \nis enormous, we need to find some innovative ways to help pay for them, \nnot through tax hikes, not to\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\nburden Americans with more taxes, but to find innovative ways to help \nmake the transition.\n  As you know, when a family faces financial trouble, every member of \nthe family pitches in. It first cuts its spending, it won't go to the \nmovies, or it might not eat out as often as it has and will delay \npurchasing big household items. The Government needs to take the same \ntype of approach. A family, when it is facing a financial crisis, needs \nto pitch in and make financial sacrifices to make it through. The \nGovernment has to do the same thing.\n  My plan proposes to help cut Government spending to help finance the \ntransition. We require capping mandatory Government spending by \nallowing only new spending for new beneficiaries who meet the same \ncriteria for benefits under the law. This would prohibit the expansion \nof these programs during the transition, but it would still cover those \nentitled to the current benefits.\n  In addition, we propose a 5-percent across-the-board budget cut for \nevery Federal agency, plus a 15-percent reduction in Government \noverhead.\n  Mr. President, in the long run, my plan will balance itself because \nas workers opt for the personalized retirement system, they will \nreceive fewer benefits from the old Social Security system as a result. \nAgain, remember the statement made by the President and many others, \nand that statement is: Save Social Security first. That takes money, \nnot just good intentions; not slogans, but actual action.\n  Since the plan is designed to spread its transition costs across \ngenerations, the system will start off relatively slowly. It will grow \nover time and, therefore, offer other financial mechanisms that will be \nneeded, particularly during the start-off period.\n  One of these mechanisms is to ask workers who opt out of the Social \nSecurity system to continue to pay, as I said before, the 2.4 percent \nof their FICA tax to help with the transition. Right now, we pay 12.4 \npercent of income into Social Security. Under this plan, 2.4 percent \nwould go to transition costs. The other 10 percent would go into the \nindividual retirement fund.\n  The plan also proposes using the majority of the general revenue \nbudget surplus, again with the notion, ``Save Social Security first.'' \nIf there is a surplus, the majority of our budget surplus should go to \nhelping reduce the transition costs of Social Security.\n  To cover a portion of the transition deficit, we would sell the $700 \nbillion in Government bonds that have accumulated in the Social \nSecurity trust fund. If we still fall short in financing the gap, my \nplan calls for issuing new Government bonds to the public in order to \nhelp raise money. This would be done over a period of time, and, again, \nthis stretches the financing of the transition over generations, not \none generation having to pay for the mistakes the system has made, but \nmany generations will have to help cover the costs.\n  These bonds would not involve new Government debt. This is \nimportant--no new debt. We are not talking about issuing new bonds to \ncreate new debt but to, in other words, put into focus the $20 trillion \nin unfunded liability. What we are doing is saying we are now going to \nrecognize that and put into place bonds that are going to help cover \nthis. Again, this is not new debt but only explicit recognition of the \nimplicit debt that the Government already owes through the unfunded \nliabilities of Social Security.\n  These are the promises that we have already made, and they need to be \npaid for. It is the cost of hanging on to this system too long, and it \nwill cost even more if we wait.\n  Mr. President, the advocates of the status quo are using the recent \nstock market adjustment in an attempt to scare the American people away \nfrom a market-based retirement system. In my view, it is highly \nimproper to use market cycles as the reason to deny exploring a viable \nsolution to the coming Social Security crisis.\n  Historical data recognizes market cycles, and the long-term prospects \nfor the stock market have always been bullish. William Shipman, one of \nthe country's leading pension management experts, has studied the worst \nperformances of the market. He finds that in the past 70 years--and \nthis includes the period of the Great Depression--on only 10 occasions \nhave stocks fallen by 18 percent in 1 quarter or 14 percent in 1 month \nor 8 percent in 1 day. Even if the market would drop 89 percent on the \nday that a worker entered retirement, that worker would still have more \nin their retirement account than they would have available under Social \nSecurity.\n\n  If you look at the numbers, Mr. President, again, even if the market \nwould happen to drop 89 percent of its value in just 1 day, and it \nhappened to be on the day the worker retired, the worker would still \nhave more in their retirement account than they would have available \nunder Social Security. That would be a worst-case scenario.\n  We know that better planning and looking ahead would mean the worker \nwould lose very little, if any, no matter how the market cycle would go \nwith good financial planning. So the scare tactics that many are using \nare just that, scare tactics in order to help support their current \nSocial Security system. We need to give the American people the \ninformation they need so they can make a very educated choice. We don't \nneed scare tactics from either side. We need just to lay out the \ninformation, show them the truth, and then allow Americans to help us \nmake this change.\n  Let me repeat, even if the market dropped 89 percent on the day a \nworker entered retirement, that worker would still have more in their \nretirement account than they would have available under Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. President, there are also many safeguards in this plan that a \nworker would not have to draw retirement money on that day, that there \ncould be moneys taken out so he could wait a while or also do many \nthings leading up to his retirement so he wouldn't have to worry what \nwas going to happen on that last day. There are many choices and \noptions to maximize retirement benefits, but many are going to use any \nfluctuations in the market to try to scare people. Again, we need to \njust give the American people the information they need to help them \nmake the choice.\n  As you know, our entire economy is based on a capitalistic market. If \nthe market drops at this rate, even Social Security won't be immune \nfrom any downturn. We will have to borrow against future workers to pay \nany benefits. A market-based retirement plan is a long-term investment, \nnot short-term speculation, and that is a key distinction that I urge \nall my colleagues to acknowledge in considering this plan.\n  The market-based retirement plan is a long-term investment, not a \nshort-term speculation. When you are in it for 40 years, you can ride \nout those cycles, but, again, over the last 70 years the market has \npaid 7.56 percent in interest, not the 1 percent or less than we now \nsee in Social Security.\n  The entire debate over how to reform Social Security boils down to a \nfew simple questions: Do you trust the Government to provide retirement \nsecurity, or would you rather rely on yourself and would you rather \nhave more control over your own resources? Do you want the Government \nto be your financial adviser? Is it necessarily true that what is good \nfor Washington is good for you? I don't think so. To me and many \nAmericans, the choice is very clear.\n  In conclusion, I turn to the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt \non June 8, 1934, and that is the day he proposed to Congress the \nestablishment of the Federal Social Security system. He wrote this:\n\n       This seeking for a greater measure of welfare and happiness \n     does not indicate a change in values. It is rather a return \n     to values lost in the course of our economic development and \n     expansion.\n\n  Mr. President, 63 years later, after six decades of economic \ndevelopment and expansion that dwarf what the world had known in 1934, \nwe began to stray from the values that helped found this great \nNation. We have strayed from the words of President Franklin Roosevelt \nas he signed Social Security into law.\n\n  In 1998, Americans choose to turn, not to the Government to provide \nthat ``greater measure of welfare and happiness,'' but to the \nindividual, to ourselves; not to look to Washington, but to look to our \nfamilies. The Government cannot be there to provide the ``greater \nmeasure of welfare and happiness.''\n  Mr. President, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act \nacknowledges that to achieve the fullest\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\nmeasure of security and individual liberty, the individual must be free \nfrom the inherent constraints of Government. It restores those values \nfrom which we have drifted, and it offers every American the \nopportunity to achieve real personal wealth--not with the Government \ntelling you what you are going to get in retirement, not with the \nGovernment telling you you have to retire, not with the Government \ntelling you what benefits that you are going to get--but America will \nbe offered the opportunity to achieve real personal wealth and the \ndignity and the freedom and the security that it affords in retirement.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, when one pauses to ponder the implications \nof it all, 1998 has been a remarkable year in terms of there having \nbeen a sort of rebirth of (I still contend) America's great national \npastime--baseball.\n  And as an old (very) former sports writer, I have never pretended \nthat baseball has not always been my favorite sport. I like all of \nthem, I hasten to say, but baseball is, to this good day, Number One \nwith me.\n  So what, you may inquire, has made this year all that great? Let us \nbegin by recounting the drama of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, each of \nwhom broke the 37-year-old home run record of Roger Maris--and then \nkept on breaking their own records.\n  I had meant, Mr. President, to pay my respects long ago to 14 very \nspecial youngsters from Greenville, North Carolina, who made hearts \nbeat faster and faster as the team made their way to the national \nchampionship game of the Little League World Series.\n  Greenville is the hometown of a lot of good things and good people. \nEast Carolina University is there, including its splendid medical \nschool. It is a colorful city (56,000) which understands and practices \nthe free enterprise system. And you better believe that everybody in \nthe area around Greenville was proud of those 14 young Little Leaguers \nwho made it to the championship game.\n  The young guys from Greenville lost that championship game to the \nteam from Toms River, New Jersey, but they were winners big time just \nthe same because they did win the consolation game with the excellent \nCanadian team. Look at it this way, Mr. President--the Little League \nteam from Greenville ranks third in the world.\n  I have a hunch that they know that they are Number One in the hearts \nof all of us who watched them on television, night after night, \ncheering them on.\n  I should mention, by the way, that these comments were prompted by a \nfine young member of the Helms Senate Family, Josh Royster, who kept \ntrack of those fantastic youngsters from Greenville who made all of us \nproud.\n  Josh was impressed with the manner in which coaches and parents and \ncountless other folks sacrificed to support their team. They traveled \nacross the country for the better part of six weeks, rooting for the \nGreenville Fourteen. That's what morale and role modeling and love and \ngood citizenship are all about. And then when the 14 young guys arrived \nhome, Josh says that 2,000 people turned out to greet them and cheer \nthem on.\n  A long time ago, when I was a lot younger than the Little Leaguers of \n1998, Dad told me something that I have never forgotten: ``Son,'' he \nsaid, ``the Lord doesn't require you to win. He just expects you to \ntry.''\n  Those 14 young guys did try and I suspect they won a lot more than \nthey now realize. For one thing, there's a Senator up here who's hoping \nthat Greenville's Little Leaguers will be in the championship game \nagain next season. I am not alone in my feeling that those youngsters \nwill be glad they did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11448-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11448-S11449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE HONORABLE THOMAS J. HARRELSON'S JULY 1, 1998, ADDRESS TO NEW \n                                CITIZENS\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the past weekend in going through a \nfile folder, I ran across a letter somehow placed there inadvertently \nthis past July just before my surgery to replace my worn-out 1921-Model \nknees with new 1998-Models.\n  The letter was from a longtime friend, Jim Lofton, well-known in \nCongress for his years as a highly respected assistant to the \ndistinguished then-Congressman, Jim Broyhill, of North Carolina. (Jim \nsubsequently served North Carolina's Governor Jim Martin who also had \nbeen a Congressman from North Carolina).\n  Jim Lofton, now president of the North Carolina Association of \nFinancial Institutions, had written to share the text of an address by \nanother distinguished North Carolinian, Thomas J. Harrelson, who on \nJuly 1 had delivered an inspiring address to an audience of several \nhundred people, including 41 new U.S. citizens whose naturalization \noccurred at the ceremony in Southport at which Mr. Harrelson spoke. Mr. \nLofton decided, quite correctly, that I might want to share Tommy \nHarrelson's remarks at Southport by inserting the text into the \nCongressional Record.\n  Mr. President, with gratitude to Mr. Lofton and Mr. Harrelson, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of Mr. Harrelson's address be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              Address by the Honorable Thomas J. Harrelson\n\n       It is a great honor for me to participate in this ceremony \n     and share this moment with you, your family, and friends.\n       We are gathered here in this patriotic time in a setting \n     very appropriate to the occasion. This site on which we are \n     standing, Fort Johnston, was built between 1748 and 1754 and \n     was burned to the ground in 1776 by the Patriots who were \n     tired of royal rule. It was rebuilt around 1812 and figured \n     in other efforts to secure our freedom and independence. \n     After all, the Cape Fear river was the super highway of the \n     pre-colonial and colonial era, bringing some of the early \n     European settlers to our shores.\n       One can imagine the native Americans, who must have come \n     here often for the bounty of the river and the ocean, seeing \n     the strange vessels and the pale skinned passengers in \n     foreign dress. How exciting and fearsome it must have been to \n     them and to the early settlers to come to terms with learning \n     to live side by side without the benefit of a common language \n     or an understanding of each other's cultures.\n       Yet these early settlers were just the first of the \n     immigrants who made the United States the powerful yet \n     diverse country that it is. Just as this river and others \n     like it roll relentlessly to the ocean, so a reverse stream \n     of immigrants moved up these same rivers and streams to \n     populate the early eastern seaboard settlements, and finally \n     to take the expansion to our Pacific coast, and even to \n     Alaska and Hawaii.\n       In that early time in our history, water travel was the \n     quickest, and in some cases, the only mode of transportation; \n     the expansion of knowledge was just beginning to speed up, \n     and communications depended almost entirely on the same mode \n     of transportation. Now, people have exceptional mobility, the \n     body of knowledge is doubling at an\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\n     ever-increasingly rapid pace, and the internet, satellites \n     and television make communication both instantaneous and very \n     personal. But one thing has been constant over the years: \n     every immigrant group has brought new vitality and vigor to \n     our society.\n       We who are already citizens of the United States gather \n     during this time to attest our loyalty and patriotism. It is \n     also a time to reflect upon the suffering and sacrifice we \n     have faced to get this far. How brave the people were in 1776 \n     to rise up in defense of liberty and confront a powerful \n     empire. Five of the signers of the Declaration of \n     Independence were captured by the British and tortured as \n     traitors. Nine fought in the War for Independence and died \n     from their wounds or hardships they suffered. Two lost their \n     sons in the Continental Army. Another had sons captured and \n     at least a dozen of the fifty six had their homes pillaged \n     and burned.\n       I am sure we have with us men and women who have served in \n     our armed forces in defense of our liberty, or family members \n     who have lost loved ones in this cause. I am also sure that \n     some of those of you who will soon be our fellow citizens \n     have stories of personal sacrifice and hardship to arrive at \n     this point.\n       We later fought a civil war in which it was determined that \n     we would remain one nation and that all people, regardless of \n     race, would be free and have the rights and responsibilities \n     of citizenship. Earlier this year, a local historian \n     discovered that two of our black citizens had fought on the \n     side of the Union. How brave they must have been to take that \n     step!\n       There was bravery and courage on both sides of that sad \n     conflict. We were a divided society back then and remained \n     divided for generations, separated by fear and mistrust. It \n     speaks volumes about the positive changes in our attitudes \n     that the entire community of Southport joined recently to \n     celebrate these two unsung heroes.\n       If we fought a civil war in which we determined that all \n     who are Americans would be free, we have also fought a series \n     of wars both hot and cold, to defend our own liberty and \n     expand freedom to other peoples. We live in a marvelous age, \n     having seen the collapse of Soviet communism and the freeing \n     of millions of people from its cruel oppression. This \n     happened because we and our allies remained firm and strong \n     in our beliefs and stalwart in the defense of liberty. We as \n     Americans have an awesome responsibility to the world. We \n     have made great scarifies to ensure fairness and equality at \n     home to extend democratic ideals and freedoms to others \n     throughout the world.\n       The world will never be truly safe until all peoples have a \n     sense of fellowship and common interests. As the civil rights \n     leader, and U.S. Congressman, John Lewis, recently said, ``to \n     achieve the beloved community, we must teach not only \n     tolerance, but acceptance and love. We must recognize the \n     wonderful opportunity our nation's diversity presents. Every \n     culture in our society offers its own contributions of art, \n     industry and experience.''\n       This sentiment needs to be embraced at home and in our \n     dealings abroad. To be an American is to have responsibility \n     to the world and to our neighbor at home.\n       We who are here together, the citizens and the citizens to \n     be, have much in common. We are either the descendants of \n     immigrants or immigrants ourselves. We or our ancestors came \n     here to be free from hunger, free from fear, free from \n     oppression, or free from slavery or servitude. When our \n     framers of the Declaration of Independence put those words on \n     paper, they became part of our culture and were also written \n     in our hearts and souls.\n       Our system of government is important, but what really is \n     more important is the fact that liberty lies in the hearts of \n     men and women. As the great jurist, Learned Hand said in a \n     4th of July speech toward the end of World War II, ``When it \n     dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it; no \n     constitution, no law, no court can even do much to help it. \n     While it lies there, it needs no constitution, no law, no \n     court to save it. And what is this liberty which must lie in \n     the hearts of men and women? It is not the ruthless, the \n     unbridled will; it is not freedom to do as one likes. That is \n     the denial of liberty and leads straight to its overthrow. A \n     society in which men recognize no check upon their freedom \n     soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of \n     only a savage few--as we have learned to our sorrow.''\n       Mr. Justice Hank went on to describe his own faith in \n     liberty. ``The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not \n     too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the \n     spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and \n     women: the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their \n     interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of \n     liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth \n     unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of him who, \n     near two thousand years ago, taught mankind a lesson that it \n     has never learned, but has never quite forgotten--that \n     there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and \n     considered side by side with the greatest.''\n       Before I close, let me take the opportunity of passing on \n     some advice to our new citizens. In the past, the children of \n     immigrants were often ashamed of their heritage and \n     deliberately turned away from both their ancestral culture \n     and language. I will agree that it is important to embrace \n     and understand the culture of your new country and to be \n     fluent in English. However, with the growing importance of \n     international relations and the globalization of the economy, \n     your children should be encouraged to appreciate your culture \n     and learn your native tongue, and to use them as a \n     springboard to understand other cultures and learn still \n     other tongues.\n       It used to be that we were fairly isolated in the United \n     States. That is no longer the case. Some counsel to our \n     current citizens is in order too. We are seeing an increase \n     in immigration from all over the world. I predict that, \n     despite the fears of some, these new immigrants, much like \n     all who came before them, will contribute to an ever \n     improving quality of life in our country. And as United \n     States citizens, new and old, we should never be satisfied \n     until freedom--political, religious, and economic--is enjoyed \n     by all the people of the world.\n       In a few moments, we will join together, new citizens and \n     old, to recite our pledge of allegiance. In so doing, I hope \n     you will recall with me the words of another famous American, \n     who challenged our country to greatness and helped bring \n     about freedom for the peoples of Eastern Europe, former \n     President Ronald Reagan:\n       ``The poet called Miss Liberty's torch, `the lamp beside \n     the golden door.' Well, that was the entrance to America, and \n     it is. And now you know why we're here tonight. The \n     glistening hope of that lamp is still ours. Every promise, \n     every opportunity is still golden in this land. And through \n     that golden door our children can walk into tomorrow with the \n     knowledge that no one can be denied the promise that is \n     America. Her heart is full; her torch is still golden, her \n     future bright. She has arms big enough and strong enough to \n     support, for the strength in her arms is the strength of her \n     people. She will carry on unafraid, unashamed, and \n     unsurpassed.''\n  (On Friday, October 2, 1998, two statements were inadvertently \nomitted from the Morning Business section of the Record.

Mr. President, I take a moment to honor Dave Rose, an \nAlaskan who has dedicated his life to public service. This weekend the \nAmerican Diabetes Association (Alaska area) is honoring Dave for his \nleadership in raising funds to combat this disease. He will be the \nfirst recipient of the ``Golden Rose Award'' honoring his commitment in \nthe fight against diabetes.\n  Dave has diabetes, but he hasn't let the disease slow him down. Even \nwith impaired vision and regular dialysis treatments, he has been a \ntireless fund raiser, spokesman, and volunteer organizer. When Dave \nisn't working to help combat diabetes he lends his time to a whole host \nof causes including the Anchorage Concert Association Foundation, the \nAlaska Pacific University Foundation, the Alaska Federation of Natives \nSobriety Foundation, and the Alaska Community Foundation. Dave and his \nwife Fran also have their own foundation which distributes funds to \narts, health, and higher education programs.\n  Dave's leadership in Alaska goes beyond the philanthropic. After a \ndistinguished career in the Army, he spent many years on the Anchorage \nAssembly. He also shepherded Alaska's permanent fund from a fledgling \nportfolio to the multi-billion dollar account which stands as a rainy \nday fund for the time when Alaska's oil revenues decline dramatically.\n  Dave's optimism, his love of people, and his willingness to share his \ntalents for the betterment of others deserves our recognition. Alaska \nis a better place for Dave's dedication and commitment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article about Dave \nRose entitled ``Golden Attitude'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Anchorage Daily News, Sept. 29, 1998]\n\n                            Golden Attitude\n\n                           (By Susan Morgan)\n\n       All was quiet in Dave Rose's offices at Alaska Permanent \n     Capital Management Co. one morning last week, so he figured \n     the stock market was doing well.\n       ``I'd hear screaming'' if there was trouble, said Rose, the \n     company's chairman.\n       Rose, first director of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., \n     knows the signs. Since retiring in 1992--the fund grew to \n     $13.5 billion from $3.8 billion and earned more than $8 \n     billion in cash during the 10 years he was there--he's been \n     running his own money management company, now investing about \n     $1.5 billion dollars for Alaska clients.\n       As during his tenure with the Permanent Fund, business is \n     quietly successful.\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\n       ``We are always classified as dull and boring. We hit a lot \n     of singles (return rates),'' Rose explained. ``If we hit a \n     double, we're euphoric.''\n       This is a man who unabashedly loves his work. ``They pay me \n     to do this, which is fun.''\n       That appreciation for the good things in life has been made \n     sweeter by Rose's recent struggles to maintain his health. \n     While many of those with diabetes suffer eye, heart or kidney \n     problems, Rose--diagnosed 15 years ago--has been hit hard by \n     all three.\n       Now 61, he is dependent on daily shots of insulin, has no \n     vision in his left eye, underwent quadruple bypass heart \n     surgery this year and endures three hours of dialysis--losing \n     7 pounds of fluid each time--three times a week while he \n     awaits a kidney transplant.\n       Dialysis is an arduous process in which Rose's blood is \n     removed from his body via a needle in an artery, then \n     ``dewatered'' and cleaned of toxins--work normally done by \n     healthy kidneys. The blood is returned through another needle \n     inserted in a vein. Rose's arm shows a long line of scars \n     from the process.\n       ``I have nails in my workshop that are smaller than those \n     needles,'' he says.\n       But Rose, who calls himself ``basically an optimist,'' \n     hasn't taken to his sickbed. He's been known to dress up in \n     costumes for the amusement of others during dialysis and has \n     added to an already jampacked personal schedule.\n       In addition to owning several local businesses, running his \n     investment firm and serving as finance director for Gov. Tony \n     Knowles' current campaign, Rose has added the American \n     Diabetes Association to the already lengthy list of \n     charitable organizations to which he volunteers time and his \n     prodigious fund-raising energy.\n       Crediting a ``good Rolodex'' for his success, Rose has led \n     a small group of local bicyclists to national championships \n     in the Tour De Cure, a fund-raising event for the American \n     Diabetes Association. For three years in a row, until this \n     year, ``Rose's Riders'' raised more money than any other team \n     in the United States--more than $80,000 in four years.\n       Because of those efforts, the Alaska office of the \n     association has created the Golden Rose Award. In a ceremony \n     Saturday, Rose will be its first recipient.\n       ``We wish to honor Dave for his generosity, as well as his \n     commitment . . . to improve the lives of people with diabetes \n     and to find a cure,'' district manager Connie Weel wrote in a \n     press release.\n       Meanwhile, Rose looks for the best in his situation. With \n     just one arm to use during dialysis, he can't manage both a \n     book and the now-necessary magnifying glass, so he listens to \n     books on tape--especially his favorite ``trashy mysteries.''\n       He even gets a kick out of a conversation with his doctor \n     about whether he should get a Seeing Eye dog.\n       ``He said to get a Lab, If I do, because in Alaska, if \n     you're blind you can get a free hunting license.''\n       Rose urges Alaskans to get a test to show if they're among \n     the millions of Americans with undiagnosed diabetes--``You \n     can deal with it if you catch it early enough''--and \n     emphasizes the importance of becoming an organ donor.\n       Most important to him seems to be not letting diabetes \n     limit his life. He and his wife, Fran--they married in 1959 \n     and she's now ``my eyes and driver''--dote on their Maine \n     Coon Kitten, two grown sons and gardens.\n       ``I'm trying to live a normal life and fit everything in,'' \n     Rose says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11449-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to provide that no Federal income tax shall be \nimposed on amounts received by Holocaust victims; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               holocaust assets tax exclusion act of 1998\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Holocaust \nAssets Tax Exclusion Act of 1998.'' This act will make all income \nreceived by Holocaust\n\n[[Page S11451]]\n\nsurvivors or their heirs from any settlement or adjudication in their \nfavor, non-taxable. This legislation is now very much needed because \nsurvivors of the Holocaust who had assets withheld from them by Swiss \nbanks or others have finally received justice in the form of a \nsettlement between the banks and the survivors' attorneys in August \n1998. The settlement was for $1.25 billion for survivors worldwide. We \nmust remember, one-third of all Holocaust survivors live in the United \nStates. This is why this legislation is so needed.\n  In addition to these recipients, survivors who are needy, will be \nreceiving one-time payments from the Swiss Humanitarian Fund \nestablished by the Swiss government in 1997. In both cases, payments \nfrom the Swiss banks and other sources like this should be excluded \nfrom taxation because they are receiving back what was rightfully \ntheirs to begin with. The sum total of payments coming to the needy \nHolocaust survivors in the United States from this fund will be $31.4 \nmillion. It would be a travesty if the IRS were to decide that these \nfunds would be taxable.\n  Mr. President, it is necessary to understand that the survivors who \nsued the banks and settled in August 1998 did so because this was the \nonly avenue left open to them to seek justice. Deprived of their \nassets, or those of their families for over 50 years, survivors fought \nunsuccessfully until now to receive what rightfully belonged to them.\n  With the average age of Holocaust survivors at 80, there is little \ntime for debate over these payments which will ease life for the \nsurvivors in their final years. To tax them for the long overdue \nreceipt of assets would be wrong. This is why I am offering this \nlegislation. The survivors of man's greatest inhumanity to man deserve \njustice. After escaping death at the hands of the Nazis, they were \nagain victimized by the Swiss bankers. Now that they have received some \nmeasure of justice, let us not take their assets from them again.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support me in this legislation \nand urge its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2549\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2551, the \nMedicare anti-duplication bill. This important reform legislation is a \nnecessary step in improving the rights and choices that face New \nYorkers. This amendment will in fact correct the language of title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to correct an unintended consequence \nof the Federal Medicare anti-duplication law and permits disabled \npersons to take full advantage of the full range of choices in the \nhealth insurance market that are currently available for other New York \nState citizens. The very narrow legislative change I am proposing will \nallow several hundred chronically ill New York residents to choose from \na variety of health care plans which offer identical health care \ncoverage at lower prices.\n  In 1995, New York enacted a ``Point of Service'' law requiring all \nHMO's in the state to offer standardized health care benefits to any \nindividual who purchases coverage directly from the plan. However, some \nindividuals that the New York law was intended to help were unable to \npurchases this coverage.\n  The Federal Medicare anti-duplication statue prohibits insurers from \nselling coverage, other than Medicare supplement coverage, which \nduplicate benefits available under Medicare. In New York, individuals \nwho were receiving Medicare benefits due to disabilities, were \npermitted to elect continued coverage of private insurance which were \npurchased prior to enrolling in Medicare. Prior to 1996 these \nindividuals' choices were limited, and were essentially forced to \ncontinue their very expensive Commercial policies. After the ``Point of \nService'' law was enacted, there were numerous policies available which \nprovided identical benefits to the Empire policy, at more affordable \nprices.\n  Those disabled Medicare subscribers enrolled in the Empire policy, \nhowever, were prohibited from purchasing these other less expensive \npolicies as a result of the Federal anti-duplication law because the \ntime to elect to continue private coverage had expired. These Disabled \nindividuals numbering between 400-500, were left with essentially one \nchoice, continuing a very expensive commercial policy.\n  My anti-duplication amendment will ensure that the disabled New \nYorker enrolled in medicare is available to afford a managed care \nproduct, and that these purchases will not be considered a \n``duplicate'' of Medicare health benefits. My bill has been drafted \nspecifically to help those several hundred chronically sick individuals \nin New York, who, prior to 1996, did not have the choice to select one \nof the many policies which were subsequently required by State Law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11450-8", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11451-S11452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1286\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1286, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude from gross income certain \namounts received as scholarships by an individual under the National \nHealth Corps Scholarship Program.\n\n\n                                S. 1529\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the names of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 1529, a bill to enhance Federal enforcement \nof hate crimes, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1720\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1720, a bill to amend title \n17, United States Code, to reform the copyright law with respect to \nsatellite retransmissions of broadcast signals, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Kentucky \n(Mr. McConnell) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1868, a bill to express \nUnited States foreign policy with respect to, and to strengthen United \nStates advocacy on behalf of, individuals persecuted for their faith \nworldwide; to authorize United States actions in response to religious \npersecution worldwide; to establish an Ambassador at Large on \nInternational Religious Freedom within the Department of State, a \nCommission on International Religious Persecution, and a Special \nAdviser on International Religious Freedom within the National Security \nCouncil; and for other purposes. \n\n\n                                S. 2180\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Maine (Ms. \nSnowe) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2180, a bill to amend the \nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act \nof 1980 to clarify liability under that Act for certain recycling \ntransactions.\n\n\n                                S. 2196\n\n  At the request of Mr. Gorton, the name of the Senator from Virginia \n(Mr. Robb) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2196, a bill to amend the \nPublic Health Service Act to provide for establishment at the National \nHeart, Lung, and Blood Institute of a program regarding lifesaving \ninterventions for individuals who experience cardiac arrest, and for \nother purposes. \n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\n                                S. 2217\n\n  At the request of Mr. Frist, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n(Mr. Levin) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2217, a bill to provide for \ncontinuation of the Federal research investment in a fiscally \nsustainable way, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2233\n\n  At the request of Mr. Conrad, the name of the Senator from Kentucky \n(Mr. Ford) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2233, a bill to amend section \n29 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the placed in service \ndate for biomass and coal facilities.\n\n\n                                S. 2364\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the names of the Senator from Ohio (Mr. \nDeWine) and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 2364, a bill to reauthorize and make reforms to \nprograms authorized by the Public Works and Economic Development Act of \n1965.\n\n\n                                S. 2418\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the names of the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Boxer), and the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Moseley-\nBraun) were added as cosponsors of S. 2418, a bill to establish rural \nopportunity communities, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2507\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from California \n(Mrs. Feinstein) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2507, a bill to \nstimulate increased domestic cruise ship opportunities for the American \ncruising public by temporarily reducing barriers for entry into the \ndomestic cruise ship trade.\n\n\n                                S. 2520\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lautenberg, his name was added as a cosponsor \nof S. 2520, a bill to exclude from Federal taxation any portion of any \nreward paid to David R.

Res. 285\n\n       Whereas Gabon is a heavily forested and oil-rich country on \n     central Africa's west coast;\n       Whereas Gabon gained independence from France in 1960;\n       Whereas Gabon is scheduled to hold national elections in \n     December 1998 for the purpose of electing a President;\n       Whereas the Government of Gabon has been subject to single-\n     party rule for a significant period of its recent history and \n     only 1 person has held the office of the President since \n     1967;\n       Whereas the Freedom House Survey of World Freedom, 1997-\n     1998, determined that ``Gabon's citizens have never been able \n     to exercise their constitutional right to change their \n     government democratically'';\n       Whereas the International Foundation for Election Systems \n     (IFES) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) served as \n     observers during the organization of the 1993 Presidential \n     and legislative elections in Garbon and found widespread \n     electoral irregularities;\n       Whereas the Government of Gabon is a signatory to the \n     ``Paris Accords'' of 1994, approved by national referendum in \n     July 1995, which were to have provided for a State of law \n     guaranteeing basic individual freedoms and the organization \n     of free and fair elections under a new independent national \n     election commission;\n       Whereas the people of Gabon have demonstrated their support \n     for the democratic process through the formation of numerous \n     political parties since 1990 and their strong participation \n     in prior elections; and\n       Whereas it is in the interest of the United States to \n     promote political and economic freedom in Africa and \n     throughout the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends those Gabonese who have \n     demonstrated their love for free and fair elections;\n       (2) commends the Gabonese Government for inviting the \n     International Foundation for Election Systems to perform a \n     pre-election assessment study;\n       (3) calls on the Gabonese Government--\n       (A) to take measures to help ensure a credible election and \n     to ensure that the election commission remains independent \n     and impartial; and\n       (B) to invite the International Foundation for Election \n     Systems, the National Democratic Institute, the International \n     Republic Institute, and other appropriate international non-\n     governmental organizations to aid the organization of, and \n     supervise the December 1998 Presidential election in Gabon, \n     in an effort to ensure that these elections in Gabon are free \n     and fair;\n       (4) urges the Government of Gabon to take all necessary and \n     lawful steps toward conducting free and fair elections;\n       (5) calls on the international community to join the United \n     States in offering their assistance toward free and fair \n     elections;\n       (6) urges the United States Government to provide support \n     directly and through appropriate non-governmental \n     organizations to aid the organization of free and fair \n     elections in Gabon;\n       (7) calls on the United States Government to work with the \n     international community in urging the Government of Gabon to \n     create the conditions necessary to guarantee free and fair \n     elections; and\n       (8) urges the United States Government and the \n     international community to continue to encourage the \n     Government of Gabon to ensure a lasting and committed \n     transition to democracy.\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I submit a resolution calling for \nfree and transparent presidential elections in the African country of \nGabon. A similar measure was introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I applaud the work of those Members of the House \nwho are bringing attention to democratic development in this democracy.\n  This resolution expresses support for the promotion of transparent \nelections at a crucial time in Gabon's political development. Although \nostensibly a democracy since 1961, Gabon has been ruled by the same \nindividual--Omar Bongo--since 1967. In 1968, President Bongo declared \nGabon a one-party state and has since then won four consecutive \npresidential elections.\n  A political easing in 1990 led to the strengthening of individual \nrights and the establishment of multi-party elections. However, there \nhave been reports that disorganization and a lack of transparency \nmarred President Bongo's most recent election in December 1993.\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\nAccording to the Freedom House Survey of the World Freedom, Bongo was \ndeclared the winner before many voters were counted and after a \ncampaign that included extensive use of state resources and state \nmedia. Further, widespread irregularities were reported by the \nInternational Foundation for Election Systems (IFES) and the National \nDemocratic Institute (NDI), which served as observers during the \nGabonese presidential and legislative elections in 1993.\n  The electoral victory by President Bongo led to several months of \ncivil unrest and violent repression. Some observers in Gabon believe \nmore civil unrest will occur if the presidential elections this \nDecember are considered illegitimate. A free and fair electoral system \nwould further democracy and stability in Gabon and set an example for \nother African nations.\n  Mr. President, this resolution calls on the Gabonese government to \ntake measures to help ensure credible presidential elections. The \nmeasure calls on the government to invite IFES, the NDI, the \nInternational Republican Institute (IRI), the Center for Democracy or \nother appropriate non-governmental organizations to aid or observe the \nDecember 1998 Gabonese presidential elections.\n  The resolution also urges the United States and the international \ncommunity to offer assistance for fair elections in Gabon and to \nencourage movement toward a stable democracy.\n  Gabon is at a turning point. It enjoys a per capita income of $4,700, \na high literacy rate (69 percent), and a billion dollar oil industry. \nThe United States Senate would be aiding Gabon in the establishment of \na stronger democracy that can help bring stability to a volatile region \nof Africa.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the benefits of free and fair \nelections in Gabon and to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11452-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 286--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT MARK \n  McGWIRE AND SAMMY SOSA SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n  Mr. MACK submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to.\n\n                              S. Res. 286\n\n       Whereas the recent conclusion of the regular baseball \n     season marked the end of an unprecedented home run race \n     between the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire and the Chicago \n     Cubs' Sammy Sosa;\n       Whereas both broke Roger Maris' home run record that many \n     thought would stand untouched as indeed it has since Maris \n     passed the ``Babe'' by one home run when he hit his 61st some \n     37 years ago;\n       Whereas ``Mighty Mac'' rounded out his record setting \n     season by sending two more over the fence in the team's final \n     game to finish the year with 70 home runs while ``Slammin' \n     Sammy'' finished close behind with 66;\n       Whereas McGwire and Sosa brought to the game much more than \n     a new record for the books, even though they are both great \n     competitors, they showed the nation how competitors can show \n     mutual respect and appreciation toward each other and to the \n     game;\n       Whereas Mark McGwire is surely an ideal role model for \n     tomorrow's baseball stars as evidenced by his quiet dignity, \n     love of the game and respect for his competitors which was \n     clearly demonstrated the night he broke the home run record--\n     from his triumphant jog around the bases, to hugging his son \n     at home plate, to saluting Sammy Sosa, and then finally \n     spending a few moments in the stands with the family of Roger \n     Maris;\n       Whereas Sammy Sosa who stayed on McGwire's heels throughout \n     the home run chase is also a role model who, as a native from \n     the Dominican Republic, rose from near poverty to be one of \n     the greatest home run hitters in the history of the game, and \n     is a hero in his home country where he continues to share his \n     success by funding special programs for its underprivileged \n     children;\n       Whereas the nation witnessed this year a flashback to an \n     earlier time when the fans felt a connection to the players \n     and the players gave their all for the fans;\n       Whereas baseball is a game of magic moments, like a perfect \n     game or a triple play--or watching the ball fly over the \n     fence for a home run, and, this year, McGwire and Sosa \n     brought the nation plenty of those magic moments; and\n       Whereas through class and character Mark McGwire and Sammy \n     Sosa are modern day heroes who brought out the best in \n     baseball and reminded us all why baseball is the great \n     American past time: Now, therefore, be it\n  Resolved, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are to be commended for their \nrecord achievement, for reinvigorating the game of baseball, for their \ndecency, and for giving our children sports heroes worthy of that \nstatus.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, this morning I have sent a resolution to the \ndesk commending Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa for a remarkable baseball \nseason. I suspect that many of our colleagues in the Senate, and the \nentire Nation, for that matter, were focused on that last couple of \nweeks, the contest between those two individuals.\n  I think, at least from my perspective as I watched events unfold, \nthere were times people would come up to me and ask, Who do you want to \nwin? My reaction was--like, I suspect, many others'--it would have been \ngreat if it was a tie.\n  The way the two individuals interacted with each other and their \nattitude about the game were just, I think, a remarkable statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11453-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 287--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY SENATE LEGAL \n                                COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased Senators Lott and \nGorton have accepted my amendment to the substitute to S. 852, the \nNational Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer Protection Act of 1998. \nSenators Feinstein and Bryan have joined me in offering this amendment \nwhich will remedy concerns that the substitute bill would have \npreempted state laws that provide greater consumer protection with \nregard to the titling of salvage vehicles.\n  My colleagues may have heard from the state attorneys general about \ntheir opposition to the state preemption impact of the substitute bill. \nMr. President, I have worked with the state attorneys general to \naddress their concern. Simply put, my amendment will allow states with \nhigher standards to keep them.\n  S. 852 without my amendment would establish national titling \nstandards that act as a ceiling rather than a floor because, except for \na few narrow exceptions, the legislation would have preempted existing \ntougher state standards for when a vehicle must be declared salvage, \nrebuilt salvage, non-repairable or flood damaged.\n  For example, Michigan has a stronger consumer protection standard for \nwhen a vehicle must be declared ``non-repairable'' which would be \npreempted by S. 852. In Michigan, if a vehicle is damaged 91 percent or \nmore of its value, its title must be branded ``scrap'' or non-\nrepairable.\n  S. 852 defines non-repairable as a vehicle which has no resale value \nexcept as a source of parts or scrap and it excludes flood vehicles. \nThat is considered a weaker and more subjective definition than \nMichigan's, but under the substitute to S. 852 without my amendment, \nMichigan must accept the lower or weaker national standard.\n  In addition, Michigan's salvage definition includes motorcycles, \nmotor homes, and flood vehicles and S. 852 exempts them. Again, the \nsubstitute legislation would force Michigan to abide by a standard that \nexcludes these types of vehicles. My amendment would allow Michigan to \nretain these provisions of its vehicle titling code.\n  To avoid the preemption of state laws providing greater vehicle \ntitling protection to consumers, my amendment would establish a \nnational or federal standard for when a vehicle's title must be branded \nwith the term ``salvage'', ``rebuilt salvage'', ``non-repairable'', and \n``flood'' damaged. Under my amendment, the federally required standard \nwould become a floor because no state opting in would be allowed to \nhave a lower standard. However, my amendment would allow states that \nchoose to provide more protection to consumers to retain or enact \nstandards that may be considered more stringent.\n  Therefore, under the substitute, with my amendment, consumers would \nbe protected against unscrupulous people who take the title of a \nvehicle that has been in a wreck to a state with lower standards in \norder to give the vehicle a clean title to hide the fact that it was \ndamaged. There will now be a national standard that each participating \nstate will have to meet. But it will be a national floor rather than a \nceiling because states can retain or enact tougher standards if they so \nwish. Establishing a federal standard leaves state salvage law intact \nand not preempted.\n  I view this legislation, as amended, as a big step forward in \nprotecting the consumer from the unscrupulous practice known as ``title \nwashing'' because it gives us a relatively high national standard that \ndid not previously exist. At the same time, it is not watering down any \nstate standard that may be even more protective of the consumer than \nthe federal standard established by this legislation.\n  I would have preferred that the federal standard contain a tougher \nmeasurement for when a damaged vehicle would be declared ``salvage''. \nHowever, the majority of states that have a percentage based salvage \ndefinition use the 75% number contained in this legislation and it is \nappropriate we go with the definition of the majority of states.\n  This legislation, as amended, does not preempt state law and the \nnational standard that it sets is where the majority of states are, in \nterms of the percentage used in the definition of ``salvage'' vehicle.\n  Mr. President, few would dispute the need to stop the current \npractice of selling rebuilt wrecks to unsuspecting buyers. The \nobjective of this legislation is to make it more difficult for the \nunscrupulous seller to conceal the fact that a vehicle has been in an \naccident by transferring the vehicle's title in a state with lower \nstandards then where the vehicle is ultimately sold. This legislation, \nas amended, accomplishes this objective and with my amendment, it \nrepresents important consumer protection.\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nSalvage Motor Vehicle legislation as it has been amended by the Levin/\nFeinstein amendment.\n  The sale of rebuilt vehicles that have been wrecked in accidents has \nbecome a major national problem. According to the National Association \nof Independent Insurers, about 2.5 million vehicles are involved in \naccidents so severe that they are declared a total loss. Yet, more than \na million of these vehicles are rebuilt and put back on the road.\n  In many cases, ``totaled'' cars are sold at auction, refurbished to \nconceal prior damage, and resold to consumers without disclosure of the \nprevious condition of the car. The structural integrity of these \nvehicles has been so severely weakened that the potential for serious \ninjury in an accident is greatly increased.\n  This bill seeks to address the problem by requiring vehicle owners to \ndisclose that the car has been salvaged if it has sustained damage \nvalued at more than 75% of its retail value. The problem with this \napproach is that it sets a ceiling rather than a floor for consumer \nprotection. States who may already have stronger definitions of salvage \nvehicles would be preempted.\n  The amendment that I have offered with the senior Senator from \nMichigan will eliminate this flaw in the bill. Our amendment says \nspecifically that nothing in this bill will effect a state law that \nprovides more stringent consumer protection relating to the inspection, \ntitling or any other action dealing with salvage vehicles. We believe \nthat this is the best possible outcome. A minimum level of consumer \nprotection will be set at the federal level, but the bill now \nauthorizes states to provide greater or more comprehensive protection \nif they wish.\n  Protection for consumers in my state of California will be greatly \nenhanced by the Levin/Feinstein amendment. California law does not set \na percentage value for salvage vehicles. Instead it says that a vehicle \nis salvaged when the owners determines that repairing the vehicle is \n``uneconomical''. Our amendment will allow California to maintain that \ndefinition as well as states with other protections. California law is \nalso more comprehensive in terms of what vehicles are covered. \nCalifornia's law covers all vehicles including large trucks, \nmotorcycles, and motor homes which would not be covered under the \nfederal law.\n  I believe we now have a good bill. By setting a federal level of \nconsumer protection that is a floor rather than a ceiling, we will \nachieve the goal of protecting consumers from fraud while at the same \ntime giving states the flexibility to implement a stricter definition \nfor salvage vehicles.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Michigan. Together we have crafted \nan amendment that will protect the residents of our states and many \nothers. I also want to thank the Majority Leader for his willingness to \nwork with us to improve the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11498-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11498-S11499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER LILIA L. RAMIREZ, US NAVY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to Commander Lilia L. Ramirez, U.S. Navy, who is retiring after \neighteen\n\n[[Page S11499]]\n\nyears of distinguished service to this nation. She stands out as a \npioneer, a leader and an outstanding role model for young people in \nuniform.\n  Lilia's United States Navy career is testament to a true American \nsuccess story. She was born in Bogota, Colombia, and emigrated to the \nU.S. when she was just five years old. Her parents, Alvaro and Ana \nRamirez, were fleeing violence in the Colombian countryside in the \nearly 1960's and sought a new life of security and promise for their \nchildren in America. Al and Ana settled in Bayshore, New York, and \nstarting with little more than a confident spirit, went on to raise \nfive extraordinary citizens through hard work, a determination to \nsucceed, and a deep commitment to family.\n  Lilia is the eldest of the five children. She spoke only Spanish when \nshe arrived in New York as a five-year-old. But Lilia excelled \nthroughout her public education career, graduating with distinction \nfrom Brentwood High School and accepting an appointment to the U.S. \nNaval Academy as a member of the class of 1981, only the second class \nto have admitted women at Annapolis.\n  As a brand new Ensign, Lilia set sail for the Naval Communications \nArea Master Station Western Pacific in Guam, the first of three \noverseas assignments. While in Guam, Lilia deployed to the Indian Ocean \naboard the submarine tender USS PROTEUS. One of just a handful of women \naboard PROTEUS, she crossed the Equator with the ship and was proudly \nand courageously initiated as a Trusty Shellback in that time-honored \nsea faring ceremony.\n  Assignments in Europe followed, first in England as a Navy-Air Force \nLiaison Officer at RAF Mildenhall, where one evening on liberty she and \ntwo other Annapolis classmates saved the life of an elderly Briton they \nhad come upon who had collapsed from a heart attack. Next she served at \nthe U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, Germany, as the Officer-in-\nCharge of the Navy-Marine Corps Element in the headquarters' manpower \nand personnel directorate. While in Stuttgart, Lilia provided crucial \nafter-action reporting and personnel support in the wake of a terrorist \nmurder of our Naval Attache in Greece and the U.S. Marine Barracks \nbombing in Beirut.\n  After five years overseas, Lilia returned to the Washington, DC area \nto serve in several assignments, including the Navy Telecommunications \nCenter at Crystal City, at the time the Navy's largest message center; \nthe Navy's Bureau of Personnel, where she was personally involved in \nassigning a record number of women officers to pursue advanced \ntechnical degrees at the Naval Postgraduate School; and the Joint \nStaff's Command, Control and Communications Systems Directorate. On the \nJoint Staff, she coordinated the installation of command and control \nsystems in the field offices of Customs, DEA and the North American Air \nDefense Command as part of our national anti-drug policy.\n  In 1990 Lilia was assigned as Officer-in-Charge of the Personnel \nSupport Detachment at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, in the state of \nWashington. In this tour she was responsible for the pay, travel and \ncareer advancement matters of 8,000 service members and their families. \nLilia returned to the Washington, DC area again in 1992 where she \nserved as base commander of Naval Communications Unit Cheltenham, a \n230-acre facility in rural Maryland. At Cheltenham she was responsible \nfor 300 personnel, 19 tenant commands, and environmentally protected \nwetlands at her base, where she also played host to the local Boys \nScouts Troop.\n  In 1994 Lilia began a tour in the Secretary of the Navy's Office of \nLegislative Affairs. Lilia was responsible for representing command, \ncontrol, communications and tactical intelligence programs to the \ndefense and intelligence committees of both the House and Senate. In \naddition to numerous informative visits to Naval communications and \nintelligence facilities throughout the U.S., Europe and Japan, Lilia \nalso escorted congressional delegations to the refugee camps at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to witness national elections in Nicaragua. \nIn 1997 she was part of a team from the U.S. Naval Academy sent to Peru \nto advise the Peruvian Navy on integrating women into their naval \nacademy.\n  Lilia was also a student at the Inter-American Defense College, where \nshe again blazed a trail as the first U.S. Navy woman to attend that \ninstitution. She was an impressive ambassador of the U.S. Navy to her \nLatin American counterparts, where she was able to combine her native \nSpanish fluency and breadth of experience in national security affairs \nto forge lasting relationships with key civilian and military leaders \nof Latin America. She left them with enduring, positive impressions of \nwomen as military professionals.\n  Lilia's personal decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service \nMedal, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation \nMedal, and the Navy Commendation Medal (three awards).\n  The Nation owes a debt of gratitude to Lilia Ramirez, whose example \nwill inspire women and Hispanics to seek public service and whose work \nwill continue to have a lasting impact on our armed forces for years to \ncome. While we will miss her distinguished career in uniform, we will \nno doubt continue to enjoy her commitment to community and nation. I \nwish to recognize her entire family, including father Alvaro, mother \nAna (whom we lost just this year to cancer), brothers Michael and \nHenry, and sisters Angela and Ana Tulita, all great American success \nstories in their own right. Best wishes to Lilia, husband Randall \nLovdahl (Commander, U.S. Navy), and children Bianca and Beau as they \nmark this special milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11498-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11499-S11500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with \nSenator Chafee and a bipartisan group of our colleagues from the \nFinance Committee including Ms. Carol Mosley-Braun in introducing the \nStructured Settlement Protection Act.\n  Companion legislation has been introduced in the House (H.R. 4314) by \nRepresentatives Clay Shaw and Pete Stark. The House legislation is co-\nsponsored by a broad bipartisan group of Members of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  The Treasury Department supports this bipartisan legislation.\n  I speak today as the original Senate sponsor of the structured \nsettlement tax rules that Congress enacted in 1982. I rise because of \nmy very grave concern that the recent emergence of structured \nsettlement factoring transactions--in which factoring companies buy up \nthe structured settlement payments from injured victims in return for a \ndeeply-discounted lump sum--completely undermines what Congress \nintended when we enacted these structured settlement tax rules.\n  In introducing the original 1982 legislation, I pointed to the \nconcern over the premature dissipation of lump sum recoveries by \nseriously-injured victims and their families:\n\n       In the past, these awards have typically been paid by \n     defendants to successful plaintiffs in the form of a single \n     payment settlement. This approach has proven unsatisfactory, \n     however, in many cases because it assumes that injured \n     parties will wisely manage large sums of money so as to \n     provide for their lifetime needs. In fact, many of these \n     successful litigants, particularly minors, have dissipated \n     their awards in a few years and are then without means of \n     support.--Congressional Record (daily ed.) 12/10/81, at \n     S15005.\n\n  I introduced the original legislation to encourage structured \nsettlements because they provide a better approach, as I said at the \ntime: ``Periodic payment settlements, on the other hand, provide \nplaintiffs with a steady income over a long period of time and insulate \nthem from pressures to squander their awards.'' (Id.)\n  Thus, our focus in enacting these tax rules in sections 104(a)(2) and \n130 of the Internal Revenue Code was to encourage and govern the use of \nstructured settlements in order to provide long-term financial security \nto seriously-injured victims and their families and to insulate them \nfrom pressures to squander their awards.\n  Over the almost two decades since we enacted these tax rules, \nstructured settlements have proven to be a very effective means of \nproviding long-term financial protection to persons with serious, long-\nterm physical injuries through an assured stream of payments\n\n[[Page S11500]]\n\ndesigned to meet the victim's ongoing expenses for medical care, \nliving, and family support. Structured settlements are voluntary \nagreements reached between the parties that are negotiated by counsel \nand tailored to meet the specific medical and living needs of the \nvictim and his or her family, often with the aid of economic experts. \nThis process may be overseen by the court, particularly in minor's \ncases. Often, the structured settlement payment stream is for the rest \nof the victim's life to ensure that future medical expenses and the \nfamily's basic living needs will be met and that the victim will not \noutlive his or her compensation.\n  I now find that all of this careful planning and long-term financial \nsecurity for the victim and his or her family can be unraveled in an \ninstant by a factoring company offering quick cash at a steep discount. \nWhat happens next month or next year when the lump sum from the \nfactoring company is gone, and the stream of payments for future \nfinancial support is no longer coming in? These structured settlement \nfactoring transactions place the injured victim in the very predicament \nthat the structured settlement was intended to avoid.\n  Court records show that across the country factoring companies are \nbuying up future structured settlement payments from persons who are \nquadriplegic, paraplegic, have traumatic brain injuries or other grave \ninjuries. That is why the National Spinal Cord Injury Association and \nthe American Association of Persons With Disabilities (AAPD) actively \nsupport the legislation we are introducing today. The National Spinal \nCord Injury Association stated in a recent letter to Chairman Roth of \nthe Finance Committee that the Spinal Cord Injury Association is \n``deeply concerned about the emergence of companies that purchase \npayments intended for disabled persons at drastic discount. This \nstrikes at the heart of the security Congress intended when it created \nstructured settlements.''\n  As a long-time supporter of structured settlements and an architect \nof the Congressional policy embodied in the structured settlement tax \nrules, I cannot stand by as this structured settlement factoring \nproblem continues to mushroom across the country, leaving injured \nvictims without financial means for the future and forcing the injured \nvictims onto the social safety net--precisely the result that we were \nseeking to avoid when we enacted the structured settlement tax rules.\n  Accordingly, I am pleased to join with Senator Chafee in introducing \nthe Structured Settlement Protection Act. The legislation would impose \na substantial penalty tax on a factoring company that purchases \nstructured settlement payments from an injured victim. There is ample \nprecedent throughout the Internal Revenue Code, such as the tax-exempt \norganization area, for the use of penalties to discourage transactions \nthat undermine existing provisions of the Code. I would stress that \nthis is a penalty, not a tax increase--the factoring company only pays \nthe penalty if it undertakes the factoring transaction that Congress is \nseeking to discourage because the transaction thwarts a clear \nCongressional policy. Under the Act, the imposition of the penalty \nwould be subject to an exception for court-approved hardship cases to \nprotect the limited instances of true hardship of the victim.\n  I urge my colleagues that the time to act is now, to stem as quickly \nas possible these harsh consequences that structured settlement \nfactoring transactions visit upon seriously-injured victims and their \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11499-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF NATIONAL 4-H WEEK\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today as a former 4-Her to \npay tribute to the participants and volunteers of 4-H, in honor of \nNational 4-H Week, which takes place October 4-10.\n  Although it is not known exactly when or where the 4-H program began, \nMinnesota was one of its originators. The 4-H program, initially known \nas the Boys and Girls Clubs, was founded sometime around the turn of \nthe Twentieth Century by representatives of a wide range of community \ninterests; specifically, farm families, agricultural scientists, school \nteachers, administrators and concerned citizens. The instrumental \nfounder of 4-H in Minnesota was Theodore A. ``Dad'' Erickson, a Douglas \nCounty School Superintendent.\n  During its formative years, a three-leaf clover was used as the \nsymbol of the Boys and Girls Clubs representing three ``H's'': head, \nheart and hands. In 1924, Mr. O.H. Benson used the four-leaf clover \nsymbol in Iowa; in his design the fourth leaf represents health. Today, \n4-H emphasizes projects that improve the four ``H's'': head, heart, \nhands, and health.\n  4-H evolved from an organization which first focussed on advancing \nagricultural technology for young men and home economics skills for \nyoung women, into a program which helped develop self-confidence and a \nsense of community responsibility for all youth participants. Today, 4-\nHers not only continue to be involved in vegetable gardening, bread \nbaking and sewing, which have been around since the program's \ninception, but have branched out into new areas to keep in tune with \ntoday's ever-changing world, such as computer, bicycle and electrical \nprojects. Ultimately, 4-H continues to expand upon its primary goal: \nthe development of young people.\n  Nationwide, there are 6,009,997 members between the ages of five and \ntwenty-one and 624,967 volunteers who participate in the 4-H program. \nAs for Minnesota, 4-H is the largest youth organization in the state \nand consists of over 250,000 members and 14,000 volunteers. In \naddition, there are more than 4,000 4-H clubs in the state of \nMinnesota.\n  There are many activities that 4-Hers and their clubs undertake, such \nas cleaning up trash in their communities, helping in literacy \nprojects, and delivering food to hospice patients. 4-Hers participate \nin local county and state fairs, showing off months of hard work by \npresenting vegetables they have grown in their gardens, various shop \nprojects they have built or refurnished, and recipes they have \nperfected. They also show various animals ranging from domestic pets to \nlivestock they have trained and groomed for competition. 4-Hers have \nthe opportunity to attend various camps, state 4-H youth gatherings, \nnational 4-H Congress, national 4-H Conference, and International 4-H \nyouth exchange.\n  Mr. President, 4-H would not work without the commitment from \nAmerica's youth and the dedication of the volunteers who continue to \nmake 4-H an ever-expanding success on a local, state, national and \nglobal level. Again, as a former 4-H member, I believe 4-H provides our \nyouth of today the skills necessary to survive in our evolving world. I \ncommend all of those involved for their hard work, service, and their \npledge to honor to follow the 4-H motto: ``To make the best \nbetter!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11500-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11500-S11502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ONE GUN A MONTH FORUM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on September 2, I convened a \nforum on gun trafficking. Across America, it is simply too easy for \ncriminals, particularly gangs, to purchase and distribute large numbers \nof guns. And more guns in the wrong hands means more murder and mayhem \non our streets.\n  Because we must move more aggressively to stop this deadly crime, I \nintroduced S. 466, the Anti-Gun Trafficking Act. The testimony I heard \nat the forum has made me even more determined to pass this sensible \nlegislation and help stop gun traffickers.\n  In order to share the insights of the witnesses at the forum with my \ncolleagues and the public, I am submitting the testimony presented for \ninclusion in the Congressional Record. Last week, I submitted the \ntestimony of Mayor Edward Rendell. Today, I am submitting the testimony \nof James and Sarah Brady. Through their tireless efforts with The \nCenter to Prevent Handgun Violence and Handgun Control, they have \nhelped reduce gun violence across our country and it was an honor to \nhave them at the forum.\n  I am also submitting the testimony from several young people who were \nkind enough to testify at the forum. John Schuler, Kenisha Green and \nQuanita Favorite live in communities where gun violence is an everyday \noccurrence, and they have experienced the pain and misery that results. \nWe must do more to help them and the\n\n[[Page S11501]]\n\nother children who live in the crime-ridden neighborhoods of our \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the testimony of James Brady and Sarah \nBrady, along with excerpts from the testimony of John Schuler, Kenisha \nGreen, and Quanita Favorite, be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n     john schuler--21 years old--resident of benning terrace in se \n                             washington dc\n\n       I live in a neighborhood that guns are always going off. \n     You hear them late at night or early in the morning hours. It \n     sometimes feels like a war zone. The bad part about it is \n     that you never feel safe. You always have this fear that it \n     could be you that gets shot today. That's no way for children \n     to grow up.\n       Nobody is willing to do anything about it. Guns are sold \n     all the time and its like--you can get one anytime you want \n     one. The people who sell em' don't even live in the \n     neighborhood. It's like a business you know. All the time, \n     somebody needs a pistol to protect themselves or because they \n     got to get somebody before they get taken out themselves.\n       I've seen friends get shot or killed sometimes for no \n     reason at all. Or because they were in the wrong place at the \n     wrong time. You can get what ever you need, gloc, special or \n     what ever, you can get it if you got the cash.\n\n\n  Kenisha green--20 years old--resident of park morton, washington, dc\n\n       I've got so much to say and it just doesn't seem to be \n     enough time to explain how I feel. I've seen guns sold in and \n     around my neighborhood, to my friends and to my enemies. The \n     fact of the matter is that nobody wins. Every time a gun is \n     sold or stolen and ends up on the streets, you can just \n     scratch off somebody's baby being dead. We are killing each \n     other at alarming rates and its like nobody cares because \n     they say--``they're poor, or they're just dope dealers, or \n     they're just not worth it.'' It's not fair. Other kids get to \n     go to college and we get to go to funerals. These people who \n     sell guns are the real predators. They feed off of our pain \n     and make it seem like we be the animals. Any kind of weapon \n     you want, if you got the cash its available.\n\n\nquanita favorite--18 years old--resident kennedy street nw washington, \n                                   dc\n\n       Just like they sell crack in neighborhood guns are sold all \n     the time in my community. Just last week outside my apartment \n     I could hear a man and woman arguing in the alley. He pulled \n     out a pistol and started firing at her. It's like Dodge City \n     . . . everybody seems to be carrying. Not long ago my uncle \n     was shot and killed on Capital Hill. I still have nightmares. \n     Why are guns so easy to get in our neighborhood? Why do \n     people sell guns like candy and make the victims the guilty \n     parties. We are suffering in our neighborhood and nobody \n     really cares.\n       I work for the Advocates for Youth here in Washington. My \n     job is helping other young people understand the violence and \n     that they can do something about it. Almost every person who \n     we come in contact with, throughout the Nation's Capital has \n     been touched by gun violence. Either a close loved one or a \n     friend at school. When people can purchase guns from other \n     states and easily bring them to sell on the streets of \n     Washington, we've got a real problem.\n       I don't want to die or raise children in an environment \n     where walking down my street could be a life or death \n     situation. people have got to understand that we need drastic \n     measures to curb the illegal sales and purchases of weapons \n     or we all will become victims.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Testimony of Sarah Brady, Chair, Handgun Control, Inc., September 2, \n                                  1998\n\n       Good morning. I'm Sarah Brady, chair of Handgun Control, \n     Inc. and the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.\n       For too many years, the ladies and gentlemen of the United \n     States Congress have heard strenuous objections from the NRA \n     and its allies to reasonable gun control measures. The Brady \n     Bill, the assault weapon ban, and the currently pending \n     Childrens' Gun Violence Prevention Act of 1998 . . . all were \n     characterized by the gun lobby as an assault of the rights of \n     gunowners that would do nothing to stop the trafficking and \n     use of firearms by criminals.\n       The gun lobby was and is wrong about those measures, but \n     I'm particularly curious to hear what they have to say about \n     the proposal we are discussing today that would limit handgun \n     purchases to one a month. You see, the whole point of this \n     proposal is to make it extremely difficult for straw \n     purchasers to buy multiple firearms and resell them to the \n     criminal market. As every major law enforcement group in the \n     nation will tell you, these multiple sales are the easiest \n     and most efficient way for legal guns to transform themselves \n     into the tools of robbery, rape and homicide.\n       But you don't have to take my word for it. In 1993, the \n     same year this federal legislation was first introduced by \n     Senator Lautenberg, Virginia reacted to its reputation as the \n     number one gun trafficking state in the northeast by passing \n     its own one-handgun-a-month law. As our research demonstrated \n     three years later, Virginia's law successfully disrupted the \n     gun trafficking pattern from that state to the rest of the \n     northeast. For crime guns purchased after implementation to \n     the new law that were recovered in the Northeast, Virginina's \n     share fell by 54%. Even more dramatically, the percentage of \n     guns traced back to Virginia gun dealers fell by 61% for guns \n     recovered in New York, 67% for guns recovered in \n     Massachusetts, and 38% for guns recovered in New Jersey. \n     Quite simply, the one-gun-a-month law curtailed Virginia's \n     role as the arms supplier for the eastern seaboard.\n       Maryland's one-gun-a-month law took effect in October, \n     1996. Last year I joined Governor Glendenning in applauding \n     the law's effects--in 1997, not one Maryland handgun bought \n     in a multiple sale was traced from a crime in the District of \n     Columbia. And, the state not only showed an overall drop in \n     crime in 1997, but as of last November, Baltimore police \n     recovered 623 handguns, as opposed to 934 in the year before \n     the law went into effect.\n       But as effective as one-gun-a-month laws are at the state \n     level, a national law would do so much more to curb \n     interstate gun trafficking. The same tracing data that \n     demonstrates that Maryland and Virginia are no longer the \n     main suppliers for gun traffickers demonstrates that Georgia, \n     Florida and other states with weak gun laws have to some \n     degree taken over the business. If even one state allows \n     straw purchasers to walk out of gun stores with ten \n     semiautomatic pistols in a bag, we will all suffer when those \n     guns make their way to the streets and alleys of neighboring \n     communities. Just last spring, Philadelphia law enforcement \n     officials cited the multiple sales of weapons to concealed-\n     carry licensees as one of the most important sources of that \n     city's continually high rate of gun violence.\n       We need to stop pretending, after all this time, that the \n     gun problem and the crime problem exist independently of each \n     other. New research by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence \n     demonstrates that the more guns sold per transaction, the \n     more likely that those guns will be recovered in another \n     state in connection with a criminal investigation. The Center \n     studied data involving 1,173 guns that were traced by ATF as \n     part of a criminal investigation and which were later \n     discovered to have been purchased as part of a multiple sale \n     transaction.\n       The Center's study showed a clear link between multiple \n     sales and interstate gun running. Guns that were purchased as \n     part of a sale involving 3 or more guns were trice as likely \n     as other guns to be recovered in another state.\n       The research also showed that a gun purchased as part of a \n     multiple sale is far more likely to be a junk gun, or \n     Saturday Night Special. A gun that is purchased as part of a \n     sale involving more than three guns is three times more \n     likely to be a Saturday Night Special. It doesn't take much \n     imagination to see what is happening here: interstate gun \n     traffickers are acquiring Saturday night specials at the bulk \n     rate in one state and selling them in another.\n       These conclusions bear out what our common sense tells us. \n     Gun dealers know that the guy with the hundred dollar bills \n     buying 10 Lorcins at a time is not giving them out as party \n     favors to his buddies. Law enforcement knows that the drug \n     dealer's girlfriend buying five Tec-9 assault pistols is not \n     using them to decorate her living room. Prosecutors know that \n     the straw purchaser with the technically clean record who is \n     fronting for violent criminals is as dangerous as a drug-\n     dealer--but much harder to catch and put away. Jim and I know \n     that the Brady Law's background checks and waiting periods \n     cannot prevent a buyer with a clear record from supplying \n     half the gangsters in his neighborhood with guns at a hefty \n     profit. And the public knows that criminals will still take \n     the easiest route to a gun--and right now, that route is the \n     illegal gun trafficker who buys 20, 30 or 40 guns a month.\n       Five years ago, during the debate over Virginia's proposed \n     law, NRA Executive Director Wayne LaPierre acknowledged that \n     ``not many law-abiding Virginians purchase more than one gun \n     a month.'' Well, of course they don't, Wayne. Given the high \n     cost of a quality firearm, most people don't want or need to \n     buy more than one gun a month--it's like buying four or five \n     televisions or refrigerators in a month. Twelve guns a year \n     is more than enough to give any law-abiding sportsman the \n     arsenal of his dreams--and to prevent those with other \n     objectives from getting the firepower they need to rob, to \n     rape and to murder.\n       We have waited long enough for a sensible solution to this \n     nation's crime and gun problem to be implemented. Let's start \n     preventing some of the crimes we are spending hundreds of \n     millions of dollars to punish. Let's make this Congress pass \n     a real and common-sense achievement for our nation's well-\n     being and public safety, and pass this long-overdue anti-gun \n     trafficking measure.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Testimony of James Brady, September 2, 1998\n\n       As a life-long Republican, I have always been a champion of \n     small business. But there is one small businessman that \n     should be put out of business and that's the professional gun \n     trafficker. Professional gun traffickers, like other \n     businessmen, have to make a living, and you don't make a \n     living by selling just one handgun per month. If you are a \n     professional gun trafficker, you have to buy and sell in \n     volume.\n       Let me give you a few examples:\n       In December 1997, three police officers were shot with one \n     of the many guns supplied by Michael Cartier, who pleaded \n     guilty to firearms trafficking in a federal court on August\n\n[[Page S11502]]\n\n     5, 1998. Cartier admitted that he bought 11 guns in one day \n     in Alabama, to be sold in Rochester, New York. He also \n     admitted that he dealt firearms in Western New York without a \n     license between June 20, 1997 and February 14, 1998, and that \n     he purchased 28 other firearms before February 14.\n       In March 1996, Bronx police officer Kevin Gillespie was \n     fatally shot while attempting to intercept a carjacking. An \n     investigation of four handguns found at the scene uncovered a \n     nationwide gun trafficking ring reaching from Houston, Texas \n     to Columbus, Ohio, to Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The New \n     York Times reported that 14 high-powered handguns sold by the \n     smugglers were purchased from one Ohio gun store during a \n     three-month period. Many of those guns were recovered by \n     police in drug dens and at other crime scenes.\n       In April of 1995, a notorious gang member attempted to \n     murder a Los Angeles police detective. The handgun he used \n     was traced to a gun-trafficking ring that had purchased at \n     least 1,000 firearms in Phoenix and sold them to Los Angeles-\n     area gangs.\n       By passing a law limiting handgun purchases to one handgun \n     a month, you will be putting professional gun traffickers, \n     like those I just mentioned, out of business. With all due \n     respect to you, Senator Lautenberg, I think you should choose \n     a different name for this legislation. I would suggest you \n     call it, ``The Gun Trafficker's Unemployment Act of 1998.'' \n     Take it from me: this is one business we don't need.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to testify.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11500-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REAUTHORIZATION OF THE OLDER AMERICAN'S ACT OF 1965\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \nBill 2295. Senator John McCain introduced this bill to reauthorize the \nOlder American's Act of 1965. This legislation will extend \nauthorization for three years for America's senior citizen population.\n   Today's seniors face issues and problems that will eventually effect \nevery American. I watched my parents confront life as seniors, and I \ntoo am concerned about my life after retirement. Taxes, health care, \nSocial Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and quality of life issues are \njust a few of the areas in which our seniors face difficult challenges.\n  The number of people 65 years of age and older is expected to grow \nmore than three times as fast as the total population through the next \nthirty years. I believe the Older Americans Act provides essential \nprograms for this growing population. The Older Americans Act includes \nsenior programs such as the senior nutrition program, senior employment \nservices, and the foster grandparent program, among others. Area \nAgencies on Aging throughout Michigan and the nation conduct various \nsocial and health related programs for seniors through the Older \nAmerican's Act. These programs, when run effectively and efficiently, \nare a great service to our elderly population.\n  The Older American's Act has been without reauthorization for too \nlong. I supported this straight reauthorization to provide some \nstability to these important programs. I believe congress must take \nsteps to ensure the health and well-being of the growing elderly \npopulation. For these reasons, I am proud to join my colleagues in \ncosponsoring this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11502-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11502-S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE DEATH OF MAYOR TOM BRADLEY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in memory of Mayor Tom \nBradley, who is being laid to rest in Los Angeles today. I join with \nall Angelenos, and indeed all Californians, in mourning this kind, \ngentle, and wonderful man who led one of the world's great cities with \nsuch skill for so many years.\n  For nine years during my tenure as Mayor of San Francisco, I had the \npleasure of working with Mayor Bradley on state and national issues and \ntogether we offered a loud drumbeat that the cities of our nation need \nattention. As cities go, so goes the nation, we often said. Through and \nthrough, I saw Tom Bradley as mayor who earned the respect of his peers \nwhile he demanded attention for his city.\n  First elected Mayor in 1973, Mayor Bradley paved the way for many \nother leaders on the local and national level. Although he made history \nas the first African-American mayor of a major city, Tom Bradley ran \nand won a campaign where he pledged to be a mayor who represented the \nentire city. He was true to his word, and for a record-setting five \nterms, he served all the millions of people who call Los Angeles home--\nfrom every racial, cultural, and religious group.\n  Born into a sharecropper's family, Tom Bradley was seven years old \nwhen he and his family headed to California to start a new life. When \nhe arrived in Los Angeles in 1924, Tom Bradley remembered that \n``reaching California was like reaching the promised land.''\n  A product of the Los Angeles public school system, his academic \nabilities enabled him to parlay his high school athletic prowess into a \nuniversity education. Bradley received a scholarship to attend UCLA, \nwhere he soon distinguished himself as a track star.\n  Prompted by a desire to serve the city, Tom Bradley joined the Los \nAngeles Police Department in 1940. In May 1941, he married the former \nEthel Arnold. They had two daughters, Lorraine and Phyllis.\n  As an early example of his enormous capacity for hard work that \nmarked his years as mayor, Tom Bradley worked full-time as a police \nofficer and went to law school at night. he graduated from Southwestern \nUniversity in 1956 and passed the California Bar Exam.\n  After 21 years of service, he retired from the LAPD with the rank of \nLieutenant in 1961 and began to practice law. Urged by community \nleaders, he decided in 1963 to run for a seat on the Los Angeles City \nCouncil. He became one of the first African-Americans ever to serve on \nthe Council, and held his seat for 10 years before becoming the city's \n37th Mayor in 1973. He ran for Governor of California twice, in 1982 \nand 1986, and nearly became the first African-American governor of the \nlargest state in the Union. I think he would have made an outstanding \ngovernor.\n  Mayor Bradley once said, ``My guiding philosophy as mayor has been \nand will continue to be, to paraphrase the Athenian Oath, to transmit \nthis city * * * not as a lesser * * * but as a greater, better and more \nbeautiful city than it was transmitted to me. This philosophy continues \nto be my inspiration.''\n  Mayor Bradley did so much for the city he loved so well. He attracted \nbusinesses to the city and established policies that resulted in the \ndramatic resurgence of the downtown Los Angeles economic center. The \nimpressive skyline that graces Los Angeles' downtown is the realization \nof his vision. He turned the city's Harbor and Airports into top-of-\nthe-line businesses, expanding the number of people employed and the \ncity's ability to compete in the world market. Today, when people fly \ninto the Los Angeles airport from abroad, they land at the Tom Bradley \nInternational Terminal: a fitting tribute to the man who expanded the \nairport into the second-busiest in the country.\n  Mayor Bradley secured the 1984 Summer Olympic Games during a time \nwhen many predicted economic gloom. Instead, his signature approach of \nuniting the private and public sectors behind a common goal produced \nthe most successful Olympic Games in modern history. The Games boosted \neconomic activity in Southern California by $3.3 billion, created \n68,000 jobs, and ended with a $215 million surplus. Just as important, \nthe Games made all of us proud to be Americans. When we think of Carl \nLewis winning his four gold medals, or Mary Lou Retton vaulting her way \ninto the country's heart, we have Mayor Bradley to thank.\n  Mayor Bradley focused economic opportunities both on the inner city, \nwith such community revitalization projects as the Baldwin Hills-\nCrenshaw and Vermont-Slauson shopping centers, and on the entire city, \nwhere he put forward affordable housing and fair planning policies.\n  Mayor Bradley also led a long and hard battle to bring rail \ntransportation to the city of Los Angeles. There were many times it \nwould have been easy to give up, to say the will simply was not there. \nYet he was determined, came to the halls in Washington, D.C. often to \nappeal for funding, and never gave up. Today the Metro Blue Line \ncarries passengers from Long Beach to downtown Los Angeles, and the \nMetro Red Line carries passengers from downtown to MacArthur Park. \nConstruction is now underway to extend the Red Line to North Hollywood.\n  Finally, to reinforce his strong emphasis on education and to shield \nLos Angeles youth from drug peddlers and street gangs, Mayor Bradley \ninitiated an ambitious plan, called L.A's BEST\n\n[[Page S11503]]\n\n(Better Educated Students for Tomorrow), to provide computer training, \ntutorial assistance, and other enrichment activities to students in Los \nAngeles' low income neighborhoods. Under the program, parents are able \nto voluntarily keep their children at school from 2:30 p.m. to 6:00 \np.m. each school day to learn and play. Today L.A.'s Best serves over \n5,000 children each day, and has shown dramatic results in boosting \nstudents' academic achievement and self-esteem.\n  Mayor Tom Bradley shaped Los Angeles. He guided the City through \nenormous growth and change. His 20 years were marked by too many \ntriumphs to count, and even in the bad times, during the devastating \ncivil unrest that took place after the Rodney King verdict, his strong \nleadership and gentle demeanor brought Angelenos together to work for \nthe common good. For many Angelenos, Mayor Bradley was a father figure: \nphysically imposing at six-foot-four, and intellectually imposing as \nthe sharp-minded, politically astute big city mayor, but always so warm \nand gentle that you instantly felt at ease when you talked with him. He \nwas a great leader, but more than that, he was a great person.

Mr. President, five years ago, Mr. Irving Gross of \nLondonderry, Vermont returned to his father's birthplace, Skierniewice, \nPoland for the first time. During his trip he visited the city's Jewish \ncemetery. Like many other Jewish cemeteries in Poland, Skierniewice's \nhad been destroyed by the Nazis and ravaged by time. The grounds were \nunkempt and monuments and headstones were broken, overturned or missing \ncompletely.\n  Today, through the efforts of Mr. Gross, Mr. Tadeusz Zwierzchowski, a \nformer member of the Polish underground and a Skierniewice resident, \nand local Skierniewice authorities, the cemetery has been \nrehabilitated. It now stands as a memorial to the Polish Jews who \nperished under Nazi persecution and serves as a powerful reminder to \nthe residents of Skierniewice of the vibrant Jewish culture that once \nenriched their city and their lives.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize all those who participated \nin this important effort to commemorate the role of the Jewish people \nin Polish culture and their plight during the Holocaust. In bearing \nwitness to the past, the residents of Skierniewice have made a valuable \ncontribution to their city's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11503-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ACTON INSTITUTE FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGION AND LIBERTY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to more \nthan 25,000 Minnesota fire fighters in their dedicated efforts to \nreduce the dangers of fire and the impact it has upon our society. Fire \nfighters play an integral role in the communities of Minnesota each \nday, but their dedication will be highlighted October 4-10, as we \nrecognize National Fire Prevention Week.\n  Fire Prevention Week is the result of efforts by the Fire Marshals \nAssociation of North America, under the nonprofit organization, the \nNational Fire Protection Association (NFPA). The remembrance of the \nGreat Chicago Fire of October 9, 1871 sparked the NFPA into action to \nincrease public awareness of fire safety. It was not until 49 years \nlater that President Woodrow Wilson issued an official proclamation \ndeclaring October 9 as National Fire Prevention Day. In 1922, President \nWarren Harding signed a proclamation pronouncing the Sunday--Saturday \nperiod in which October 9 falls a national observance.\n  Today, the goal of National Fire Prevention Week is to bring an \nawareness to the public to take an active role in fire prevention. \nMinnesota's dollar loss to fire last year totaled more than $141 \nmillion. Experts tell us a commitment to prevent fires before they \noccur is the only way to stop the significant loss of life and property \nfrom fire. For more than 70 years the NFPA has developed a theme \nmotivating the public to actively participate in public education and \nfire prevention efforts. The theme for 1998 is ``Fire Drills: The Great \nEscape.''\n  Minnesota is working in conjunction with the NFPA and fire \ndepartments throughout the United States and Canada to implement the \nfirst-ever North American fire drill--``The Great Escape'' on October \n7. The Great Escape theme hopes to encourage citizens throughout North \nAmerica to become actively involved in fire safety, specifically home \nescape planning and practice. Home fire escape planning and practice \nensures that everyone in the household will know how to use what is \noften a small window of opportunity effectively and get out alive.\n  The 794 fire departments in Minnesota have been preparing for Fire \nPrevention Week by educating the public with guidelines and a map grid \nto help them design an escape plan. This awareness ``Toolbox'' has been \ndistributed to schools and can be found at your local fire department. \nTheir hope is to motivate people to think about fire safety in a \npositive, proactive way, and to start practicing their home escape \nplans regularly, at least twice a year.\n  School programs to teach children fire safety have always been an \nintegral part of fire prevention. Minnesota will debut a Juvenile \nFiresetter Intervention Program this month. The program will provide \ntraining to identify, educate, bring to justice, and offer avenues for \nreferral and restitution to the juvenile firesetters in Minnesota's \ncommunities. This will be supported through regional task forces across \nthe state. In addition to these activities, the Minnesota State Fire \nMarshal Division, in conjunction with Tandy Corporation (Radio Shack), \nhas developed a ``Free Smoke Detector Program.'' To aid in the \ndetection of fires, 5,000 smoke detectors have been donated for \ninstallation in homes of at-risk individuals.\n  Mr. President, our fire departments have shown the highest level of \ndedication and service to protecting our homes and places of work from \nfire. I truly appreciate their unabated commitment to the safety of our \ncommunities and am honored today to pay tribute to the men and women of \nfire prevention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11503-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11503-S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. In recent years, Internet use has exploded, \ncreating unprecedented opportunities for individuals and businesses. We \nmust not allow a complicated patchwork of taxes to impede future \nopportunities.\n\n[[Page S11504]]\n\n  Growth of the Internet has presented individuals with quick access to \nunlimited information. With an estimated 100 million users connected by \nyear's end, its popularity is unmistakable.\n  Logically, entrepreneurs are catering to this growth through online \nsales. We are now seeing the online sale of books, airline tickets, and \ncomputer software. New companies are being created and old companies \nare adapting to provide products and services via the Internet. \nCompanies such as Amazon.com and Dell computers are leading the way. Of \ncourse, large numbers of small businesses are focusing on Internet \nsales as well. Electronic Commerce generated an estimated $8 billion \nlast year and is projected to generate over $300 billion in 2002.\n  Mr. President, we must not underestimate the benefits of such growth. \nIt leads to the creation of new businesses and jobs. And while \ncompanies that do this well will reap tremendous rewards, consumers \nwill be the ultimate winners. They will benefit from the convenience \nand efficiency of electronic commerce. Furthermore, growth in Internet \nsales will lead to increased competition, bringing consumer choice and \nlower prices. I, therefore, believe it's vital that we protect this \nemerging industry.\n  By placing a two-year moratorium on Internet access tax and \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct is a strong step in the right direction. I understand that many \nbusinesses may not have the resources or may choose not to engage in \nInternet sales. This bill doesn't discriminate against these companies \nby creating a tax haven for their competitors. It applies only to those \ntaxes which specifically target the Internet. It, in effect, prevents \ndiscrimination against companies engaged in Internet sales.\n  Mr. President, the Internet Tax Freedom Act is a bipartisan bill \nwhich will ensure the vitality of our nation's electronic commerce. \nToday, I offer my full support for this commonsense \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11503-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        STUDENT LOAN FLEXIBILITY\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Committee, Senator Jeffords, I would like \nto engage him in a brief discussion of a proposal that was raised \nduring Senate consideration of the higher education reauthorization \nbill.\n  As the chairman will recall, the managers' amendment offered during \nSenate consideration included sense-of-the-Senate language regarding \nthe need for greater flexibility in federal student loan programs. \nSpecifically, there were some of us interested in increasing the annual \nlimits on unsubsidized loans while maintaining the aggregate limits, so \nthat students could take greater advantage of federal loans available \nat lower interest rates. Unfortunately, a substantive amendment to \nadvance that proposal was scored by the Congressional Budget Office \n(CBO) as increasing mandatory spending, and adequate offsets could not \nbe found.\n  My purpose in raising this matter again today is to elicit from the \nchairman an indication of his support for this loan flexibility \nproposal on a substantive policy basis, in the hope that, if we can \never find the additional resources necessary to cover its costs, we \nmight enjoy the chairman's support in pressing for its enactment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from New \nHampshire that one of the main obstacles to the adoption of the loan \nflexibility proposal was the cost implications raised by CBO. In fact, \nbudget considerations prevented us from making a number of beneficial \nchanges in the Act which I know members would have liked to have \nprovided. I am favorably disposed to the loan flexibility proposal on a \nsubstantive policy basis, and I am willing to continue to work with the \nSenator from New Hampshire and other interested parties to gain its \nenactment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the chairman's \ncomments and his support and look forward to our continued work \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11504-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             300TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF PENSACOLA, FL\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of the 300th \nanniversary of the City of Pensacola, Florida. Although November 21, \n1998 will mark the 300th anniversary of the continuous settlement of \nPensacola, the origins of Pensacola are much older.\n  In 1559, Don Tristan de Luna y Arellano led the first authorized \nattempt to colonize what eventually became known as Pensacola. The \nfirst attempt at colonization failed, however, and the Spanish were \nforced to withdraw in 1561. The Spanish did not attempt to colonize the \narea again until 1698.\n  Since 1698, Pensacola has flown the Spanish flag, the French flag, \nthe British flag, the Confederate flag, and the American flag over the \nCity. Each flag left its mark upon the City and their historical \npresence is still evident today. Pensacola honors its heritage each \nyear with the Fiesta of Five Flags celebration.\n  The presence of the United States Navy has also had an impact upon \nPensacola. In the 1820s, a Navy Yard was established in Pensacola. The \nNavy Yard was closed in 1911, but in a few short years Pensacola was \nselected as the site of a ``Naval flying school.'' Today, pilots still \nseek flight training at the Pensacola Naval Air Station which has been \ncalled the ``Cradle of Naval Aviation.''\n  Pensacola's deep and sheltered bay, sugar white beaches, friendly \nresidents, and Southern hospitality continues to charm visitors today. \nOver the past three hundred years, the community has hosted such \nvisitors as General Andrew Jackson and entertainer Bob Hope.\n  On November 21, 1998, Pensacola will celebrate its 300th anniversary \nat the site of the former Spanish settlement which today is part of the \nPensacola Naval Air Station. This historic event will be commemorated \nwith a celebration which will include a parade and fireworks.\n  As a United States Senator from the State of Florida, it gives me \ngreat pleasure to wish the City of Pensacola a happy 300th anniversary. \nI wish the City of Pensacola all the best for a fun-filled \ncelebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11504-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOSPONSORSHIP OF S. 2426, THE UNIFORMED SERVICES FILING FAIRNESS ACT OF \n                                  1998\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support \nfor Senate Bill 2426, ``The Uniformed Services Filing Fairness Act of \n1998.'' I believe this legislation will work to give much assistance to \nour men and women abroad in uniform. As we continue to ask for \nincreased responsibilities from our servicemembers, let us not punish \nthese same stewards with unfair tax return deadlines. Due to the remote \ndeployment of many in the uniformed service, these tax deadlines become \nnearly impossible to meet. In my view, this presents the Senate with an \nopportunity to provide a measure of relief to servicemembers already \nstretched to their limits by those repeated and remote deployments.\n  In my view, this needed legislation is both fair-minded and fiscally \nresponsible. I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11504-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11504-S11505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I have sent to the desk a manager's \namendment to H.R. 8, a bill that was reported out of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee on a voice vote. Mr. President, H.R. 8 was \ndeveloped to address part of the air pollution in southern California \nthat has proven difficult to control. The pollution source in question \nis emissions from cars and trucks crossing into the San Diego area from \nMexico. Those of us who work on the problems of air pollution are well \naware of the strict auto emissions standards California has put in \nplace in an effort to meet national air quality standards. Many of the \ncars crossing the border from Mexico greatly exceed the standards that \nCalifornia cars are expected to meet.\n  California has an extremely difficult task in trying to improve its \nair quality. The State is working to reduce emissions from nearly every \nconceivable source. The excess emissions from cross-border traffic is \nestimated to be 13 percent of the excess pollution from cars and trucks \nin the San Diego area.\n  So, H.R. 8 was written to allow cars to be checked as they come \nacross the border to ensure that those cars coming into the U.S. on a \nregular basis comply with State emission standards. California State \nlaw already requires this, but without a border check, the law has been \nimpossible to enforce.\n  This matter has been widely recognized as one that H.R. 8 can be \nhelpful in addressing, and as I have said, the bill was approved by a \nvoice vote in the committee.\n  Today, I am submitting a manager's amendment to remedy some concerns \nraised by a few Senators about how the bill might apply to other \nstates. The amendment will ensure that this bill is neutral with \nrespect to all parts of the U.S. border with Mexico or Canada except \nthe California-Mexico border, where the real problem is. Another change \nmade by the amendment will focus the bill more narrowly on regular \ncommuters as opposed to the occasional visitor on a shopping trip.\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that this amendment has already \nbeen reviewed and approved by the minority. These changes also have \nbeen cleared by both the majority and minority on the House Commerce \nCommittee, as well as by Congressman Bilbray, the bill's sponsor.\n  I would urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and pass H.R. 8.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3739) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as amended, be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 8), as amended, was considered read the third time and \npassed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11511-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11512-S11513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RELIEF OF RICHARD M.

Res. 286\n\n       Whereas the recent conclusion of the regular baseball \n     season marked the end of an unprecedented home run race \n     between the St. Louis Cardinals' Mark McGwire and the Chicago \n     Cubs' Sammy Sosa;\n       Whereas both broke Roger Maris' home run record that many \n     thought would stand untouched as indeed it has since Maris \n     passed the ``Babe'' by one home run when he hit his 61st some \n     37 years ago;\n       Whereas ``Mighty Mac'' rounded out his record setting \n     season by sending two more over the fence in the team's final \n     game to finish the year with 70 homes runs while ``Slammin' \n     Sammy'' finished close behind with 66;\n       Whereas McGwire and Sosa brought to the game much more than \n     a new record for the books, even though they are both great \n     competitors, they showed the nation how competitors can show \n     mutual respect and appreciation toward each other and to the \n     game;\n       Whereas Mark McGwire is surely an ideal role model for \n     tomorrow's baseball stars as evidenced by his quiet dignity, \n     love of the game and respect for his competitors which was \n     clearly demonstrated the night he broke the home run record--\n     from his triumphant jog around the bases, to hugging his son \n     at home plate, to saluting Sammy Sosa, and then finally \n     spending a few moments in the stands with the family of Roger \n     Maris;\n       Whereas Sammy Sosa who stayed on McGwire's heels throughout \n     the home run chase is also a role model who, as a native from \n     the Dominican Republic, rose from near poverty to be one of \n     the greatest home run hitters in the history of the game, and \n     is a hero in his home country where he continues to share his \n     success by funding special programs for its underprivileged \n     children;\n       Whereas the nation witnessed this year a flashback to an \n     earlier time when the fans felt a connection to the players \n     and the players gave their all for the fans;\n       Whereas baseball is a game for magic moments, like a \n     perfect game or a triple play--or watching the ball fly over \n     the fence for a home run, and, this year, McGwire and Sosa \n     brought the nation plenty of those magic moments; and\n       Whereas through class and character Mark McGwire and Sammy \n     Sosa are modern day heroes who brought out the best in \n     baseball and reminded us all why baseball is the great \n     American past time: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are to be commended \n     for their record achievement, for reinvigorating the game of \n     baseball, for their decency, and for giving our children \n     sports heroes worthy of that status.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/05/senate-section/article/S11513-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION BY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience \n     and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to--\n       (A) live independently;\n       (B) enjoy self-determination and make choices;\n       (C) benefit from an education;\n       (D) pursue meaningful careers; and\n       (E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, \n     political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of \n     society in the United States.\n       (2) Technology has become 1 of the primary engines for \n     economic activity, education, and innovation in the Nation, \n     and throughout the world. The commitment of the United States \n     to the development and utilization of technology is 1 of the \n     main factors underlying the strength and vibrancy of the \n     economy of the United States.\n       (3) As technology has come to play an increasingly \n     important role in the lives of all persons in the United \n     States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of \n     government, in the fostering of communication, in the conduct \n     of commerce, and in the provision of education, its impact \n     upon the lives of the more than 50,000,000 individuals with \n     disabilities in the United States has been comparable to its \n     impact upon the remainder of the citizens of the United \n     States. Any development in mainstream technology would have \n     profound implications for individuals with disabilities in \n     the United States.\n       (4) Substantial progress has been made in the development \n     of assistive technology devices, including adaptations to \n     existing devices that facilitate activities of daily living, \n     that significantly benefit individuals with disabilities of \n     all ages. Such devices and adaptations increase the \n     involvement of such individuals in, and reduce expenditures \n     associated with, programs and activities such as early \n     intervention, education, rehabilitation and training, \n     employment, residential living, independent living, and \n     recreation programs and activities, and other aspects of \n     daily living.\n       (5) All States have comprehensive statewide programs of \n     technology-related assistance. Federal support for such \n     programs should continue, strengthening the capacity of each \n     State to assist individuals with disabilities of all ages \n     with their assistive technology needs.\n       (6) Notwithstanding the efforts of such State programs, \n     there is still a lack of--\n       (A) resources to pay for assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services;\n       (B) trained personnel to assist individuals with \n     disabilities to use such devices and services;\n       (C) information among targeted individuals about the \n     availability and potential benefit of technology for \n     individuals with disabilities;\n       (D) outreach to underrepresented populations and rural \n     populations;\n       (E) systems that ensure timely acquisition and delivery of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services;\n       (F) coordination among State human services programs, and \n     between such programs and private entities, particularly with \n     respect to transitions between such programs and entities; \n     and\n       (G) capacity in such programs to provide the necessary \n     technology-related assistance.\n       (7) In the current technological environment, the line of \n     demarcation between assistive technology and mainstream \n     technology is becoming ever more difficult to draw.\n       (8) Many individuals with disabilities cannot access \n     existing telecommunications and information technologies and \n     are at risk of not being able to access developing \n     technologies. The failure of Federal and State governments, \n     hardware manufacturers, software designers, information \n     systems managers, and telecommunications service providers \n     to account for the specific needs of individuals with \n     disabilities in the design, manufacture, and procurement \n     of telecommunications and information technologies results \n     in the exclusion of such individuals from the use of \n     telecommunications and information technologies and \n     results in unnecessary costs associated with the \n     retrofitting of devices and product systems.\n       (9) There are insufficient incentives for Federal \n     contractors and other manufacturers of technology to address \n     the application of technology advances to meet the needs of \n     individuals with disabilities of all ages for assistive \n     technology devices and assistive technology services.\n       (10) The use of universal design principles reduces the \n     need for many specific kinds of assistive technology devices \n     and assistive technology services by building in \n     accommodations for individuals with disabilities before \n     rather than after production. The use of universal design \n     principles also increases the likelihood that products \n     (including services) will be compatible with existing \n     assistive technologies. These principles are increasingly \n     important to enhance access to information technology, \n     telecommunications, transportation, physical structures, and \n     consumer products. There are insufficient incentives for \n     commercial manufacturers to incorporate universal design \n     principles into the design and manufacturing of technology \n     products, including devices of daily living, that could \n     expand their immediate use by individuals with disabilities \n     of all ages.\n       (11) There are insufficient incentives for commercial \n     pursuit of the application of technology devices to meet the \n     needs of individuals with disabilities, because of the \n     perception that such individuals constitute a limited market.\n       (12) At the Federal level, the Federal Laboratories, the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other \n     similar entities do not recognize the value of, or commit \n     resources on an ongoing basis to, technology transfer \n     initiatives that would benefit, and especially increase the \n     independence of, individuals with disabilities.\n       (13) At the Federal level, there is a lack of coordination \n     among agencies that provide or pay for the provision of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services. In addition, the Federal Government does not \n     provide adequate assistance and information with respect to \n     the quality and use of assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services to targeted individuals.\n       (14) There are changes in the delivery of assistive \n     technology devices and assistive technology services, \n     including--\n       (A) the impact of the increased prevalence of managed care \n     entities as payors for assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services;\n       (B) an increased focus on universal design;\n       (C) the increased importance of assistive technology in \n     employment, as more individuals with disabilities move from \n     public assistance to work through training and on-the-job \n     accommodations;\n       (D) the role and impact that new technologies have on how \n     individuals with disabilities will learn about, access, and \n     participate in programs or services that will affect their \n     lives; and\n       (E) the increased role that telecommunications play in \n     education, employment, health care, and social activities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide financial assistance to States to undertake \n     activities that assist each State in maintaining and \n     strengthening a permanent comprehensive statewide program of \n     technology-related assistance, for individuals with \n     disabilities of all ages, that is designed to--\n       (A) increase the availability of, funding for, access to, \n     and provision of, assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services;\n       (B) increase the active involvement of individuals with \n     disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, \n     and authorized representatives, in the maintenance, \n     improvement, and evaluation of such a program;\n       (C) increase the involvement of individuals with \n     disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members, \n     guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in \n     decisions related to the provision of assistive technology \n     devices and assistive technology services;\n       (D) increase the provision of outreach to underrepresented \n     populations and rural populations, to enable the 2 \n     populations to enjoy the benefits of activities carried out \n     under this Act to the same extent as other populations;\n       (E) increase and promote coordination among State agencies, \n     between State and local agencies, among local agencies, and \n     between State and local agencies and private entities (such \n     as managed care providers), that are involved or are eligible \n     to be involved in carrying out activities under this Act;\n       (F)(i) increase the awareness of laws, regulations, \n     policies, practices, procedures, and organizational \n     structures, that facilitate the availability or provision of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services; and\n       (ii) facilitate the change of laws, regulations, policies, \n     practices, procedures, and organizational structures, to \n     obtain increased availability or provision of assistive \n     technology devices and assistive technology services;\n       (G) increase the probability that individuals with \n     disabilities of all ages will, to the extent appropriate, be \n     able to secure and maintain possession of assistive \n     technology devices as such individuals make the transition \n     between services offered by human service agencies or between \n     settings of daily living (for example, between home and \n     work);\n       (H) enhance the skills and competencies of individuals \n     involved in providing assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services;\n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\n       (I) increase awareness and knowledge of the benefits of \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services among targeted individuals;\n       (J) increase the awareness of the needs of individuals with \n     disabilities of all ages for assistive technology devices and \n     for assistive technology services; and\n       (K) increase the capacity of public agencies and private \n     entities to provide and pay for assistive technology devices \n     and assistive technology services on a statewide basis for \n     individuals with disabilities of all ages;\n       (2) to identify Federal policies that facilitate payment \n     for assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services, to identify those Federal policies that impede such \n     payment, and to eliminate inappropriate barriers to such \n     payment; and\n       (3) to enhance the ability of the Federal Government to--\n       (A) provide States with financial assistance that \n     supports--\n       (i) information and public awareness programs relating to \n     the provision of assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services;\n       (ii) improved interagency and public-private coordination, \n     especially through new and improved policies, that result in \n     increased availability of assistive technology devices and \n     assistive technology services; and\n       (iii) technical assistance and training in the provision or \n     use of assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services; and\n       (B) fund national, regional, State, and local targeted \n     initiatives that promote understanding of and access to \n     assistive technology devices and assistive technology \n     services for targeted individuals.\n\n     SEC. 3.
