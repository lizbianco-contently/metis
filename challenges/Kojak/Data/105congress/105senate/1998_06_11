Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be \nin a period for morning business until 11:15 a.m. Following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will resume consideration of the tobacco bill, and \nit is expected that a Republican amendment will be offered regarding \nattorneys' fees. It is hoped that a short time agreement can be reached \non that amendment so that remaining amendments can be offered and \ndebated throughout today's session. At 12 noon, the Senate will proceed \nto a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the modified tobacco \ncommittee substitute. Assuming cloture fails, the Senate will continue \ndebate on the tobacco bill. The Senate may also consider any other \nlegislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. \nTherefore, rollcall votes are possible throughout today's session of \nthe Senate.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know my colleague wants to address the \nSenate and I will only take a minute on the business side. It is my \nunderstanding with respect to the tobacco bill, in a discussion with \nthe majority leader last night, that there would be a Democratic \namendment, I believe, at 11:15, with the understanding that the \nattorneys' fees amendment will follow that. I can say to a certainty \nthat on the Democratic amendment, we will gladly enter into a time \nagreement. It will not be a long time agreement. So we can anticipate \nmoving to the attorneys' fees amendment, hopefully, in the early \nafternoon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, the last amendment last night \nvoted on was a Democratic amendment, and going back and forth, I \nbelieve the next one will be a Republican amendment. However, the \nchairman is not here. We will check with him, and if an accommodation \nis necessary, we will pursue that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say to my friend, that is \naccurate in the sense there was a Democratic amendment. But the \ndiscussion we had with the majority leader and the manager of the bill \nis the Democratic amendments that have flowed to date were essentially \nresponsive amendments on the same subject to the Republican amendment. \nEffectively, there hasn't been a proactive, freestanding Democratic \namendment. I think that is why the majority leader was happy to say he \nwill allow the Democrats to have sort of a substantive amendment of \ntheir own choosing, and then we can proceed forward. But we can work \nthis out. I just wanted to make sure at least that was on the record at \nthis time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I don't suspect that will be a \nproblem. We are going to check with the chairman and try and \naccommodate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6131-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this coming weekend the President \nof the United States will travel to my home State of Oregon to deliver \nthe commencement speech at Portland State University. As Oregon's \njunior Senator, I welcome President Clinton. I look forward to seeing \nhis remarks and want him to know he is welcome in my State.\n  While in Portland, he will find a vital, vibrant community, like much \nof the Nation, which has enjoyed very\n\n[[Page S6132]]\n\ngood economic times. Because of this, the President might leave \nPortland thinking his administration's policies, even those regarding \nnatural resources and the environment, have been good for Oregon. And \nif he does that, if he has that impression, he will be sadly mistaken.\n  During the last recess, I traveled through the rest of Oregon. I \nreturned from Washington last weekend having spent 5 days in eastern \nOregon. I went to the communities of Condon, Boardman, Hermiston, \nPendleton, LaGrande, Baker City, Ontario, Nyssa, Burns, John Day, \nEnterprise, Milton-Freewater, and Ione.\n  This region is the home to honest, hard-working people. It is a \nregion that is also home to some of the most breathtaking scenery on \nthe Earth. It is a region of forests and rivers, mountains and valleys. \nIt is a region where people earn their living from the land. But it is \na region in dire economic straits. It is a region which is fighting for \nits survival.\n  Many States have what I term country-city divides, conflicts between \nrural and urban areas. I happen to be the first Senator elected in \nOregon who has lived in rural Oregon in nearly 70 years. I take the \nissues with respect to all of my State very seriously. I take the \nissues that affect rural Oregon very personally.\n  I would like to report to my colleagues on the State of rural Oregon, \nthe rest of Oregon, today, and to invite the President not just to go \nto Portland but to come with me to John Day, to come with me to Nyssa, \nto come with me to Burns, OR, and to see for himself an area of my \nState that has been terribly damaged by many of his administration's \npolicies.\n  These are Oregonians who have made their living off the land for \ngenerations. They are now being forced out of business by policies of \nthis administration. These policies are often driven by emotionally \ngenerated, questionable science to institute severe restrictions on \nagriculture, forestry, grazing, and mining on both public and private \nlands.\n  Mr. President, there are people in the administration now who talk \nwith straight faces, without blinking, about tearing out the Columbia \nRiver dams. These are assets built by the Federal Government in the \nSecond World War. They were built to serve a multiple of purposes. They \nwere built to provide public safety from spring flooding; they were \nbuilt to provide irrigation for agriculture; they were provided to move \ncrops from country to city, the city of Portland, the Port of Portland, \nwhere 40 percent of the wheat in the West goes right through and down \nthat river.\n  They were built also to produce electricity. Heaven forbid, people \nneed electricity. They were built specifically to provide the \nproduction of metals for weaponry in the Second World War. But now we \nare being told that all of these values must be subordinate to the \nsingle value of supposedly protecting the environment. They want to \nblow up these dams.\n  I am afraid I probably motivated some of my environmental opponents \nwhen I told them that when they blow the dams I will be on top of them, \nbecause I feel very strongly that the multiple of public values that \nare to be served by these are still worthy values. And there are many \nthings we can do to make them more environmentally friendly, and we are \ndoing that as we speak.\n  Well, that is an aside. But the people that I know in rural Oregon \nare good stewards of their land. After all, they need their land for \ntheir livelihoods, and they desperately would like to pass it on to \ntheir next generation, to their children. Moreover, these people make \ntheir living by producing food and wood fiber that all Americans need \nand use in our everyday lives.\n\n  I sometimes begin to think that we are so removed from rural \ncommunities in our modern society that we think we do not need farmers \nbecause there is a Safeway down the street, we do not need foresters \nbecause there is a lumber yard down the street, and we forget this \nconnection.\n  As we forget this connection, we begin to enact laws that shut down \nall of our basic American industries of mining, grazing, farming, \nforestry, fishing, drilling--all of these things that we have done that \nhave produced this American standard of living.\n  I fear as we shut these things down, we will then lament the day when \nour economy takes a very serious downturn. And it is difficult to \nreverse, because even in this room, Mr. President, everything around us \nis the product of the Earth in one way or the other. It came out of the \nEarth, and we bring these materials into commerce to produce products. \nWell, we all use them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask unanimous consent to have an additional 5 \nminutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. For all the talk of a postindustrial service \neconomy, Mr. President, people's most basic needs are still food and \nshelter.\n  Let me offer some facts and figures to help put things in \nperspective. Eleven of Oregon's thirty-six counties had double-digit \nunemployment in March, including Grant County with a rate of nearly 20 \npercent, Lake County at 15 percent, Wallowa County at 14.4 percent. It \nis about to get much worse.\n  For example, Mr. President, people do not like the way a clearcut \nlooks, but nature has a way of clearcutting, too. It is called a forest \nfire. We have them very commonly in my part of the world, and yet even \nthe salvage of burnt timber is not being allowed to be harvested in my \nState now. That makes no sense.\n  And 122 mills have shut down in Oregon since 1990. Timber receipts to \nGrant County for roads and schools declined from a high of $12.4 \nmillion in 1992--$12.4 million--to $1.9 million in 1997. What are we \nsaying about schools? What are we saying about roads?\n  The amount of timber harvested from our public lands has been reduced \nby approximately 80 percent. Under the President's Northwest Forest \nPlan, only 3 million of the 24 million acres--or 12 percent of the \navailable acreage--is open for sustainable timber production. All this \ndespite the fact that tree growth rates exceed harvest rates by 85 to \n90 percent.\n  The Clinton administration would have us believe that they need to \ntake over the management of Oregon's natural resources because we are \nincapable of doing so. Nothing could be further from the truth. In \nfact, Oregon has some of the toughest land use laws in the Nation. \nDespite the utilization of forest lands for agriculture, urbanization, \nand infrastructure, 91 percent of the forest land base that existed in \nOregon in 1630--in the year 1630--91 percent of that land still exists \nas forests and for growing trees.\n  Mr. President, the final visit of my week in eastern Oregon was to \nthe Ione High School commencement, where I had the privilege of \ndelivering the graduation address. Ione is a small community, and its \nclass of 1998 is also small. There were nine graduates. Yet nearly 500 \npeople packed the high school gymnasium on a Friday evening to lend \ntheir support as a community to these outstanding young people.\n  As I looked at the graduates, I could not help but wonder what future \nthere was for those who wished to live and work and raise a family in \neastern Oregon. Will there be jobs for them? Will there be good schools \nfor their children? Will this administration sentence them to a future \nwith no option but to move to a city, to an urban area, in order just \nto make a living?\n  I returned from that trip, Mr. President, with a commitment to \nredouble my efforts on behalf of the good people of rural Oregon and to \ndo everything within my power to ensure that their communities and \ntheir way of life will survive.\n  Finally, the next indignity to be visited upon rural Oregon involves \nthe implementation of the Glenn amendment which now may invoke \nunilateral sanctions that unjustly impact our farmers. I think the \ndistinguished Senator who has just left the Chair has a bill, I think \nSenator Murray has a bill, and I have a bill to address this very \nissue. Now, I know Senator Glenn and I know he is a good and decent \nman, and I know his bill was designed to deter nuclear proliferation. I \nam all for it. It didn't work.\n  Now we are about to witness the incredible spectacle of wrestling \nourselves to the ground. The government is about to impose sanctions \nthat will ultimately not hurt Pakistan because\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\nthe truth of the matter is our competitors love this. The people that \nwill be hurt are the people of rural Oregon, Washington, Idaho and \nothers, who will lose 40 percent of their markets to U.S. sanctions on \nU.S. farmers that have had no ability to deter nuclear \nnonproliferation.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at a bill which I am proud to \ncosponsor. It is a bill by Senator Lugar that has a ``stop, look, and \nlisten'' provision to this whole episode of unilateral sanctions, which \nin effect makes war on our own people. I think we need to stop and look \nat this very, very seriously.\n  Mr. President, I indicated how devastated wheat farmers will be in \nthe rural parts of Oregon, Idaho, and Washington by the sanctions now \nabout to be imposed by the Clinton administration by the Arms Export \nControl Act. Food aid under this act is supposed to be exempted. It is \nimportant that credits and credit guarantees for export of wheat also \nbe exempted.\n  For that reason, I am introducing legislation this morning to exempt \ncredit guarantees from any sanctions to be imposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry, Mr. Cleland and Mr. Abraham pertaining to \nthe introduction of S. 2157 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6131-6", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6133-S6134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last month the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, came to the floor to urge the Republican \nleadership to allow the body to consider reform of managed health care \nin our country. Today, I also want to join his plea that this \ninstitution be allowed to consider the consequences for American \nfamilies of the managed health care system in our country.\n  The simple truth is health care in America is in a state of crisis--\nnot a crisis of competence or technology. Most assuredly, it is a \ncrisis of confidence. Confidence in health care in many respects is as \nimportant as the quality of the providers or the level of our \ntechnology. I have rarely in my life seen an issue where so many \nAmericans are of a similar mind with such a depth of concern regarding \nthe availability and quality of health care under the HMO system.\n  I realized myself the depth of these feelings when, only a few \nmonths, ago I joined with my colleague, Congressman Pallone from New \nJersey, in a field hearing in our State. During the hearing, families \ntold me about their own experiences in attempting to care for their \nchildren, gaining access to the best health care providers, and the \nenormous frustration and feeling that the costs of operations were \nbeing placed before the health of their children.\n  Perhaps the best example came from a single family in New Jersey, the \nBolingers. Their daughter, Kristin, is 15 years old, and lives in \nSpotswood, NJ. She has experienced the frustration of managed care that \nhas been visited upon many American families. As an infant, Kristin \ndeveloped unexplained intractable seizures which left her in need of \nvery specialized care and expensive diagnostic tests. Five years \nbefore, Kristin's parents had enrolled themselves in an HMO. But \nbecause of the rules of the HMO, Kristin could no longer see the \npediatricians and the specialists who had been treating her for her \nentire life. Those who had the experience with Kristin, had seen her \nsymptoms and knew her case, were now separated from her treatment, and \nin their place the HMO on its list of available doctors made a \npediatrician available who was not qualified, who had no experience \nwith her condition, and did not know her or how to treat her.\n  Her family then was left in an extraordinary position. In caring for \ntheir 15-year-old daughter, do they absorb all of the financial costs \nwhich they are unable to bear when treating their child or do they go \nto doctors who, on their face, were not qualified to deal with the \ncase?\n  The family was left in a desperate financial position. The HMO \nrefused to pay many of her medical bills deeming them ``not medically \nnecessary.'' The case only gets worse.\n  In 1994, scoliosis, caused by Kristin's condition, required the use \nof a back brace. The HMO gave her a back brace which was inferior and \nnot usable.\n  Last year, Kristin had to undergo corrective spinal surgery. Her \nphysician prescribed home nursing care and physical therapy. For a long \ntime the HMO refused to pay for the physical therapy or the home care. \nThey would pay for nothing. After they started to pay, the physical \ntherapy was only half complete when payments stopped.\n  This, of course, leaves Kristin Bolinger's family with a question \nthat they will ask themselves all their lives. The bills were not being \npaid, the family had to make these sacrifices in spite of the fact they \nwere paying an HMO all of this time on time in full. The finances \naside, the Bolinger family for the rest of their lives is left with the \nquestion: How much did their child suffer, and how much of her \ncondition might have been reversed if she had gotten the right care at \nthe right time?\n  Obviously, Mr. President, Kristin Bolinger and her family are not \nalone. She is one of 4 million people in my State of New Jersey and 50 \nmillion in our country who have absolutely no protection from the \njudgments of their health maintenance organizations. They live at the \nwhim of whatever decisions may come from the officials who manage these \nhealth care organizations. That is true, even though I am very proud \nthat in New Jersey we probably have the best patient protection system \nfor those in managed care of any State in the Nation. But it doesn't \nwork. State protections don't work because only 25 percent of those in \nhealth maintenance organizations in New Jersey can be covered by State \nprotections. The other 75 percent, who like Kristin Bolinger are in \nERISA-based plans, are left to their own devices to fight their \ninsurance companies for their rights because State protections cannot \nshield them.\n  It is no wonder that more than half of all Americans who are enrolled \nin health maintenance organizations are significantly dissatisfied with \nthe quality of their care.\n  Fifty-one percent of Americans believe that health maintenance \norganizations are eroding the quality of health care for their \nfamilies. Fifty-five percent fear that if they become ill while in a \nmanaged health care plan, those who administer their plan would have \ntheir highest priority in saving money rather than caring for their \npatients. And if that is not bad enough, the worst indication may be \nthat this lack of confidence of those who are enrolled in the plan is \nmirrored by health care professionals themselves. Forty percent of all \nphysicians who work in these very plans every day watching these \njudgments believe that the quality of health care and of the judgments \nmade by health care professionals is eroding and prevent them from \nmaking the best medical judgments for patients.\n  I cannot tell you that the movement in America to managed health care \nplans has not had benefits. The truth is the spiraling upward costs of \nhealth care in America are being contained. I do not believe we ever \ncould have developed the current Federal budget surplus without managed \ncare. It has been of enormous benefit to the American economy as \ncorporations have contained costs, but there is a loss of balance. If \nwe are achieving the controlling of these costs, but the price is that \nfamilies and physicians do not have confidence they can get the care \nthey are purchasing, we are paying a very high price for this \nefficiency. What is required is to restore the balance between the \nefficiencies of delivering care and ending the upward spiral of rising \nhealth care costs, but assuring quality and access and balance of \njudgments.\n  The truth is this loss of balance is not necessary. Patients should \nhave access to health care professionals who are qualified to treat \ntheir conditions and not forced to accept people without\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\nthe proper professional credentials simply because they are preferred \nby health care managers in these organizations. Insurance companies \nshould not withhold the care that family physicians and specialists \nalike deem necessary. If a health care professional, a doctor believes \na certain treatment is necessary, as a matter of right that doctor's \njudgment should prevail. Obviously, if a doctor believes that an HMO is \nmaking the wrong judgment for the health of an individual, there should \nbe a fair and speedy appeals process to someone who can make the best \njudgment for the patient.\n  Mr. President, this case is so obvious, it is so compelling, it comes \nas close to a consensus judgment as can ever be reached in a country of \nthis size and complexity. It is at issue in every State, in millions of \nAmerican families, borne out by the practical experience of people that \nSenators meet every day. It is true today. It was true yesterday. It \nwas true last month. It was true last year.\n  I join with the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, in urging \nthat this Congress this year deal with health maintenance organization \nreform. There is legislation before this Senate that is prepared. It is \nready. It is comprehensive. It deals with the issue. Senator Daschle's \nlegislation, S. 1890, would deal with the very issues that Kristin \nBolinger had to face in her own life. Senator Daschle's Patients' Bill \nof Rights, consistent with the call of President Clinton in his State \nof the Union Address, would ensure that patients like Kristin would \nhave (1) access to providers who are qualified to treat their \nconditions, including referrals to specialists when necessary; (2) that \nany Member of a health maintenance organization, wherever they are in \nAmerica, wherever they travel, whatever community they are in, have \naccess to emergency care in a hospital that is proximate to them when \nthey are in trouble or in need; (3) have access to a fair and immediate \nappeals process.\n  More than anything else, this would convince the American people that \ntheir interests and the needs of their families are being put before \nthe profits of these organizations. It is obviously too late to deal \nwith Kristin Bolinger's pain or the terrible financial plight of her \nfamily. Kristin's experience and those of millions of other Americans \ncan be instructive to this Senate and remind us of our obligations to \ndeal with the problems of health care in America. We can still \nacknowledge the enormous efficiencies of managed care and its benefits \nof ending the rising costs, helping with corporate efficiency and the \npredictability of health care costs. But simply because these \norganizations are working to add efficiency, does not attest to the \nfact that all families are being treated fairly as demonstrated by \nKristin Bolinger's experience. Senator Daschle's legislation, his \nPatients' Bill of Rights, deals with that balance. I urge the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, to bring the Patients' Bill of Rights for managed \nhealth care reform before the Senate.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6133-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6134-S6135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       METHAMPHETAMINE CHALLENGE\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious challenge \nto law enforcement, to communities, to our youth, and to the future of \nour country.\n  Methamphetamine, as most of us in this body know, is a growing danger \nin many of our communities. We have the dubious distinction in Missouri \nof having achieved the highest ranking in the number of clandestine \nmethamphetamine labs busted in the last year. Seven hundred labs were \nbusted where they were cooking up this deadly brew to endanger their \nneighbors, to threaten the lives and the future of our young people and \nour adults. Methamphetamine, or crank, is a hot new drug, and it is \nsupposed to have a wonderful temporary feeling. The problem is it \ndestroys the body and the minds of the users. It also, when it is \nprepared, leaves a deadly residue and threatens explosion and fires \nthat have injured many innocent people.\n  Methamphetamine dealers are the very worst kind of social predators, \nfar worse than even an average drug dealer, and that is saying \nsomething. They have the same disregard for young lives they seek to \nspoil, but they also possess a callous indifference to the entire \npublic. Meth cookers prepare their drugs in homes, in rented apartments \nand hotel rooms, but the meth cooking process is a very dangerous one \nbecause it produces dangerous byproducts including carcinogens and \ntoxins and combustible gases. While it is being cooked, it is highly \nexplosive.\n  I have talked with law enforcement officers who go in who have to use \nlow-powered flashlights because a really hot flashlight could set off a \nspontaneous combustion in a meth lab. I have seen the pictures of young \nchildren who have been on cooking sites with their parents or care \ngivers when the mess caught fire and burned them horribly. The \naftermath of the process is a mini toxic waste site. The waste sites \nlitter my State of Missouri.\n  Despite the danger, law enforcement officers in my home State \ncontinue their heroic effort every day to bring more of these labs \ndown. They are currently outgunned because the methamphetamine \nproduction and sales have been spreading. The problem is severe, and \nmany of the lab sites are so dangerous that local law enforcement \nagencies cannot handle the responsibility alone.\n  We have been very gratified that many of the local police agencies \nand law enforcement agencies in my State have been provided invaluable \nassistance by the Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA. As I said, last \nyear, 700 labs were taken down. This year, it looks like they may even \nexceed that number.\n\n  The lab sites must be cleaned up promptly, and that is where the \nproblem comes in. The responsibility initially falls on local law \nenforcement officials, and the drug dealers are not very concerned \nabout what mess they leave with the community. Cleaning up the waste on \nthese sites can cost anywhere from $4,000 to $40,000. Our law \nenforcement agencies are not funded to do this. Our law enforcement \nagencies, when I talked with the DEA and the local police and the local \nsheriffs around Missouri, find out they have to waste valuable manpower \njust babysitting the sites, keeping people away from these sites so \nthey do not stumble in and get caught in one of these dangerous meth \nsites.\n  For that reason, I believe we should embark on a State-Federal \npartnership to ensure that these labs are fully cleaned up and the \nnuisance is removed immediately from local communities. In the HUD-VA \nappropriations bill, we have included a pilot project for $2 million to \ngo to our Department of Natural Resources for the State of Missouri, to \ninstitute a cleanup partnership between the State and local law \nenforcement.\n  With these valuable resources, the State environmental expert will \nteam up with local law enforcement agencies on the sites promptly and \nrid the town of toxic waste. The State will have funds to outfit a \ncleanup detail, expand that detail, and equip itself to respond to all \ncorners of the State. The State will also have the resources to share \nwith local governments, who must move in and respond to emergency \ncleanups, a process that could otherwise bankrupt many small \ncommunities.\n  On a broader basis, we recognize this problem is a nationwide \nproblem. In the Superfund measure that has been reported out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, that I hope this body will be \nable to take up, we provided that brownfields money can be used for \ntoxic waste cleanups of methamphetamine sites because, in fact, they \nare toxic waste sites and, in essence, may be more dangerous than many \nof the sites already classified as toxic waste sites.\n  What happens when one of these sites becomes a site for cooking meth \nis deadly. The meth labs can blow up--blow the front off the building. \nIf they are in a motel, people innocently taking a room in the adjacent \nroom may find themselves victims of a blast. But whoever comes on a \nsite, a methamphetamine site, after cooking has occurred there, is in a \nvery dangerous position.\n  We need to crack down to the fullest extent of the law on these \npredators, but until we win that war we must protect our community. \nThis effort will go\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\na long way toward helping our law enforcement fulfill that \nresponsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Last week, Mr. President, Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright traveled to Geneva to meet with the other permanent members of \nthe U.N. Security Council. The purpose of her meeting was to convince \nthe world's declared nuclear powers to join the United States in \ncondemning India and Pakistan for their recent nuclear tests and \nsomehow to prevent an arms race from escalating in South Asia. To no \none's surprise but her own and President Clinton's, no agreement was \nreached.\n  The foreign policy of the United States in the Clinton Administration \nhas now come down to this. In dealing with the People's Republic of \nChina, a country with a developing internal free market, but repressive \nof any political dissent, with systematic restrictions against \ncompetitive American products, and a blind eye toward billions of \ndollars of intellectual property piracy, we not only don't defend the \nvictims of these practices, we generously supply the PRC with missile \ntechnology that allows it to increase in its already immense threat to \nits neighbors.\n  The Clinton Administration gives ``Most Favored Nation'' treatment \nfor China a whole new meaning. What it means now is, what China wants, \nChina gets--even an American president to be greeted on Tiananmen \nSquare, insulting the memory of its martyrs.\n  And then we are surprised when India tests nuclear weapons, joining a \nclub we founded fifty years ago. We react by sanctioning--\nunilaterally--the world's most populous democracy. And we follow up by \nimposing the same sanctions on Pakistan, a long time ally, for a \nnatural and justified reaction to India's tests.\n  As Charles Krauthammer so eloquently put it in his column in Friday's \nWashington Post, the President:\n\n     . . . is guilty of more than mere fatuousness, however, in \n     dealing with the India-Pakistan nuclear arms race,. He is \n     guilty of fueling it. While for years his administration has \n     claimed deep concern about proliferation, [he] has \n     shamelessly courted the world's worst proliferator of weapons \n     of mass destruction: China.\n\n  Not only is the administration in large part to blame for the current \ncrisis, but is now taking steps to ensure that our economy will suffer \ntogether with our national security. The President has decided to \nimpose harsh economic sanctions on both India and Pakistan.\n  It has already been made alarmingly clear that unilateral sanctions \ndo not work. For the law the President stands behind in his decision to \nimpose sanctions was designed not to punish other nations for flexing \ntheir nuclear muscle, but to deter them from entering the nuclear club. \nAs David E. Sanger wrote in The New York Times on May 24, ``passionate \nnational causes--particularly the urge for self-sufficiency--almost \nalways trump economic rationality.'' Mr. Sanger goes on to say, wisely, \nthat ``unilateral sanctions almost never work--precisely because they \nare unilateral. In a global economy, there are too many producers of \nalmost everything.''\n  The President has told the American people that he has no choice but \nto impose the sanctions, claiming that they are required under the \nNuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. What he doesn't say is \nthat Sections 102 (b)(4) and (5) of that law provide the President \nauthority to waive the sanctions in whole or in part if he uses the 30 \nday delay allowed him before imposing the sanctions. The President did \nnot use the 30 day delay. The reason for his rush to impose sanctions \nis clear. The President has no other solution.\n  But unilateral sanctions do little to produce results. Instead, they \nharm U.S. workers, farmers, and families. My home state of Washington \nhas a lot at stake in this international dispute. In 1996, Washington \nexports to India totaled $429.39 million and India was the state's \nfourteenth largest export market. Boeing airplane sales to India \ntotaled $372.8 million in 1996 and accounted for a large majority of \noverall Washington state exports to that country. Most of the planes \nIndia purchases from Boeing are financed by the Export-Import Bank. If \nthe President cuts off Ex-Im Bank loans to India, Boeing, and \nWashington state's economy will feel a major strain.\n  Washington is the largest producer of soft white wheat, Pakistan's \ngrain of choice. Pakistan is the largest market for Washington state \nwheat exports.\n  During Fiscal Year 1997, Pakistan purchased 2 million metric tons of \nsoft white wheat from the Pacific Northwest--32 percent of total soft \nwhite wheat exports from the region. So far in FY 1998, Pakistan has \npurchased 2.14 million metric tons of soft white wheat--37 percent of \ntotal wheat exports from the region, with purchases from Washington \ntotaling $140 million.\n  While American farmers and manufacturers stand today at risk of \nlosing these important markets, their counterparts in Canada, Europe, \nand Australia are celebrating the shortsightedness of the U.S. \nAdministration. For the U.S. sanctions are better for their businesses \nthan the most ingenious of marketing campaigns. They are happy to step \nin and fill the place of American exporters in India and Pakistan.\n  Mr. President, if the U.S. is the only country imposing sanctions on \nIndia and Pakistan for actions strongly supported by a large majority \nof their people, then the Indian and Pakistani governments and the \nIndian and Pakistani people will turn to nations that are not \ncriticizing their actions for their imports. Airbus and Canadian or \nAustralian grain farmers will benefit from U.S. actions, while Boeing \nand U.S. farmers will be left out in the cold.\n  The President must take action now to resolve the situation in South \nAsia and end the sanctions. If he does not, the American people will \nsuffer the consequences of his mistakes for a long time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered\n  Mr. BREAUX.

Mr. President, we are in the middle of the debate on the \nso-called tobacco legislation which has been ongoing for a number of \ndays. I think that it is appropriate to pause for a moment and to \nconsider where we are and where we have been and to try to come up with \nan idea of where this debate is likely to go. Because I think that with \nall the debate and discussion we have had, there is some confusion as \nto exactly what has been happening.\n  I think it is very important to recognize that in order to know where \nyou are going, it is also important to actually know from where you \nstarted. I think if you look at where we started, Congress became \ninvolved in this tobacco legislation really as a result of attorneys \ngeneral litigation on behalf of all the various States trying to \nrecover money for the States' Medicaid programs, which had suffered a \nloss because of payments for people who had suffered disease and injury \nbecause of smoking-related activities.\n  When it comes to this issue, I want to make one point very, very \nclear. I do not think any of us need to be lectured to about the \nproblem that is facing us. All of us have examples and instances in our \nown lives that make the problems associated with cigarette smoking and \nthe tobacco industry very, very clear. In my own family, my mother died \nof lung cancer--lung cancer that was clearly and directly related to \nyears of tobacco use. In addition, my father-in-law died of lung cancer \nand tumors related clearly to smoking and exposure, probably at the \nsame time, to asbestos.\n  Probably each Member of this body and also the other body has similar \nstories they can relate that personally affect them in their approach \nto this\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\nlegislation. You simply cannot divorce it. People are affected for a \nlifetime by personal experiences, and mine are not any different from \nprobably many of my colleagues'. So when I approach this issue, it is \nwith the intent of wanting to do something to reduce underage smoking \nin this country.\n  In order to determine where we are going, it is important to look \nwhere we started. The June 20 agreement was the baseline. It was the \nagreement the attorneys general of this Nation, who deserve a great \ndeal of credit, were able to reach as a result of litigation in the \ncourts of America against the tobacco companies of America. That \nsettlement that was immense in what it did. It was immense in the \nproportions of good that it did. I would like to outline it for a \nmoment to show where we started.\n  That June 20 agreement would have settled the lawsuits brought by all \n40 States. It would have settled them. The States would have been \ncompensated in their State Medicaid programs for funds that they spent \nto treat smokers. That is what the States wanted. It affected literally \nmillions of people.\n  In addition, it would have settled all of the individual lawsuits \naround this country, and people would have been compensated as a result \nof that settlement. In addition, it provided funds to cover the costs \nof implementing and enforcing several public health programs related to \nsolving the problems of underage tobacco use and also to try to find \nways to cure diseases caused by smoking.\n  The tobacco companies, under that agreement, would have paid $368.5 \nbillion, not including the attorneys' fees, over a 25-year period. \nPayments at the rate of $15 billion per year would have continued \nforever.\n  It is important for us to note that for the previous 40 years there \nwas not an individual in this country who ever put a nickel in their \npocket as a result of litigation against tobacco companies. So to say \nthat you get $368 billion-plus to cover the costs of individual suits, \nand to use those moneys for health programs, is monumental in what it \nachieved because no one had ever walked off with a nickel in their \npocket as a result of that litigation. This settlement did that.\n  It also did something that the FDA was never able to do. It said in \nthe agreement that the FDA would regulate tobacco products under the \nFood, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the FDA would have the authority to \nreduce nicotine levels in those products.\n  It also said we are going to set some goals, and the goals are going \nto be that you would have to show a 30-percent decline in cigarette and \nsmokeless tobacco use by minors within 5 years --a 30-percent \nreduction--a 50-percent reduction within 7 years; and a 60-percent \nreduction within 10 years. If not successful, penalties would be \nassessed against the companies of up to $2 billion a year.\n  That had never been done before in the history of this country, where \nyou set absolute targets that companies agreed to and suffered \npenalties if they did not meet those targets, which were substantial.\n  It also said, on advertising and marketing, that tobacco advertising \nwould be banned on billboards, in store promotions, and displays over \nthe Internet. No more Marlboro Man, no more cartoon characters like Joe \nCamel. Tobacco would also be banned from sponsoring all sporting \nevents. No more race car events, no more race track events, no more \nanything from a sporting standpoint at which they would be able to sell \nor advertise. No more clothing, no more baseball caps, no more jackets, \nnone of that would have been allowed under this agreement. Tobacco \ncompanies agreed to that. Companies agreed to the targets; companies \nagreed to the FDA regulation; companies agreed to pay $368.5 billion.\n  Also, the warning labels were stronger than ever. Like, ``Smoking can \nkill you.'' Can you get it any stronger than that? You read that and \nstill want to do it? Is there something loose somewhere in your head? \nThat was going to be part of it.\n  It includes substantial restrictions on youth access to cigarettes; a \nban on cigarettes being sold from vending machines unless they are \nadult-only facilities; minimum standards for retailers. All of that was \nin there.\n  If you had said this was possible to have 5 years ago, they would \nhave looked at you and said, ``No way. You can't get that done.'' But \nthat is all part of the agreement. That is where we started.\n  I would just like to talk about some things that I think are part of \nthis agreement that are not going to be able to be accomplished if we \ndo not have an agreement that includes the companies.\n  Marketing and advertising restrictions under this agreement took \neverything that the FDA wanted to have done and said, it is part of the \nagreement. It bans nontobacco brand names or logos on tobacco products. \nIt bans tobacco brand names, logos and selling messages on nontobacco \nmerchandise, i.e., the T-shirts, baseball caps, jackets; no more of \nthat.\n  It bans the sponsorship, as I said, of all sporting and cultural \nevents in the name, logo or selling message of a tobacco product brand. \nIt restricts tobacco advertising to black text on white background \nonly, like this chart. It requires tobacco advertising to have a \nstatement, ``Nicotine delivery device.'' It bans offers of nontobacco \nitems or gifts based on the proof of purchasing a cigarette product. \nAll gone. That is all what the FDA would like to have done, which, \nincidentally, is being litigated. Companies accepted that as part of \nthat settlement agreement.\n  It also said, we are going to do a lot more than that beyond what FDA \nwanted to do on marketing and advertising. This agreement spelled out \nsome other things. We talked about it; that is, banning all outdoor \ntobacco product advertising, as in stadiums; and for indoor facilities \ndirected outdoors. It bans the human images, again, like the cartoon \ncharacters of Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. No more advertising on \nthe Internet. It limits point-of-sale advertising to black-on-white. \nAll of these things that no one has ever been able to accomplish was \nagreed to by the lawyers, agreed to by the defendants, agreed to by the \ntobacco companies as part of the settlement agreement.\n  In addition to that, we also have youth-access restrictions. \nRetailers are prohibited from selling cigarettes or smokeless tobacco \nto children under 18, and all of the things they have to do under a \nyouth-access restriction program.\n  The point that I make is that all of this is part of their agreement. \nI am concerned that what we have done is to take this agreement, which \nno one would have thought possible 5 years ago, 4 years ago, and have \nturned it into an attempt to make a Christmas tree, to take care of all \nkinds of additional items, increase the amount everywhere you possibly \ncan. I understand that.\n  It is a race to see who can be the toughest on tobacco companies, and \nI understand that, too. My concern is, in our race to be the toughest, \nthat we will lose all of the things that I have just outlined. Because \nI am absolutely convinced, from testimony in the Commerce Committee, \nthat those restrictions on marketing and advertising that are in the \ncurrent legislation, without the companies agreeing to it, is not going \nto be constitutionally upheld by the courts of this country--will not \nbe. We cannot restrict advertising to adults. We cannot restrict \nadvertising of legal products to adults that only incidentally affect \nchildren.\n  The court cases are very, very clear with regard to what we can do \nand cannot do. The first amendment applies, yes, even to tobacco \nproducts, as long as they are legal, and no one is yet saying we will \noutlaw tobacco products like we tried to outlaw alcohol.\n\n  I am concerned that as we increase everything that we are increasing, \nwe lose the company's participation in this effort, and we are going to \nend up with something that may make us feel good temporarily but will \nnot get the job done. An analogy is of the little boy who puts his hand \nin the cookie jar and tries to take all the cookies out of the jar; he \nhas so many in his hand, he can't get anything out.\n  We went from the base of $368.5 billion from the settlement; we \nincreased that with a tax of $1.10, so now it is $574.5 billion. Then \nafter we added to the base payments, we also added the look-back \nprovisions. The look-back was the penalty for companies that didn't \nmeet the targets I talked about. The June 20 agreement had penalties.\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\n The Commerce bill raised the penalty potential to $706 billion. Floor \namendments raised it to $810 billion on the look-back.\n  I think that is questionable constitutionally. I think it is \nquestionable whether you can say to a company, you have to do all kind \nof things, but if you do all those things and still don't meet the \ntargets we will penalize you. I think it is questionable \nconstitutionally for the ability to do that unless the companies agree \nto it. I think what we are doing is penalizing companies without any \nfault on their part. We are saying, do all of these things, but if you \ndon't reach these targets we are going to hit you with $810 billion \nworth of penalties. They can agree to that; but if they don't agree to \nit, I doubt whether it will pass constitutional muster.\n  I think the marketing and advertising restrictions happen to be the \nmost important thing we can do in order to get teens to stop smoking. \nThe $1.10 is not going to do it. Kids pay $100 for a pair of sneakers. \nDo you think $1.10 will get that many to quit smoking when they are \npaying $100 for a pair of tennis shoes? I doubt it. Marketing and \nadvertising restrictions are very important--probably not \nconstitutional.\n  The look-back provisions: Sounds good. Let's make it as high as we \ncan. If the companies don't agree, I question whether that is \nconstitutional.\n  Look what we did when you add it up. The base payments were \nincreased, the look-back provisions, and now the judgments. We used to \nhave a $5 billion annual cap for liability payments. This is for future \nsuits. People say we are giving them all kinds of limitations on \nliability. Individuals can still sue in the future, can still have \ncriminal actions against companies in the future, under the agreement. \nYou can still have punitive damages in the future for companies who do \nwrong, and intentionally do it, but what we have done--we have gone \nfrom adding an increase in base payments, increased the look-back \npenalties, and took the cap off any annual limitations on future \npayments. We have gone from $435 billion to $906.4 billion, and now we \nadd it up and there is no limit. Why would a company agree to all of \nthose marketing and advertising restrictions, agree to all these look-\nback penalties and targets that they have to meet, and get nothing in \nreturn?\n  I am not arguing their case. I made it very clear where I come from \nin the beginning. An agreement, unless it is comprehensive, an \nagreement, unless everybody is involved in it, is an agreement on paper \nthat may make us feel good temporarily but is not an agreement that is \ngoing to get the job done.\n  It is incredibly important that we look at reality and come up with \nsomething that works. I suggest that we take the June 20 agreement as \nthe basis, pass it, go to conference in the House, and we can work out \nsomething that will work. Senator Hatch, I understand, and Senator \nFeinstein and others on our side are working together to take what \npeople thought was impossible and pass it.\n  Let's get out of the cookie jar. Let's get back to reality. Let's do \nsomething that will pass, that will work, and that will make good \nsense.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6135-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6137-S6139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the \ncontinuing lack of commitment by the Republican Leadership to schedule \nfloor debate on legislation to end abuses by health insurance managed \ncare plans. Today, more than 100 groups have sent a letter to Senator \nLott and Speaker Gingrich asking for quick, full and fair floor \nconsideration of this legislation, which is called the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. These groups represent millions of patients, doctors, \nnurses, therapists, and working families.\n  Yet, in a memo sent to all Senators and in recent floor statements, \nit appears that our patient protection legislation--the Patients' Bill \nof Rights--is not even on the Republican Leader's radar screen. It is \nnot on the list of priorities designated by the Republican Leadership \nto be taken up this month, or even this session. I have here a list of \nmore than 20 bills, ranging from regular appropriations bills and \nreauthorization bills to the nuclear waste disposal legislation and a \nconstitutional amendment on flag burning.\n  But, I have yet to see any interest from the Republican Leadership in \ntaking action to ensure that medical decisions are made by treating \nphysicians, and not by insurance company accountants. And I have yet to \nsee any interest from the Republican Leadership in curbing abusive \nactivities by the worst plans and insurance companies that are \ndedicated to their profits, not their patients. Instead, it appears \nthat, by this inaction, the Republican Leadership is interested only in \ndefending the indefensible, the status quo.\n  In addition, the House Republican Leader, Dick Armey, recently lashed \nout at doctors, nurses and other health care professionals by grossly \nmisinterpreting and distorting a provision in the Patients' Bill of \nRights that allows health care professionals to support their patients \nin appeals procedures, and to report concerns about the quality of care \nwithout fear of retaliation. These are reasonable patient-oriented \nprotections. Congressman Armey's misguided effort offends and impugns \nthe character and professionalism of hundreds of thousands of nurses, \ndoctors and patients.\n  In fact, his harsh attack has helped mobilize even more organizations \nto support the bill. Representatives Lois Capps, Carolyn McCarthy and \nEddie Bernice Johnson, who are former nurses, and nurses from \ncommunities around the country have rallied around the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. Today, they have sent a letter to Congressman Armey asking \nfor a meeting on these critically important issues. They are supported, \nin a separate letter, by a number of groups who represent persons with \ndisabilities, mental illness and HIV/AIDS, and other organizations that \nrely regularly on trained and devoted health care professionals.\n  These issues matter a great deal to families across the country. Too \noften today, managed care is mismanaged care. In state after state \nacross the country, patients are paying for these industry abuses with \ntheir lives.\n  Just ask Frances Jennings of Andover, Massachusetts. In November, \n1992, at the age of 57, her husband Jack was diagnosed with mild \nemphysema by his pulmonologist. A few years later, in March, 1997, Mr. \nJennings was hospitalized for a pneumothorax, which can lead to a \ncollapsed lung. His physician, Dr. Newsome, determined that a lung \nreduction procedure would improve Jack's health and overall quality of \nlife.\n  Two months later, in May, 1997, Jack's condition was stable enough \nfor the operation, and he was referred to Dr. Sugerbaker, a top surgeon \nwho specialized in the procedure.\n  But in late May, Jack's insurance plan--U.S. HealthCare--denied his \nreferral to the specialist. Frances and Jack were disappointed that the \nplan refused to authorize the referral, and they requested a referral \nfor consultation with a plan-approved physician. This appointment was \nfinally scheduled for June 12. But, on June 11, the new doctor's office \ncalled Jack to cancel his appointment, stating that the physician no \nlonger accepted patients from the health plan.\n  Immediately following this cancellation, Jack's primary care \nphysician--Dr. Newsome--contacted the health plan to obtain yet another \nreferral. On June 18, a new appointment was confirmed for mid-July, \nfour months after his initial hospitalization.\n  Tragically, Jack Jennings never had the opportunity to benefit from \nthe procedure recommended by his doctor. Jack had been having trouble \nbreathing, despite his continuous use of oxygen, and had been \nhospitalized at the end of June. During this hospitalization, they \ndiscovered a fast growing cancer in his chest. Lung surgery was out of \nthe question, and it was too late for chemotherapy to be effective.\n  Mr. Jennings died on July 10--four days before his long-awaited \nappointment with the specialist. In fact, this appointment would have \nbeen with Dr. Sugarbaker's group, the same physician that U.S. Health \nCare had prevented Jack from seeing in May.\n  This is a clear case where needed health care was unnecessarily \ndelayed, with tragic implications. Timely care could have saved Jack's \nlife. The health plan's inability or unwillingness to provide it cost \nhim his life.\n  Unfortunately, such abuses are far too common in managed care plans\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\ntoday. Congressional offices are flooded with letters and calls from \nconstituents who need assistance. Newspapers tell story after story of \nthe human costs of these abuses.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights will help solve these problems, and \nrestore confidence in the health care system. The Patients' Bill of \nRights is a common sense solution. Nearly all of its provisions were \nrecommended by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Quality in the \nHealth Care Industry. Many are included in the voluntary code of \nconduct for members of the American Association of Health Plans, the \nmanaged care trade association. Some of the provisions are already \nbeing implemented for federal health programs, including Medicare. \nStill others are included in model laws written by the National \nAssociation of Insurance Commissioners. The Senate should act on this \nimportant legislation, and it should act now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I have \nmentioned may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard K. Armey,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Armey: As organizations representing \n     health care consumers, we strongly support efforts to \n     establish meaningful patient and quality protections. We \n     believe that an essential component of that effort is to \n     protect the rights of physicians, nurses and other health \n     care professionals to speak out about quality concerns \n     without fear of retribution. While the rise of managed care \n     has created strong incentives to reduce costs and cut \n     corners, many of those impacts are not evident to patients. \n     Instead, patients need to rely on the ability of health care \n     professionals to provide information and advocate on their \n     behalf.\n       For that reason, we take strong exception to your May 15th \n     ``Dear Colleague'' expressing your opposition to H.R. 3605, \n     the Patient's Bill of Rights. First, we do not believe that \n     patients are served when those who care for them are gagged \n     or handcuffed, unable to speak out because of contractual \n     arrangements or the very real threat of retaliation. This is \n     not just a question of being informed of all available and \n     appropriate treatment options; it is also a question of \n     knowing when patient safety is the risk because of quality \n     problems.\n       Second, we strongly believe disagree with your contentions \n     that nurses and doctors are only seeking financial gain and \n     would use ``good faith'' reporting protections ``to \n     rationalize a financially motivated lie.'' Nurses and doctors \n     across this country have had the courage to challenge managed \n     care and other health industry abuses, often at personal \n     risk. Those abuses will not disappear if the health industry \n     is allowed to continue using retaliatory threats to shield \n     itself from investigation. If nurses, physicians and other \n     health care professionals are afraid to speak out, quality \n     concerns will go unreported and problems will be ignored. If \n     this situation is allowed to continue, patients will be the \n     real losers.\n       Our organizations understand that health care consumers \n     benefit when workers have the ability to report poor quality, \n     including medication errors, problems created by early \n     discharges from hospitals, or fraud and abuse. We hope that \n     you will come to realize the need for such patient \n     protections and reverse your opposition, both to this \n     provision and to the entire Patients' Bill of Rights. \n     Patients know that nurses and doctors have been their \n     advocates. It remains our hope that you and the Republican \n     leadership will demonstrate that you also are advocates in \n     the fight for quality care.\n           Sincerely,\n         AIDS Action Council; The Arc; Bazelon Center for Mental \n           Health Law; Center on Disability and Health; Children \n           and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD); \n           Communications Workers of America; Consumer Federation \n           of America; Consumers Union; Epilepsy Foundation of \n           America; Families USA; Friends Committee on National \n           Legislation; Gay Men's Health Crisis.\n         National Association of People with AIDS; National \n           Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems; \n           National Association of Social Workers; National \n           Council of Senior Citizens; National Multiple Sclerosis \n           Society; National Partnership for Women and Families; \n           Neighbor to Neighbor; Older Women's League; San \n           Francisco AIDS Foundation; Summit Health Coalition; \n           United Cerebral Palsy Association; United Church of \n           Christ, Office for Church in Society.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard K. Armey,\n     Majority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Armey: On behalf of over 200,000 \n     nurses, we would like to express our deep disappointment with \n     Your May 15 ``Dear Colleague'' letter accusing nurses and \n     other health care workers of being willing to lie about \n     quality concerns in order to improve their financial status. \n     Your letter demonstrates a profound lack of awareness of the \n     integrity and concerns of nurses as well as the problems \n     facing patients throughout this country.\n       The major impetus behind the patient protection bill is \n     health care quality. An important part of that is providing \n     patients with accurate information and ensuring that the \n     health care professionals who treat them are able to meet \n     their professional and ethical obligations to advocate on \n     their behalf.\n       Every day, nurses are confronted with situations that place \n     their patients in jeopardy. Insufficient numbers of nurses, \n     the replacement of skilled nurses with untrained personnel, \n     and incentives for early discharge are just a few of the \n     problems. In some facilities, the growing crisis in quality \n     has forced families to hire private duty nurses in order to \n     ensure that their loved ones receive adequate care.\n       Nurses know about patient conditions and are justifiably \n     alarmed. Yet, nurses who speak out risk termination, cutbacks \n     in hours, and other forms of retaliation. The Patients' Bill \n     of rights, H.R. 3605, seeks to protect nurses, doctors and \n     other health care professionals who report quality problems \n     to their employers, public entities and private accreditation \n     organizations. It is an important first step in improving \n     patient conditions.\n       Your opposition to even this limited provision is \n     surprising and disturbing. Your statements that this \n     provision is motivated by financial considerations is an \n     insult to every nurse who struggles to provide the best \n     possible care to her on his patients.\n       As Congress considers legislation to improve health care \n     quality, we would like the opportunity to meet with you to \n     discuss our views and describe the real world situation \n     nurses see every day. We understand that your views as \n     majority Leader are likely to reflect, or at least influence, \n     those of the Republican leadership and the task force \n     appointed by the speaker to make quality care \n     recommendations. Therefore, we would appreciate meeting with \n     those representatives as well. Please contact Cathy Hurwit at \n     (202) 429-5006 if you have any questions or to arrange a \n     meeting.\n           Sincerely,\n         Martha Baker, RN, President SEIU Local 1991, Miami, \n           Florida, Candice Owley, RN, Wisconsin FNHP, President, \n           FNHP Local 5001, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Kathy Sackman, \n           RN, President United Nurses' Association of California \n           Pomona, California, Sandra Alexander, LVN, Vice \n           President, AFSCME Local 839, Council 57, Daly City, \n           California, Norma Amsterdam, RN, Executive Vice \n           President Registered Nurse Division 1199NY/SEIU, New \n           York, New York, David Bailey, LPN, Director AFSCME \n           District #3, Mt.

Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader:\n       The American people want and need the protection of \n     Patients' Bill of Rights. As more and more families face \n     unreasonable barriers to getting necessary health care \n     approved from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and \n     other health insurance plans, it is clear that legislative \n     action is needed. Public opinion surveys repeatedly show that \n     the public's desire for managed\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\n     care consumer protections is both wide and deep.\n       It is more than half a year since the President's Advisory \n     Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health \n     Care Industry proposed, virtually unanimously, the adoption \n     of a Bill of Rights. For many months it has been clear that \n     strong support exists for the enactment of a genuine \n     Patients' Bill of Rights. A number of bills including the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights Act (S. 1890), the patients' Access \n     to Responsible Care Act (S. 644) and others have such support \n     and demonstrate that many members are in favor of bipartisan \n     patient protection legislation.\n       It is therefore both troubling and puzzling that there has \n     been a delay in consideration of this legislation. We believe \n     that it is wrong to obstruct congressional consideration of \n     genuine patient protection legislation. Your colleagues want \n     such legislation. America's families need it. And it is a \n     violation of fundamental fairness, and a disservice to \n     families seeking health care, for you to block a vote on this \n     important legislation.\n       We hope that you will lend your support to efforts to enact \n     genuine managed care patient protection legsilation--not a \n     watered-down version and not one that is combined with \n     ``poison pills.'' We urge you to schedule quickly a full and \n     fair debate on such legislation. Protecting America's \n     families should be your number one priority. We urge you to \n     act now.\n           Sincerely,\n         ACT UP Golden Gate, AIDS Action, AIDS Legal Referral \n           Panel, AIDS Policy Center for Children, Youth and \n           Families, AIDS Treatment News, Alzheimer's Association, \n           American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, \n           American Academy of Neurology, American Academy of \n           Physician Medicine and Rehabilitation, American \n           Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, American \n           Association for Psychosocial Rehabilitation, American \n           Association for Respiratory Care, American Association \n           of Children's Residential Centers, American Association \n           of Pastoral Counselors, American Association of Private \n           Practice Psychiatrists, American Association of \n           University Women, American Association on Mental \n           Retardation, American Board of Examiners in Clinical \n           Social Work, American Cancer Society, American \n           Chiropractic Association, American Counseling \n           Association, American Dental Association, American \n           Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations (AFL-CIO).\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees (AFSCME), American Group Psychotherapy \n           Association, American Lung Association, American \n           Medical Association, American Medical Rehabilitation \n           Providers Association, American Nurses Association, \n           American Occupational Therapy Association, American \n           Protestant Health Alliance, American Psychiatric \n           Association, American Psychiatric Nurses Association, \n           American Psychoanalytic Association, American \n           Psychological Association, American Society for \n           Adolescent Psychiatry, American Society of Plastic and \n           Reconstructive Surgeons;

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have now been on this legislation for 3 \nweeks. We have taken some very important votes, and the bill has been \nsignificantly modified. I think it is time for us to complete our \nbusiness and do so with dispatch. Obviously, if we don't, the \nproponents of the status quo will achieve by delay what they can't with \na majority of votes; and that is, obviously, to kill tobacco \nlegislation that is aimed at saving the lives of over 1 million \nchildren.\n  The bill, as it has been modified, contains measures of enormous \nbenefit to the Nation, including vital antiuse smoking initiatives that \nwill stop or reduce the compelling aspect of this entire legislation--\nthat is, the 3,000 children a day from taking up a habit that will kill \na third of them. There is critical funding for ground-breaking health \nresearch, assistance to our Nation's veterans who suffer from smoking-\nrelated illnesses, a major antidrug effort to attack the serious threat \nthat is posed by illegal drugs, the magnitude and importance of which \nwas described very effectively by the Senator\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\nfrom Georgia, the Senator from Idaho, and others.\n  This legislation contains one of the largest tax decreases ever, and \nit eliminates the marriage penalty for low- and moderate-income \nAmericans and achieves 100 percent deductibility of health insurance \nfor self-employed individuals. It provides the opportunity to settle 36 \npending State cases collectively and in a timely fashion.\n  I argue that those provisions which I just described--research, \nveterans, tax cut, attacking the problem of illegal drugs, and settling \npending legislation--I believe have made this legislation far more \nimportant than it was when it was introduced.\n  We all know that the time is to finish the business and move the \nprocess forward. I think it is also clear for anyone who has turned on \nthe television or listened to the radio or read the newspaper that the \nobjective of the tobacco companies is to kill the legislation. I am \nsure they have come to expect a return on their enormous campaign \ncontributions.\n  If we kill the bill, it doesn't do anything to stop tobacco companies \nfrom marketing to kids, it doesn't do anything to stop the death march \nof teenagers who are taking up a killer habit, and it does nothing to \npromote ground-breaking research on new treatments and cures for these \nterrible diseases, including cancer and heart and lung disease. We will \nnot take a step forward to stop the flow of abuse of illegal drugs, and \nwe will do nothing to assist our Nation's veterans. Inaction doesn't do \nanything to relieve the burden on the Nation's taxpayers, a burden not \nonly in the form of a marriage penalty but in the $50 billion taxpayers \nhave to shell out to treat smoking-related disease, which is almost \n$455 tax per household per year.\n  As I was driving from one place to another last night, I heard \nanother one of these commercials. I do want to again express my \nappreciation to the tobacco companies for raising my name ID all over \nAmerica, especially in the States of Arizona, Iowa, and New Hampshire. \nSo I am very appreciative of almost making my name a household word--\nwhat kind of a household word, obviously, is up to interpretation. But \nI just want to repeat that there are two attacks that the tobacco \ncompanies are making on this legislation. We polled it, and one is that \nit is a ``big tax bill,'' and the other is the issue of ``contraband.'' \nI have addressed those issues before, but I want to point out again and \nagain because the attacks are made again and again. Right now, today, \n$50 billion per year is paid by the taxpayers to treat tobacco-related \nillness. Mr. President, that number is bound to go up. If teenage \nsmoking is going up, then the tax bill is going up.\n\n  Now, you can argue, as some in the tobacco companies have argued, and \nsome of my colleagues particularly on this side of the aisle have \nargued, that there is no way you can reduce teen smoking; that there is \nnothing you can do; that raising the price of price of cigarettes won't \nwork and antismoking campaigns won't work.\n  This tax bill is big and it is getting bigger. Some don't accept--and \nI am not clear why--the view of the Centers for Disease Control that \nteenage smoking is on the rise in America. I think a visit to any local \nhigh school in your State or district might indicate that teenage \nsmoking is on the rise. But, more important, people whose statistics on \nthese public health issues that were unchallenged are now being \nchallenged as to whether teenage smoking is on the rise or not. I think \nthe burden of proof is on those who disagree to prove that these \nstatistics are wrong, given the credibility of the organizations who \nstate that teenage smoking is on the rise. If you accept the fact that \nteenage smoking is on the rise, then over time there would be more \npeople who would require treatment for tobacco-related illnesses. The \ntax bill goes up. It is sort of elemental, but it needs to be said over \nand over again. If we are paying this huge tax bill to treat people as \na result of tobacco-related illness, and it is getting bigger, then it \nseems to me that you have a much bigger tax bill than the costs \nassociated with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are reaching a crucial point, as I \nmentioned earlier in my remarks. We are either going to have to invoke \ncloture and address the germane amendments, which is still part of \ncloture, part of the Senate procedures after the invocation of cloture, \nor we are going to have to move on to other things. At that point, as \nis usual, we assess winners and losers. That is appropriate and fun \nhere, especially inside the beltway. I don't disagree with that \napproach.\n  I think we ought to understand who the losers will be. The losers \nwill be the children of America. They are the only ones who lose. \nAnybody else who loses can probably survive, probably go on to other \nthings, probably lead their well and healthy lives. But I don't believe \nthat the American people will treat us kindly, nor should they, if we \nfail to act on this issue. Is it the most important and compelling \nissue that affects America today? Probably not. Crime is important, \ndrugs are important, education is of critical importance. But do we use \nthat rationale to ignore this problem? Is that appropriate logic? Do we \nsay, well, crime and education are far more important issues to the \nAmerican people than teenage smoking; OK, so therefore ignore it?\n  I don't get that logic, Mr. President. I was reading in some of the \nnewspapers this morning that there are polls out now that have \nconvinced some Americans--and perhaps in the view of some pollsters, a \nmajority of Americans--that this is a ``big tax bill.'' A lot of \nAmericans believe we really aren't going to do anything about kids \nsmoking. Why would anybody be surprised at that? If you spend $100 \nmillion, which is what many--or suppose only $50 million on \nadvertising, it is going to sway American public opinion. But the \neffect of those kinds of advertising campaigns fades. The American \npeople then focus back on the problem because the problem will remain. \nAnd if we do nothing to address it as a body, I think the American \npeople have every reason to be less than pleased at our performance at \naddressing what I believe most Americans correctly view as a very \nimportant issue, which is--obviously, we have stated many times --our \nchildren.\n  So I think it is important that we recognize that we are now ending \nthe third week of considering this legislation, and we are going to \nhave to either file cloture and move forward with a vote on it, and if \nthe vote carries, move to a conclusion. Otherwise, I believe that we \nshould obviously move on to other things, and with the full and certain \nknowledge that the issue is not going away because the problem is not \ngoing away.\n  I understand that my friend from Massachusetts will have an \namendment, and that an agreement has been made with the majority \nleader. I hope we can reach a time agreement on that and then move to \nour side for an amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be sending up an amendment shortly. \nWhen that amendment is called up, I will ask unanimous consent that we \nhave 1\\1/2\\ hours--Mr. President, a small change, a quick change in \nplan, which is not unusual in the last 2\\1/2\\ weeks. We are going to \ndebate this amendment. It is our intention to debate this amendment for \nan hour, at which time there will be a motion to table, and hopefully \nafter we have disposed of this amendment, should we be able to do so, \nwe would proceed to the Faircloth-Sessions-McConnell amendment on \nattorneys' fees.\n  That is the current plan. We hope to be able to proceed with that \nplan. I, therefore, ask that amendment No. 2541 be called up.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2689 to Amendment No. 2437\n\n                   (Purpose: To reduce youth smoking)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I withdraw that request, and I send this \namendment to the desk and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry), for himself, \n     and Mr. Bond, Mr.\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\n     Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Johnson, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Specter, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \n     Graham proposes an amendment numbered 2689 to amendment \n     numbered 2437.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n       (  ) Assistance for Children.--A State shall use not less \n     than 50 percent of the amount described in subsection (b)(2) \n     of section 452 for each fiscal year to carry out activities \n     under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering, together \nwith Senator Bond, Senator Chafee, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Wellstone, Senator Johnson, Senator Boxer, Senator Specter, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Durbin, Senator Graham, and others is a \nbipartisan amendment with considerable support, I believe, both in the \nSenate and outside of the Senate. It would be my hope that we would be \nable to dispose of it rapidly.\n  Over the course of the last couple of weeks we have had some very \ncontentious issues on the floor of the Senate regarding liability, \nregarding look-backs, the marriage penalty, and drugs. I won't suggest \nthat the drug penalty didn't have some focus with respect to children. \nOf course it does.\n  But this is primarily children. This amendment is the primary focus \nof this legislation. This amendment goes to the core effort of how we \nwill best get this legislation to assist in the effort to reduce our \nyoung people from smoking. That is why this amendment, I believe, has \nbroad support. That is why this amendment has been supported by \neditorials across the country. That is why this amendment is supported \nby different advocacy groups on behalf of children across the country.\n  We have been debating for 2\\1/2\\ weeks now about the Nation's first \nopportunity to try to deal comprehensively with tobacco, and, in so \ndoing, comprehensively try to address the question of reducing teenage \nsmoking. This is an amendment that can directly improve the lives of \nour children by adopting a national policy with respect to tobacco and \nour approach to children that is workable, proven, and fair.\n  I believe the reason that a number of colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, from different political ideologies, have come together on this \namendment is for the very simple reason that not only is it focused on \nchildren, not only is it about children, but it comes with a proven \ntrack record of making an impact on choices that children will make.\n  This is, frankly, not about politics. This is certainly not an effort \nto stall the bill. This is an effort to make this bill as \nconstructively as possible a bill that is really going to assist us in \naccomplishing the purposes of the bill; that is, principally to raise a \ngeneration of young people who are able to live up to their potential, \nfree from the grasp of what we know to be a dangerous drug.\n  This is an effort to try to guarantee that those 3,000 children who \nwe have talked about day in and day out who begin smoking won't start \nsmoking, and they won't start smoking because there is an intervention \nin their lives that is significant and meaningful at the time that it \ncounts.\n  Senator Bond, I am pleased to say, comes to this amendment with \nconsiderable experience in how these kinds of efforts work. When he was \nGovernor of Missouri, he started the parents and teachers plan there. \nThere are few people in the Senate who I think speak with as much \nconviction about the difference that it makes for young people when \nadults are adequately involved in their lives and when the kind of \nstructure is available in their lives so that we can make a difference \nwhen it makes the most importance to those children.\n  In my judgment, and I think in Senator Bond's judgment, Senator \nChafee's judgment, Senator Specter, and others who are part of this \nlegislation, this seeks to have an impact at the most direct connected \nlevel with our young people.\n  The legislation on the floor, Mr. President, currently directs that \nabout 40 percent of the funds that are raised through the tobacco \nrevenues be directed directly to the States over 5 years. That is in \nthe billions of dollars. Those billions of dollars that are directed \nstraight back to the States are divided into two groups. Half of that \nmoney is restricted to a certain set of programs in which the States \ncan engage. Half of it is completely unrestricted, as many people in \nthe Senate think it ought to be. That is so that the States can choose, \non their own, what they think might make the most difference with \nrespect to tobacco and how they would like to spend the proceeds in an \neffort that, after all, the States were significantly involved in. The \nStates' attorneys general are the ones who brought the lawsuits and \nhelped significantly to put us in the position to be able to be trying \nto arrive at a comprehensive national settlement. So that is the theory \nbehind which those funds were distributed appropriately to the States.\n\n  However, given what has happened in the last days here on the floor, \nwhere a considerable portion of this legislation has now been diverted \nto a specific tax cut, and another considerable portion of the \nlegislation has seen money directed specifically to the Coast Guard, or \nto the DEA, or to other drug-fighting efforts, it is even more \ncompelling and more appropriate that at this point in time we seek to \nguarantee that some of those available funds are really going to go to \nthe children on those activities that will most impact those children's \nchoices.\n  So we want to assure that at least 50 percent of the restricted \nfunds--not the unrestricted but 50 percent of the already restricted \nfunds--will be spent on those activities that already exist within the \nmenu of what the restricted funds can spend it on. We want to guarantee \nthat it will go to the after-school programs, to the early childhood \ndevelopment, and to the child care that every expert in the field will \ntell you will make an enormous difference to the lives of those \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, let me just share with my colleagues an article that \nappeared in the Washington Times yesterday. It is called ``After-School \nCrime Busing.'' It is an article by Edward Flynn. In fact, he is the \nchief of the Arlington Community Police Department. He writes:\n\n       In fact, the tobacco bill is an opportunity for Congress to \n     take its most powerful step ever to fight crime--by investing \n     half the new revenues in the child care and after-school \n     programs proven to prevent crime and make communities safe.\n\n  This chief of police says to all of us in the Washington Times:\n\n       The tobacco companies are worried about their bottom line. \n     I look at crime's bottom line. Educational child care for \n     young children and after-school programs for school age kids \n     are two of the most powerful weapons to fight crime and \n     protect our kids from getting hooked on tobacco. For example:\n       Studies have shown that denying at-risk toddlers quality \n     educational child care may multiply by up to five times the \n     risk that they will become chronic lawbreakers as adults, and \n     by up to ten times the risk that they will be delinquent at \n     age 16.\n       What's more, as a recent Rand report shows, these programs \n     actually produce savings to Government--primarily from lower \n     criminal justice and social service expenditures-- as much as \n     four times higher than their cost.\n       But today millions of Americans who must work earn less \n     than the cost of quality child care for two kids.\n\n  And then it goes on to discuss the availability of child care.\n  Police Chief Flynn says the following:\n\n       FBI data tells us that violent juvenile crime triples in \n     the hour after the school bell rings, and half occurs between \n     2 p.m. and 8 p.m. The good news: After-school programs can \n     cut crime by as much as 75 percent. And they help kids do \n     better in school, treat adults with respect and resolve \n     conflicts without violence.\n       Unsupervised after-school hours aren't just prime time for \n     juvenile crime. They're also prime time for youngsters to \n     become crime victims and for other threats to children's \n     health like teen sex and substance abuse.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here--substance abuse, tobacco.\n\n       There is good evidence that after school supervision can \n     cut in half the risk that kids will smoke, drink or use \n     drugs.\n       So in addition to their proven anticrime impact, after-\n     school programs--because of the supervision they can offer \n     while parents are at work and their positive effect on kids' \n     values--are powerful antismoking and antidrug programs as \n     well.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \narticle be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, June, 10, 1998]\n\n                       After-School Crime Busting\n\n                          (By Edward A. Flynn)\n\n       If you've been reading the huge ads the big tobacco \n     companies have been running recently, you might think tobacco \n     legislation will cause a new American crime problem by \n     creating a black market in cigarettes.\n       In fact, the tobacco bill is an opportunity for Congress to \n     take its most powerful step ever to fight crime--by investing \n     half the new revenues in the child care and after-school \n     programs proven to prevent crime and make communities safe.\n       The tobacco magnates' claims deflate when you look at the \n     facts:\n       They use grossly inflated projections of cigarette cost \n     increases, as much as three times higher than the $1.25 or so \n     the Treasury Department and most economists agree will be \n     added to the price of cigarettes.\n       They ignore protections in the bill like requiring that \n     each pack of cigarettes carry a serial number so it can be \n     daily traced, that will probably reduce the smuggling that \n     now occurs between states.\n       While there could be some increase to international \n     smuggling, the best way to deal with that is to make sure a \n     bit of tobacco revenues are left available to enforce the new \n     law--not to eliminate tobacco penalties that would reduce \n     smoking, save lives and compensate taxpayers for the billions \n     we've paid to treat health problems caused by smoking.\n       In fact, if Congress allocates at least half of the new \n     revenues to support educational child development and after-\n     school programs, it can dramatically reduce crime, violence \n     and addiction.\n       The tobacco companies are worried about their bottom line. \n     I look at crime's bottom line. Educational child care for \n     young children and after-school programs for school-age kids \n     are two of the most powerful weapons to fight crime and to \n     protect our kids from getting hooked on tobacco. For example:\n       Studies have shown that denying at-risk toddlers quality \n     educational child care may multiply by up to five times the \n     risk that they will become chronic law breakers as adults, \n     and by up to ten times the risk they will be delinquent at \n     age 16.\n       What's more, as a recent Rand report shows, these programs \n     actually produce savings to government--primarily from lower \n     criminal justice and social service expenditures--as much as \n     four times higher than their cost.\n       But today millions of Americans who must work earn less \n     than the cost of quality child care for two kids. Because \n     Head Start and child care block grants don't have the \n     resources to help most of those who need them, parents are \n     forced to leave their children in poor-quality care--little \n     more than ``child storage.'' That damages child development, \n     including kids' ability to get along with others and succeed \n     in school, and ultimately puts your family's safety at risk.\n       FBI data tells us that violent juvenile crime triples in \n     the hour after the school bell rings, and half occurs between \n     2 p.m. and 8 p.m. The good news: After-school programs can \n     cut crime by as much as 75 percent. And they help kids do \n     better in school, treat adults with respect, and resolve \n     conflicts without violence.\n       Unsupervised after-school hours aren't just prime time for \n     juvenile crime. They're also prime time for youngsters to \n     become crime victims, and for other threats to children's \n     health like teen sex and substance abuse. There's good \n     evidence that after-school supervision can cut in half the \n     risk that kids will smoke, drink or use drugs.\n       So in addition to their proven anti-crime impact, after-\n     school programs--because of the supervision they can offer \n     while parents are at work, and their positive effect on kids' \n     values--are powerful anti-smoking and anti-drug programs as \n     well.\n       Law enforcement leaders nationwide--from the Police \n     Executive Research Forum and the Major Cities Chiefs \n     organization to the National District Attorneys Association \n     and Fight Crime: Invest In Kids--have called on legislators \n     this year to provide the funds so communities can ensure all \n     kids access to educational child care and after-school \n     programs while parents are at work.\n       The way to do that--the one-two punch that also fights teen \n     smoking--is by designating at least half of new federal \n     tobacco tax revenues to support child care and after-school \n     programs.\n       This would be one of the most powerful steps Congress has \n     ever taken against crime, and a tremendous investment to help \n     America build a healthy and productive generation for the \n     twenty-first century, decrease long-term government financial \n     burdens like welfare and crime costs, and start saving \n     innocent lives today.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I will discuss some further evidence of why this is so \nvital, but let me emphasize to my colleagues what we are doing in \nrestricting this 50 percent of the already restricted funding is not a \nnew program. We are not creating any new program. We are not creating \nany new bureaucracy. We are not requiring any new line of expenditure. \nWe are using the existing child care development block grant, and we \nemploy a mechanism that both parties, in a bipartisan fashion, have \nalready accepted.\n  This existing, successful bipartisan program already helps States to \ninvest in child care but not adequately. And it already helps this \ninvestment in early childhood development programs but still not \nadequately. I believe all we have to do is look at the example of \nPresident Bush, who signed the block grant into law originally, and the \nbipartisan effort of Senator Hatch and Senator Dodd, who pushed the \nSenate to make this investment a reality.\n  This amendment spells out explicitly the truth that has been implicit \nin all of this debate, that children are at the heart of the debate \nabout tobacco in this country. We know--and we now know it to a \nshocking degree because we have discussed it at length on the Senate \nfloor--through the tobacco companies' own memoranda, the degree to \nwhich tobacco companies targeted young children for decades. We went \nthrough, about a week ago, some of the extraordinary documents that now \nexist as a result of the lawsuits that show the million dollars of \nadvertising that researched ways in which the tobacco companies could \ntarget young children and, the tobacco companies themselves \nacknowledged, ``get them when they're most vulnerable.'' The language \nwas the most shocking and explicit statement of a kind of craven policy \nof how to corrupt young people that you have ever seen. And literally \nthey said, get them hooked early, get them with all these symbols, get \nthem with the advertising, and we won't say anything about the \naftereffects because the pharmacological impact, they said--that is the \nway they politely labeled getting hooked--the pharmacological impact \nwould see to it that the kids continued to buy down the road.\n  So here we have an opportunity to protect our children from exactly \nthat kind of predatory practice that is unacceptable. We believe that \nis the compelling reason why the Senate should adopt this amendment.\n  According to a January 1998 poll, 83 percent of American voters \nsupport what I just said--83 percent of American voters believe that \ntobacco legislation ought to include significant investments in our \nchildren. It is a bipartisan consensus in this country that we ought to \ndo that.\n  Two-thirds of the Republicans who were polled by Lake, Sosin and \nAssociates strongly agreed that the funds from the tobacco bill ought \nto be invested in child care and other childhood development programs \nthat will make a difference as to whether or not those kids would then \npick up smoking.\n  In the Philadelphia Inquirer, the editorial page recently praised \nthis amendment, saying, ``Using tobacco settlement proceeds for child \ncare meshes with the goal of cutting the health toll of smoking and \ncould produce benefits that go far beyond that.''\n  The Deseret News in Salt Lake City, UT, recognized that support for \nchild care programs ``saves billions of tax dollars down the road.'' \nThe Syracuse Herald-Journal on its editorial page, in urging the Senate \nto pass this amendment, said, ``Let the tobacco bill do some good.'' \nThe editors of that newspaper reminded us that ``there are good reasons \nwhy tobacco revenues should go into child care. Child care and \ndevelopment block grant program, put in place during the Bush \nadministration, simply doesn't have enough of a budget to fulfill the \nneeds of working families--it wouldn't even if $20 billion is allotted. \nBut it would be a start.'' And that is what these voices are telling \nus--that we ought to make the start.\n\n  There is, in addition to broad editorial support, Mr. President, the \ncoalition of more than 100 national, State, and local organizations, \ncalled Child Care Now, fighting for this amendment because they \nrecognize the connection between kids and smoking. And in that \ncoalition you will find the National Council of Churches of Christ in \nthe USA, the YWCA of the USA. I have a letter that I received from the \nchildren and parents of Camp Fire Boys and Girls, 700,000 members \nstrong, asking each Senator to support this amendment because, \n``Children engaged in constructive after-school activities are less \nlikely to smoke.'' These are mothers and fathers of working families,\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\nand they understand the tremendous pressures and temptations of \nsmoking, and they have asked each and every Senator to support the \nnotion that that is where a significant component of this revenue ought \nto go, to give their kids a fighting chance.\n  This amendment responds directly to the plea of parents who \ndesperately seek help in the area of child care and early childhood \ndevelopment to help keep their kids away from the cigarettes that they \nknow they are being exposed to during the hours when, because they are \nworking, because they are compelled to be away from the home, and \nbecause they do not have enough money to provide adequate support \notherwise, their kids are being exposed. And we have an opportunity \nhere to help them do that.\n  Scientific research at the University of Southern California and the \nSchool of Public Health at the University of Illinois shows that 13-\nyear-olds who are left home alone after school or during the day are \nsignificantly more likely to smoke cigarettes than children who \nparticipate in structured after-school activities. But today, only one-\nthird of inner-city schools offer those programs, and, not \ncoincidentally, it is in those very inner cities where youth smoking \nrates are now rising and going the highest.\n  The National Women's Law Center, committed to protecting the rights \nof women, but also committed to the economic security of low-income \nwomen, wrote to Senator Bond and to me in favor of this bill, because \nthey recognize that under the child care development block grant today \nonly 1 out of 10 eligible children in a low-income working family \ncurrently gets the child care assistance they need.\n  So if we are intent on reducing the number of kids who are smoking, \nand if we are really worried that smoking among high school seniors is \nat a 19-year high, and we are really worried about what the Senator \nfrom Georgia said when he came to the floor and talked about the drug \nproblem, the marijuana increase among young people, then it is critical \nwe focus on the 3 million young children in this country who are \neligible but do not get it. We need to leverage the capacity of every \nState and local community to be able to take kids off the street \ncorners, where they too often cave in to peer pressure and smoke each \nday, and put them instead into a structured environment that brightens \ntheir future, not one that jeopardizes it.\n  So if we are serious about reducing youth smoking, it is imperative \nthat we engage now in this effort to cultivate a whole generation of \nyoung people who have the capacity to make the right decisions.\n  I have a letter from Dr. T. Berry Brazelton of the Harvard Medical \nSchool. Many people in America know him well, personally, and think of \nhim as America's pediatrician. I would like to point out that he wrote, \nalong with over 50 other doctors, public health officials and child \ndevelopment experts, to Senators about the early child development \ncomponent of sound decisionmaking for our children. Among those who \njoined Dr. Brazelton were Julius Richmond, former Surgeon General of \nthe United States, and the Chairman of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins \nUniversity School of Medicine, and Elizabeth McAnarney, the Chairwoman \nof the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Rochester. They \ntell all of us that scientific study after scientific study shows that \nthe brain development in those first years of life is the most \nimportant--I quote from the letter of Dr. Brazelton:\n\n       . . . for laying the foundation for adequate development, \n     which results in self-confidence, smart decisionmaking, and \n     the ability to later resist destructive habits like smoking.\n\n  So these aren't ideas that have been cooked up on a political basis \nsomehow. These are the foremost experts in the field. They are telling \nus if we want to raise a generation of children who are able to make \nthese decisions, who will not fall prey to the lure of tobacco, it is \nvital that we invest in their capacity to do so.\n  Again, I return to their letter, and read directly from it:\n\n       We urge Congress to craft a comprehensive program for \n     reducing teen smoking--and to ensure that such an effort \n     includes an essential investment in early childhood \n     development and after-school programs. You can support a down \n     payment on this investment by voting for the Kerry-Bond \n     amendment.\n\n  I think Dr. Brazelton said it best in a recent editorial when he \nsaid--simply--\n\n       As a prescription for preventing teen smoking, I'd say that \n     early childhood development and child care programs are just \n     what the doctor ordered.\n\n  We also know from police officers and prosecutors like Ed Flynn, \nChief of Police in Arlington, Virginia, who are leading a fight to \ninvest tobacco money in child care. Chief Flynn has said that child \ncare and after school programs ``help kids learn the valuable skills to \nbecome responsible adults.'' An entire organization led by police, \nprosecutors, and crime victims is pushing the Senate to pass this \namendment because:\n\n       The hours from 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. are not only the peak \n     hours for juvenile crime, teen sex and teen experimentation \n     with drugs, but also the hours when teens are most likely to \n     get hooked on tobacco. After-school programs are not only our \n     best protection against juvenile crime, but also may be the \n     most powerful anti-smoking programs available. Being \n     unsupervised in the afternoon doubles the risk that kids will \n     smoke, drink, or use drugs.\n\n  It is those individuals closest to our children who know this is the \nright way to deal with youth smoking.\n  This is an amendment every Senator ought to support.\n  I want to especially thank Senator McCain for supporting this \namendment. In view of the pressure on Senator McCain, the Senator's \nsupport means a lot to me. I think I can speak for Senator Bond when I \nsay we are honored to have John McCain by our side on this fight. I \nalso want to thank Senators Chafee, Campbell, and Specter for \ncosponsoring this amendment.\n\n  I think it proves that this is an amendment which is based not on \nRepublican ideas or Democrat ideas, but simply on good ideas in touch \nwith the mainstream view in this country.\n  Under the Kerry-Bond amendment states will enjoy the flexibility of \nthe child care development block grant. The truth is we would simply be \narticulating once and for all the important standard which the public \nhealth community and most Governors have already endorsed: that child \ncare and early childhood development are vital tools in reducing the \nrates of children smoking in this country. We then leave it to the \nleadership at the state and local level to meet that standard, to \ndesign the programs that meet the local needs in places as different \nand diverse as Illinois, where Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican, is \nexperimenting with child care, and Rhode Island, where Gov. Almond has \nmade after school care an integral part of preparing children in his \nstate for the next century.\n  The Kerry-Bond amendment empowers communities to find their own way \nof saving a new generation from smoking. We know how after school \nprograms like Girls Inc. of Worcester, MA have effectively incorporated \nanti-smoking curriculum designed to teach their participants about the \ndangers of tobacco and equip them with the values to resist the peer \npressure to smoke. I have met with the case workers from Central, MA \nwho tell you that the ``Home Instruction Program for Preschool \nYoungsters'' helps parents and teachers join in community \npartnerships to raise healthier kids. But in all these communities and \naround the country you will find that there are waiting lists for the \nservices--for the programs which teach kids about responsible decision-\nmaking, for the anti-smoking programs and the programs which take kids \noff the streets and give them structure--and the demand far exceeds our \ncapacity to serve. At the Castle Square Early Child Development Center \nin Boston, there were 67 kids in the program and 500 on the waiting \nlist. I believe it's a moral dilemma that you have 500 children there \nwho aren't receiving the structure they need to resist smoking, that \ntoday we have limited ourselves to saving just 67 of those kids. The \nKerry-Bond amendment can change that, by ensuring that half of the \nrestricted funds would go to child care programs which can play such an \nimportant role in reducing youth smoking.\n\n  I return to the original premise of this debate, the reason we are \nhere on the floor of the Senate debating a bill that a few years ago \nwould have been considered too hot to handle. We are all fortunate to \nhave Republicans like Senator Bond here in the Senate who believe it is \nwrong to ignore our children in this tobacco debate. I want to\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\nespecially thank him for his leadership in this discussion, for his \ninitiative in pushing to include children in our legislation. Senator \nBond has helped set a tone of bipartisan cooperation and along with \nSenator McCain I think he has laid the benchmark for fairness. Kit Bond \nand I believe this Senate can find room in fair and workable tobacco \nlegislation to put hundreds of thousands of children on the road to \ngood health and responsible decisionmaking. In truth I wonder if we can \nreally believe that fair tobacco legislation could ignore the kids who \nbrought us here today as one unified Senate. Let us prove once again \nthat the moral center can hold in this debate and let us join together \nin passing the Kerry-Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I particularly thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Massachusetts for yielding to me. I am very pleased to \njoin with him in offering this critically important amendment.\n  Late last year, Senator Kerry and I introduced legislation, which is \nbipartisan legislation aimed at providing support to help families give \ntheir children the kind of encouragement, love, early training and a \nhealthy environment they need to develop their social and intellectual \ncapacities. I have had the opportunity in my years both as Governor and \nin the Senate to work with children and work in the development of \nchildren. I am convinced that many of society's problems today--the \nhigh school dropout rate, drug and tobacco use, juvenile crime, even \nadult crime--can all be linked to inadequate child care and early \nchildhood development opportunities.\n  Let me just tell you a brief story about the first really broad-based \nearly childhood development program that we put into effect in \nMissouri. Our Parents As Teachers Program was designed to provide \nassistance through educating and informing and giving helpful advice to \nparents of children from birth to 3 years old--how they could relate to \nthe children, how they could establish better contact with the \nchildren, how they could excite the child's curiosity, to get involved \nwith reading and learning. I was having a difficult time getting it \nthrough the Missouri legislature. I recommended it in 1981 and 1982 and \n1983, and someone always had a reason to vote against it. I never got \nit through.\n  Finally, in my last year as Governor I said we are going to make an \nall-out push because this program is making a difference. We were \nseeing in the pilot projects in four school districts that children \nwhose parents had been in Parents As Teachers came to school ready to \nlearn. Their parents had taken responsibility. The parents were \ninvolved in their education. They had developed the pattern of \ninvolvement. The program itself identified potential learning \ndisabilities or physical disabilities early on, which could be best \ncorrected at those early ages.\n  I told everybody I was going to focus attention on early childhood \ndevelopment. Without my direct suggestion or intervention, the Director \nof Corrections, the Missouri Department of Corrections, the man who \nmanaged all of the prisons and the parole and probation efforts in \nMissouri, Dr. Leroy Black, on his own, came before the committee that \nwas hearing testimony on Parents As Teachers. We had just gone on a \nmajor prison-building exercise in Missouri. In that 4 years of my \nsecond term we had increased the prison spaces 88 percent. People were \nwondering whether we could ever catch up with the prison population.\n  He came before that committee with a very simple, straightforward \nmessage. He said if we want to cut down on the need to keep building \nprisons in the future, we are going to have to deal with early \nchildhood development. He said the failures in early education, the \nfailures of parental responsibility, the failures of the parents to be \ninvolved--for some care giver to make sure these children were getting \nan education, being taught responsibility--is the greatest cause of the \nincrease in crime and the increase in prison population.\n  He was successful. He was a great help in getting this program \nestablished on a Statewide basis. Yes, as Senator Kerry mentioned, we \nnow have studies based on this program and others that show a child's \nsocial and intellectual development is deeply rooted in the early \ninteraction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years \nand the scientific research shows that infant brain development occurs \nmuch more rapidly than previously thought.\n\n  We used to think of those cute little infants, birth to 3 years old, \nas being cuddly, wonderful things without much going on. But brains are \ndeveloping--50 percent of a child's mature learning capabilities are \ndeveloped by the age of 3. They are in a very rapid mode of \ndevelopment.\n  Anybody who has tried to teach a child to speak two languages instead \nof one language will find a very small child--you think they would \nlearn English slowly--but they will learn another language, too, just \nas quickly, where an adult is having a great deal of difficulty trying \nto learn another language. They are in a rapid mode where they can \naccept new inputs and they are learning rapidly.\n  The role parents and adults play is critical. That is when the \npatterns are established for the future learning of future \nresponsibility of the children. I had long said the first 3 years of \nlife was the greatest learning experience for a child. I found when our \nson Sam was born, that the first 3 years of his life were the fastest \nlearning experience in my life. I learned a lot more in those 3 years \nthan I had learned in many years as Governor and various offices that I \nhad held.\n  Learning about a child and learning how important that education is, \nis quite an experience. Frankly, some of the people who attacked our \nearly childhood development program, Parents As Teachers, were accusing \nit of being subversive. They thought it was subversive because we were \nencouraging government to come in and take over the raising of \nchildren. That is not the purpose of the program. We provided the \nparents the tools to be the first educators of the children.\n  Guess what happened. It was subversive in that it hooked the parents \ninto the child's development and well-being and welfare and education. \nWhen we are talking about discouraging children from using tobacco, and \nas we did in the amendment adopted this week, from using drugs, from \nusing alcohol, parental responsibility is a vitally important part of \nthat program.\n  We believe establishing responsibility can best occur with assistance \nthrough early childhood development. Parental responsibility is very \nimportant. Yet, there are times when parents need some help. That is \nwhat the other part of this bill does. Parents today face a variety of \nstresses that were unheard of a generation ago. Many families with \nchildren rely on more than one paycheck. That doesn't necessarily mean \ntwo 9-to-5 paychecks. Many families are working tag-team shifts or \npart-time only, or own home-based businesses so one parent can always \nbe with the children. The challenges are tremendous and the challenges \nare not going to get any easier.\n  As we all know, the most dangerous time of the day when children \nengage in harmful activities, such as tobacco or drug use or crime, is \nbetween the hours after school and before parents get home from work.\n  In an average week in America, over 5 million children under the age \nof 13 come home to an empty house. These are the kids who are most \nvulnerable and who engage in activities which may threaten their \nfuture.\n  Providing increased funding for early childhood development and \nconstructive after-school activities will serve as a powerful deterrent \nto these damaging behaviors.\n  Ultimately, however, it is important to remember that the likelihood \nof a child growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is most \nimpacted by his or her parents and family. While government cannot and \nshould not become a substitute for parents and family, we can help them \nbecome stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet every day \nchallenges.\n  The Kerry-Bond amendment achieves that goal.\n  This amendment will lay the foundation needed to realize meaningful \nreductions in tobacco and drug use, juvenile crime, and other social \nills which plague our society.\n  Again, prevention is the key. Investing in early childhood \ndevelopment initiatives and before and after school activities is an \nimportant weapon in our\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\nfight against our Nation's unhealthy and life-threatening activities.\n  The future well-being of our children is too important for us to \nbreak continually along partisan lines. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nthis amendment, and I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts for his hard work and dedication to this cause.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Bingaman \nand Senator Kohl be added as cosponsors to the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment 2689, \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I think this is a very fine amendment. I \nwant to commend our colleagues, Senator Kerry and Senator Bond, for \noffering this amendment. I strongly support it.\n  This amendment is designed to invest in the well-being of our \nchildren in this country. It is a measure that ensures that the \nchildren of our Nation will get the right start for a far brighter \ntomorrow.\n  As our colleagues have already discussed, the amendment will earmark \n50 percent of the Federal share of the tobacco funds going to the \nStates for child care. Specifically, Mr. President, these funds will be \nused to increase our investment in child care and development block \ngrants--a piece of legislation we were very proud to offer with my good \nfriend from Utah, Senator Hatch, some 8 years ago.\n  The idea, Mr. President, is not to create here a new Federal child \ncare program, but rather to do a better job with the well-established \nprogram that enjoys wide support from our States and Governors, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, across this Nation.\n  The child care and development block grant was created in 1990, as a \npartnership between the States and the Federal Government, to improve \nthe availability and affordability and quality of child care. The block \ngrant is a very efficient and popular way of providing States with \nsorely needed child care funds, and the States enjoy it. The reason is \nbecause it is so flexible. Perhaps most important, this is why parents \nalso support the program.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in some cases, raised \nconcerns during the child care debates that somehow our intent with \nthis child care legislation is to limit the ability of parents to \nchoose how their children would be cared for, that somehow we would \nlike to see the Federal Government deciding how to raise them. Of \ncourse, Mr. President, this rhetoric could not be further from the \ntruth.\n  The child care and development block grant is predicated upon \nparental choice. With assistance from the block grant, parents can \nchoose to enroll their children in church-based care, they can choose \nto have their children cared for by a neighbor down the street, or they \ncan choose to have a family member care for their child. If they wish, \nthey can choose to enroll their child in a child development center. \nBut the benefits of this program are offered to far too few families. \nIt is terribly underfunded. Only 1 out of 10 children in America who \nare eligible for child care assistance receives it. That still leaves \nfar too many families without the help they need in child care. Full \nday care can easily cost $4,000 to $10,000 per child per year, which is \nequal to what some families pay for college tuition plus room and board \nin a public university in America.\n  I know concerns have been raised and are apt to be raised about \ngiving any direction to the States in their use of these funds. I would \nlike to remind our colleagues that half of the tobacco funds that would \ngo to the States are unrestricted. These are the funds that reimburse \nStates for their tobacco-related Medicaid expenses. Many States do with \nthis money what they will, and they should be able to do so. However, \nsince the other half of the funds to the States represents the Federal \ncontribution, we feel we should have something to say about how those \ndollars are spent.\n  As this bill is currently written, the Federal share of the money \nearmarked for States would be restricted to a list of six programs. \nWhile child care is on the list, there is no guarantee that any of the \nfunds would be used for that care. There is no guarantee that child \ncare would get a single dime of these dollars. I think that would be \nunfortunate, Mr. President. We have talked a lot about child care, \nabout caring for children during this debate on tobacco. We have talked \na lot over the past weeks about things that, frankly, have little or \nnothing to do with the well-being of children in this country. \nAffordable, accessible, high-quality child care is about the well-being \nof children. The tobacco industry has preyed on America's children --\nall of us agree on that--stunting their growth and stealing their \nfutures. This amendment is about turning the tide and making an \ninvestment in children and their families from the very beginning.\n\n  Mr. President, experts tell us that the first 3 years of the life of \na child are critical to brain development and to laying the ground for \nself-confidence--a sound foundation for a healthy future. Investing \nearly in childhood development is the best prevention against a whole \nhost of problems, not the least of which is teenage smoking. Experts, \nagain, including Fight Crime, Invest in Kids, an organization \nrepresenting law enforcement officials from around the country, tell us \ntime and time again that quality after-school activities are extremely \nimportant to preventing problem behaviors and criminal activity. \nScientific studies support their claims that nearly 5 million children \nleft\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\nhome alone in the afternoon are much more likely to engage in at-risk \nbehavior, from smoking to drugs and sex than their peers who are \nengaged in stimulating, productive activities.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has an opportunity in the next few hours to \nensure that we make a concrete commitment to investing in the health \nand safety of America's children. Setting aside a specified percentage \nof funds--funds that we have already agreed to spend for the child care \nneeds in this country--says to the American public that we will provide \nfor a solid foundation for the future good health of America's \nchildren. Many of my colleagues know that I have introduced a \ncomprehensive child care bill along with 26 other colleagues, including \nthe sponsor of this amendment. This amendment is an important first \nstep that I think we can take in making good and fulfilling the promise \nof that bill. Is this all we need to do? Obviously not, but it is a \ngood beginning.\n  I hope that our colleagues, in considering this amendment offered by \nSenators Kerry and Bond, in a bipartisan way, would find a way to \nsupport expanding this block grant. It doesn't create any new programs. \nIt is designed to give maximum flexibility to families across this \ncountry. It can make a huge difference for those parents, who don't \nhave the choice about whether or not to be at home, to be able to \nafford that needed child care.\n  That $10,000, as I said a moment ago, is equivalent to the cost of a \nhigher education and room and board. It is expensive. Child care is \nvery expensive. If we can assist in the cost of that and relieve the \nfinancial burden and the tremendous anxiety the parents feel about \nwondering where their child is as they must work, then, in addition to \ndoing something about reducing smoking among young people in this bill, \nthat will be amplified by providing assistance to these families and \nseeing to it that their child care needs are going to be met, or at \nleast it will take a significant step in meeting those needs. I commend \nmy colleagues for offering this amendment and urge colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Dodd from \nConnecticut, and commend him, Senator Bond, and Senator Kerry for \noffering this very important amendment to this very important bill. I \nwant to say a few words, if I could, as a supporter.\n  The issue that has been most contentious about this tobacco \nlegislation has been how do we really stop people--children, adults and \nyoung people--from smoking? We have debated that. Many of us feel like \nthe best way, the surest way to stop people from smoking, from using a \ndangerous product that has now been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt \nto be dangerous, is to raise the price of a pack of cigarettes high \nenough to discourage as many young people as possible from even \nstarting to smoke and, frankly, discourage adults, who most certainly \nhave a choice, from continuing a habit. It is a purposeful levy. If we \ncould stop people from smoking by not raising the price of a pack of \ncigarettes, perhaps we should consider that. But I am convinced, as \nmany Members of this Chamber are, that this is the best and most \neffective way, along with counteradvertising, advertising restrictions, \nand other restrictions, which, in fact, will be effective.\n\n  The question becomes, what do we do with the proceeds generated? \nBecause it is going to fall regressively, in a sense, on poorer people, \nI think we should try to get the money back to those who are going to \npay the tax. We can do that in a number of ways. One way is to target a \ngeneral tax relief, which, as this bill moves through, I hope we can \ndo. But another way that my colleagues have come up with is targeting \nsome of this money back to hard-working American families--in most \ninstances, with both parents working full time and, in some instances, \nthere is only one parent--to help them with the great costs they are \nincurring and the great challenge that they have, which is how to be \ngood workers and how to be good parents. It is incumbent upon us to try \nto get some of this money back to these families that are going to pay \nthis tax and their children for one reason: Because children were \ntargeted by the industry. There is no question about it. They were \ntargeted by the industry. In my opinion, they should benefit from the \nproceeds generated in this tobacco settlement. To leave the children \nout and not specifically designate a portion for them, even though they \nare going to get some benefit from their research that is done, would \nbe a shame. It still gives States discretion about how they would like \nto spend a part of the money coming in. But it says that we want you to \nuse at least 50 percent of your restricted funds to support child \ninitiatives, child care particularly, and to improve the quality of \nchild care. Because children were targeted, they should benefit. \nBecause families who are paying the tax--poor families primarily, \nlower-income families--this amendment targets this benefit to them and \nallows them to get accessible, affordable, and quality child care.\n\n  Let me say one other thing that in some way angers me as a working \nmom myself. Some people would like to maybe make judgments about \nfamilies that choose to work, or parents outside of the home, or inside \nof the home. I would like to say maybe ideally it would be great for \nevery child in America to have two parents, and perhaps it would be \nideal if one of those parents would stay home full time. But this is \nnot an ideal world; this is a world where families have to make tough \nchoices.\n  Frankly, we have an economy now in America that depends on almost \nevery able-bodied person over 18 to work. If people haven't noticed, \nthere is a worker shortage in America for skilled work, for talented \nwork. Our businesses can't survive unless there are workers working. So \nwe have to do both. We have to work outside of the home. We have to be \ngood parents to our children, and one way is to have the Government \nhelp parents who are doing everything that they can do. One way we can \ndo that is to help them, be a partner with them, to find good-quality \nchild care, because investing in our children is the best thing we can \ndo to help our families, to help our country, to keep our economy \nstrong, and do what is right with the proceeds of this tobacco bill.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues. I think this has great bipartisan \nsupport. It would be a shame to pass this bill without this amendment \non it and to fall down in our commitment to the children and working \nfamilies of our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, good afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6139-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6146-S6149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENGAGING CHINA IN THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to address the upcoming \nsummit in China and to stress the importance of this visit to U.S.-\nChina relations.\n  Mr. President, as the age old adage says, ``A journey of a thousand \nmiles begins with a single step.'' We should begin this journey with \nthe first step--by defining our goals in Asia, and, more directly, in \nChina.\n  America's goals are simple: we want peace; we want prosperity and \nfair trade; and we want a decent world to live in.\n  How do we achieve these goals? First, by guaranteeing peace and \nstability in the Pacific. That means preserving our permanent military \npresence in Asia. Remaining committed to our alliances with Japan, \nKorea and Southeast Asia. Defining our interests clearly to China.\n  But it also means preventing unnecessary conflicts. And to do that we \nmust find common ground. Remain engaged. Preserve and foster our \nworking relationship with China. We must build and strengthen our \ndiplomatic ties.\n  In many ways China remains a challenge--a great wall in and of \nitself. Its intransigence in many areas of trade, human rights and arms \nproliferation presents a clear challenge for U.S. policy. Whether the \ntopic is pirated software or the incarceration of political\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\nprisoners, China has often proved unwilling to adopt practices that the \nrest of the world perceives as reasonable and just. And when China \nbehaves contrary to accepted norms, or to the rule of law, we must not \nlook the other way.\n  But we also must not fail to recognize China's importance to the \nUnited States and the rest of the world. And to engage China, we must \nunderstand China. This is a vast and old nation. When Kublai Khan \nconquered southern China in 1279, he presided over the largest empire \nthe world had ever seen. And at that time the Chinese empire was \nalready 1,500 years old, and Chinese history 2,500 years old. Today's \nPeople's Republic of China is the world's most populous nation, \naccounting for one-fifth of humanity; a nuclear power; and one of the \nworld's fastest-growing economies.\n  It is also a diverse nation. China is a mosaic of language, religion \nand culture. The majority of its 1.2 billion population are Han. The \nremaining 70 million people belong to 55 different ethnic minorities. \nChina has eight major languages and 600 dialects. Yet we often think of \nChina as one mind, one voice. China has many voices.\n  Those who have not traveled to China may find it hard to truly grasp \nthe differences in lifestyles. How many Americans today live without a \ntelephone? Many have two or more. In China, one in four homes has \ntelecommunications capability. And about six out of ten have a radio.\n  The average per-capita income in China is estimated at $360 to $700. \nYet it is possible that in the next century China will become the \nworld's largest economy. At the same time, it will continue to face \nenormous problems of unemployment, overpopulation, a low level of \neducation, and poverty.\n  Now is the time for the United States to help bring China into the \n21st Century. Now is the time to engage China with great expectations. \nIn the areas of weapons proliferation, Most Favored Nation Trading \nstatus and the World Trade Organization. And with human rights and the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Albright recently stated that ``we have an \nabiding political interest in a region whose cooperation we seek in \nresponding to the new global threats of proliferation, terrorism, \nillegal narcotics, and the degradation of our environment. And we have \nan abiding interest as Americans in supporting democracy and respect \nfor human rights in this, the most populous region of the world.''\n  Our relationship with China will be essential to all these interests. \nAnd we must begin with peace and security, because our diplomatic and \nsecurity interests in China are critical to maintaining a peaceful and \nstrategic relationship in Asia, as recent events in the Taiwan Strait, \nSouth Asia and the Korean Peninsula show.\n  China regards our Taiwan policy as the most critical and sensitive \nissue in this relationship. So while we must treat Taiwan policy with \ngreat care, our historic policy, based on commitments to Taiwan's \nsecurity through the Taiwan Relations Act, and our commitments to \nacknowledge China's view of sovereignty under our three Joint \nCommuniques, remains sound today. And the events of the past few years \nshow that. China has made its point about how seriously it views \nindependence in the crisis of 1996; and former Secretary Perry made our \npoint about Chinese threats of military force.\n  Today the situation has calmed. Taiwan and China are beginning to \ntalk once again. And we can, with caution and foresight from all three \nsides, expect if not reconciliation, at least stability in the Taiwan \nStrait. We need make no major changes, and in particular should avoid \ndeals at Taiwan's expense as relations with China improve.\n\n  For us, the division of the Korean Peninsula, and the continuing \nthreat posed by the 1.2-million-man North Korean Army just above the \ndemilitarized zone, is equally sensitive. In fact, this is the only \nissue that ever brought the U.S. and China to war\n  And to maintain the peace, we need a cooperative working relationship \nwith China; and on this issue we have it. China is doing precisely what \nwe hope it will do. It offers the North Koreans advice that only a one-\ntime ally can give. It provides food aid. And it does what it can to \nmove the four-party talks ahead, even if that is limited to figuring \nout seating and handshake arrangements that the two Koreas will accept.\n  Then let us look to the spread of nuclear weapons in South Asia. This \nhas created an immense danger for the world of a breakdown in the Non-\nProliferation Treaty; an immediate danger of war between India and \nPakistan; and a new strategic question for China, as the Indian \ngovernment has indicated that its decision to test nuclear weapons was \ndue to fears about China.\n  China's potential as a positive mediator in South Asia cannot be \nunderestimated. I remain concerned that China may have contributed to \nthe arms race by aiding Pakistan in its development of a nuclear \ndevice. It is incumbent on all nations to prevent the spread of nuclear \nweapons, and we must hold China to its signed commitments on this \nissue. Just as China worked constructively to avert further spread of \nthe recent Asian currency crisis, so too must it be expected to work \ntowards preventing the further proliferation nuclear arms in Asia.\n  Mr. President, before I speak about the issue of China and trade, let \nme say a few words regarding the recent flap over satellite launches.\n  First, the concept of allowing China to launch American satellites is \nsound. It can be done without transferring technology useful for ICBMs. \nAnd to suggest that we would willingly facilitate the process of other \ncountries launching ICBMs does not make any sense.\n  However, the controversy over this question indicates the large \nemerging question of a proper approach to the rapid advance of \ntechnology from military to commercial fields. This is the basic \nquestion not only in satellite launches but in software encryption, \ntechnology exports and many other issues. Our country needs a strategic \napproach to the entire question, and the time to begin is now. With \nrespect to the specific question of satellite launches, if oversight \nwas weak, we should strengthen our policy. If any American companies \nbroke the law they should be punished. But derailing potential progress \nin U.S.-China relations does not improve the situation one iota.\n  The second thing we need is a fair, mutually beneficial economic \nrelationship. And that begins with the most urgent question--the Asian \nfinancial crisis.\n  I think China's performance--along with that of the Hong Kong S.A.R. \ngovernment--during the Asian financial crisis has been impressive. With \nSoutheast Asia's currencies suffering, China's competing exports are \nunder intense pressure. A devaluation of the yuan could ease life for \nmany Chinese businesses. But it would start a new panic in the currency \nmarket, just as Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and other Asian \nnations are beginning to rebuild from last year's collapse. Up to now, \nChina and Hong Kong have remained committed to avoid devaluations. And \nif Asia recovers this year, it will be in no small part because of \nChina and Hong Kong.\n  We also need a stable bilateral trade relationship. And the \nfoundation for this relationship is Most Favored Nation Status.\n  President Clinton has just put forth his annual request for renewal \nof Most Favored Nation status for the Republic of China. Not \nsurprisingly, this request has been greeted with suggestions that the \nUnited States should use MFN as a tool. As a weapon, to convince China \ninto making dramatic reforms. It is not. It is the foundation of \ncommercial relations and should be left alone.\n  As Winston Churchill once said: ``A pessimist sees the difficulty in \nevery opportunity. An optimist sees the opportunity in every \ndifficulty.'' Those are good words to live by. I stand here today \nbecause I believe that we should use MFN as our way of helping China \naddress its internal reforms while preparing for its accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  I do not believe that an open trade policy means Americans should be \nindifferent to human rights abuses in China. The United States should \ntake a strong stand against serious infractions against workers, \ndissidents, women and children. But restrictions, such as the denial of \nMFN trading status or the use of sanctions that hurt\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\nChinese people and fail to directly punish the abusers of power, do \nlittle to encourage social reconstruction on the mainland.\n  In fact we should do the opposite. We should give China unconditional \nMFN trading status, upon China's accession to the World Trade \nOrganization. I have long promoted this process. And I will do so again \nas we prepare for this historic summit. The extension of permanent MFN \nstatus to China would benefit both of our countries. It would reduce \nuncertainty in our trade relations. It would increase the chances of \nChina moving to a more open economy. In addition, it would ensure that \nthe U.S. is able to benefit fully from the economic liberalization \nmeasures that China must adopt in order to be accepted as a WTO member.\n  Finally, we need a fair trade relationship. China's market should be \nas open to our goods and services as we are to theirs. And today it is \nnot. In this case, the numbers speak for themselves. It may be true \nthat we have a large and growing deficit with China. At the same time, \nU.S. exports to China have increased from $11.7 billion in 1995 to \n$12.8 billion in 1997. In the first quarter of 1998, our exports have \nreached $3.3 billion. My home state of Montana exported $6.2 million \nworth of products to China just last year.\n  Furthermore, our agriculture industry relies on Asia. Ag exports to \nAsia constitute 40 percent of all agricultural exports. In the United \nStates we produce more than we could ever possibly consume. Our \nagricultural producers simply cannot survive without markets in China \nand the Pacific Rim.\n  Our economic goals and China's economic goals are not so far apart. \nChina seeks a working market economy for China's people. We seek that \nas well. We want a fair and open market for our goods and services. Yet \nwe continue to face the startling implications of the trade imbalance \nbetween the United States and China--our deficit is almost $50 billion \nand growing.\n  British writer G.K. Chesterson once said: ``Do not free a camel from \nthe burden of his hump; you may be freeing him from being a camel.'' We \ncannot change China to make its leaders think like Americans, act like \nAmericans, and participate in the world marketplace like Americans. We \nshould accept our differences. But we must insist on a minimum standard \nof behavior.\n  We must continually push for the elimination of unfair trade \nbarriers, such as the phony ban on Pacific Northwest wheat due to TCK \nsmut. We must encourage private investment over State-Owned \nEnterprises. We must fight for market transparency. We must insist that \nPresident Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji open China to more U.S. \nimports. And the way to do that is a commercially meaningful accession \nfor China to the WTO.\n  This is in everyone's best interest. It is good for China and it is \ngood for the United States for the world's largest country to become a \nmember of the WTO.\n  But the accession is going too slowly. It is not good enough to wait \nfor China to reach internal consensus on WTO membership. We need to \nshow China that the status quo is not acceptable. I believe that by \nengaging China, we can help China's reformers balance internal change \nand global opening. This does not mean delivering WTO carte blanche. \nRather, the Administration and Congress should pursue a three-pronged \napproach to serious engagement.\n  First, the United States must give China a material incentive to \nenter the WTO. The Administration should endorse, and Congress should \npass, a law to make permanent MFN status automatic when China enters \nthe WTO.\n  Second, the United States should target China's moral incentive to \nenter the WTO. With our bilateral talks on Taiwan's WTO membership \ncomplete, the Administration should push for Taiwan's rapid entry into \nthe WTO, regardless of where talks stand with China.\n  Third, the United States must convince China that unnecessary delay \nin entering the WTO is costly and counterproductive. Distribution and \nmarket access are just two issues that farmers and traders want fixed. \nAt the same time, we want to make certain that China will be able to \nagree to, live with and abide by a signed agreement. If talks remain \nstagnant after President Clinton's visit to China at the end of this \nmonth, we should strongly consider opening a broad market access case \nunder Section 301 of our trade law. It should begin with the areas \nwhere China is violating our 1992 agreement. It should set a deadline \nfor sanctions if they do not shape up.\n  Let me now turn to our third goal: a decent world to live in.\n  President Clinton is right to go to Tiananmen Square when he visits \nChina this month. But he will also be right to speak out on human \nrights and the rule of law.\n  It is a sad fact that those who would speak out against the \ngovernment are still in danger of being imprisoned or subject to house \narrest. Just as China will be expected to abide by the standards of \nnuclear non-proliferation and the WTO, it also should be expected to \nlive up to the international standards of human rights, beginning with \nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n  Although I welcome the recent release of political prisoners Wang Dan \nand Wei Jingsheng, I am disheartened that they are subject to a de \nfacto exile, unable to return to their homeland because of their \npolitical activities. Upwards of 2,000 political prisoners remain in \nChina, imprisoned for the simple expression of their beliefs.\n  Mr. President, Americans hold freedom of expression as one of their \nmost cherished rights. It is a prerogative that is all too often denied \nthe Chinese people, but one that I view as essential to that country's \npolitical and economic viability. Where ideas are suppressed, \ncreativity and innovation are lost. And we need look no further than \nthe world's leading economy to see the importance of innovation and \nexpression. America's economic power is indicative of its political and \neconomic freedom and the extent to which ideas and innovation are \nexchanged. It is true that China's economic success in the last 20 \nyears is impressive. But how far can innovation and growth proceed in \nthe absence of true freedom to carry out discourse and exchange ideas? \nThe global marketplace grows increasingly competitive every day. China \nand the rest of the world stand to lose if that great country's people \naren't allowed maximum ability to express, innovate and progress.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must also engage China when it comes to \nenvironmental concerns. As economies develop throughout the world, they \nuse more fossil fuels. Of course, with increased usage often comes \nsignificant pollution. Nowhere is that more true than in China. In the \ncoming years, China will likely burn more fossil fuels, dispose of more \nchemical and industrial waste and emit more carbon dioxide than any \ncountry in the world. As economic growth in China accelerates, demand \nfor electricity and the coal used to generate it will also increase.\n  Mr. President, 9 of the last 11 years have been the warmest of the \n20th century. If the emissions from China's burgeoning power plants are \nnot subject to controls, our efforts to prevent global warming will be \nundermined. China is part of the problem, and should be part of the \nsolution. Although this is true for all developing nations, it is \nespecially true for China, its appetite for hydrocarbons being what it \nis\n  When I worked on the Clean Air Act 1990, emissions trading was \nproposed as an alternative to inflexible, across-the-board efforts to \ncontrol emissions. Initial reports indicate that the system of \nemissions trading works. I am interested in possibly applying the \nconcept on a global scale, to include developing countries such as \nChina.\n  Again, Mr. President, if we are to minimize the impact of these \noutputs, the United States must engage China in a cooperative \nrelationship. We must do it in the areas of environmental protection, \ninternational security, human rights and trade. Although I agree with \nthe Chinese proverb that says, ``It is better to light a candle than \ncurse the darkness,'' I also think that the words of that great \nAmerican Henry Ford are apropos here: ``Coming together is a beginning, \nstaying together is progress, and working together is success.'' Mr. \nPresident, the United States and China have come together. For our \nbenefit and that of the rest of the world, let us continue to work \ntogether for success.\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say a few words about the approach I \nsee developing in Congress.\n  We have not covered ourselves with glory recently. We have not passed \nour IMF replenishment. We have not passed our UN dues. We have not \npassed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We have not passed fast \ntrack. And some have seen the recent satellite launch controversy as an \nopportunity to make points in domestic politics.\n  This is not the way a great power behaves. We have serious \nresponsibilities in our foreign affairs--whether in peace and security, \nin economics and trade, human rights or environmental protection. And \nwe diminish our institution at home, and our country abroad, if we do \nnot take these responsibilities seriously.\n  We have time to fix our deficiencies. But it is not unlimited time, \nand as we see in South Asia; in Hong Kong; in Korea; events will not \nwait for us. So as the President makes this historic trip, let us \nreflect a little more deeply on ourselves, on our responsibilities, and \non what we can do for our national, rather than political, interest.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6146-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6149-S6176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2689\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know our dear colleague from Nebraska is \nhere to speak, and I will try to be brief. I do not want to hold him \nup, knowing he has something we need to hear and I am eager to hear it. \nBut I want to talk just a moment about the pending amendment.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that in this bill before us, one of the \nthings the proponents of the bill say is good about the bill is that it \ntransfers money to the States. While this bill allows attorneys to be \npaid $92,000 an hour, while this bill provides $18,615.55 per Native \nAmerican who smokes for smoker abatement, while this bill pays farmers \n$21,000 an acre who are currently under the tobacco program while \nallowing them to keep their land and to continue to farm tobacco, we \nare told that at least a good thing about the bill is that it gives \nmoney back to the States.\n  However, when you open up the bill to page 201, you find that we do \ngive money back to the States, but only half the money can be spent by \nthe States as they choose to spend it. Basically this bill dictates \nFederal mandates as to how the other half of the money has to be spent.\n  The bill requires that ``a State shall use not less than 50 percent \nof the amount received'' for the following kinds of programs: maternal \nand child health services block grant, child care under section 418 of \nthe Social Security Act, federally funded child welfare and abuse \nprograms under title IV-B of the Social Security Act, programs \nadministered within the State under the authority of the Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration under title 19 part B \nof the Public Health Service Act, the Department of Education Dwight D. \nEisenhower Professional Development Program under title II.\n  It is obvious that there is some lobbyist somewhere who has all these \npet programs and is now having the Federal Government dictate to the \nState of Texas and to other States in the Union how they are supposed \nto spend the money that they are getting under this tobacco settlement.\n  If this weren't bad enough, if this weren't outrageous enough, now \nSenator Kerry and others come along and say, ``Well, this is not \nenough. What we are going to do in addition to all these things is we \nare going to tell the States that they have to spend half of 50% on a \nspecific program. ``A State shall use not less than 50 percent of the \namount described in subsection (b)(2) of section 452 for each fiscal \nyear to carry out activities under the Child Care and Development Block \nGrant Act.''\n  In other words, not only are we making them do all these things, but \nnow Senator Kerry and others want to say that 50 percent of the 50 \npercent that we are forcing the states to allocate has to go for this \none particular use.\n  Yesterday and the day before, we went back and forth with amendments. \nSenator Coverdell got to offer a real amendment to try to target drug \nuse among teenagers, and those who were opposed to it got to offer \ntheir supposed alternative. Yesterday, I offered an amendment to give a \nthird of the money back to moderate-income working people by repealing \nthe marriage penalty, and those who were opposed to it got a chance to \noffer their alternative. I have an amendment that will eliminate all \nthe restrictions in the bill related to the Federal Government telling \nthe States how to spend this money.\n  I want to make it clear I don't intend to see this Kerry amendment \nvoted on up or down until I have an opportunity to offer my \nalternative. My amendment takes all these earmarks out of the bill and \ngives the Members of the Senate the opportunity to decide if they want \nto serve in the State legislature and allocate State moneys, or do they \nwant to be U.S. Senators? If I wanted to tell  the State of Texas how \nto spend money, I would have run for the Texas Senate or for the Texas \nLegislature. I didn't run for the Texas Legislature. I never served in \nState government, and I don't want to get into State government now by \ntrying to tell my State how they have to spend this money.\n\n  We can have a motion to table this Kerry amendment. But, if it is not \ntabled, before this amendment is going to come to a final vote, I want \nto have the right to offer my alternative and give the Senate, as we \ndid on drugs, as we did on taxes, two alternatives: One, do more to \nmake the States spend the money they get under the bill the way \nCongress and all these special interest groups that have written this \nbill dictate it should be spent; or, two, rip out all the provisions of \nthe bill relating to mandating how the States spend the money and let \nthe States spend the money as they choose to spend the money.\n  I think the Senate ought to have that choice, not a choice between a \nbad provision and making it worse, but a choice between making it worse \nand getting rid of the whole process of telling the States how to spend \ntheir money.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his patience, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I appreciate the \nsuggestion the Senator from Texas just made, because I intend to do \napproximately the same thing, only with the entire piece of \nlegislation. Perhaps I am the only Member of the Senate who is becoming \nincreasingly confused about what is in this bill. Perhaps everybody is \ncrystal clear. I am not.\n  As I understand it, the tobacco companies will be required under law \nto pay into a trust fund, $15 billion in the first year, growing to $23 \nbillion. If I were to make an inquiry, I suspect, of the managers of \nthe bill right now as to what is in this bill, I am not sure I would \nlike the answer.\n  What we have been doing since the bill was introduced is we have been \ndeciding how we are going to allocate that money. As I understand it, \nthe amendment of the Senator from Texas, which was accepted, will \nallocate a piece of that money for tax cuts, and the amendment of the \nSenator from Georgia will allocate a piece of that $15 billion to $23 \nbillion for antidrug efforts, drugs other than nicotine.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Missouri, \nSenator Bond, have is an amendment before this body that will allocate \nan additional amount for child care. What the Senator from Texas is \nsaying is he wants to have all that money undesignated. So do I, only I \nbelieve that a substantial portion of the $15 billion to $23 billion \nneeds to be allocated in as unrestricted a fashion as possible to the \nStates so that we can help people who choose to stop smoking stop \nsmoking.\n  I appreciate that many Americans do not want to stop smoking. And if \nthey have the freedom to choose, with full disclosure of what is in the \nsubstance, fine. Choose, and let the substance do to you what it is \ngoing to do.\n  However, I have approximately 350,000 Nebraskans who smoke, and\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\nthey spend about $250 million a year on cigarettes alone, they smoke \nover 100 million packages of cigarettes a year. My belief is, if we \norganize this correctly, we can help those who choose to stop smoking \nstop.\n  We now know that nicotine is addictive. That is one of the reasons \nthe tobacco industry was willing, on June 20, 1997, to say that, ``We \nwill pay in $15 billion a year as well as a $50 billion punitive damage \npayment.'' Indeed the 37 million documents in the Minnesota case showed \nfar worse.\n  Yesterday, as we all know, a case in Florida was decided in the favor \nof an individual. I listened to a member of the jury this morning on \ntelevision say he voted to give this individual damages because the \ntobacco industry is still saying that nicotine is not addictive, still \nsaying it does not produce a powerful physical addiction.\n  Now, back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth, I was a pharmacist. That \nwas 1961 to 1965. I went to the University of Nebraska and graduated \nwith a degree in pharmacy. I was given a physical examination by the \nGovernment and served time in the Navy, so I did not have a chance to \npractice very much. But in those days we understood addiction. We were \ntrained to study it.\n  So I am impressed with nicotine as a drug, because it crosses the \nblood-brain barrier and it is a powerful addictive substance. It is not \njust habit forming; it is as addictive, according to scientists, as \ncocaine, as heroin, and other drugs that produce such a strong physical \npull on an individual that about a month ago a former mayor of Omaha, \nGene Leahy, a wonderful human being, announced he is dying of lung \ncancer; and at the press conference he was smoking a cigarette because \nhe can't stop. It isn't that he is choosing to smoke cigarettes; he has \nno choice; he is addicted to the nicotine.\n  So I have 350,000 people in Nebraska who smoke, who spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars a year on cigarettes. By my calculations, if they \nare spending all that money, and if we are asking them to pay all of \nthis additional money to continue to smoke, we ought to at least offer \nto help those who want to quit, quit. And if we can help them stop \nsmoking--not only are they going to become healthier as a result of \nthat help they are going to be more prosperous because they are not \nspending money on tobacco anymore.\n  I have never been convinced by the arguments that simply raising the \nprice of cigarettes is going to dramatically reduce smoking. Not if you \nare addicted. What does the price increase of cocaine do to an addict? \nThey just steal the money and buy the substance. If it is an addictive \nsubstance, I do not care what the price is--a person is addicted to \nit--they are going to do what is necessary to buy the product. That is \nwhat we are dealing with.\n  What we are doing with this piece of legislation, as I see it, is we \nare nicking away at the money raised as a result of this bill's \nincrease in the price of cigarettes and thereby decreasing the chance \nwe have to help those individuals who want to stop smoking not only \nbecome healthier but to become more prosperous. Again, the funds raised \nby this bill should be spent on reducing the number of people who are \nsmoking in this country. In Nebraska, we should be concerned about \nreducing dollars spent on cigarettes from say $250 to $200 million--\nwhich is a relatively modest though difficult goal to achieve. And \nwhile it may not sound like an enormous decrease, it is a quarter of a \nbillion dollars every 5 years into the pockets of those individuals.\n  So all the talk about this being a tax increase, to me, is \nmisleading. It takes us in the wrong direction, puts us on the slippery \nslope of cutting taxes instead of reducing smoking. What we ought to be \ntrying to do is cut people away from an addictive  substance that, \ntaken as directed, would decrease their chance of living a long and \nhealthy life and decrease their chance, as well, of getting a shot at \nthe American dream of having a little bit of prosperity.\n\n  One of my friends in life is an extremely conservative \nbusinessperson. He will not hire anybody who smokes. I understand that \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes this legislation. I am a member of \nthe Chamber of Commerce in my business. I think they are wrong. I think \nthey have looked at this thing only as a tax increase, because some are \ndescribing it as that, and they are not understanding that if their \nemployees decrease their addiction to this substance, that they are \nhealthier. And if they are healthier, the cost of their insurance goes \ndown, their absentee rates go down.\n  Everybody who has employees working for them wants their employees to \nbe as healthy as possible. The Chamber of Commerce, in my judgment, and \nthe National Restaurant Association are missing the point. If there is \ncessation money in this bill, I can go to Nebraska and appeal to the \nbusiness community, to the Nebraska restaurant association, to the \nNebraska Chamber of Commerce, and say, ``Let's get involved with this \ncause of helping the people in Nebraska who want to quit, quit.'' You \nsay, ``Well, that ought to be easy enough to stop.'' Mr. President, \nagain, it is addictive, and to stop and to get off an addiction is not \nan easy thing to do. As a result, it is extremely hard for these people \nto not pay the price increase being imposed on them--they have a \nphysical need for the product.\n  And it is made even more difficult--I have met, on a number of \noccasions now, with Nebraskans who smoke, especially with young people \nwho smoke; and one of the interesting things that I acquire from those \nconversations is an answer to the question, ``Why don't you just do \nsmoking cessation if you want to stop?'' And one of the answers is, it \nis not only easier, it is cheaper to smoke than to stop smoking.\n  Most places where you buy cigarettes, they are right there in the \nopen. They are right there in the open. You can go and buy them for a \ncurrent per pack price of about $2.50.\n  But if you want to stop smoking--as we all know who have had friends \nwho have either been addicted to this substance or addicted to alcohol \nor addicted to other sorts of substances, who are trying to get off the \nurge--the desire for this substance comes back. You need much more than \njust an opportunity to buy.\n  But go into a store, go into any store in your home State, and try to \nbuy a smoking cessation kit. No. 1, you are going to find out that it \nis substantially more expensive than a pack of cigarettes. For lower-\nincome people, who tend to smoke in higher percentages, it is a \nbarrier. And it is especially a barrier as I have talked to young \npeople who say they simply do not have the out-of-pocket money to be \nable to buy it. So it is easier for them to buy cigarettes. The \nphysical environment for buying smoking cessation kits in stores is \nmore difficult, oftentimes kept under lock and key.\n  So as I see this legislation, the original purpose of the legislation \nwas to collect from the tobacco companies a fee, which started at $15 \nbillion, and increased to $23 billion as a result of the Minnesota \ncourt decision, to help adults who want to quit, quit as well as to \nstop young people from smoking. That is a laudable goal--40 percent of \nmy underage teenagers in Nebraska smoke; one out of three of them will \ndie prematurely as a consequence. A very high percentage of them \nbelieve they are going to stop, even though all the statistics show \nthat they do not stop because they are addicted. They do not understand \nthe nature of addiction. They do not understand that nicotine is \naddictive. They have been told otherwise by the tobacco companies for \nall of these years.\n  So, Mr. President, I have heard the distinguished Senator from Texas \nsay that before he will allow a vote on this amendment by Senator Kerry \nand Senator Bond, which seems like an altogether reasonable amendment \nto me--at least it puts money into children; he wants an agreement that \nhe is going to get a vote on his amendment.\n  Well, I want the same. I am here to say that I will insist on the \nsame, an amendment that allows us to say that this legislation will \ngive each of our States a designated amount of money, that we will know \nwhat that amount of money is going to be, for a block grant that will \ngo for smoking prevention and cessation. Let the States decide. I do \nnot believe any of us really understands what it is going to take to \nget people to stop smoking. I think the people at the community level \nunderstand it an awful lot better.\n  It is not going to be easy to get the job done. My amendment would \ncreate a single block grant, not only to help young people not to \nsmoke, but also to\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\nhelp those who currently smoke to stop. I believe it will make our \npeople not only healthier, as a consequence of getting off an addiction \nthat causes them to have significant health care problems, but it will \nalso make them more prosperous by decreasing the amount of money they \nare spending on a substance that, taken as directed, will make them \nunhealthy.\n  So the Senator from Texas gave me an excellent idea. I had not \nintended on doing that when I came to the floor. One of the things I am \ntrying to get to is--as I said earlier, I am confused about what is \nleft in this bill. I understood it in the beginning that it was a $15 \nbillion fee from the tobacco companies, growing to $23 billion; that 26 \npercent of it was going to be allocated to research; that 16 percent of \nit was going to be allocated to farmers; that 40 percent of it was \ngoing to be allocated to States; and the balance was going to be \nallocated to public health for education, cessation. As I understand \nit, of the total amount only 6 percent would go to smoking cessation \nprograms.\n  As I said, I had drafted an amendment that would have taken a \nsignificant portion--46 percent--of the funds raised by this \nlegislation and given it to the States in a single smoking cessation \nand prevention block grant.\n  I have prepared numbers that show what every single State would get \nunder this block grant designed to work to reduce those people who are \naddicted to smoking, reduce their health care costs, and increase their \nprosperity by helping them kick the habit and get off of an addiction \nthat is not only costing them their health but also costing them a \ngreat deal of money.\n  I will insist on my amendment that will restore the money that was \ntaken out of the $23 billion in the Gramm amendment, that will restore \nthe money that was taken out with the Coverdell amendment, that will \nrestore any other money that is taken out.\n  I believe if this bill is going to be effective, if it is going to \nhelp us organize the coalitions at the community level to help \nAmericans become healthier and more prosperous, we have to help \nespecially those adults who are addicted to a substance that is \nextremely difficult to kick.\n  One of the most frustrating things I am dealing with right now on \nthis piece of legislation is I don't know what is in it. I believe \nbefore we proceed further with any additional amendments we need to \nknow how that $15 to $23 billion is allocated. I heard some who are \narguing in favor of the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nTexas having to do with the marriage penalty, that we would still have \n40 percent going to the States. It is 40 percent of a much smaller \nnumber. Forty percent of the people on the floor of this chamber is a \nmuch smaller number than forty percent of the people in this country.\n  My math tells me the best way to look at this is to start off and \nsay, $15 billion coming from the tobacco companies, growing to $23 \nbillion, how much is going to be designated under this law for various \nitems? At this stage of the game, I am not able to get an answer. I \nunderstand that the managers of the bill are going to try to crunch the \nnumbers and give us an answer, but I don't think we can seriously \nconsider it unless we presume we will accept every single amendment and \nwrite the bill in conference, which I think is a bad way of doing \nthings.\n  Our most distinguished Senator, George Norris, served in this body \nfor a number years. He went back to Nebraska, hating the conference \ncommittee--hating the process by which House and Senate differences are \nresolved. We keep hearing that the problems with this bill can be fixed \nin conference, that a conference committee will take care of them. That \nis undemocratic. We should not be writing a piece of legislation as \nimportant as this one in a conference committee. I think it is a very \nbad thing to do, and I think we need to consider every single amendment \nthat is brought down here as seriously as possible, based upon an \nunderstanding of what is in the bill.\n  I do not know what is in this bill right now. I do not know how the \n$15 to $23 billion is being allocated. I know every single amendment \nthat has been passed has changed that allocation, but I don't know what \nwe are left with. I knew prior but I don't know now. I am hopeful we \nare able to get that.\n  I will declare, as the Senator from Texas did, that before we have a \nvote on the Kerry-Bond amendment, which I support, I want to vote on my \namendment which will take this bill back to what I think it was \noriginally intended to do, which is to reduce addiction in the United \nStates of America on a substance called nicotine, that we discovered on \nthe 20th of June, 1997, is addictive.\n  For those who understand the nature of addiction, it is a very \nserious public health problem. I thought we were going to try to solve \na very serious public health problem. I thought we were going to try to \nempower our citizens to participate in solving that problem, as well. I \nhope that at some point in this debate we are able to get back to that.\n  As I said, I appreciate very much that there is a lot of enthusiasm \nto move this thing along. I read in the paper we have dealt with this \ncontroversial tax issue and all that is left is the controversial farm \nprovision--we just deal with that thing and this thing will move out \nand put pressure on the House then to pass it. All of that legislative \nprocess confuses me, let alone confuses the people I represent. What \nthey are not confused about is their desire to have an opportunity to \nimprove their health and improve their prosperity through this \nlegislation. As I see it, we decrease the chances of that happening \nwith the amendments that have been agreed to thus far.\n  I have come to the floor to ask for two things, and I hope at some \npoint I can get them. One, what is in the bill? How is that $15 to $23 \nbillion allocated? How much goes to the reduction in tax in the \nmarriage penalty and whatever else was in the Gramm amendment? How much \nof it goes now to fight the war on drugs? For gosh sakes, we don't have \nthe political courage to put enough money in the drug war on our own \nwithout taking it from this bill--I don't understand that, frankly. How \nmuch is now going to the war on drugs? How much will be going to child \ncare under the Kerry-Bond amendment? I want to know what the lay of the \nland is.\n  Second, I will insist, as the Senator from Texas has just done, that \nmy amendment be considered as well, that we convert this bill into what \nit was intended to do in the first place, and that is to give our \npeople at the community level the opportunity to fight this war against \nnicotine addiction. I believe when we win this war, this piece of \nlegislation is going to be seen as a very important piece of \nlegislation. But if we don't win this war, if all we do is go home and \nissue press releases saying I cut your taxes, I gave you some more \nmoney for this and some more money for that, then it seems to me, Mr. \nPresident, that whatever else it is that we get done through those \nperipheral efforts, we will have not empowered the people in our States \nand our communities to be able to fight a battle that we now know--and, \nindeed, I argue one of the problems we are having is we don't know the \nfull ramifications and details of all of the new information that we \nhave since the 20th of June, 1997--about the seriousness of this health \ncare problem.\n  I am hopeful, as I said, that not only can I get the information \nabout what is in the bill right now, but I will hopefully not offend \ntoo many by insisting, as the Senator from Texas has, that my amendment \nbe given an opportunity to be voted on at the same time that the Kerry-\nBond amendment is considered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nSenator for 15 minutes on the bill and the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to talk about the \nunderlying bill and the Kerry amendment that is pending. This is, \nobviously, the most serious effort ever by any Congress to address the \ncritical public health issue of smoking.\n  Now, what has brought us to this point? Obviously, the historic \nsettlement negotiated last year by the States and the tobacco industry \nprovided the most incentive for this, but\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\nthe tremendous success of several States--and I particularly note the \nState of Minnesota and their attorney general, Skip Humphrey, in \naggressively pursuing their claims against the tobacco industry--has \nrevealed what has been the massive deception that underlies the tobacco \nindustry's traditional position.\n  It has been now conclusively demonstrated that tobacco is, in fact, \naddictive. That is a claim which the tobacco industry had consistently \ndenied and, frankly, covered up. We have learned that the tobacco \nindustry has targeted children to addict them to tobacco products, \nanother claim that the tobacco industry has lied and covered up. We \nhave also learned if you do not start smoking when you are underage, it \nis unlikely that you will ever become addicted to tobacco. All the more \nreason, then, all the more incentive, then, for some to try to addict \nchildren to this product.\n  I support adult choices and adult responsibility, but when an \nindustry targets kids, knowing full well the children are vulnerable to \naddiction, and then argues for adult choice, it is time for this \nCongress to step up and protect our kids.\n  I don't need to recite the statistics that everyone in this Chamber \nhas heard the past couple of weeks now. Let me just say this: 3,000 \nchildren start smoking every day; 1,000 of them will die prematurely \ndue to this addiction. Every day we delay this process, we sentence \nanother 1,000 children in America to die early.\n  There are many critical amendments to be reviewed and debated, but \nlet us not lose sight of the fact that we have to act now. There is an \nurgency to act now. Any further delay would be unconscionable. The \nlives of our children are at stake, literally. We must protect them \nfrom the predatory industry that views youth as ``our replacement \nsmokers'' good for many decades of addiction to their deadly product.\n  Cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed consumer products in \nour country. Tobacco companies currently spend almost $6 billion a year \nto promote and advertise products, and they have increased their \nspending by more than 12 times since 1971, when advertising on radio \nand television was banned.\n  Children are, obviously, the most vulnerable to tobacco company \ntactics. They have targeted kids because of this vulnerability to \nnicotine addiction, and they are the most easily affected by slick \nadvertising and promotional ploys. The evidence is overwhelming that \nsmoking is a pediatric disease. I support a comprehensive approach to \nensure success in our efforts to protect kids. For every 10 cents added \nto the price of cigarettes, approximately 700,000 fewer teens will \nbegin smoking.\n  To further promote public health, I have supported investment in \npublic health and research. We must maintain and support FDA authority \nto restrict advertising directed at teens. Finally, we have to \nstrengthen the look-back provisions and, ultimately, hold tobacco \ncompanies responsible for their efforts to addict kids. These important \ndecisions will influence companies to stop marketing to children with \nadvertising and promotional techniques.\n  I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have supported \nour efforts to address this critically important issue.\n  My own State of South Dakota holds the dubious distinction of having \nthe second-highest rate of underage tobacco use in America. Now, I am \ncommitted to doing what I can to see these rates reduced.\n  Almost one out of every nine high school boys in my State will die \nprematurely from tobacco use. Of the teenagers in our State, we can now \nexpect 15,000 South Dakota teenagers to die early because of their \ntobacco use. These odds are way too high to be permitted or to be \ntolerated by this body. The expeditious passage of this tobacco bill \nwill have a real and immediate impact on releasing those rates. We \ncannot delay any longer. I am also pleased that as we debate this \nissue, Senator Kerry, Senator Bond, and others, have joined in an \neffort, which I have joined in as well, to direct a modest portion of \nthe revenue generated for child care purposes.\n  I appreciate that there has been a significant debate on the floor of \nthis body on the use of revenue generated by this legislation. I think \nit is correct that this legislation ought to be directed at cessation \nof smoking and tobacco use and not as a revenue generator. However, the \nreality is that any realistic bill that has a chance of reducing \ntobacco usage will generate revenue, and this body has a responsibility \nof determining how best, then, to use that amount of revenue \ngenerated--some $62 billion over the first 5 years.\n  It makes sense to me the first emphasis ought to be on health care, \nreimbursing the States, clearly, for the health care expenses they have \nincurred. It makes sense to me that there ought to be a high emphasis \non medical research, on cancer, lung cancer, heart disease, and other \ndiseases that are smoking-related. There ought to be a huge effort in \nthat direction. There ought to be an effort and a priority for smoking \ncessation programs. But it also seems to me that some of these dollars \nought to roll back to families and to children through some tax relief. \nNo doubt, that will be a part of the package. But I think it is a \nmistake to include a tax package that is so enormous that it drains, \noverall, the revenue, or a large share of the revenue that could \notherwise have been utilized for medical research, help for the States, \nsmoking cessation, or for child care. I think there needs to be a \nbalance in that regard.\n  I am particularly troubled by the amendment that was passed \nyesterday, which would, in fact, not only drain these resources away, \nbut would ultimately dip into the budget surpluses and, in fact, Social \nSecurity surpluses to make good on its obligation. But I believe that \nif we can use the revenue that Senators Kerry and Dodd have proposed, \nit would go a long way toward promoting at least a portion of the goals \nof our Early Childhood Development Act, which I have cosponsored with \nthem.\n  This amendment, if adopted, would go a significant way toward \nassisting working families, recognizing the reality that more and more \nfamilies now have both parents in the workforce, and in the case of \nsingle-parent families, quality child care is all the more essential. \nEach day, an estimated 13 million children younger than 6 years old, \nincluding 6 million toddlers, spend all or part of their day in child \ncare of some form, and child care experts tell us it easily costs \nbetween $4,000 and $10,000 a year for a child.\n  Now, augmenting the block grants to the States where we do not create \na Federal bureaucracy, we do not federalize child care, we do not run \nthings from Washington, but we give the resources necessary for States \nto devise their own innovative, strong child care strategies, makes all \nthe sense in the world, particularly given the fact that, as I have \nheld child care meetings all around the State of South Dakota, it has \nbecome obvious to me that not only do people have too few choices--\nquality choices--but all too often the child care providers themselves \nfind themselves on the economic edge, with good people leaving that \nparticular profession because of the low salaries and the high stress \nof that particular occupation. So we have children at the most \nvulnerable point in their lives, where the greatest share of brain \ndevelopment is taking place in the course of their lives, with a \npatchwork system that has simply not received the national attention it \ndeserves. This amendment would go a long way toward augmenting the \nchild care options, the affordable quality options that working parents \nin our country deserve to have.\n\n  I appreciate that there are people in this body and around the \ncountry on the far political right who seem to lie awake nights \nworrying that somehow this legislation may generate the resources \nessential for the Government to actually do something for kids. I don't \nlie awake nights worrying about that. I worry about how can we work on \na partnership basis with States, local governments, and private \norganizations to provide more affordable and quality options for child \ncare and improve the health of the next generation of Americans. I \nthink that is the underlying concern. For that reason, I am very \nsupportive of this amendment and the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is that we may have a \nvote soon on the amendment, so I will take a couple of minutes. My \ncolleague from Massachusetts is here and others are here on the floor. \nLet me just say that I am honored to be a part of this effort and to \njoin with Senators Kerry and Bond. And I appreciate the words spoken by \nmy colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I will try to be succinct. The focus of this \nlegislation is children. The focus of this legislation is, of course, \nto go after the addiction of children to tobacco, to focus on cessation \nprograms, to focus on the goal of making sure that we don't have \nchildren addicted to this very lethal drug any longer, and to make sure \nthat we, in fact, focus on the overall health of children in our \ncountry, and that we focus on ways in which children cannot only be \nhealthy, but have hope and can do well in school and do well in their \nlives.\n  In that respect, I think this amendment is right on point, right on \ntarget. We are talking about at least trying to make sure that about $6 \nbillion-plus over the next 5 years would go to early childhood \ndevelopment, both for children before they go to kindergarten and also \nfor afterschool care.\n  I will just raise two questions in 2 minutes. No. 1, to tell you the \ntruth--that is an interesting expression; it is not like everything \nelse I have said has not been the truth--but to tell you the truth, I \ndon't even know why it is that for some reason, somebody decided the \nonly way we are going to have funding for child care in this country is \nout of a tobacco bill. I think if we really care about this, we are \ngoing to make the investment. But I also believe this is a very \nappropriate vehicle on which to have this focus. As my colleague from \nSouth Dakota said--and I know my colleague from Massachusetts will \nfocus on this--we have all this research, and the Federal evidence is \nirrefutable, irreducible. We have to make sure that children by the age \nof 3 are ready for school and ready for life. If they are not, they may \nnever do well in school; they may never do well in their lives.\n\n  What more important investment, what more important feature of this \nlegislation could we support than to make sure we invest in the health, \nskills, intellect, and character of our children? That is what this is \nabout. It is related to how they feel about themselves, their \nconfidence--both early childhood development before kindergarten and \nafterschool care. That is also related to the question of whether or \nnot they care enough about themselves and feel good enough about \nthemselves that they don't get addicted to tobacco and that they think \nabout a positive life, about a healthy life, and about what they are \ngoing to do in their lives.\n  This is an extremely important amendment which goes to the heart of \nwhat this legislation is supposed to be all about--public health, \nfocusing on the improvement and the betterment of our children's lives, \nand all of these children are God's children.\n  This amendment should pass. It is a bipartisan effort. I am very \npleased to be on the floor supporting it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Kerry/Bond Youth \nSmoking Reduction Amendment. This year has featured hearings, press \nconferences, and legislation from both sides of the aisle promoting \nchildren's programs. Over 50 bills have been introduced to improve \nchildhood development and after school programs. Headlines have focused \nthe nation's attention on the difficulties that many parents face in \nfinding quality care for their children. The struggle for decent child \ncare is a daily fact of life that all working families understand, \nregardless of their income. Yet millions of families today cannot \nafford the child care they need in order to raise, and protect their \nchildren.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats agree that the number one goal of this \ntobacco bill ought to be protecting our children and reducing teenage \nsmoking. Rightly, so. Millions of young lives hang in the balance. \nEvery piece of tobacco legislation that has been introduced is intended \nto help children. Republicans have called their bills ``Placing \nRestraints on Tobacco's Endangerment of Children and Teens Act'' and \nthe ``Kids Deserve Freedom from Tobacco Act.'' Democrats have \nintroduced the ``Healthy Kids Act.'' It's time to make this legislation \nreflect the rhetoric about children.\n  Senator Grams was right when he recently explained why he will not \nsupport the tobacco settlement--``It's not about protecting kids from \ntobacco, because if it were, the dollars the federal government \ncollects would go to the kids.''\n  I agree that these funds should be used for early childhood \ndevelopment, child care and after school programs--programs that \ndirectly help kids. These programs are effective ways to curb teen \nsmoking and promote a healthy future for our children. It's time to \nstand up for the nation's children, and stand against the tobacco \nindustry.\n  During this debate, there has been a great deal of discussion about \nrestricting tobacco advertising and increasing the price of cigarettes. \nBoth steps are intended to curb teenage smoking, and both will help to \ndo just that. But there are other steps we can take as well to deal \nwith realities that make children vulnerable to the lure of tobacco. By \ninvesting in essential early childhood development and care that can \nreally help us save children from the dangers of smoking.\n  The purpose of this tobacco legislation is to help children and to \nstop teenage smoking. For more than a generation, the tobacco industry \nhas been profiteering by abusing the nation's children, stunting their \ngrowth and stealing their futures. The full dimension of this cynical \ntobacco industry strategy is finally becoming clear. The avalanche of \nsecret industry documents disclosed in recent months reveals a blatant \nnationwide scheme to target children and addict them to tobacco in \norder to maximize industry profits.\n  For a quarter century the R.J. Reynolds Company has referred to \nchildren as ``tomorrow's cigarette business.'' Newly released documents \nshow that Philip Morris provided money to movie makers to add smoking \nscenes to popular movies, such as the Muppets, in order to observe \nattitudes toward smoking by children as young as 5 years old. As a \nresult of the tobacco industry's tactics, 93 percent of 6 year olds can \nidentify Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking.\n  Investing in child development is sensible ``public health'' \nstrategy. It is based on sound science and common sense. Doctors and \npublic health officials who are on the front lines, working tirelessly \nto help children grow and develop into productive citizens, know all \ntoo well the dangers of tobacco. They have seen all too frequently its \ntight grip on our young people. They have called upon us to do all we \ncan to reduce teen smoking, including an essential investment in early \nchildhood development and after school programs. Forty-two doctors, \npublic health officials, business leaders, and child development \nexperts including Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, America's foremost \npediatrician, have strongly supported this strategy, and have asked \nCongress to invest in child care and after school programs to prevent \nyouth smoking addiction.\n  Recent research reminds us that brain development in the first three \nyears of life is critical to laying the foundation for positive self \nesteem, effective decision-making and the ability to resist destructive \nhabits such as smoking. If we want children to grow up healthy and \ntobacco free, we must ensure that they receive the stimulation and \nnurturing they need early. If we wait until adolescence to help them \ndevelop the will and the skill to say no to smoking--what we do will be \ntoo little and too late.\n\n  After school and summer programs also make a large difference. Over 5 \nmillion children are left home alone after school each day. They are \nmore vulnerable to negative peer pressure and pressure from the tobacco \nindustry. These are precisely the teenagers targeted and manipulated by \nthe industry's marketing schemes. After school programs help keep young \npeople off the streets and engaged in constructive activities that do \nnot jeopardize their futures. Many of these after school programs \nspecifically incorporate anti-smoking initiatives to teach participants \nabout the dangers to tobacco and\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nequip them with the skills to make important life and death decisions.\n  Teenagers left home alone are significantly more likely to smoke \ncigarettes, drink alcohol, and experiment with drugs. In stark \ncontrast, children who participate in productive after school \nactivities are far less likely, to smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs. \nWe also know that cigarettes are a ``starter drug'' and often lead to \nhard drug use and substance abuse.\n  High quality child care and after school programs can help children \ndevelop the skills they need to avoid unhealthy habits such as smoking. \nBut, every day across America, millions of low-income working families \nface the daunting task of finding affordable child care on their \nlimited budgets. The reality is that far too many children are at risk. \nTen million low-income children today theoretically qualify for \nservices under current federal child care programs. But because of the \nlack of funding, only 1 in 10 actually receive it. The cost of decent \nchild care often ranges from $4,000 to $10,000 per year--yet a minimum \nwage job pays only $10,700 a year. Low-income parents need support to \nensure that their children are safe and well cared for. Unfortunately, \nfar too few of them receive the help they need and deserve. Sadly, they \nare the one group that has been deliberately targeted by the tobacco \nindustry for addiction and early death. That is why I support the \nKerry-Bond Amendment, which will ensure that at least half of the \nfederal share of the state funds received under this legislation will \nbe spent by states on after school care and early childhood development \nby increasing the Child Care Development Block Grant.\n  The American people understand the importance of funding these child \ndevelopment programs. They agree that tobacco settlement revenues \nshould be invested in child care and child development programs. I have \nreceived numerous letters from groups, experts, and parents from across \nthe country urging Congress to do so.\n  If we want children to say no to tobacco, then Congress needs to say \nyes to making children's programs part of our national strategy for \nkeeping children healthy and tobacco free.\n  Mr. President, I join in commending my friend and colleagues, Senator \nKerry and Senator Bond, for bringing up this amendment. I think it is \nvery consistent with the central thrust of this legislation which is \naddressed to reducing the number of young people in this country--the \nchildren of this country--from becoming involved in smoking.\n  What we all find out in listening to those who have thought about \nthis, studied it, and reviewed the various real-life experiences that \nwe have seen in different communities, countries, and States is that \nthere are some very, very powerful conclusions. There is no one single \nanswer, but there are a series of answers.\n  I believe that this amendment addresses one of the very important \nconclusions that have been drawn on the basis of sound science and \ncommon sense. We have learned that if you see a significant increase in \nthe cost of a pack of cigarettes, that it provides a significant \ndisincentive to children to involve themselves in smoking. We find out \nthat if you provide counteradvertising in making young people aware of \nthe dangers, that it can have a powerful impact in offsetting the $5 \nbillion a year that is out there to try to draw young children into \nsmoking by presenting the case that, if they start to smoke, their life \nwill be more exciting, more pleasurable, and more successful. You don't \nneed to match the tobacco industry dollar for dollar, but you do need \nto have an effective counteradvertising campaign. That reduces youth \nsmoking. We have seen it in Massachusetts. We have seen it in \nCalifornia. I have referred to those studies at other times in the \ncourse of this debate.\n  Cessation programs to help young people to stop smoking have had some \nimportant success.\n  Support for school-based programs, which I see in my own State of \nMassachusetts, where young people involve themselves in working with \nlaw enforcement to discourage retailers from violating the law, has had \nsome success.\n  We have a number of young people now in my State of Massachusetts who \nare involved in programs to have the various malls around Massachusetts \nsmoke free. They are doing it as volunteers. The young people are doing \nit. They are also educating the public and their colleagues about the \ndangers of smoking.\n  There are a number of things that can be done. But the importance of \nproviding early child development to equip young children with the \nconfidence-building tools so that they have the ability to resist \nvarious peer pressures and develop those skills of competence is \nabsolutely imperative and essential if we are expecting the children in \nthe future to resist dangerous types of behavior. That has been \ndemonstrated time in and time out. The various Carnegie studies have \namply demonstrated that.\n  This legislation is focused on early child development, building \nthose confidence-building skills, helping and assisting in augmenting \nand supporting children at the earliest ages. We find as the study goes \non and on that the earlier, really, the better.\n  Then by providing an atmosphere where these children are going to be \nable to be challenged intellectually and socially in child care \nsettings provides the kind of supporting atmosphere and climate, again, \nfor building their confidence-building skills.\n  Also, providing some after-school programs, whether it is in the day \nwhen the children are attending school, or whether it is at a time when \nthe children are not in school, such as during vacations and also the \nsummertime, considered together, have a very powerful impact in \nstrengthening the willingness of children to resist the negative \nbehavior patterns that start out with smoking, then yield to smoking \nand drinking, and then, as the law enforcement experts provide, smoking \nand drinking lead their way to significant substance abuse. That \nempirical evidence has been included during the period of these last \ncouple of weeks and has been amply justified over a period of time.\n\n  The benefit of this particular amendment, I think, primarily rests \nwith helping the children at their most vulnerable time, as they are \ndeveloping their own kinds of confidence-building skills--giving them \nthe kind of help, support, and the power to resist abnormal, negative, \nand destructive behavior.\n  Second, it provides an important investment in terms of the children \nso they will have a more useful, constructive, happier, and productive \nlife.\n  All we have to do is consider the Beethoven studies that have been \ndone in Chicago and the Ypsilanti studies that have been done, which \nhave demonstrated this kind of investment in terms of children's \nattitude and support pays off in just the way that has been represented \nby those who have advanced this amendment.\n  This is right on target in helping to reduce children's smoking. It \nis right on target in ensuring that children who are the most \nvulnerable will be able to develop the kind of skills to resist \nsmoking.\n  It is right on target and consistent with the public health drive, \nwhich is the central purpose of this bill, and cannot be distorted and \ncannot be misrepresented by those who are opposed to any kind of \nlegislation. As hard as they try, this legislation is moving forward.\n  But with this particular amendment, it will be a more effective bill \nin helping the children in this country. It is an amendment that should \nbe accepted, supported, approved, and made a part of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the amendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Kerry amendment once again raises the \nfundamental questions as to why the United States Senate is considering \nthis tobacco settlement bill. Is its purpose to reduce the number of \nchildren who will become addicted to nicotine, or it is cover for \nanother Washington power grab?\n  In recent days, the Senate has debated various amendments which \naffect the agreement Senator McCain reached with the nations' governors \nto secure their support for this legislation. Members have voiced \nopposition to amendments on the grounds that it violates the agreement \nreached between the governors and the White House.\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\n  There can be no doubt that the Kerry Amendment fractures that \nagreement.\n  On a bipartisan basis, Governor Voinovich of Ohio and Governor Carper \nof Delaware have issued a letter opposing the Kerry amendment. Their \nMay 19 letter states, ``the National Governors' Association strongly \nopposes the Kerry amendment which dictates state funding choices.''\n  Governor Carper and Governor Voinovich go on to state, ``This \nfundamentally undercuts the agreement included in the manager's \namendment and would make it impossible for Governors to continue to \nsupport this agreement.\n  ``In addition, by locking states into a specific child care \nrequirement, the Kerry amendment would prevent states from meeting \nother compelling needs as their particular circumstances dictate.''\n  Mr. President, the Kerry amendment is the old broken record that \nWashington knows best. Only Washington can set the priorities.\n  Mr. President, by imposing this restriction on the states, the Kerry \namendment has changed the rules of welfare reform. The effect of the \nKerry amendment is to increase the state matching requirement for \nreceiving funds out of the child care and development block grant. Why \nare we imposing such a policy on a tobacco bill?\n  If the Kerry amendment is adopted, the tobacco bill will contain two \ncompletely contradictory policies. The McCain May 18 modification \nalready establishes new rules for claiming additional federal dollars \nfor child care. Under section 452, ``Grants to States,'' the bill now \nchanges the federal match rate for new child care dollars to 80 \npercent. This is a higher match rate than any state receives for the \nMedicaid Program.\n  Why must the federal government bribe the states to claim federal \ndollars for child care by lowering the cost to the states? Simple. \nBecause the states are not spending all of the child care dollars \nalready available to them.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the states spent only 72 percent of what they \ncould have spent out of the child care and development block grant. The \ntobacco bill includes this higher match rate at insistence of the White \nHouse. The Clinton administration fully understands it must change the \nrules in order to pump more dollars into child care.\n  Mr. President, this administration proposal is so troublesome to me \nbecause the White House is blowing hot and cold air at the same time on \nthe issue of child care. The White House proposed cutting funds for \nchild care under the title XX program. The President's budget requested \na reduction in this important program for fiscal year 1999 and in the \nyears beyond.\n  Under the Clinton administration's budget, the SSBG would receive $1 \nbillion less than what is authorized under welfare reform in 2003.\n  Mr. President, you cannot profess to be for child care when you \npropose to reduce the social services block grant. The two ideas are \nmutually exclusive. Every state uses SSBG funds to provide day care for \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, the Kerry amendment does not define who is for child \ncare or who is against child care. The Clinton administration has acted \nin a contradictory way and those who voted to cut the social services \nblock grant have acted in a contradictory manner. If we are serious \nabout child care, the first priority should be to restore the social \nservices block grant.\n  If the Kerry amendment is adopted, the U.S. Senate will be saying \nthat the state match for child care funds is both too high and too low.\n  Mr. President, this simply does not make sense.\n  The Kerry amendment is not needed. The states are free to spend their \nentire amount of unrestricted funds on child care if they so choose. Of \nthe 50 percent of funds which are restricted, child care is one of the \noptions the states can spend their tobacco funds on.\n  Mr. President, Delaware is considering using its tobacco funds for \nexpanding health insurance to low-income families. The Kerry amendment \nwould substitute the judgment of the U.S. Senate about what priorities \nshould be funded for the judgment of the elected men and women of \nDelaware.\n  That is a mistake we should not make.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we had agreed earlier, I will in a few \nseconds propose to table the Kerry amendment. Following that, under a \nprevious agreement, Senator Faircloth and Senator Sessions will be \nrecognized for their amendment, which I understand has to do with \nattorneys' fees, and I hope we can complete that in a reasonable length \nof time. This issue has been fairly well ventilated in the past and is \nwell known now.\n  I think it is well known that the amount of money attorneys would \nreceive under this settlement and are receiving or scheduled to receive \nunder State settlements is inordinately high, to make one of the \ngrossest understatements of this debate. I think it is important \nSenator Faircloth and Senator Sessions intend to debate this.\n  Mr. President, at this time I move to table the Kerry amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for not \nmoving to table just yet because I would like to make a couple of \ncomments concerning the amendment that is pending.\n  The amendment that is pending deals with section 452 of this bill. \nSection 452 deals with how the money is going to be spent, or at least \nhow it applies to the States. It has a couple of different sections. It \nstates: ``Restricted Funds.'' That is, 50 percent that States could \nspend any way they wish. That is under title (b).\n  Under the funding for child care, under section 418 of the Social \nSecurity Act, it has some new language that was put in. I don't know \nwhat the purpose of it is, but it states that notwithstanding \nsubsection (b)(2) of that section--we looked that up and basically it \nmeans we eliminate the means testing for this program. The program that \nwe are dealing with in child care is supposed to be for low income, and \nnow we find this tobacco bill coming in and saying, well, we are going \nto eliminate means testing. So millionaires' kids will qualify for \nthis.\n  That is not the purpose of the child care block grant program. And \nthen the child care block grant program was supposed to be on a State \nshare identical to Medicaid. In some States, that is 50-50, 50 percent \nFederal, 50 percent State. We put in a little change in this bill that \nsays it is 80-20, 80 percent Federal, 20 percent State.\n  Now, I am bothered by that. I am bothered by it for two or three \ndifferent reasons. One, I have stated all along I have felt this entire \nbill was a tax-spend bill. We raise a lot of taxes. We are transferring \nabout $102 billion from consumers over the first 5 years--I think over \n25 years probably well in excess of $8- or $900 billion but just for \nthe first 5 years alone, $102 billion. Half of that money we allocate \nand we say to the States, you are going to get your fair share, you are \ngoing to get part of it, and now we dictate how the States have to do \nit. But now we find out there is a little language change to say, well, \nwe are going to allocate this new money; we are going to take child \ncare development block grants, which right now total about $3 billion, \nand we are going to make it $5 billion. This is $2 billion on top of \nwhat we already have. That is a 66-percent increase per year.\n\n  Then we change the eligibility and say it is not means tested. Then \nwe change the ratio where the States don't have to put up their \nmatching share in Medicaid. We just say the Federal Government is going \nto pay 4 to 1--80 percent Federal Government, 20 percent by the State. \nSo we have a massive expansion of an entitlement program, a massive \nexpansion of who is eligible. We make higher income people eligible. It \nis just another way to see, can't we funnel more money? Can't we spend \nmore money? This is living proof this amendment is not about curbing \nsmoking. It has nothing to do with curbing smoking--nothing, not one \nthing. It is not going to reduce consumption by teenagers one iota, but \nit will spend $50 billion.\n  The amendment that we have before us says to the States, you will \nspend 50 percent, or basically $49.25 billion, over the next 25 years \nin child care, basically $2 billion a year--$2 billion a year\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nfor a program in which we are already spending $3 billion. So we spend \n$3 billion now. We increase that $2 billion per year, a 66-percent \nincrease in spending on child care development block grants. Then we \nchange the rules and say, well, we don't have means testing on the new \nmoney. And we won't use the old Federal match of Medicaid. We are going \nto come up with a new match that says, Federal Government, you have to \npay four times as much as the States. I think that is a serious \nmistake.\n  Mr. President, I hope that our colleagues will say, wait a minute, \nthis is not about reducing smoking. This amendment has nothing to do \nwith reducing smoking. It does have to do with increasing social \nspending. It is something that some people maybe have wanted to do. It \nis something we have had an increase on in the last couple of years. \nBut I would just urge my colleagues, this is not the right way to spend \nthis money. This is people saying, wait a minute, there is money \navailable. Let's take it and use it for what we deem is right. It has \nnothing whatsoever to do with curbing teenage consumption or addiction \nto tobacco or drugs, and so I would urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the McCain tabling motion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Kerry amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are working on a unanimous consent \nagreement so we can make the Gramm amendment in order after a Democrat \namendment. As we had previously agreed amongst all parties, I ask that \nSenator Faircloth be recognized to propose his amendment while we work \nout this unanimous consent--that he be allowed to start debate on his \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that no amendment will be sent to the desk at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No amendment can be sent to the desk because \nthere is a pending amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask the cooperation of our colleague that \nonce we have the unanimous consent request worked out, that the Senator \nwould yield back to us for the purposes of propounding that request, \nand allow that interruption in the debate.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I plan to start the debate on my amendment, and \nshortly the amendment will be made germane.\n  Mr. KERRY. Do I understand from the Senator from North Carolina that \nhe will allow us to interrupt him in order to propound the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Absolutely, yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to limit \nattorneys' fees in this tobacco settlement to $1000 per hour, and I am \njoined by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and the Senator from \nKentucky, Mr. McConnell.\n  The tobacco legislation is about public health--not the enrichment of \ntrial lawyers--and I believe that this is more than ample compensation \nfor these lawyers.\n  I offered a fee limitation amendment last month at $250 per hour, and \nI considered that excessive, but I was reluctant to lose votes from \nthose inclined to believe otherwise. I believe that passage of a fees \nlimitation amendment is a legislative imperative, Mr. President, but I \nam a realist. It is the obligation of this Senator to set aside \npersonal reservations and sentiments and to offer an amendment that \nwill pass the Senate and restrain the trial lawyers from their plunder \nof the Treasury.\n  I thought that $250 per hour was an inordinate reward for these trial \nlawyers and favored a far lower limitation, but I can count votes, and \nI regret that passage requires a higher cap. The trial lawyers are the \nultimate Washington special interest, Mr. President, and these \ncourtroom predators marshaled all their forces against the Faircloth \ncap and indeed forced another vote on this issue.\n  The Federal government cannot put its imprimatur on legislation that \ndiverts billions from the taxpayers to pay trial lawyers. Mr. \nPresident, this is the legislative process of the Senate, not ``Wheel \nof Fortune'' for trial lawyers.\n  If the Congress fails to enact fee limitations, Mr. President, trial \nlawyers will collect from $3 billion to $15 billion per year in fees. \nThe state Medicaid suits will yield $1 billion to $3 billion per year, \nand, the lawyers will be further enriched through their contingency \nfees from individual smoker cases, from which they will reap between $2 \nbillion and $12 billion per year.\n  In fact, if the Congress fails to enact fee limitations, trial \nlawyers stand to collect at least $100 billion over the next 25 years. \nThis $100 billion sum exceeds the annual gross domestic product of 24 \nStates and 98 foreign countries.\n  The failure to replace the arbitration provision in the McCain bill \nwith a fees limitation provision, if the Senate were so blind, would \nconstitute acquiescence to the most blatant and insidious special \ninterest legislation since the Senate convened in 1789.\n  This is a $100 billion payoff for the ultimate special interest. This \nis the Washington special interest that leads the pack in its passion \nfor personal interest over national interest.\n  The trial lawyers, Mr. President, will not bloat their stock \nportfolios at the\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nexpense of taxpayers across this nation. This tobacco legislation is, \nin essence, the fruit of an extortion pact. The Congress cannot reward \nthis legal vigilantism. The Senate is not for sale.\n  The four state cases that settled portend a dreadful abuse of the \ntaxpayers and underscore the imperative of federal fee limitations. \nJudge Harold Cohen of the Florida circuit court estimated that their \nfees of $2.8 billion were, in fact, equivalent to $185,186 per hour. \nThe five trial lawyers about to share $2.3 billion in Texas will \ncollect, in effect, close to $92,000 per hour.\n  Who are these modern Sir William Blackstones?\n  Who are these latter day Clarence Darrows and William Jennings \nBryans?\n  I discovered that Hugh Rodham, the President's brother in law, is \namongst their ranks. It is estimated that he will collect $50 million \nas a Castano group lawyer. Mr. President, permit me to read two \nnewspaper reports of his contributions to these lawsuits.\n\n       And just for good measure, the state of Florida has hired \n     Hugh Rodham (Hillary Clinton's brother) to be a part of their \n     litigation team, despite his complete lack of experience in \n     these types of cases.'' Knoxville News-Sentinel, July 20, \n     1997.\n       Hugh Rodham ``spen[t] the last hours of the talks in a \n     corner reading a paperback by Jack Higgins, `Drink with the \n     Devil.' '' Washington Post, June 23, 1997.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to address some misinformation about the \nFaircloth cap, and I believe that I can rebut all the arguments made \nagainst the amendment last month.\n  Mr. President, it was said on this floor last month that my amendment \nwas unprecedented, but this is not the case. The Federal government \noften sets professional fees.\n  Medicare and Medicaid, for example, limit physicians' fees for \nprofessional services. These doctors contribute far more to public \nhealth than the trial lawyers, but the Congress decided to limit their \nfees, so I find it remarkable that Senators will argue to exempt \nlawyers from policies intended to protect the taxpayers.\n  There are numerous federal laws that set attorneys' fees. The Equal \nAccess to Justice Act sets fees at $125 per hour in civil rights cases. \nThe Internal Revenue Code sets fees at $110 per hour in successful \ntaxpayer cases. The Criminal Justice Act sets fees at $75 per hour. \nCertainly, Mr. President, these are not uncharted waters.\n  These statutes restrict fees awards against the United States to \nprotect the taxpayers. The taxpayers, after all, pay the expenses of \nthe United States. Dan Morales, the Attorney General of Texas, admitted \nthat the taxpayers will pay part of the attorneys' $2.3 billion share \nof the Texas settlement. The principle is the same, Mr. President, and \nthese fee limitations protect the taxpayers.\n  There are countless other federal provisions that limit attorneys' \nfees--from the Veterans' Benefits Act to the Trading with the Enemy \nAct--and preempt contingency fee contracts to impose restrictions on \nthe lawyers' share of the recovery.\n\n  These statutes serve, in effect, to protect clients from their \nlawyers.\n  The taxpayers deserve the same protections, Mr. President, and these \narguments about an unprecedented fees limitation are specious and \nunfounded. The McCain bill addresses attorneys' fees provisions through \nits flawed arbitration clause, so, clearly, reasonable limitations on \nfees are within the scope of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, several members pointed to the arbitration clause in \nthe bill as an alternative to the fees cap, but the arbitration clause \nis really a ``trial lawyers' bill of rights'' rather than a protection \nfor American taxpayers. Their argument that the arbitration clause will \nalleviate concerns about excessive attorneys' fees is, in fact, a \nconcession that the fee contracts are excessive and merit review.\n  The Congress of the United States cannot shunt that obligation to a \npanel of unnamed arbitrators.\n  The arbitration clause in this bill is a one-way street that permits \nlawyers--but not their clients--to compel arbitration of attorneys' \nfees disputes. In effect, the lawyers can compel the States to \nparticipate in binding arbitration, and the outcome cannot be appealed.\n  If arbitration is indeed the exclusive remedy for fee disputes, it \nlocks in these fees because the lawyers will not object to the billion \ndollar contingent fee arrangements, and the States are not empowered to \nchallenge the fees under the arbitration clause in the bill. The \nlawyers can just file court papers to pursue enforcement of their \ncontract.\n  If arbitration is an exclusive remedy, however, it is a clear \nviolation of both the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial and state \nsovereign immunity provisions. These are serious and indeed \ninsurmountable constitutional hurdles.\n  If arbitration is not an exclusive remedy, the clause purports to let \ntrial lawyers choose between arbitration and litigation, but it forces \ntheir clients--taxpayers and tobacco users--into expensive and \nprotracted litigation battles.\n  The language in the bill authorizes the arbitration panel to award \nattorneys' fees and expenses for ``legal services'' that ``in whole or \nin part resulted in or created a model for programs'' in the bill. The \nbill thus appears to authorize fees for attorneys who played no role in \nthe underlying litigation that gave rise to the bill.\n  This bill incorporates elements of many--if not most--of the tobacco \ncontrol programs that the public health groups advocated in recent \nyears. The panel thus stands to draw fee and expense applications from \nthe armies of lawyers and legal assistants that provided public \nagencies and private organizations with advice about tobacco control \nmeasures over the years.\n  Mr. President, let us not underestimate the creative spirit of the \nplaintiffs' bar, because I assure you that this flood of fee petitions \nwill indeed materialize under this provision.\n  Finally, the arbitration mechanism applies to fee and expense \ndisputes related to litigation ``affected by'' this Act. In light of \nthe broad scope of this bill, it is possible that this mechanism will \nbe invoked not only in tobacco and health cases, but in other cases \nthat involve tobacco manufacturers.\n  It is not impossible that pure commercial cases will come within the \nscope of the arbitration mechanism to the extent that these cases are \n``affected by'' the tobacco legislation. Certainly, Mr. President, \nbillboard owners with abrogated contracts and other parties ``affected \nby'' the settlement appear to fall within the broad scope of this \nprovision.\n  I heard a lot of rhetoric last month about the constitutionality of \nthis fee limitation. However, despite the specious arguments of the \nplaintiffs' bar, the Faircloth cap is constitutional. The Supreme Court \nprecedents are clear that Congress can upset economic expectations as \npart of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. In fact, I heard members \npraise the bill last month because its regulations are so pervasive and \nits reach so broad, so the legislative history will support my \narguments.\n  Mr. President, Federal courts have routinely upheld laws that \nabrogate past contracts, so long as those laws possess a rational \nbasis. It is certainly rational to regulate fees as part of a broad \nregulatory package to ensure that an equitable amount of finite \nresources will be available to protect the national public health and \nwelfare and to compensate those who suffer from tobacco-related \ndiseases.\n  This bill will force tobacco companies to abrogate contracts with a \nrange of parties--from retailers to advertisers--but, curiously, I do \nnot see hand-wringing about the abrogation of those contracts.\n  It is a ludicrous constitutional proposition to suggest that private \nparties can enter into contracts in order to preempt congressional \nactions.\n  Further, Mr. President, this bill minimizes the risks in tobacco \nlitigation. The McCain bill makes it far easier for the lawyers to win \ntheir cases against the tobacco companies. This new courtroom landscape \ncompels the Congress to revisit these fee arrangements that date to a \ndifferent and distant era of tobacco litigation.\n  The McCain bill establishes unprecedented evidentiary presumptions \nthat reverse the traditional burdens of proof on two critical issues--\nnicotine addition and disease causation--and thus relieve trial lawyers \nof litigation expenses for these complex issues.\n  The McCain bill also establishes a tobacco document repository, which \nwill curtail--if not eliminate--the need for the discovery process. The \ndiscovery\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nprocess is long and intensive, so the McCain bill, in effect, relieves \nlawyers of the most expensive element of the litigation, which is often \ncited as the justification for their enormous fees.\n\n  Indeed, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that, \n``[O]nce we establish this document repository, it should be easier to \nprove cases that can go to jury and, I think, increase the chances of \njury awards * * * . It would be easier to recover * * * . [A]ttorneys \ntoday will have everything going for them because of the tobacco \nsettlement.''\n  It is manifest that this bill will ease their burden in the \ncourtroom, Mr. President, so it defies common sense to assume that the \nCongress will permit fees predicated upon a dramatically different \nlegal position.\n  These lawyers are officers of the court, Mr. President, so they are \nfiduciaries. These arguments about the sanctity of contract are thus \nspecious because there are different rules applicable to attorneys' \nfees. Mr. President, to argue otherwise is, in effect, to advocate the \nrepeal of the canons of ethics.\n  The common law tradition, which we uphold today, enshrines a quid pro \nquo that offers lawyers monopolistic access to the courts but that \nrequires reasonable fees to preclude exploitation of clients.\n  The old rules of the Model Code stated that ``clearly excessive'' \nfees were unethical and unenforceable. The old rules imposed a standing \nobligation--from the execution of the fee agreement to the remittance \nof the fee--to conform the fee to fiduciary principles. The more recent \nModel Rules, in fact, strengthened this limitation and replaced the \nprohibition on ``clearly excessive'' fees with a ban on ``unreasonable \nfees.'' Mr. President, if there is some semblance of ontological \ncertitude to the definition of ``reasonable,'' then the Senate will \nenact this amendment to amend these contingent fee contracts.\n  These lawyers stand to collect unimaginable rewards--billions of \ndollars--without commensurate risk. These fees and the underlying \ncontingency fee contracts are thus unreasonable under any appropriate \nstandard.\n  The most logical standard, of course, is to look to comparable work. \nThe payments to the defense lawyers--those lawyers who analyzed and \ncontested the same issues--are thus the most appropriate standard. It \nis clear that the proposed caps in this amendment far exceeds the fees \nfor defense lawyers.\n  I summarize my position as comparable pay for comparable work.\n  The contingency fee structure of these contracts further deepens this \nethical morass. The contingency fee arrangement earmarks a percentage \nof the judgment to the lawyer without limitation. These funds are, \nquite simply, diverted from the victim to the lawyer.\n  Consequently, ethicists point out that contingency fees compel a \nheightened scrutiny because these arrangements thus benefit the lawyer \nat the expense of his client. Indeed, reductions of the lawyers' fees \naccrue to the benefit of the client, and that balance compels the \nCongress to weigh in on behalf of the clients. Mr. President, those \nclients are injured smokers and the taxpayers of the United States, and \nthey deserve our support.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is fair, and it is consistent with the \nrest of this bill. The trial bar argues that a fees cap violates free \nmarket principles. It was, however, their submission of the proposed \ntobacco settlement to Congress for review and approval that removed the \nagreement from the free market and brought it into the legislative \nprocess.\n  The Congress cannot condone billion-dollar payments to a small band \nof trial lawyers for minimal efforts. Some of these lawyers copied \ncourt papers from other state lawsuits and filed these documents in \nelaborate productions choreographed for the television news. This is \nthe essence of ``jackpot justice.''\n  The trial bar cannot expect Congress to enact broad and detailed \nlegislation to regulate tobacco and, yet, believe that their component \nof the bill is sacrosanct and above congressional review.\n  Mr. President, despite vehement protestations last month, it is \nincontrovertible that this bill uses taxpayer dollars to pay off trial \nlawyers. This use of taxpayer dollars is an unacceptable diversion of \npublic funds. The Attorney General of Texas conceded to the New York \nTimes on May 27, 1998 that federal funds will be used for part of the \n$2.3 billion payment for lawyers' fees.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, the bill permits the use of revenues from the \nNational Tobacco Trust Fund to pay trial lawyers' fees. In fact, 40 \npercent of Trust Fund revenues are sent to the States for Medicare \nexpenses, but half of this sum is untethered. There is a finite pot of \nresources from the tobacco companies, so the billions of dollars that \nwill flow to trial lawyers under the McCain bill will be available for \nstate public health initiatives if Congress passes the Faircloth Cap.\n  In response to some of the other concerns voiced on the floor last \nmonth, I made some changes, which I am confident will alleviate the \nconcerns of some Senators.\n  This version of my amendment eliminates the reports to the Judiciary \nCommittees, and it simply permits the judge assigned to the tobacco \ncase to determine fees. Judges routinely review petitions for \nattorneys' fees and expenses, so this will not present any \ndifficulties, and I am confident that it is the most prudent route for \nresolution of these fee disputes.\n  Mr. President, a spokesman for Public Citizen, the group founded by \nRalph Nader, conceded that, ``My gut feeling is that these fees are \nvery, very difficult to justify.''\n  The United States Senate represents the taxpayers, not the trial \nlawyers, and this amendment is a litmus test of our commitment to the \ntaxpayers. The breadth of support for this amendment reaches across the \nspectrum because these jackpot fees offend our sense of justice.\n  The Congress cannot permit the ultimate Washington special interest--\nthe trial lawyers--to dictate this legislation and to reap unimaginable \nrewards and riches. The Congress cannot endorse an extortion pact \nfoisted upon the American public--and the Congress--by a pack of legal \npredators. The Congress cannot tax the poorest Americans--those least \nable to shoulder additional taxes--in order to shower golden dragoons \nupon trial lawyers.\n  I want to touch on one quick thing because I am ready to close.\n  If this bill passes, 70 percent of the largest tax in history is \ngoing to be paid by people making less than $35,000 a year. If anybody \ncan tell me that it is unfair to restrict the attorneys to $1,000 an \nhour when the people who are paying this tax make less than $35,000 a \nyear, 70 percent of it is going to be paid by people making less than \n$35,000 a year. No one can tell me that it is not right to restrict the \nattorney fees to $1,000 an hour.\n  The Congress cannot tax the poorest Americans, those least able to \nshoulder additional taxes, in order to shower this tremendous amount of \nmoney upon the trial lawyers of the Nation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate very much the \nconviction and hard work done by the Senator from North Carolina on \nthis important issue. It is not a political issue, although I think it \ncould become one as time goes along. It is a question of right and \nwrong. It is a question of just how rich persons can get with the money \nthat should be available to benefit children and the health care of \nAmericans.\n  So I think we have an issue of great importance. I think the Senator \nfrom North Carolina is also correct when he says that we came here a \nfew days ago and we talked about a $250 per hour containment of \nattorney fees and they said that was not enough. So we have attempted, \nagain, to come up with a bill that will pass muster in this body, that \nwill have support from both sides of the aisle, Democrats and \nRepublicans, with the kind of fees that nobody can object to, that are \nrational and just and fair and quite generous, and will, in fact, make \nmultimillionaires out of many, many lawyers.\n  I do not believe and I resist the suggestion that this capping of \nthese fees in this litigation is somehow an attack\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\non attorneys and an attack on the contingent fee contracting in \ngeneral. It has nothing to do with that. It involves only tobacco \nlitigation--tobacco litigation and legislation that was brought to the \nU.S. Senate. And we were asked to pass legislation on it. It spun out \nof litigation. It certainly has not been completed. None of the \nverdicts have been affirmed on appeal. Other cases have just gotten \nstarted. And we in the Federal Government are about to pass legislation \nthat could, in fact, terminate all of that and bring it all to a \nconclusion. The trial lawyers who had contracts, some of whom have done \nlittle work, on a contingent basis, now want to be paid billions of \ndollars in fees. Perhaps 20 or more attorneys will receive $1 billion \nin fees.\n  I would just like to point out how much $1 billion is. This Nation \nspent $450 million last year on diabetes research. The Alabama general \nfund budget for the entire State, apart from education, is less than $1 \nbillion.\n  So we are talking about huge sums of money by any standard, the kind \nof money that we have never seen before. These are the largest fees \never awarded in America, many of them for litigation only a few months \nold. It is ``unconscionable,'' as a judge in Florida has said, and it \ncannot be allowed to continue.\n  I hope this very generous legislation that allows the lawyers to \nstate their case for up to $1,000 an hour in fees will be the kind of \namendment in which everybody in this body could join.\n  I want to note why someone could not feel comfortable with that.\n  Let me share with this body a report from ``20/20'' that was done \nrecently involving the Florida litigation. This will explain how that \nlitigation prevails, just how much was involved, and how much the \nattorney gets out of it. It began with Hugh Downs. This is what he \nsaid.\n\n       What is your time worth? How does $7,000 an hour sound? \n     That's what some lawyers want to be paid for their work on \n     Florida's suit against the tobacco industry. Each and every \n     one of them could become a millionaire many times over just \n     from this one case. So did they really earn their fee?\n\n  John Stossel tells us about it.\n\n       John Stossel: ``The children are supposed to benefit * * * \n     ''\n\n  You know that we have heard a lot of talk about children and helping \nchildren. Let me ask this question: Will allowing an attorney to become \na billionaire help children? Could that money be used for other \nantismoking programs, or tax reductions for the American people? It \ncertainly could.\n\n       John Stossel: ``The children are supposed to benefit from \n     new money from antismoking programs. And later the Governor \n     invited in some children and dummied up a check to celebrate \n     the first $750 million payment. But now it turns out that the \n     Florida taxpayers may not get as much of that money as they \n     thought because Florida's lawyers are in a legal battle over \n     how much money they should get. Montgomery says they deserve \n     $2.8 billion. That's right, billion. He doesn't exactly \n     need money. This is his multimillion-dollar house in \n     luxurious Palm Beach right next to the ocean. The house is \n     so huge, it looks more like a palace. Even his Rolls Royce \n     and his Bentley live in a garage that's bigger than many \n     houses. Montgomery got this rich suing car makers and \n     hospitals and insurance companies.''\n\n  The interview with Bob Montgomery was right there at his house. He \ndescribes his lawn.\n\n       So this is my putting green, and this is my sand trap. And \n     what I do is I have these balls, and this is where I drive \n     them:\n       John Stossel: ``Out into the water.''\n       Bob Montgomery: ``Out into the water.''\n       John Stossel: ``The inside of the house is even more grand. \n     Montgomery has a vast art collection.''\n\n  Ladies and gentleman, we are talking about a lot of money. We are \ntalking about hundreds of millions of dollars, not just $1 million. One \nmillion dollars is a lot of money. A million dollars. It is an American \ndream to be a millionaire. We are talking billions, a billionaire.\n\n  Mr. Stossel goes on. He talks about how they were selected. How do \npeople get selected to file these lawsuits? Did they bid on it? Did \nthey go out and say what lawyer will take this lawsuit and what kind of \nrate will you give us and let's evaluate the best bid?\n\n       Stossel. Friendship starts to explain how some of these \n     private lawyers were selected and ended up with a contract \n     that says each is now entitled to hundreds of millions of \n     dollars. It began four years ago when Levin came up with a \n     scheme to use Florida's legislature to make it easier to win \n     a suit against big tobacco.\n\n  They interviewed Mr. Levin, a fine lawyer. I had occasion to meet the \nman, a skilled attorney, and he was very, very frank about what \nhappened.\n\n       Mr. Levin: I took a little known statute called a Florida \n     Medicaid recovery statute--\n\n  This is his exact quote--\n\n     changed a few words here and a few words there, which allowed \n     the State of Florida to sue the tobacco companies without \n     ever mentioning the words ``tobacco'' or cigarettes. The \n     statute passed in both the--the House and the Senate. No one \n     voted against it.\n       John Stossel. Well, did people know what they were voting \n     for?\n       Levin: No. And if I had told them, they'd have stood up and \n     made a--you know, they'd have been able to keep me from \n     passing the bill.\n       John Stossel. This made the suit much more winnable?\n       Mr. Levin. Oh, God, it meant it was almost a slam dunk . . \n     .\n\n  Oh, this is tough litigation. The chief plaintiff lawyer who wrote \nthe bill to make the suit possible in Florida said it wasn't tough \nlitigation; it was a slam-dunk because he changed the law in a way that \nnobody knew what he was doing to create a lawsuit that had not been \npossible before.\n  Here, Mr. Stossel goes on.\n\n       Am I missing something here? The controversy's become \n     should the dream team--\n\n  That is talking about the lawyers--\n\n     get billions from the 25-percent deal?\n\n  They had a contract, you see. We will sue these people for the State \nof Florida. We will take 25 percent of whatever we recover. And then \nthey go in and change the law and it becomes a slam-dunk lawsuit and \nthey want 25 percent of it. Then they come to Congress and say, well, \nwe have some problems with just suing. We need the Congress to pass \nglobal legislation to control this whole area of the law but don't \ncontrol our fees. You can control everything else. Tell the tobacco \ncompanies they are violating their contract, but you can't violate our \ncontract, not ours, because ours is sacrosanct because we are lawyers. \nWe are lawyers. That is our business and you can't violate our \ncontract.\n  Stossel. This is his quote.\n\n       Why do private lawyers gets so much of the State's money in \n     the first place? When this construction company got the \n     contract to replace this Florida bridge, they had to compete \n     against other construction companies. There was competitive \n     bidding. To win the job, they had to show they were qualified \n     and submit the lowest bid. All States have such rules to \n     prevent politicians from funneling projects to friends. But \n     that's not what happened with the lawyers. Here, Fred Levin \n     called some friends. You picked the dream team.\n\n  Then they interviewed Professor Lester Brickman, a law professor at \nCardozo School of Law, an outstanding professional who studied legal \nfees and how they are awarded for a number of years, and asked Mr. \nBrickman about it.\n\n       Mr. Brickman: It's an outrage. It's more than greed. It's a \n     scam.\n\n  Those are strong words: ``It's more than greed. It's a scam.''\n\n       John Stossel. Law Professor Lester Brickman, who's an \n     expert on legal fees, says it's not right for a Governor to \n     hand over such a potentially lucrative case to a friend.\n       Brickman. There are politicians involved who are stroking \n     the backs of lawyers because lawyers have stroked their backs \n     before and may yet stroke their backs again. So I think the \n     public perception here, which is probably pretty accurate, is \n     that this smells.\n       Stossel. However it smells, the deal is now mostly done. \n     Its main accomplishment is a huge transfer of wealth from not \n     tobacco companies--they'll just raise the price--but from \n     today's smokers, who will give it to State treasuries with a \n     huge cut going to lawyers like Bob Montgomery. It's like an \n     old boys' scam. You and your buddy, the Governor who sleeps \n     in your house, do your little deal together. You get rich.\n\n  John Stossel says:\n\n       The taxpayers get burned. The smokers get burned.\n\n  Finally, Mr. Stossel points out--I am quoting him now--\n\n       Finally, another clever twist you might have missed in the \n     tobacco deal is that usually when Americans want to tax \n     something--\n\n  This is very important, and I will share with you my personal \nexperience less than 2 years ago when I was attorney general of \nAlabama--\n\n     we vote on that. The legislature decides on behalf of the \n     people, but not here. Here, a Governor--\n\n  Sometimes in other States the attorney general--\n\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\n\n     and some lawyers decided, in secret, that smokers should pay \n     the State and lawyers a lot of money.\n\n  And then Mr. Levin explains why it is such a cool political deal and \nwhy many of the people in this body like it, those fellows and ladies \nwho favor tax increases and tax and spend and tax and spend. And people \nare getting mad about it. They are getting alert to it. They are \nobjecting to it. They are seeing how taxes get slipped in through this \nbackdoor and that backdoor. It is not popular, and many of them are \nlosing their places in Congress and in the State legislatures because \nthey are voting for too many taxes. That is not good.\n  So Mr. Levin tells why this is such a good deal.\n\n       The tobacco companies don't care. They can either pass it \n     on as a tax, or they can pass it on as an increase in price, \n     and tobacco companies settle with the Government. Beautiful.\n       John Stossel. What's the difference? You're still paying 60 \n     cents more for your cigarette?\n       Levin. But it's the tobacco company they can get mad at. \n     You don't hold that against the Governor.\n\n  You see, make the public get mad at the tobacco company for raising \nthe price, and the politician says, We didn't raise taxes. It was the \ntobacco company that raised the price of the cigarette. You get the \ndeal? Good politics. Mr. Levin just flat said it.\n  John Stossel concludes:\n\n       So everybody wins. Well, not the smokers, but the \n     politicians win, the tobacco companies win, the State and \n     certainly the lawyers.\n\n  Hugh Downs concludes the report:\n\n       That's really outrageous, isn't it? And Bob Montgomery may \n     well get his way because last week an appellate court judge \n     reopened the door for what could be a big payday for these \n     guys.\n\n  And Barbara Walters concluded.\n\n       As Mr. Montgomery said, ``Oh, yeah.'' But you know Senator \n     Crist is trying to have a bill that caps the amount they get \n     paid at $250,000. But even that's not bad money.\n\n  Two-hundred-fifty thousand dollars is not bad money either. I say \nthat to you.\n  I went through that report because, Mr. President, it shows how this \nthing has developed and that there is a sense and a tinge of corruption \nin the way this was done.\n  Another thing that was very unhealthy is how did the settlements \noccur and how were they justified? Well, the lawyers said for the \ntaxpayers and public citizens not to worry about it, how we got this \ncase settled and where it leads, because these fees are not paid by the \nState; they are paid by the tobacco companies. They agreed to pay our \nfee, see. I agreed with my tobacco company and they pay my fee. And it \nis not coming from the taxpayers.\n  Now, I have been a lawyer for a good while. I have litigated a lot, \nand most business people understand money and they know that the \ntobacco companies, when they settle a case, don't care whether the \nmoney they pay is called tobacco fees, lawyer fees or anything else. \nThere is so much money, they are willing to pay. And so they are \nperfectly happy if they can pay off the lawyer and give him a lot of \nmoney for their fee to get them to agree to the whole settlement. It \ndoesn't bother them in that circumstance.\n  So there is an unhealthy relationship there, and it is something good \nlawyers have to guard against at all times. You have to guard against \nthat because it can even corrupt your judgment because your money may \nbe paid from the person you are supposed to be suing and your fidelity, \nyour loyalty, your integrity is due to the people you are representing.\n  That is an unhealthy relationship. I just say to you this money \nabsolutely available to be paid to the Government to be used for tax \nreduction and the child smoking reduction effort and health care and \nhealth research, it will not be used for that; it will be sent to the \nattorneys.\n  Let's talk about something else. In Mississippi, the case there was \nan interesting case. In Mississippi, the case was brought before a \nsingle judge in Mississippi, and the case was filed in equity. It was \nnot a jury trial, it was in equity. Many States still have a \ndistinction between law courts, legal courts, and equity. Historically, \nin England, equity courts were run by the church and the law courts \nwere run by the king. In matters of divorce and family, relief of that \nkind was done in equity. They came out with an equitable doctrine of \nunjust enrichment and pursued this case for a number of years, and \nunder a theory that the tobacco companies were unjustly enriched, they \nmade their recovery. So, hundreds of millions of dollars will be paid \nout of that Mississippi case, based on that.\n  In Texas, the fee came down to be $2.3 billion for the attorneys \ninvolved in that case. I believe the firm that was involved in that had \nfour partners, five attorneys in that firm, who will split $2.3 \nbillion--quite a lot of money.\n  Professor Brickman of the Cardozo Law School has testified, I \nbelieve--as Governor George Bush of Texas is furiously and aggressively \ndoing everything he can to undermine and defeat these claims for this \nhuge amount of money--Professor Brickman has testified that he figures \nthe trial lawyers were asking for at least $92,000 per hour. I didn't \nmake that up. This is a Cardozo Law School professor saying these \nlawyers were asking $92,000 per hour.\n  Stewart Taylor, writing for the Legal Times--he also is a senior \nwriter for the National Journal--estimates that the total attorneys' \nfees will amount to $5 billion per year and quotes Professor Brickman \nas saying it will create 20 to 25 billionaire attorneys. I am talking \nabout a billionaire. I had my staff pull up--I think it is Fortune \nmagazine that lists the richest people in America. We counted 60 \nbillionaires in America. We are talking about creating numerous new \nbillionaires out of this one lawsuit--some of them have not filed a \ncase this past year--will be making $1 billion. That is just not \nacceptable. That just cannot be.\n  So I appeal to all the Members of this body, whether you are Democrat \nor Republican, to look out for justice, to look out for fairness, to \nlook out for decency. This is beyond making a good fee. I am quite \nwilling to have these attorneys make a good fee. We will let them make \n$1,000 an hour and double their expenses that they have invested in it. \nI am willing to let them. But I am telling you, that is more than I \nreally feel is necessary. But I want to gain support for this \nlegislation. I think it is absolutely critical that we contain these \nfees.\n  Where is the money coming from? Is it from the waitress? the \nconstruction person? the businessman? the gas station owner? the \nsecretary who smokes--that is who is paying it--to give it to a lawyer \nwho already has a garage with his Bentley in it, bigger than somebody's \nhouse, and who practices golf by driving golf balls out into the \nAtlantic Ocean? That is what we are talking about--a wealth transfer \nfrom decent Americans who trust their Government. They trust us to \ntreat them fairly, to pass legislation that gives them a fair chance. \nWe are taxing them to pay for this kind of thing? Wrong. It is \nunjustifiable, unconscionable, as a judge in Florida has said.\n  How did it happen? How did this all happen? I want to tell you how it \nhappened. I will tell you exactly how it happened because I was, in a \nway, there. I was attorney general of Alabama less than 2 years ago, \nand I was approached by a group of attorneys. They said, ``Well, Jeff, \nwe would like to talk to you about hiring us to sue these tobacco \ncompanies. We are working with a group of lawyers around the country, \nand we have this theory, and you can pay us 25 percent and we will just \nfile this lawsuit for you. I know your attorney general's office \ndoesn't have a lot of money, and we'll just fund that for you. You just \ngive us 25 percent of whatever we recover.''\n  And I said, ``What's your legal theory? I don't think I can file a \nlawsuit, according to the ethical rules of law, if I don't believe it's \na good lawsuit.'' So we spent a good bit of time talking about that \nfirst. When they got through, I said, ``What you are telling me is, \nthis is not an established principle of law but you want to expand the \nlaw and go further.''\n\n  And they said, ``Yes, that's correct. It hasn't been a proven theory. \nBut we have this new theory. We think we maybe can prevail on this. It \nis very popular today. Nobody likes tobacco. We believe we might just \nwin.''\n  So I told them, ``No, I don't think so. I think I'd rather have you \ngo ahead with your suits, and I'm not going to\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\nspend 25 percent of the recovery. If you prevail in Mississippi or \nFlorida or other States and you establish a cause of action, I may \nconsider joining it. But I won't need you then, because I have lawyers \non my own staff and they can handle the litigation, thank you.''\n  They didn't want to do that. They persisted and told me certain names \nof attorneys that they wanted to participate. One of the best known \nattorneys in Alabama, Jere Beasly, was a name they suggested to me--\nthat he would be part of it. And the person making the proposal to me, \nit wasn't Hugh Rodham, but he was the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama \nwho was a part-time Lieutenant Governor and a lawyer. He was coming in \nas a private attorney, and he was going to make part of the fee out of \nthe case.\n  I objected to all of this--by the way, the Lieutenant Governor has \ngreat power on legislation. We have had a lot of efforts to reform tort \nlaws and lawsuits in Alabama, and they have died in the State Senate, \nwhere he presides over the State Senate in committees that he set up \nand established. He was popular with the trial lawyers, and he asked me \nto file the suit, and I said no, I didn't think that we ought to do \nthat.\n  And he said to me, ``Well, you can hire some of your law firms. You \ncan hire some of your buddies, your Republican law firms--cut them in \non the deal. Why don't you do that, Jeff? That will be fair, won't it?\"\n  I am telling you, this is not good business that we are involved in \nhere. There is an element of greed that goes beyond what is normal.\n  So, anyway, that is the way that went. They go around the States, \nthen, approaching attorneys general with this kind of pitch. As it \nturns out, one attorney is apparently involved in litigation in 30 \nStates and another attorney group is involved in litigation in 28 \nStates. What does that mean? What they do is, they have this theory. \nThey have come up with a theory of litigation that can make billions of \ndollars in recoveries. They go into a State and get a group of local \npeople, and they also bring in the President's brother-in-law, Hugh \nRodham, make him a $50-million man because he sits in the room and \nreads a novel while they are settling the case. Let him have a little \nbit, too. Make him happy. Maybe it will make the President happy. Maybe \nhe will be supportive of us when we come in with the legislation. We \ncut in the Attorney General of Alabama; maybe he will continue to be \nfriendly to us in the State legislature. What would his fee have been? \nI don't know.\n  They go around and they get investors. People, basically, as I would \nunderstand it, buy shares. They go out to a number of the big name \nplaintiff firms in this town, community or State, and they get them to \nagree to put up so much of the money. They put the money in. Each one \nof them has a share. These major law firms that are doing most of the \nwork, they do all the brainwork, and the local guys file the pleadings \nand handle the PR and the political stuff and take care of the attorney \ngeneral, and make him look good. That is how it happens.\n  And then, boom, after Mississippi--they had that unique single judge \nin Mississippi--you had the change of law in Florida, the tobacco \ncompanies lost those big settlements, and they just collapsed and they \nagreed to pay everybody. Listen to me. In some States, the attorneys \nhad done little more than file the lawsuit and they are now claiming 25 \npercent, 15 percent, of billions of dollars in recovery.\n  Why? Because they had a contract. They signed a contract with the \nattorney general of Alabama, Georgia, whatever State. That is not good. \nThat is not a good process. I will tell you with absolute certainty and \nconviction that money paid to those lawyers is money not available to \nchildren, to antismoking programs in America. It was simply allowed to \ngo to the attorneys.\n  Why would not my brethren on the other side of the aisle, who profess \nto be so concerned about children, be involved in this? They have \naccused those who have opposed this tobacco legislation consistently of \nbeing tools of big tobacco--``Oh, they're just bought and paid for by \nbig tobacco.''\n  I will say this, I took not a dime from tobacco. I rejected tobacco \nmoney. I have not taken it and will not take it. I don't think at this \nstage of the game we ought to be taking money from tobacco. I realized \nwe were going to have a contested issue concerning tobacco, and I \nwanted to keep my record clear, so I have not taken any. A lot of other \nSenators on both sides of the aisle don't take tobacco money.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I wonder if those on the other side of the issue are \ntaking money from plaintiffs' attorneys?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Well, you have asked an absolutely important question. \nThose who have been opposed to this legislation have had their \nintegrity questioned and it was suggested that they are bought by \ntobacco. I have somewhere in this stack a little chart that indicates \nsomething about political donations.\n  From the years 1990 to 1994--I want the Senator from Texas to \nunderstand this--plaintiffs' lawyers in three States--my State and your \nState being two of the three--Alabama, California and Texas, spent \n$17.3 million on political contributions. During that time, the \nDemocratic National Committee, in all 50 States, spent $12.4 million. \nDuring that time, the Republican National Committee, in all 50 States, \nspent $10 million. During that time, big oil in Alabama, California and \nTexas spent $1.7 million. I know oil is a big industry in Texas. They \nonly spent $1.7 million in Alabama, California and Texas, whereas the \ntrial lawyers spent $17.3 million. The automobile companies in Alabama, \nCalifornia and Texas spent $3,500.\n  That shows you what has happened here. I suggest that we need to rise \nabove special interests. I believe every Member of this body has an \nobligation to his constituents--to that secretary, to that waitress, to \nthat gas station operator, to that farm equipment dealer--if he takes \ntheir money and increases taxes, to not give it away to people who live \nin mansions who practice golf by driving their golf balls out into the \nocean, and that is what we are talking about.\n  There are a number of other things that I can mention, but I see the \nSenator from Texas is here. I am pleased to yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say that our dear colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions, is a freshman Member of the U.S. \nSenate, and I am very proud of the leadership that he has provided on \nthis issue and on other issues. I think he is a testament to the fact \nthat we have good people in the U.S. Senate, and I am very proud of \nhim.\n  Mr. President, when we tell people that we are debating a bill that \nis going to set in place a procedure whereby attorneys are going to \nreceive $92,000 an hour, they find it hard to believe. But let me just \nread from an article by Robert J. Samuelson in the Washington Post:\n\n       The hourly rates strains belief. Lester Brickman of the \n     Cardozo School of Law, an expert in fees, estimates that the \n     Texas lawyers spent, at most, 25,000 hours on their case \n     which never went to trial. A $2.3 billion settlement values \n     their time at $92,000 an hour.\n\n  This is absolutely predatory. It is totally unfair to be taxing my \n85-year-old mother, because she started smoking 65 years ago, $1,015 a \nyear, which is what she will pay under this bill because she is not \ngoing to quit smoking cigarettes. It is unfair to tax her to pay a \nplaintiff's attorney $92,000 an hour. It is predatory and it is \noutrageous, and something needs to be done about it.\n  The Senator from Alabama is not proposing that we be tightfisted with \nplaintiffs' attorneys. In fact, he is proposing that they be paid \n$1,000 an hour. How many people in America would figure that they were \nbeing cheated if they were getting $1,000 an hour in a fee for work \nthat they had done? I don't think many people in America would think \nthat we are cheating lawyers by requiring that they be compensated no \nmore than $1,000 an hour for work that he had done on these cases.\n  But when asked about $1,000 an hour, a prominent attorney, who was \nquoted in the Washington Times, scoffed and said, ``That would hardly \npay for tips for my house staff.''\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\n  ``Hardly pay for tips for my house staff.''\n  Our colleagues on the left are very fond of talking about how they \nare trying to protect average citizens. Our President is always talking \nabout his position as champion of the average person. But yet what is \nhappening here is our President is supporting provisions that allow \nattorneys to be paid $92,000 an hour. Many of the Members of the \nminority here, the great majority of them, are supporting provisions \nwhere attorneys will be paid $92,000 an hour. And our colleague from \nAlabama is saying, let's set a cap in this bill that says that \nattorneys on these cases will be paid no more than $1,000 an hour. I \nbelieve that it is totally outrageous that we cannot see this amendment \nadopted by 100 votes in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  I do not see how anybody can go back home and say we are going to tax \nJoe and Sarah Brown--a waitress and a truck driver. Seventy-five \npercent of the money we are going to collect in these taxes on \ncigarettes come from Americans and families that make less than $50,000 \na year. We are going to reach in their pockets and take their money, \nand we are going to pay $92,000 an hour to plaintiffs' attorneys. It is \npredatory. It is outrageous. And something has to be done about it.\n  Is there no shame in this whole process? Is no one embarrassed by the \nfact that we are allowing this piracy to go on? I believe it is \nimperative that this amendment be adopted. I want to pledge that if \nthis amendment is rejected, that we are going to come back and raise \nthis figure and do it again and again and again and again until we cut \nthese fees off at something less than $92,000 an hour.\n  If that is not enough, or if that is no more than enough to tip your \nhouse staff, then I want people to explain to people back in their \nStates about how we are imposing a tax to raise $600 billion and turn \naround and let plaintiffs' attorneys make $92,000 an hour on the deal. \nI would be embarrassed to say that I was for allowing that to happen. I \ndo not understand how anybody--anybody--could oppose this amendment and \ngo back home and explain to people what they are doing.\n  Let me also say--this is something I do not do, but I want to respond \nto people who do it--one of the games that is played now in Washington \nis that when people cannot debate the issue, they try to attack your \nintegrity.\n  We have all these little groups around town that try to find somebody \nwho maybe runs a store that sells tobacco products--a 7-Eleven store \nfor example--who contributed to Senator Sessions' campaign or \ncontributed to Senator McConnell's campaign or my campaign or to the \ncampaigns of other of our colleagues who are here on the floor, and \nthey say, ``That was a tobacco contribution.'' But it is very \ninteresting to me that when we are debating $92,000 an hour for \nplaintiffs' attorney fees, where are these groups?\n  Why are they so silent? Who took away their tongues and their pens to \nnot write about the millions, tens of millions, perhaps hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that plaintiffs' attorneys contribute to the \nDemocratic National Committee, and who contribute to candidates who \noppose this amendment and who support this bill?\n  Now look, I don't get into the business of trying to question \npeople's motives. But the point I want to make is this: If these groups \nare going to run around trying to tag Senators as being the spokesmen \nfor some interest, I think that is perfectly legitimate. It is a tactic \nthat I do not agree with, but it is perfectly legitimate. But why are \nthey silent on this issue? Why are they silent on the source of the \ncontributions going to some of those who support the bill?\n  What we have here is a bill that has but one constituency. And that \nconstituency reminds me of a large group of vultures who want to bring \ndown this industry and then feed on the carcass. And the biggest \nappetite, in this case, belongs to the plaintiffs' attorneys who are \ngoing to make $92,000 an hour on this bill.\n  So I hope my colleagues will not stand up and say, ``We can't give a \ntax cut and eliminate the marriage penalty. We don't have enough money \nto do that.'' Well, we have enough money for attorneys to make $92,000 \nan hour. As long as we have enough money to do that, we have enough \nmoney for tax cuts.\n  We are going to see an amendment offered in a couple of days to try \nto do something about teenagers drinking. I hope it is going to be a \nbipartisan amendment. I want to predict right now that the proponents \nof this bill will stand up and say, ``We don't have enough money to do \nanything about teenage alcohol use. We are spending our money on \nteenage smoking,'' which is, in terms of public concern, a much less \nconcern than teenage drinking. But they are going to say, ``We don't \nhave the money for it.''\n  Let me suggest that we begin with $92,000 an hour legal fees. There \nis a source for money. Let us take the money from that, and let us use \nthat money on programs designed to reduce teenage drinking, drunk \ndriving, things of that nature.\n  I know my colleague from Kentucky wants to speak. Let me sum up and \nstop.\n  I am proud of our colleague from Alabama. He speaks with passion and \nwith clarity, and he is absolutely right. There are no other terms for \nthese kind of settlements other than predator and clear abuse of the \nsystem. We have in this bill a provision that sets out a commission \nmade up of lawyers to review lawyer fees. It is not an issue over \nwhether we are going to have the Federal Government involved. There is \na provision in the bill that guarantees that.\n  But rather than letting lawyers oversee fees for lawyers so they get \nthe $92,000 an hour, let us have a provision that simply says you \ncannot get more than $1,000 an hour in these cases.\n  Let me offer right now, if any of my colleagues want to come to my \nState and go with me into a local restaurant in the morning or go to \nMcDonalds--and let us try to gather up a crowd--I would like them to \nexplain why those folks ought to be taxed on their cigarettes or their \nchewing tobacco so that we can pay attorneys $92,000 an hour. If they \ncan do that in Lubbock, for example, if they can sell that in Lubbock, \nTX, then I would come back and review my position on this issue.\n  But let me predict there will not be anybody to take me up on this \nbecause anybody who would vote for this would be ashamed for people to \nknow it. But we are going to vote on it. And we are going to vote on it \nover and over and over and over until we do something about this \npredator behavior and this clear abuse of ordinary working people in \nAmerica.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Before the Senator from Texas leaves the floor--if \nthat is the direction in which he is headed--I want to thank him for \nhis important contribution to this. This bill is, more than anything \nelse, I say to my friend from Texas, about lawyers, about raising taxes \non working-class Americans and about unjustly enriching a bunch of \nsoon-to-be billionaire lawyers.\n  I think we ought to call them the ``sultans of smoke,'' because they \nare going to be as rich as sultans if we do not pass the amendment \noffered by Senator Faircloth, and spoken so eloquently on behalf of by \nthe Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, and Senator Gramm.\n  Mr. President, we have had a lot of debate over the past few weeks \nabout what provisions of this bill are most outrageous. And there is a \nlot about this bill that is outrageous. I ask my colleagues--which \nprovision is the most outrageous? Some say it is the terribly \nregressive tax on low- to middle-income Americans that is the most \noutrageous. And that certainly is outrageous. Others say it is the \nunconstitutional backdoor tax known as the look-back penalties. Still \nothers say it is the unconstitutional advertising restrictions.\n  Here we spend 3 weeks on the floor of the Senate raising taxes on \nworking-class Americans and taking away the constitutional rights of \nlegal companies.\n  I thought long and hard about which provisions of the bill truly \ndeserve the trophy for the biggest outrage, in a bill replete with \noutrages. The hands down, slam-dunk, home run winner has to be the \nlawyers' fees--the lawyers' fees. The national tobacco settlement has \nnow turned into the national trial lawyer enrichment deal. Other \nspeakers\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nhave referred to Robert Samuelson's article in the Washington Post of \nJune 3. Senator Gramm referred to it extensively, and I think this \narticle sums up much of what is wrong with the lawyer fees authorized \nby this bill.\n  More than anything else, what has become the hallmark of this bill--\nfull of outrages--is the enrichment of the plaintiffs' lawyers of \nAmerica. We are going to give a self-interested bunch of plaintiffs' \nlawyers $4 billion a year for the next 25 years--$4 billion a year for \nthe next quarter century! This is an outrage. No bill ought to leave \nthe Senate--not now, not tomorrow, not ever--that does not address this \nissue.\n  Senator Gramm called it piracy. Maybe that is even too kind of a \nword.\n  Four billion dollars a year. The only person in the world I can think \nof that has that kind of annual take, Mr. President, may be the Sultan \nof Brunei, the wealthiest monarch in the world.\n  So what we are doing here is using the power of the State and the \nFederal Government to transfer private wealth and public dollars to \ncreate a bunch of little trial lawyer sultans, the ``Sultans of \nSmoke.'' We are going to create the sultan of Mississippi, the sultan \nof Texas, the sultan of Florida, just to name a few.\n  Let's take a little trip around our currently upside-down world and \npreview our future ``Sultans of Smoke.'' First, let's go to Minnesota \nwhere a few lawyers are reportedly seeking to rake in approximately \n$450 million. The lawyers in Minnesota actually took the case to trial, \nso it is reasonable to assume they employed more attorneys and put in \nmore hours than lawyers in other States.\n  So let's assume that 50 lawyers worked a total of 100,000 hours. \nThese 50 lawyers would each take home $9 million for his or her \nlabors--$9 million. What is the hourly fee for the future sultans of \nMinnesota? That works out to about $4,500 an hour--not bad when you \nconsider the minimum wage in America is $5.15. So the plaintiff's \nlawyers in Minnesota will make $4,500 an hour.\n  Now, let's stop off in Mississippi. The latest reports out of \nMississippi are that the lawyers are seeking $250 million. The reports \nindicate that the $250 million will go to a handful of future ``Sultans \nof Smoke.'' Assuming that 25 lawyers worked on these cases for 25,000 \nhours, the Congress would be authorizing each lawyer to receive $10 \nmillion apiece as a result of congressional action.\n  So let's break that down on an hourly basis. If each of these lawyers \nworked 1,000 hours exclusively on the tobacco litigation, that would \nenable the future ``Sultans of Smoke'' in Mississippi to earn $10,000 \nan hour. Now, that is a good day's wage, especially when you consider \nthat the average lawyer in America only makes $48 an hour.\n  Now, let's stop off in Florida where a little band of trial lawyers \nare trying to take us for the ride of our lives. These soon-to-be \n``Sultans of Smoke'' are looking to receive as much as $2.8 billion. \nOne of the more eager Florida sultans has already sued for his $750 \nmillion share of the pot.\n  We don't even have to make assumptions in Florida because a judge has \nalready done the math for us. The judge looked at the greedy grab by \nthe lawyers and concluded that the demands for attorney fees, as the \njudge put it, ``Simply shock[ed] the conscience of the court.'' The \njudge concluded that, even if the lawyers worked 24 hours a day, 7 days \na week, including holidays, for over 3 years, they would earn over \n$7,000 an hour.\n  In fact, we know the actual hourly wage of the Florida lawyers is \nimmensely higher because no one can seriously contend that any lawyer, \nmuch less every lawyer, worked 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, on \ntobacco litigation for 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  But it gets better, Mr. President. The final stop on our sultan \npreview tour is Texas. Senator Gramm referred to Texas. A handful of \nlawyers in Texas are going after $2.2 billion. Let's see what kind of \nhourly fee the lawyers want in Texas. In the Texas case they did not go \nto trial, so it is reasonable to assume that Texas put in far less time \nthan Minnesota.\n  Again, assuming that 25 lawyers worked a total of 25,000 hours, then \neach of these lawyers would earn $88 million--$88 million. What kind of \nhourly fee is that for the ``Sultans of Smoke'' in Texas? It is $88,000 \nan hour, Mr. President, $88,000 an hour. Not bad when you consider that \neven the average doctor in America only earns $96 an hour.\n  If the Texas grab is not outrageous enough, this excessive, grotesque \nsum for attorneys in Texas will have to be paid out of Medicare money. \nThe New York Times recently reported that the Texas attorney general \nsaid publicly that part of the attorney fees will be paid by the \nFederal Government. And guess where it comes from? That is right, the \nMedicare money we are sending to the States in this bill.\n\n  So I ask you: Who do we pay--the sick and the elderly, or the greedy \nand the lawyerly?\n  Now the friends of the trial bar are arguing that the future \n``Sultans of Smoke'' are expecting this money. We have heard that they \nare expecting this money and, therefore, it wouldn't be fair not to \ngive it to them.\n  I don't mean to sound cold and hard-hearted, but I have absolutely no \nsympathy for any lawyer who thinks he deserves $88,000 an hour. \nMoreover, there is no reasonable expectation that any Congress, in any \nState, or any nation, would allow this band of trial lawyers to pull \noff such a scam. I repeat, these lawyers have no reasonable expectation \nthat public officials, elected to represent the best interest of the \npeople, are going to stand by and codify a right to receive an \nexcessive, gargantuan, and grotesque payment of attorney fees. Worst \nyet, these outrageous payments will continue for at least the next \nquarter century.\n  Every lawyer in this deal, and, in fact, every lawyer in this \ncountry, knows that the rules of professional conduct preclude them \nfrom charging fees that are unreasonable and clearly excessive. In \nfact, no attorney will dispute the fact that a judge could step in \ntoday and strike down any and all of these excessive fee grabs. It is \nabsolutely ludicrous to argue that the very Federal Government that is \napproving, codifying, and regulating these deals is somehow unable to \ntouch these outrageous fees.\n  In fact, let me tell you a little bit about the nature of contingency \nfees, as explained by George Will in a column earlier this year. George \nWill wrote:\n\n       Among the things that make Congress, among others, \n     irritable about the settlement are the stupendous jackpots, \n     totaling perhaps $45 billion to $55 billion, that may come to \n     lawyers hired by State governments on contingency-fee \n     contracts.\n       A Florida judge, who rejected the State's contingency fee \n     agreement as ``unconscionable and clearly excessive,'' \n     calculated that the lawyers would be paid an hourly rate of \n     $7,716--assuming each lawyer billed was working 24 hours a \n     day, every day, during the 42-month case. Some lawyers around \n     the country probably stand to be paid hundreds of thousands \n     of dollars per hour of actual work.\n\n  Further quoting George Will in his column:\n\n       Contingency-fee arrangements, under which a lawyer is paid \n     nothing if his side loses and a fixed percentage of the \n     settlement if his side wins, have traditionally been deemed \n     unethical. This is because they give a lawyer a financial \n     stake in the outcome of a lawsuit, which . . .``creates an \n     inherent conflict of interest with the lawyer's role as an \n     officer of the court.'' Contingency fees still are unlawful \n     in Britain and most of the rest of the world.\n\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. ``Contingency fees are still \nunlawful in Britain and most of the rest of the world.''\n\n       The United States long ago made a narrow ``necessary evil'' \n     exception to the general proscription of contingency fees in \n     order to help give poor people access to the courts. And the \n     American Bar Association's Code of Professional \n     Responsibility stated that ``a lawyer generally should \n     decline to accept employment on a contingent-fee basis by one \n     who is able to pay a reasonable fixed fee.'' State government \n     can pay such a fee.\n\n  In other words, State governments could pay a reasonable fixed fee.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry, I won't.\n\n       The states' tobacco lawyers demand, with more brass than \n     plausibility, that their fees be treated as an island immune \n     from Congress' general jurisdiction over the settlement.\n\n  Now, the Faircloth amendment agrees with Mr. Will's analysis and \nsimply says that no trial lawyer's sweetheart deal is an island. I \nfirmly believe that we cannot settle these\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\nState deals and create a sweeping Federal regulatory scheme for tobacco \nwithout also regulating the fees.\n  Let me repeat something that others have forcefully said. No bill \nshould leave the Senate of the United States that does not deal with \nthe unjust enrichment of lawyers contained in this bill.\n  Let me read another piece that makes similar points. The article \nappeared in a home State newspaper, the Lexington Herald-Leader:\n       Question: If on election day you were asked to chose \n     between a political candidate who promised to work for a \n     reasonable salary, and another candidate who wanted to be \n     paid 25 percent of the government's proceeds, an amount which \n     could reach billions of dollars, which candidate would you \n     vote for?\n       Many voters thought they were voting for the former, but \n     are getting the latter. That's because several dozen states \n     have chosen to farm out legal work to lawyers who will be \n     paid not for the number of hours they work but a percentage \n     of the proceeds from lawsuits.\n       Advocates for trial lawyers give several reasons why \n     lawyers should be paid large contingency fees instead of for \n     work performed, like other state employees.\n       First, they say contingency fees are the only way states \n     can afford to hire top-notch lawyers. Nonsense. Tobacco \n     litigation pits 40 states with extensive revenues (the Texas \n     state government alone collected $ 40.4 billion in 1996, \n     which is about $ 4 billion more than the domestic and \n     international tobacco revenues of the largest tobacco \n     company, Philip Morris, for the same year) against tobacco \n     companies who pay their lawyers by salary or by the hour. If \n     tobacco companies can do it, so can the states. Some have: \n     Maine has capped the fees for its lawyers at $ 150 per hour, \n     and Vermont's lawyers, in the case of a national deal, will \n     be paid no more than $ 200,000.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Private lawyers will likely reap tens of billions from \n     tobacco settlements. After they do, won't they try to keep \n     this cash cow going? If lawyers can make billions saying that \n     states are due dollars for the adverse health effects of \n     tobacco, won't they want to say the same about junk food? Or \n     liquor? Or fast cars?\n       The answer is: Yes. And that's why private profit-making \n     has no place in government decision-making. Government \n     policies should be based on their merits, not on \n     opportunities to give private lawyers billion-dollar profits.\n\n  Mr. President, I am proud to say that every state did not go out and \ncut a sweetheart deal with their trial lawyer contributors. Some states \ntook the high road in this deal and refused to allow the conflict-of-\ninterest contingency fee arrangement to taint the deal.\n  Let me read to you a piece from the Seattle Times that explains the \nrationale of these states that took the road less traveled:\n\n       Using the state's own attorneys has permitted California \n     Attorney General Dan Lungren to claim high ground and dismiss \n     suggestions that the lawsuits were motivated by the \n     plaintiff's bar.\n       The fact that we are not using outside counsel lends a lot \n     more credibility to the legitimacy of these claims,'' said \n     Tracy Buck Walsh, special assistant attorney general, who \n     is managing California's case.\n       Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton, who also had the \n     political backing of the governor, had another motive: She \n     said she is philosophically opposed to her state using \n     contingency-fee attorneys because these outside counsel are \n     motivated by more than the pursuit of justice.\n       ``We tend to be more objective than private counsel who are \n     employed on a contingency basis and who maintain their own \n     personal financial interest in the outcome of the \n     litigation,'' said Norton, a Republican. ``It gives them \n     different motives.''\n       The state of West Virginia's one-page contingency-fee \n     contract agreeing to pay one-third of the recovery, by far \n     the largest contemplated by any state, was thrown out of \n     court as unconstitutional.\n       In arguing against the contract, tobacco-industry attorneys \n     suggested that it was unethical because it compromised the \n     independence and impartiality of the quasi-judicial role \n     vested in state prosecutors.\n       ``The litigation team is wielding the coercive, regulatory \n     and punitive powers of the state,'' tobacco attorney Robert \n     King argued. Such a contract ``permits the power of the state \n     to be exercised by attorneys with a direct financial stake in \n     the exercise of that power.''\n\n  The bottom line here is that the National Lawyer Enrichment Deal \nsmells like an under-the-table arrangement cut in smoke-filled rooms.\n  The states have made deals with their lawyer friends to engage in \nwhat has been aptly referred to as ``prosecution for profit''--and we \ncan not simply bury our heads in the sand and pretend that we have no \nduty to regulate these deals.\n  In the words of the Weekly Standard:\n\n       Bribing judges was long ago made a crime. Bounty hunters \n     were banished and state prosecutors put on salary for a \n     reason--to remove any financial stake in their prosecution. \n     Contingency-fee lawyers have a stake in litigation that \n     reaches grotesque proportions. And now these lawyers are \n     being deputized by attorneys general to prosecute under the \n     cloak of state authority.\n       When these lawyers are making large political contributions \n     to the attorneys general who hire them to sue, in lawsuits \n     that have contingency fees running literally hundreds of \n     millions of dollars, prosecution for profit takes on a whole \n     new dimension. Such conflicts of interest once were \n     considered a threat to justice. Indeed they were. Indeed they \n     are.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator \nFaircloth's reasonable and fairminded amendment. Frankly, I had hoped \nthe previous amendment offered by Senator Faircloth at $250 an hour \nwould be approved. But certainly, $1,000 an hour, when the average \nAmerican entering the work force at minimum wage is making $5.15 an \nhour and when the average lawyer in America is making $48 an hour, is \nnot unreasonable.\n  The amendment says it is perfectly OK to make a great living in \nAmerica--as a trial lawyer or in any other legal occupation--but it is \nnot OK to cut sweetheart deals, ``prosecute for profit,'' and use the \nmassive, coercive, and punitive power of the State to transfer private \nand public dollars to make a few friends into instant billionaires.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, and the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions. I believe that the least we can do is \nassure that the tobacco legislation does not become a lottery for trial \nlawyers at the expense of the American taxpayer.\n  We have been debating this for several weeks. It has been mentioned \nthat we have been debating it for several weeks. Usually, when we \ndebate for 2 or 3 days on a bill, my constituents start calling and \nsaying, ``Why don't you get that wrapped up, over with?'' I have to \ntell you that those calls are not coming in. There is a fascination \nwith the debate here--a fascination, an interest, and a very deep \nconcern, because this could be the precedent for a whole bunch of other \nkinds of products. There is an interest in the attorneys' fees because \nthis could set a precedent for other product attorneys' fees.\n  Why are we doing this as part of Federal legislation? Well, if the \nStates would have been able to resolve this all on their own, the \nFederal Government would not have been involved in it. But that is not \nthe point where we are. We are at the point where the Federal \nGovernment is going ahead on its own with a tobacco bill, not a tobacco \nsettlement. We are in the process of taxing folks in the United States \nwho smoke. When we finish taxing those people in the United States, \nthere are some outstanding attorneys' fees that we will be paying out \nof the Federal funds.\n  We have to be concerned about the money and how much money is going \nto the attorneys. This is not just a matter of letting the States do \ntheir own thing. This is a case where the States said: We need to have \nyour involvement. And of course they do. It is interstate commerce. \nThere are a whole bunch of constitutional issues that come into this \nthat require Federal participation. We are now in this Federal \nparticipation. We say: Companies, you reached an agreement, but we \ndon't agree with your agreement. And so we do our own thing and we \nstart at $68.5 billion. We decided that wasn't enough money, and we \nraised it another couple hundred billion dollars, and maybe a couple \nhundred million dollars more than that. We are still coming up with \nideas for spending money. That is easy. That is a normal thing. When \nthe family has a little extra money, they are always able to figure out \nways to spend it.\n  But we are talking about taking some of that money and giving it to \npeople for a job that they did do. But we are saying, if we are \nresponsible for that money, we want to show responsibility for that \nmoney, and we think the responsibility for the money says that an \nattorney shouldn't get more than $1,000 an hour.\n  Again, I can tell from the people who are getting hold of my office \nthat they\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nthink $1,000 is a bit too high. In fact, they think it is a whole lot \ntoo high for tax money to be collected from tobacco and given out to \nother people as a precedent for the United States--$1,000 an hour. \nThere are a lot of people in my State who do not make that much in a \nmonth. They see that as a lot of money. I see that as a lot of money--\n$1,000 an hour.\n  This is just a precedent. That is why we have to talk about it so \ncarefully. We are talking about those terrible tobacco companies. They \nwithheld information. They do have a drug that is addictive. But they \nare not the only people perhaps out there. I started keeping a list of \nthe things that my constituents, the voters, the folks back home, think \nthat we ought to put on the list next. I get a lot of calls for liquor \nand a lot of calls about caffeine. What don't we know about caffeine?\n  It is getting to the point on this list now where I thought maybe a \nproject for the Senate might be to, each day, as a part of morning \nbusiness, bring in a tray similar to a dessert cart that they serve to \nyou at a restaurant that has different products on it, and we would try \nthose products and determine how beneficial or how harmful they were to \npeople and set a new tax on those. This might solve tax simplification \nfor the whole Nation, because by the time we go through all the food \nproducts in the Nation and decide what a punitive tax we ought to put \non them for information we don't know about them, that leaves a wide \nrange and we will not need any other form of tax, except of course we \nwill be figuring out new ways to spend the money as we go along.\n  The amendment before us would require the lawyers to provide a \ndetailed accounting of their legal work to Congress in relation to the \nlegal actions covered by the underlying bill, including any fee \narrangements entered into. Then it would limit the payment of the \nattorneys' fees to $1,000 an hour.\n  I know people are wondering why that is a limitation. Of course, I am \nsure they are hearing that there are some out there that are may be \ngetting $88,000 an hour or $92,000 an hour. Then when they are \nchecking, they are finding out that it is the wealthy and the connected \nlawyers who are being able to line their pockets from the settlements \nsupposedly made on behalf of the American public. This bill would \nimpose one of the most regressive taxes in America history on low-\nincome Americans. Then we have to debate whether it is fair to limit \nsomebody to $1,000 an hour.\n  Mr. President, to put these figures in a little bit of context, last \nyear the average gross receipts for the 100 top grossing law firms in \nAmerica averaged $18 million. That was for an entire firm--$18 million. \nIf this tobacco bill is not amended, some of the law firms involved in \nthe tobacco settlement will stand to gain nearly $925 million per firm. \nI would say that is a pretty good raise for relatively little work.\n\n  It is important that we reach a decision, that we put some \nlimitations on it, and that we keep people from making an unusually \nlarge amount from the tax money of the lowest-paid Americans.\n  That is where we are. A thousand dollars is higher than I would like \nit to be, but we are trying to find a range where people will say that \nis enough. We will have enough other people who will say that is too \nmuch. But I will go with it. We will get a vote that will place some \nlimitation on the way we are handling tax money for the American \npeople.\n  I thank the President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming \nis correct; we have a responsibility.\n  In meetings and almost marathon sessions around the clock with all \nSenators, 20 of us--1 finally disagreed and voted against us in the \nCommerce Committee--the distinguished Senator from Arizona, our \nchairman, made sure that everyone was factored in: That we certainly \nconsidered the health groups; Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler were there. We \nconsidered the attorneys general. We seem to forget these agreements, \nand so forth, were made by the attorneys general in consultation with \nthe White House, the health community, and the tobacco companies. We \nforget the fact, of course, that the tobacco companies--this thing has \ngotten all out of kilter--agreed to tax themselves. There was not a \nsingle Congressman and there was not a Senator at the table last June. \nThey taxed themselves. Now we are running around, we are going to save \nvictims, and everything else of that kind.\n  But let me get back to the Senator from Wyoming, because he is right, \nwe have a responsibility. The 20 of us on the committee complied with \nthat responsibility with respect to lawyers' fees that we would be \nengaged in, and the money would come to the Federal Government. Yes; as \nU.S. Senators, we are definitely responsible.\n  You will find that section, of course, on page 437 of the bill--\n``Attorneys' fees and expenses,'' and the criteria used, and everything \nelse, on arbitration.\n  We have in a responsible fashion outlined the responsibility. There \nis none of this 25 percent--none of it. Absolutely, they are looking at \nsettlements made by the several States--I think Florida, Texas, \nMississippi, and now Minnesota I think is the last one. But we are not \nthe Governor of Minnesota or Florida. We have not, as attorney general \nof Texas or Mississippi, anything to do with that. We could not \nlegislate on it.\n  We believe, as the Senator does on that side of the aisle, in the \n10th amendment, those things not outlined in the Constitution as \nresponsibilities of the Federal Government are reserved to the States. \nWhile we have one wayward former attorney general who didn't want to do \nanything, we have some outstanding attorneys general who have done \nmore--we are going to prove it--to save people from cancer than Dr. \nKoop and Kessler combined. I will get to that.\n  But I want the Senator from Wyoming to know that we have done just \nthat. We have acted in a responsible fashion. It is arbitration.\n  Incidentally, since I mentioned Florida, they ought to be ashamed of \nthemselves and take down that sign. Our distinguished President, take \ndown that sign that is absolutely false. Rodham, I don't know him--Hugh \nRodham, Hillary Clinton's brother. They put that up because they want \nto project partisan politics into this and Hugh Rodham as a part of the \nlitigation team--absolutely ludicrous. But they put a sign up there and \nthen ``drink with the Devil.'' They have all kinds of expressions. They \nare running around on the floor of the U.S. Senate with all the \npejorative terms of ``corruption,'' ``greedy,'' ``predatory,'' \n``raising taxes,'' ``slam dunk,'' ``outrage,'' ``sultans of smoke.'' \nOh, boy, they are having a heyday.\n  Oh, boy, aren't they having a heyday. Aren't they having a heyday--a \ntotal smokescreen--with respect to what the actual fact is.\n  Incidentally, you are looking at a lawyer who practiced for 20 years, \nand never by the hour. And let me identify myself as a defendant's \nlawyer as well as a plaintiff's lawyer. I represented the South \nCarolina Electric and Gas on their bus system, passenger bus. If you \nwant to defend cases, defend the suits brought by passengers on a city \ntransit system. And I can tell you here and now that about the middle \nof November, maybe even a little bit earlier, the Christmas club \nstarts. Nobody who gets on a bus wants to catch their arm in the door, \nslip down in the aisle, fall down the steps. The bus is jerking off \neverywhere. And they got all of these little suits.\n  The corporate lawyers, the regular defendant lawyers, are lazy. I \nsaid that to the chief counsel of the electric and gas company because \nI was suing them as a plaintiff and making money doing it. I said, \n``Well, tell them to come in and try the cases.'' But they settle them \nall out because they are busy and they don't want to bring the cases.\n  So I lined them all up and saved that particular corporation millions \nof dollars, and I am proud of that. I am proud to stand here when the \nSenator from Texas says they ought to be ashamed. We had this nonsense. \nWe have already voted on it. Sixty percent of the Senators, according \nto the Senator from Texas, ought to be ashamed--making all this thing \nup here of what has been going on now for years.\n  It has to do, Mr. President, with lawyers. We see it at every \nparticular turn and the political opportunism that has come about as a \nresult of an outstanding job done by lawyers. What really\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nhappened--and the Senator from Alabama said he was one who was \napproached and did nothing and is proud of it. Well, if every other \nattorney general had done that and waited for others to prove the new \ntheory, as he said--and it was a new theory; nobody had ever won a jury \nverdict--nothing would ever have happened and we would not be here.\n  If you look in the Congressional Record from January to June of last \nyear, you will not see an expression of children smoking in the \nCongressional Record. Nobody was concerned about it. I have been here \nalmost 32 years, and I have worked with the National Cancer Institute \nand the American Cancer Society, won national awards and everything \nelse of that kind. Other than putting up the notification asking for \nmore research and everything else, we were not stopping smoking. This \nwhole thing is going on here brought about by trial lawyers. It is \ngoing to eliminate a lot of cases, a lot of cancer deaths, as a result \nof smoking.\n  But, yes, they had the ingenious approach of a class action, the \ntrial lawyers did, over the past several years, culminating in the \nagreement last June. They said: We are going to continue to bring these \nclass actions even though we have not won one, and we think we have \nsome of the company's records here that the jury would take notice of \nand change their mind and give us a verdict. The attorneys general were \napproached by these particular trial lawyers, and they all joined in.\n  I will cite later on, one attorney general had to defend his life, \nhad to hide the witnesses, had to really withstand a lawsuit of hourly \npay, hourly wages--hourly, hourly, hourly. Oh, my heavens. Twenty years \nI practiced law, and if I didn't do something for the client, I did not \nget paid. And if I brought a case on a contingent basis and lost, I \nlost it; the client paid nothing. That is a wonderful thing in America \nfor middle America and the poor Americans. If you can think up a better \nsystem, think it up, because it has worked over the years. And, yes, \nour business leadership doesn't like it. They call it frivolous suits. \nWhat trial lawyer has time for a frivolous suit? He doesn't get \nanything if it is frivolous; it is going to get thrown out.\n  So the proof of the pudding on frivolous suits is to try them and \nwin, and the lawyers will quit bringing those kinds of cases if they \nare frivolous. We don't have time for frivolous suits, sham claims, and \nthose kinds of things that they talk about. We bring good cases. We \nbring good cases, and we make a mark.\n\n  That is exactly what has happened here with respect to this case. \nThey went to the attorneys general, and the attorneys general finally \ngot together with the companies. And the companies are saying: Well, we \nare winning these cases but it is costing us $500- to $600 million in \nlawyer's fees.\n  Now we want to control lawyer's fees. They never have, over here, \nworried about really making money--this crowd over on the other side of \nthe aisle. I have never seen a more sham performance than they are \nworried about anybody making money. Otherwise, I have been up here, and \nif there is an outrage, it is this billable hour crowd where ``I don't \nknow the law so I charge you as a client so much per hour to go up in \nthe library on the weekend.'' It is my call, and if I can stay ignorant \nlong enough and go up more weekends, I get more money.\n  That is the crowd that ought to be controlled. The Senators around \nhere have been involved in various hearings now that owe all kinds of \nmillions in billable hours to downtown lawyers to come and look at \ntheir records and everything else of that kind. That is the outrage \nthat bothers this particular Senator, not the lawyers who really \nbrought the case and did something.\n  And none of it is 25 percent. The truth be out and the fact is--and \ncharge me for this; it is going in the Congressional Record--8 percent \nis what is going in with respect to these cases in Florida, \nMississippi, Texas, and Minnesota. But they throw around 25 percent and \neverything else of that kind, and all of it is subject to arbitration \nand agreement.\n  In the Texas case, they already have been petitioned by the \ndistinguished Governor of Texas, and they are in a hearing, and I do \nnot know whether it will lead to arbitration; I haven't kept up with \nit. But the States know how to look out for themselves. To this States \nrights crowd on the other side of the aisle, now all of a sudden all \nthe attorneys general are dumb, don't know what they are doing, and we \nhave to protect the farmer, the filling station operator, and the \nrepairman at the garage.\n  Isn't it interesting, Mr. President. There is no plaintiff up here \ncomplaining, no plaintiff ever complaining about lawyer's fees. Who is \ncomplaining? The crowd that is crying is the one that is causing the \ninjury. They posture themselves that they are looking out for the \nfilling station operator and the working lady and the laundry woman and \neverybody else like that--poor America.\n  The only way to get a lawyer is to go in and get good representation \non a contingency basis. Isn't it interesting. You find me the plaintiff \nwho has come up and said, ``I get paid too much money.'' They are \ntickled to death to get anything, because if you left it to the \ncorporate crowd, they wouldn't get anything. I know. I have been in the \ngame. I have watched it over the years.\n  But be that as it may, they made that agreement and they said on a \ncontingent basis, which now averages out to 8 percent --despite that \nsign of pejorative terms--just to excite people around here and throw \npoison about, drinking with the Devil and all. They have all the \nwonderful little expressions, but I wish they would come out in the \nChamber and debate this thing, because I am ready to debate it and \nstand up when they end up with their peroration that we ought to be \nashamed.\n  Well, I am proud. I am proud of this particular initiative made by \nthe lawyers and the States attorneys general, because they made that \nagreement and they went in never having won before. They put in their \nown money. And go to the distinguished Attorney General Mike Moore of \nMississippi. Mr. President, you were an attorney general. Can you \nimagine bringing a case in the State of Washington and having the \nGovernor of Washington sue you because you brought the case--not just \nsay, ``General Gorton, I think you might be mistaken.'' Just sue you. \nJust sue you and make you hire a lawyer to defend yourself to do your \njob. That is Mike Moore, from Mississippi. He fought that. Had to get \nin his own pocket, and hire lawyers there the whole time.\n\n  Otherwise, they had to hide witnesses that they got from the company. \nFor 2 years they chased them around. They tried everything in the world \nto intimidate their witnesses. They really went on a struggle to come \nthis far. And some of the lawyers they are talking about--I am not that \nintimate to the case--have yet to get a red cent. They have millions of \ndollars invested in time and effort--discovery, interrogatories, \nappeals, appearances, travel, on and on and on, on behalf of the public \nof America, and they are the ones who are doing the job and not these \nSenators with this particular amendment.\n  Because if they were really interested in billable hours, I would \nrefer to some of them here who are listed by none other than our \nfriend, Steve Forbes. I worked closely with Steve Forbes. He was always \nasking me for more money. I was chairman of a subcommittee of State, \nJustice, Commerce, and he had Radio Free Europe, and Liberty. I really \nrespect him. He is a wonderful fellow, a dedicated American. He did an \noutstanding job. But don't let him act like he never saw this town, \nbecause he has, and he has been asking the town and the Government for \nmore money.\n  But he listed here, since they brought in Intel--I just got this at \nthe first thing--Andrew S. Grove, and he gets $164 million compensation \na year, coming down to $77,000 an hour. Where is the bill about the \npredatory greed, corruption, ``Sultan of Smoke,'' outrage, predatory, \nright on down the line? They don't say that Grove is all of those nasty \nthings. They say that is pretty good. Right on. And I agree with that. \nI admire him.\n  I have been to the Intel plant in Dublin, Ireland. I have to tell \nthat. I have to enjoy something this afternoon. Just to show how we do \nwork with industry, I walked into the Intel plant, a billion-dollar \nplant outside of Dublin,\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nand when I walked in the distinguished head of the plant named Frank \nMcCabe--I know everything I say is going to be checked. In a campaign, \nthey have nothing but lawyers and billable hours to check everything \nyou say, so write that down--Frank McCabe is his name. And he said, \n``Governor, glad to see you.''\n  Well, I don't remember him. But I remember him now, because he was \nwith General Electric in Irmo, a plant we brought to Irmo, SC; GE. He \nwas there for 10 years, managing that beautiful operation, and $1 \nbillion invested.\n  He said, ``You know how I got it operating and up and in the black?''\n  I said, ``No, how is that, Frank?''\n  He said, ``I went back and sent teams to Columbia, SC, where you had \nMidlands Tech, and we copied your technical training for skills, and we \nhave it over here in Ireland.''\n  So, we do not speak casually or critically of Mr. Grove. I am proud \nof him. I wish I had the ability to make $77,000 an hour.\n  The next fellow here is Mr. Eisner. Oh, I know him, and he is a \nwonderful operator. I have been out, talked to a board of young folks. \nI don't know the official name of that board, but I can tell you they \nwere the smartest young gentlemen I ever met, and ladies. They cross-\nexamined me and they knew more about what was going on in Washington \nthan any group with whom I have met. They were really updated and had \nvery thoughtful questions, and I learned from them. So I don't speak \ncritically.\n  But they got Michael D. Eisner here. Steve Forbes lists him down at \n$245 million, or $120,000 an hour. Where is the bill? Here is a fellow \nwho has more than your $90-some thousand or $80-some thousand. The \nfloor is cleared. They are not around. There is no amendment to grab \nEisner at $120,000 an hour.\n  Then, there is Stephen Hilbert. He gets $350 million, or $170,000 an \nhour. Man, this thing is going up, up, and away. I better start \nsubscribing to this magazine and see where I can get out of this \npolitical rut, trying to defend the working people of America, those \nwho cannot afford billable-hour lawyers--who cannot afford a lawyer, \nperiod--but can come in and if they have a claim or have a chance or \nwhatever.\n  One of the last cases I handled, I said, ``I don't think too much of \nthat case.'' Well, the lady said, ``Mr. Hollings, we have been to four \nother law firms and finally the sergeant out there at the police \nstation, he said that you didn't mind trying the cases. And what I am \ntelling you is right. I wasn't at fault.''\n  Well, it looked to me the way she described the particular injury, \nand the case that had come about, they had to have a moving bridge. If \nsomeone is ever interested, I will go, because I took that case all the \nway up past the circuit court of appeals in Richmond, and we won it. I \nworked for a year and a half easily, almost 2 years, my partner and \nmyself. We had a fortune tied up in that. I wish I had the time to go \ninto it this afternoon, it was very interesting. The point is, we \ndidn't know we were going to get anything for that 2-year period until \nthe end when we finally prevailed.\n  I could go down the list. Wait a minute--Sanford Weill, Travelers \nGroup, $434 million--$200,000 an hour. Where are they? Man, come on. \nDon't give me about this $80,000 an hour or $1,000 an hour. We have \npeople in America making $200,000 an hour. Yes. Yes. They are ashamed \nall right. They wouldn't come out here. They won't come out because \nthey know what we are telling is the truth about this situation.\n  What goes into an agreement is a lot of things listed here: the time \nand labor, that is the billable hour; then the novelty and difficulty \nof the question; the skill requisite; the preclusion of other \nemployment--you can go down the list of these things, on and on, about \nthe tests, the experience, reputation, ability, the attorneys involved, \nthe undesirability.\n  Can you imagine bringing a case more undesirable than to have your \nown Governor sue you for bringing the case and everybody else chasing \nyou around and calling you predatory, and ``Sultans of Smoke,'' and \neverything else like that, when what you have done was agreed upon by \nthe State?\n  And no, no, no, Senator from Wyoming, we don't have a responsibility \nother than to leave that one alone; and the one in Florida alone; and \nthe contract in Texas alone--because those were contracts made and \ncases disposed of without the Congress of the United States under \nformal agreement.\n  We are all good enough Americans to realize we are not going to \nabrogate the agreement or contract or whatever it is.\n  Even if we wanted to write it into this particular bill, we couldn't \ndo it. Those are agreements made when we were sleeping at the switch \nand not doing anything about children smoking. Now, we are all in \nheat--``children smoking,'' ``we've got to look out for the children,'' \n``they're victims, victims.'' People are bringing in their relatives \nsaying they are victims, smoking for years on end. For 30 years we have \nbeen telling them the best we could about the danger to your health on \na package of cigarettes.\n  There it is. There it is, Mr. President. They want to come in now \nwith this assault, about how they are saving people, totally \nmisrepresenting the record. There isn't any question about it, starting \nwith the Hugh Rodham sign and going down to billable allowance and our \nduty and 25 percent and the outrageous--outrageous--words again and \nagain and again.\n  Now, what's afoot? Well, any and everything on this bill, \nunfortunately, because we have drugs, we have tax cuts for marriage \npenalties, we have all kinds of little provisions here and little \nprovisions there. If you take the political polls, they say, as they \nsaid in Henry VI, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' That is what Dick the \nButcher said. But it was the greatest compliment we ever had, I say to \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my most distinguished friend, \nbecause they wanted to start anarchy and tyranny in that vast land. \nThey knew as long as there was a living lawyer to protect individual \nrights, anarchy could not prevail. So Dick the Butcher shouts, ``First, \nwe must kill all the lawyers.'' But, of course, this crowd over here \ncould care less about Shakespeare, and they are the ones who should be \nashamed of themselves, absolutely ashamed of themselves bringing on \nthis onslaught, taking up this time on a matter we have already voted \nupon.\n  Why? Because we have the billable hour crowd downtown. A lot of good \nfriends I have, and I have gotten most every award you can find from \nthe Chamber of Commerce. I love them, but they even have TV ads about \ntrial lawyers, trial lawyers. If they ever get in trouble, tell them to \nget one, because they don't want to get a corporate billable hour \nlawyer sitting on his duff up on the 32nd floor looking at his oriental \nrugs, at his mahogany desk, blinking his eyes, waiting to go to the \nclub and charging you for it.\n  It reminds me of a Sam Ervin story, when he was a Senator here, about \nthat poor doctor down there in North Carolina. He said the gentleman \npracticed medicine for 32 years and never had a vacation. He finally \ngot his son out of med school and said, ``Son, your mother and I are \ngoing to have to take off for a couple of weeks. You have to take over \nbecause we have never had a vacation.''\n  He came back off vacation and was talking to his son.\n  ``Dad, you know Mrs. Hurleeha?\"\n  He said, ``Yes, that's the lady with the bad back.''\n  The son said, ``She doesn't have a bad back.''\n  ``My God, son, did you settle that case? She paid your way through \nmed school.''\n  If you don't kill them, you can charge them, and if you don't bring \nthe case to court and keep on studying it, you get into this billable \nhour thing. That is exactly what is going on.\n  They have it with respect to the product liability, with the Coast \nGuard bill, the transportation bill. Anytime that corporate America can \nhammer on lawyers who really are bringing about safety, bringing about \ngood health, bringing about the end of smoking in America, you have \ndone something.\n  Let's get to the point. The greatest call upon any profession, Mr. \nPresident, is to rid itself of the profession. Specifically, if the \nministers can get rid of all sin, the doctors all disease, the greatest \ncall upon the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee and me \nis to get rid of all injury cases.\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\n  When I came up here 32 years ago, just about, one of the first things \nwas Love Canal. We had all the toxic fumes and the people dying. What \nhappened? We didn't sit around when it was brought to our attention, by \nwhom? Trial lawyers. We put in the Environmental Protection Agency. And \nit bothers some people getting those EPA statements, environmental \nstatements, but they have saved a lot of injury. It has saved a lot of \nlives. We have a much, much more healthy America.\n\n  Similarly speaking, we found little children burning up with \nflammable blankets in the cribs. The trial lawyers said, ``Look, there \nis no sense trying these and winning and getting money; let's stop \nburning up the children. Let's get a Consumer Product Safety \nCommission.''\n  I have been in test labs where they test not only the toys, not only \nthe cribs, but all the particular devices that go into the kitchen as \nto safety, and we have corporate America on a safety course.\n  Ask Ford Motor Company. Just the week before last, they recalled \n1,700,000 Ford pickup trucks. Why? Because of Mark Robinson out there \nwith the Pinto case in San Diego. Mr. President, 20 years ago, he got a \nverdict of $3.5 million actual damages and $125 million punitive \ndamages. He hasn't collected a dime on the punitive damages, but we in \nAmerica have collected on it, because that is why they are calling in \nthese things now. Time and again every week--Chrysler, just before \nthat, called in hatchbacks. These automobile companies don't just get a \nCPA to factor in the cause of the injury--``We can afford that rather \nthan pay the lawyers; we just settle the cases''--they are putting out \nsafe products in America. And Europe is following our example.\n  So what happens then? Along comes the trial lawyers with the \nattorneys general. They have come in now and not taxed anybody. When I \nheard this figure last June, I was almost in shock. I have worked on \nthe defense budget for 28, 29 years on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The actual amount is $250 billion, but when they came up \nwith $368 billion, I said my newspaper has gone loco. They don't know \nhow to print things. They have a mistake here. They came up with $368 \nbillion and said just increased a modest amount, and they are saying, \n``Oh, Congress is up there, tax and spend.'' And that is the companies' \nads. They are the ones who agreed to it. It was their idea.\n  Come on, we have gotten totally off track here with this political \ncharade that has been going on with attorneys' fees. ``We'll come back \nagain, and if we can't get $1,000, we'll come back for another amount; \nwe'll come back next year, and we shall return,'' like MacArthur. Come \non, they know better. We will not put in here to get the billable hours \ncrowd downtown and limit them and or take these corporation fellows who \n``deserve'' what they get. ``They produce,'' and don't tell me the \ntrial lawyers don't produce. We are here. No Congressman brought us \nhere. No Senator brought us here. The trial lawyers brought us here on \nthis particular initiative.\n  It is greed, trying to get even more, acting like we are the ones \ngiving the fees. As the Senator from Wyoming says, the provisions are \nin here for responsibility of arbitration. You wouldn't have found 19 \nSenators who would have reported this bill out for a reckless 25 \npercent and billions and billions of dollars like they are talking \nabout. It is less than what corporate America is doing, riding around \nsmiling. I met with that crowd. I like the carpetbagger up in the \nNortheast and Boston and New York.\n  When you are a young Governor, they will let you in the door. And we \nhave the blue chips, corporate America, down there. Now we travel over \nto Europe and Latin America, and we have--and we are proud of it--the \nhundreds of Hondas, the Hoffmann La Rouches, the BMWs.\n  But I can tell you here and now, let us not as a Congress bog down \ninto this political thing on account of pollster politics and start \nlimiting fees. Let us let them make their agreements. Let us, as a \nFederal program, have an arbitration like we have in everything else. \nThey have subjected themselves, I know, in Mississippi and otherwise, \nto arbitration. The trial lawyers will agree with that. Let us get away \nfrom all of this onslaught of Hugh Rodham, Hillary's brother, \neverything else like that, that they might think is a good thing to put \non national TV so they can get on C-SPAN and go again and again at the \nparticular bill that we have before us.\n  Mr. President, as a question, we had hearings on this. And there is a \nlegal question. I am sure the chairman of the Judiciary Committee will \nget into it.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. You know, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and \nsomebody who has been both a defense lawyer and a plaintiff's lawyer, I \nhave some specific thoughts and first hand experience on this issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As has this attorney.\n  Mr. HATCH. As you have been an attorney who has tried cases on both \nsides of the issue, you understand very well that without the attorneys \nin the Castano group, we would not be where we are today with the \noriginal settlement.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mr. HATCH. We would not have had a settlement that amounts to $368.5 \nbillion; not anywhere near that amount without those attorneys.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No Congressman, no Senator--just those.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is it your understanding that not one of those plaintiffs \nhas been paid a dime for this case so far?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. None of the Castano lawyers, and they \nhave been at it for years.\n  Mr. HATCH. Many of them have millions of dollars in unpaid fees in \nthis matter. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Isn't it also true a contract between a plaintiff and his \nattorney is a legally enforceable contract, which Congress should not \nimpair?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. You cannot impair the obligation of a contract \nconstitutionally. You and I both know that.\n  Mr. HATCH. If Congress, as it would be doing here, at least as I \nunderstand the intent of this amendment, were to interfere \nretroactively with private contracts, it would be unconstitutional for \na variety of reasons; isn't that right?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It would not be worth the paper we would write it on. \nWe would be wasting our time here.\n  Mr. HATCH. By capping a fee, such an interference is a taking under \nthe Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. The Supreme Court cases \nclearly show that the Federal Government cannot confiscate money or \ninterfere with a lawful contract. Is the Senator aware of that point?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. In addition, the regulation of attorneys' fees properly, \nat least as I view it, belong in the domain of the States, and such \nusurpation of State prerogatives may very well violate the Tenth \nAmendment in the eyes of many constitutional authorities. Is that \nright?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Absolutely. If the Senator would yield for just a \nsecond.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Unconstitutional. It was cited by the constitutional \nprofessor of law at the Kansas City School of Law. And I quote: ``It \nwould violate the State sovereignty protected by the 10th amendment. \nSecond, it would constitute an uncompensated taking of private property \nin contravention of the 5th amendment.''\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Recent court opinions, if my colleague would permit me to \nask another question, such as New York v. United States or Printz v. \nUnited States has made the Tenth Amendment a shield against Federal \nimpositions on the sovereign authority of the States. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. That was not always the case, but it has been so in those \ncases. Under any view of federalism, there is no justification for \nCongress, whatsoever, entering an area of pure State jurisdiction, \naltering the rights and the liabilities or remedies of private parties, \nand then dispensing with all due process protections guaranteed by the \nConstitution. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, let me ask the Senator just one or two more \nquestions. I may have a lot more to say later in this debate.\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\n  The States have already shown a willingness to step in and prevent \nunreasonable and excessive fees in the tobacco settlements. Is that \nright?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The State of Florida has stepped in and has it as a \nhearing; so has the State of Texas.\n  Mr. HATCH. In the Florida settlement, the court threw out the \ncontingency fee arrangement, which it found to be clearly excessive \nunder the circumstances. This shows that the State courts are best \nequipped to address this issue by utilizing the arbitration provision \nof the Commerce Committee bill. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, the bill that the distinguished \nSenator has worked on, the one that is on the floor before us today--as \nmuch as I dislike the bill, as much as I think it will not solve the \nproblem, as much as I think it will not bring the tobacco companies \nback to the table, as much as I think it could be written in a far \nbetter way, and as much as I think it has been substantially weakened \nby some of the amendments agreed to--the fact of the matter is that the \nbill does have a provision whereby attorneys' fees can be resolved. Is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Certainly.\n  Mr. HATCH. The bill contains a provision whereby the attorneys' fees \nwill have to be resolved in a legally reasonable manner. Isn't that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is very unlikely that anybody is going to get away with \nsome big windfall under the provisions that apply in this bill and, I \nmight add, in the substitute that we have worked on as well. Am I right \non that?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator is right on target.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, let me ask the distinguished Senator this: It seems \nto me we must also examine the precedent we are setting here in having \nthe U.S. Congress single out any one profession by capping their \nearnings.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is my plea, Senator. It might in the one instance \nbe an instrument of good, but it is the customary weapon to run amok \nand start into an area where it is totally up to the individual \nparties, on the one hand, making the agreement, but more particularly \ninvading the sovereignty of several States.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can I ask my dear friend and colleague, do we single out \nthe insurance executives or computer executives?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, sir.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the U.S. Congress set their fees or their salaries or \ntheir compensation?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. I apologize for raising these, but I just wanted to \nshow the sincerity. You know, these are all friends of mine. I admire \nthem all. And they produce that amount.\n  Mr. HATCH. Do we single out labor union leaders and say they can only \nearn so much money?\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. The Congress has a lot of good work to do, but not \nto get off in the field of this thing.\n  Mr. HATCH. I remember when Jackie Pressler was the chairman of the \nTeamsters. He came before our committee and somebody brought out that \nhe made over half a million dollars a year and was kind of needling him \nthat it was too much money for a labor union leader to make. He looked \nright up at him and said, ``Well, I want you to know that almost every \none of my corporate counterparts makes a lot more. And I'm worth every \npenny that I make for my union.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Certainly.\n  Mr. HATCH. I had to agree with him. I thought he was worth every \npenny he made, whether you agree or disagree.\n  What about entertainers? Do we set an amount of money they can make?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, sir.\n  Mr. HATCH. Or sports figures?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not at all.\n  Mr. HATCH. If Michael Jordan wants to make $60 or $80 million a year, \nor Tiger Woods, who is earning millions of dollars a year, should \nCongress be setting their salary?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate the questioning of the distinguished \nSenator, because it brings into sharp focus exactly what we are about \nhere.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask one other question. I admire some of the top \ncorporate leaders in the world as well as the top sports figures in the \nworld.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mr. HATCH. I admire people who are innovative and creative. Take Bill \nGates, for example. I admire him. I think what he has done at Microsoft \nis nothing short of phenomenal. But should we begrudge the fact that he \nhas earned his spot in our society as one of the wealthiest men in the \nworld, worth somewhere between $40 and $50 billion?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What impressed me, Senator, about Mr. Gates--I missed \nhim the other morning because I had to be on the floor--but he has some \n21,000, 22,000 individuals working for him--all millionaires.\n  Now, how do you like that? That is a wonderful business and industry. \nAnd it is his genius that has gotten it there. It was nothing we did in \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not to dwell on that industry--Steve Jobs; he deserves \nevery penny he made. He helped make the computer industry what it is \ntoday. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right.\n  Mr. HATCH. The head of Compaq, or the head of Hewlett-Packard or \nLarry Ellison, the head of Oracle, or any of them for that matter are \nall very wealthy people who some people think lucked their way into \nthis wealth. I happen to believe they worked hard and with innovation \nand creativity they were able to make this kind of compensation.\n  Are they really that much different from really top-notch plaintiffs' \nlawyers like the Castano group lawyers who really made a difference \nhere and who are responsible for bringing the tobacco industry to the \ntable and getting their agreement on the $386.5 billion settlement?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Nobody has been able to accomplish what these attorneys \nhave achieved. They brought the whole tobacco industry to their heels \nand tried to get the U.S. Congress--at least the Senate, so far--to try \nto do something about the deplorable behavior of tobacco companies. \nIsn't that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is correct, Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. Don't you think they deserve better than average \ncompensation for that significant accomplishment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. At least what is agreed to. They are complaining about \nan agreement that you didn't make and I didn't make and we have a \nresponsibility to leave alone.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me ask the Senator this question. If the Senate falls \nto pass this bill and we wind up doing nothing here or if we cut out \nthe attorney fees, they could wind up not recouping the $40 to $100 \nmillion in legal time and other expenses that they have incurred in \nthis matter; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Isn't that what contingency fees are all about?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Contingency fees are absolute risk. You are assuming \nthe cost.\n  Mr. HATCH. When I tried cases for plaintiffs on contingency fees, I \nwon most all of them. It was not a matter of not getting paid, because \nI was always able to win a bigger verdict than I could have gotten \nthrough settlement or they could have gotten through settlement.\n  The fact of the matter is, if I hadn't won the cases, I would have \nassumed those losses; isn't that right?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have done it. I have lost that.\n  Mr. HATCH. My point is, that is why contingent fees are so important. \nA lot of the people who came to me could in no way have spent a day in \ncourt without a contingency fee lawyer who was willing to take the risk \nof bringing their case before a jury and trying to recover just \ncompensation for them before that jury; isn't that true?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is correct.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been there, and I have to say, when we start \nsetting salaries for attorneys, or any other group of people, that is \ngoing to be the end of the free market system, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No question about it.\n  I see the distinguished managers of the bill. Let me yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield so I can compliment the two \nmanagers. I want to compliment the managers for the provision contained \nin this bill that resolves these matters. You have taken a reasonable \nset of language and a provision that would resolve the question of \nreasonable legal fees. I\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\nthink both manages on this bill deserve credit for having done that.\n  I will have more to say on this issue later. I am sorry I interrupted \nmy colleague, but I wanted to ask him these questions, since he had \nspoken so eloquently.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we had agreed earlier that, pending \nnegotiations with Senator Nickles, there would be a modification of the \nKerry amendment, which was not tabled. Following that language being \naccepted, then the Kerry amendment would be taken on a voice vote.\n  The debate has been on the Sessions-Faircloth amendment, which has \nnot been propounded. We would like to have Senator Sessions come over \nand propound his amendment at that time, and then Senator Kerry would \nmove to table the Sessions amendment.\n  At this time, I yield the floor so that Senator Kerry can modify his \namendment to which Senator Nickles and others have agreed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding then--and I ask \nunanimous consent that after my modification we would proceed \nimmediately to the vote on my amendment--subsequent to that, there \nwould be a 45-minute period of debate evenly divided on the Sessions \namendment, at which time that would be followed by a motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2689, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. Bond, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Wellstone, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Specter, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \n     Durbin, Mr. Graham, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2689, as modified.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2689), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 201, line 20, strike from the comma through line \n     21, and insert ``;'' after ``Act.''\n       On page 203, line 7, strike from the comma and all that \n     follows through line 14, and insert a period after (b)(2) on \n     line 7.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       (  ) Assistance for Children.--A State shall use not less \n     than 50 percent of the amount described in subsection (b)(2) \n     of section 452 for each fiscal year to carry out activities \n     under the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 \n     (42 U.S.C. 9858 et seq.).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment, \nas modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2689), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask my friend from Oklahoma if he wanted to proceed. I \nthink we are going to proceed according to the unanimous consent \nrequest, which is to go immediately to the Sessions amendment.\n  Is that the understanding of the Senator from Oklahoma?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. President, I just want to thank both my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts, as well as from Arizona, for accepting this \nmodification. The modification did a couple of things. One, as I stated \nprior to the vote, we didn't want to pass an expansion that would \nbasically take the means testing off of the child care development \nblock grant, nor did we want to change the allocation or the ratio of \nthe State match. We have corrected that.\n  I thank my friends and my colleagues for doing that. I have no \nobjection to the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, just so the legislative record is \nabsolutely clear here, there was, in the underlying bill, a change in \nsection 418 of the Social Security Act which actually transfers money \nto the child development block grant. What we arrived at was an \nagreement that there was no intention to change the means testing and/\nor distribution with respect to section 418.\n  However, it is the understanding of the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from Massachusetts that as to the money that goes directly to \nthe child care development block grant through the tobacco trust fund, \nthat money may be disbursed according to the terms of the Kerry-Bond \namendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a second to thank the \nSenator from Oklahoma. He and his very capable staff have been through \nthis bill with a fine-toothed comb. By the way, I say this with full \nunderstanding that the Senator from Oklahoma does not agree with this \nlegislation. But what he and his staff have done has been extremely \nconstructive.\n  There have been several provisions, as would be the case with a very \nlarge bill, where mistakes were made either through unintentional or \nerroneous technical printing of the bill.\n  This is not the first time that the Senator from Oklahoma has found \nunintentional provisions of the bill violating existing law and the \njurisdiction of other committees, and I appreciate very much his \neffort, because I think whether the bill passes or not, it has been \nsignificantly improved due to his efforts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, part of our agreement, and I want to make \nsure that Senator McCain agrees, and I ask further modification of the \nunanimous consent request, simply to say that, after disposition of the \nFaircloth-Sessions amendment on attorney's fees, it is then agreed that \nit would be the Democrats' opportunity to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, and I won't object, the \nSenator knows that we always have an objection from this side, but we \nhave always acted back and forth. I can assure the Senator that, if \nnecessary, I will seek first recognition so that the amendment from \nthat side could be allowed.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator. That is certainly the fair way we \nhave been moving. I thank the manager for his continued effort to make \nsure we move that way.\n  Let me say for Members who are trying to understand exactly where we \nare going, the amendment we voted on earlier this afternoon, the Kerry-\nBond amendment which carried by 66 to 30-something, was passed by the \nSenate by voice vote.\n  We will now proceed to have 45 minutes of debate remaining on the \namendment on attorneys' fees, at which point there will be a motion to \ntable and we will vote again this evening in about 45 minutes on that \namendment, at which point we will then lay down an amendment. I am not \nsure what the intentions of the majority leader will then be with \nrespect to scheduling a vote on that.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2701\n\n                  (Purpose: To limit attorneys' fees)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth], for \n     himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. McConnell, and Mr. Gramm, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2701.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 17. ATTORNEY'S FEES AND EXPENSES.\n\n       (a) Fee Arrangements.--Subsection (c) shall apply to \n     attorneys' fees provided for or in connection with an action \n     of the type described in such subsection under any--\n       (1) court order;\n       (2) settlement agreement;\n       (3) contingency fee arrangement;\n       (4) arbitration procedure;\n       (5) alternative dispute resolution procedure (including \n     mediation);\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\n       (6) retainer agreements; or\n       (7) other arrangement providing for the payment of \n     attorney's fees.\n       (b) Application.--This section shall apply to all fees paid \n     or to be paid to attorneys under any arrangement described in \n     subsection (a)--\n       (1) who acted on behalf of a State or politicial \n     subdivision of a State in connection with any past litigation \n     of an action maintained by a State against one or more \n     tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related expenditures;\n       (2) who acted on behalf of a State or political subdivision \n     of a State in connection with any future litigation of an \n     action maintained by a State against one or more tobacco \n     companies to recover tobacco-related expenditures;\n       (3) who act at some future time on behalf of a State or \n     political subdivision of a State in connection with any past \n     litigation of an action maintained by a State against one or \n     more tobacco companies tobacco-related expenditures;\n       (4) who act at some future time on behalf of a State or \n     political subdivision of a State in connection with any \n     future litigation of an action maintained by a State against \n     one or more tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related \n     expenditures;\n       (5) who acted on behalf of a plaintiff class in civil \n     actions to which this Act applies that are brought against \n     participating or nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers;\n       (6) who act at some future time on behalf of a plaintiff \n     class in civil actions to which this Act applies that are \n     brought against participating or nonparticipating tobacco \n     manufacturers;\n       (7) who acted on behalf of a plaintiff in civil actions to \n     which this Act applies that are brought against participating \n     or nonparticipating tobacco manufacturers;\n       (8) who act at some future time on behalf of a plaintiff in \n     civil actions to which this Act applies that are brought \n     against participating or nonparticipating tobacco \n     manufacturers;\n       (9) who expended efforts that in whole or in part resulted \n     in or created a model for programs in this Act;\n       (10) who acted on behalf of a defendant in any of the \n     matters set forth in paragraphs (1) through (9) of this \n     subsection; or\n       (11) who act at some future time on behalf of a defendant \n     in any of the matters set forth in paragraphs (1) through (9) \n     of this subsection.\n       (c) Attorney's Fees.\n       (1) Jurisdiction.--The determination of attorney's fees for \n     compensation subject to this section shall be within the \n     jurisdiction of--\n       (A) the court in which the action for which the claimant \n     attorney is making a claim is pending; or\n       (B) an arbitration panel selected by the parties or \n     otherwise selected by law.\n       (2) Criteria.--In the determination of attorneys' fees \n     subject to this section, the court or arbitration panel shall \n     consider--\n       (A) The likelihood at the commencement of the \n     representation that the claimant attorney would secure a \n     favorable judgment, a substantial settlement, or a successful \n     negotiation towards a global settlement agreement for \n     submission to the Congress;\n       (B) The amount of time and labor that the claimant attorney \n     reasonably believed at the commencement of the representation \n     that he was likely to expend on the claim;\n       (C) The amount of productive time and labor that the \n     claimant attorney actually invested in the representation as \n     determined through an examination of contemporaneous and \n     reconstructed time records;\n       (D) The obligations undertaken by the claimant attorney at \n     the commencement of the representation including--\n       (i) whether the claimant attorney was obligated to proceed \n     with the representation through its conclusion or was \n     permitted to withdraw from the representation; and\n       (ii) whether the claimant attorney assumed an unconditional \n     commitment for expenses incurred pursuant to the \n     representation;\n       (E) The expenses actually incurred by the claimant attorney \n     pursuant to the representation including--\n       (i) whether those expenses were reimbursable; and\n       (ii) the likelihood on each occasion that expenses were \n     advanced that the claimant attorney would secure a favorable \n     judgment or substantial settlement;\n       (F) The novelty of the legal issues before the claimant \n     attorney and whether the legal work was innovative or modeled \n     after the work of others or prior work of the claimant \n     attorney;\n       (G) The skill required for proper performance of the legal \n     services rendered;\n       (H) The results obtained and whether those results were or \n     are appreciably better than the results obtained by other \n     lawyers representing comparable clients or similar claims;\n       (I) Whether the original fee arrangement includes a fixed \n     or a percentage fee;\n       (J) The reduced degree of risk borne by the claimant \n     attorney in the representation and the increased likelihood \n     that the claimant attorney would secure a favorable judgment \n     or substantial settlement based on a chronological \n     progression of relevant developments from the 1994 Williams \n     document disclosures to the settlement negotiations and the \n     subsequent Federal legislative process; and\n       (K) Whether this Act or related changes to State laws \n     increase the likelihood of success in representations subject \n     to this section.\n       (3) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, any attorneys' fees or expenses paid to attorneys for \n     matters subject to this section shall not exceed a per hour \n     rate of $1,000 in addition to 200 percent of actual out-of-\n     pocket expenses for which detailed documentation has been \n     provided and which have been approved by the court or \n     arbitration panel in such action.\n       (4) Records requirement.--All records submitted to a court \n     or arbitration panel pursuant to this section shall be \n     available for public inspection and reproduction for a period \n     of one year from the date of adjudication of the attorneys' \n     fees.\n       (d) Severability.--If any provision of this section or the \n     application of such provision to any person or circumstance \n     is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this section \n     and the application of the provisions of such section to any \n     person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, there has been an agreement reached \nthat we will have a vote on this amendment after 45 minutes of debate, \nequally divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before the Senator proceeds, can I ask how \nis the time being allotted to both parties during the quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is charged to the Senator who suggests \nthe absence of a quorum, unless it is asked for otherwise.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nunder the quorum calls be equally divided. I did not specify that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. I \nthink it is important to keep moving and we will do that. Mr. \nPresident, I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time during quorum \ncalls will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Senator Sessions is coming to the floor and will be \nhere momentarily to speak on the bill.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield me such time as \nI may require.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am delighted to do so.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment. This effort on behalf of the U.S. Senate has a laudable and \ncommendable goal to reduce smoking among teenagers. But I regret that I \nwill not be able to support the bill for many reasons; foremost among \nthem is the fact that we are trying to enable a certain class of \nlawyers who, in many instances, I am sure have rendered legal services \nof great value, but others of questionable value. We will set \nprecedence for the collection of legal fees that have never, in my \nmemory as a lawyer, been established in the history of this country. I \njoined the distinguished Senator in a similar amendment to curtail \nthese fees.\n  I feel that the people of this country will sit back in absolute \nstunned shock should legislation pass that did not in some way try to \nproperly and fairly compensate attorneys, but not do so at the levels \nthat have been discussed in the course of this legislation.\n  I lend my strong support to this amendment.\n  Mr. President, the other features of this legislation which trouble \nme greatly is the concept of passing on to a class of persons who still \nuse tobacco, which is perfectly legal to do so, an onerous tax, \nparticularly on a class of persons that really in many respects are \nleast able to pay the tax. What we are doing is like the old days in \nthe West. We are going out and deputizing sheriffs to be tax \ncollectors. We are actually creating their own deputy tax collectors \nnow to go out and collect\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\nthis tax. We are scrambling around here trying to figure out how to \nspend it.\n  I just cannot support legislation that increases, I think, in a most \nunfair manner a tax on this class of individuals.\n  This morning I watched, as I am sure many do, the various shows, \ntelevision and news reporting shows about the reaction of the American \npublic to this legislation. They had a group of young people on. They \nall admitted to the fact that they smoked. Some said they wished they \ndidn't and would like to get off of it. I also find disturbing that we \nare putting a tax on a number of people--I don't know how you calculate \nthe number--who are smoking and would like to get off, but they simply \ncannot for various personal reasons muster the strength to do so. But \nthey are going to get punished.\n  But these young people are almost mocking the effort of the Congress \nthus far in dealing with this issue of smoking. Raising the cost of a \npack of cigarettes is simply not going to, in my judgment, in any \nsignificant way curtail the smoker. It is just not going to do it.\n  I am proud, like most in this Chamber, to have raised children who \nare grown now. We know the nature of young people. If we raise the \nprice per pack of these cigarettes, it will almost be a challenge for \nthem to go out and in some way find the money to purchase cigarettes \nand use them almost as a status symbol. Indeed, I think we run the \nrisk--and others have discussed this in great detail--of creating a \nblack market situation and almost induce criminality among the younger \ngeneration.\n  For that and many reasons, eventually I will cast my vote against \nthis legislation.\n  But on this issue this is, I think, the best attempt that I have seen \nthus far to try and recognize the injustice we are inflicting on people \nthrough taxation and that a class of beneficiaries of lawyers will be \nunjustly enriched.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by the \nSenator from Alabama and the Senator from North Carolina to try to put \nat least some limit or some reasonableness on legal fees in this bill.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say, ``Wait a minute. What about \nthe Michael Jordans and the Bill Gates, and others?'' They are not \ncompensated out of the public trust fund that comes from a tax, that \ncomes from a fee, whichever you want to call it. I call it a tax that \nis set up by Congress. Congress is in the process of raising taxes and \nfees in the first 5 years of $102 billion. That is a lot of money. And \nover the 25-year period, you usually hear the figure of $516 billion. \nBut it is a lot more than that. $516 billion doesn't index for \ninflation, and so on. We have already had charts on the floor that show \nit to be up to $880-some billion. That doesn't even count the amendment \nof Senator Durbin that was passed the other night that increased the \nlook-back penalties from $4 billion a year to about $7.7 billion a \nyear. So we may well have a tax package that over the next 25 years \nwill transfer from consumers--not tobacco companies, from consumers--\nmaybe $900 billion; maybe closer to $1 trillion.\n\n  These legal fees are coming out of this fund. This is a fund created \nby Congress. If this bill should become law--and I hope and pray that \nit doesn't, but if it does--these moneys are mandated by an act of \nCongress, and we have every right to say we want to make sure that the \nmoney goes to where we intend it to go.\n  I have heard everybody say we want it to go to reduce teenage \nconsumption of tobacco. Now we say and also consumption and addiction \nto drugs. I think likewise we have every right--as a matter of fact, we \nhave an obligation--to make sure that we don't spend excessively on \nlegal fees. We want the money to go to its stated purpose--not to be \ngoing to enhance a few trial attorneys. In some cases these trial \nattorneys would become not just millionaires but billionaires.\n  Mr. President, there was an article in the Washington Times on June \n7th. It talked about attorneys saying they deserve up to $92,000 an \nhour. This is written by Joyce Price in the Washington Times. It goes \non. I will read a couple of paragraphs and insert it in the Record.\n  It says the Orioles owner in Baltimore, Peter Angelos, who earlier \nthis decade earned about $250 million for representing ailing factory \nworkers exposed to asbestos, stands to receive as much as $875 million \nif he settles the State suit against tobacco companies to recover the \ncost of treating a smoking-related illness. It goes on. It talks about \nthe Florida case. It talks about the Texas case. It talks about the \ntotal settlement of $113 billion. But the trial attorneys would receive \n$2.8 billion, or as much as 24.7 percent of the total received in \nFlorida. In Texas, the total amount of settlement was $l5.3 billion in \nlegal fees and $2.2 billion or $2.3 billion, or about 15 percent.\n  Mr. President, those are outlandish fees. Those are fees in the \nneighborhood of $100,000 per hour. If those States negotiated, maybe \nthat is one thing. But for crying out loud. We shouldn't set up a fund \nthat is going to compensate trial attorneys all across the country to \nreceive those kind of fees, and act like we are doing it so we can \nreduce teenage consumption and addiction to tobacco. That is \nridiculous.\n  Certainly it makes sense for us, if we are going to create this trust \nfund, if we are going to have amendments, as my friend and colleague \nfrom Massachusetts just had, an amendment which said let's spend maybe \n$2 billion more in child care development. I didn't support it. He won. \nHe had the votes; congratulations to him. But we have the authority to \nsay here is where the money is going to go. This is Congress. So he won \non his amendment. I don't agree with it. I think it further confirms \nthat this bill is a tax-and-spend bill.\n  But on the spending side we have a right to say we are going to limit \non how much money we are going to spend in administrative costs and in \nlegal fees. I think it is one of the most important amendments that we \nhave.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes. I will tell my colleagues if they \ndon't support this at $1,000 an hour we are going to come back with \nanother one and maybe another one. Where is the limit going to be? \nSurely we are going to have a limit?\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Times be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 7, 1998]\n\n             Lawyers, States Tussle Over Tobacco-Suit Fees\n\n                        (By Joyce Howard Price)\n\n\n attorneys say they deserve up to $92,000 an hour; officials say this \n                          would rob the public\n\n       Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who earlier this decade earned \n     about $250 million for representing ailing factory workers \n     exposed to asbestos, stands to receive as much as $875 \n     million if he settles the state's suit against tobacco \n     companies to recover the costs of treating smoking-related \n     illnesses.\n       And Mr. Angelos is far from being the only lawyer who could \n     reap a staggering windfall from tobacco settlements.\n       Lawyers in six of the 12 private law firms that helped \n     negotiate Florida's $11 billion tobacco settlement are \n     refusing a deal that would let them share at least $280 \n     million in legal fees for their efforts.\n       Instead, the firms--most of which used only one lawyer in \n     the tobacco talks--want in excess of $2.5 billion, or as much \n     as $280 million per practice, over 25 years, and they've gone \n     to court to try to get it, says Jim Peters, special counsel \n     in the Florida Attorney General's Office.\n       ``The lawyers laugh at a payment of $280 million for all 12 \n     law firms, which would be more than $23 million per attorney. \n     One lawyer said that wouldn't be a decent tip for his house \n     staff,'' Mr. Peters said in a telephone interview.\n       There's a similar financial flap among lawyers who \n     represented the state of Texas and other plaintiffs in a \n     class-action suit against tobacco companies that was settled \n     for $15.3 billion. There, Gov. George W. Bush is fighting a \n     contingency-fee agreement authorized by the state attorney \n     general and upheld by a federal judge that will give the \n     lawyers 15 percent of the recovery, or $2.3 billion over 15 \n     years.\n       ``This is simply a giveaway of the state's money,'' Lester \n     Brickman, professor of legal ethics at the Benjamin N. \n     Cardozo School of Law in New York, said of the fortune Mr. \n     Angelos could receive.\n       But Mr. Angelos, in an interview, countered: ``We competed \n     with five other firms,\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\n     and we were selected. We have a contingency-fee contract \n     that will provide us with 12\\1/2\\ percent of recovery if \n     we win the case [against tobacco companies]. If we lose, \n     we would receive no fee.''\n       As of April, the tobacco industry had already offered \n     Maryland $4 billion to settle its tobacco lawsuit, which \n     would give Mr. Angelos $500 million. But the Baltimore lawyer \n     said Friday the expects the state will receive ``a little \n     better '' than $7 billion, which would entitle him to $875 \n     million.\n       Mr. Angelos pointed out that his firm will pay all \n     litigation costs, which he says could run anywhere from $1 \n     million to $50 million.\n       ``We have discussed a [possible] reduction of the fee. \n     We're reasonable,'' he said, but added he has nothing for \n     which to apologize. ``A San Francisco law firm that competed \n     with us offered to underwrite $1 million but they wanted 40 \n     percent of recovery,'' he said.\n       Legal compensation experts say Sen. John McCain's tobacco \n     bill, the fate of which the Senate could decide this week and \n     which has no limits on attorney fees, promises to make \n     billionaires out of some plaintiffs' lawyers who are already \n     millionaires.\n       ``That is jackpot justice for the trial lawyers, who are \n     already Washington's ultimate special-interest group,'' said \n     Sen. Lauch Faircloth, North Carolina Republican, who, with \n     Sen. Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican, tried unsuccessfully \n     to set a $250-an-hour cap on legal fees paid out under \n     proposed federal tobacco legislation.\n       Undeterred, the senators plan to try again with a higher \n     legal-fees cap, possibly as much as $1,000 per hour, aides \n     said.\n       But Mr. Brickman of the Cardozo law school said \n     contingency-fee lawyers ``do not keep hourly time records.'' \n     He explained: ``They recognize an effective hourly rate would \n     be thousands and thousands of dollars per hour, and such \n     figures would be a public relations disaster,'' he said,.\n       Mr. Brickman estimates that the Texas lawyers spent, at \n     most, 25,000 hours on their case, which did not go to trial. \n     ``The Texas lawyers will be getting $2.3 billion, or $92,000 \n     an hour. . . . I think the Florida lawyers will get $15,000 \n     to $25,000 per hour,'' he said.\n       Stephen Later, legislative counsel for Mr. Faircloth, noted \n     that Texas Attorney General Dan Morales already has said \n     taxpayers in that state will be paying a share of the $2.3 \n     billion in legal fees that a federal judge has approved in \n     that state's $15.3 billion settlement.\n       ``It's immoral to reach into the pockets of working-class \n     taxpayers in order to send billions of dollars to trial \n     lawyers so they can buy another Lear jet, another vacation \n     home or another private island,'' said Mr. Faircloth, who is \n     also mindful about how much tobacco companies in his state \n     are required to pay in litigation fees.\n       ``We all know attorneys are paid well in our society. But \n     these are the mother of all attorneys' fees. We're talking \n     about the greatest attorneys' fees in the history of the \n     world,'' said John Cox, spokesman for Mr. Sessions.\n       The goal of the tobacco settlements ``was to recoup \n     Medicaid money the states spent to treat patients with \n     smoking-related illnesses and to prevent youth smoking. It's \n     not right for these lawyers to walk away with this kind of \n     money,'' Mr. Cox said.\n       The McCain bill calls for legal fees to go to arbitration, \n     which has no fee limits.\n       Asked to comment on the size of some of the legal fees \n     being discussed, Scott Williams, a tobacco industry spokesman \n     said, ``The industry will pay reasonable attorneys' fees as \n     determined by independent [arbitration] panels.'' He did not \n     quantify that statement.\n       Mr. Later, spokesman for Mr. Faircloth, noted that \n     staggering legal fees aren't the only way the McCain anti-\n     smoking measure will ensure extreme wealth for many trial \n     lawyers. The measure has been amended to remove a proposed \n     $8-billion-a-year liability cap, he said, so ``there will be \n     a rush to courthouses all over the country'' by trial lawyers \n     representing plaintiffs in tobacco suits. An estimated 800 \n     liability lawsuits against the tobacco industry are currently \n     pending, an industry official said.\n       Mr. Peters of the Florida Attorney General's Office said \n     the compensation law firms receive from that state's tobacco \n     settlement will just be the first of many lucrative payments. \n     ``Some of these legal firms represented 25 or 30 states'' \n     that brought class-action lawsuits against tobacco firms, he \n     said.\n       An editorial last week in the Wall Street Journal described \n     Richard Scruggs, a Mississippi lawyer who helped broker \n     tobacco settlements in three states and who is representing \n     at least another seven states as a ``tobacco billionaire-in-\n     waiting.'' Mr. Scruggs happens to be the brother-in-law of \n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Mississippi Republican, \n     said Mr. Brickman.\n       Wayne Hogan, a Jacksonville, Fla., lawyer, said in a \n     telephone interview it would ``not be appropriate'' to say \n     whether he wants to receive $280 million for his work in the \n     Florida settlement, since that's a matter to be settled by \n     arbitration.\n       ``But the work done was monumental and very risky, and it \n     resulted in the disclosure of documents that were hidden \n     behind the closed doors of attorney-client privilege,'' Mr. \n     Hogan said in an interview.\n       ``And the work achieved a result for Florida taxpayers that \n     was tremendous for public health,'' he added.\n       Asked if he would be satisfied with $23 million in \n     compensation, Mr. Hogan replied, ``That would be less than \n     what the contract [between the state and trial lawyers] \n     called for.''\n       That's where Florida state officials and the lawyers \n     disagree. Mr. Peters and Gov. Chiles argue that under a \n     contingency-fee contract authorized by state law, Mr. Hogan \n     and other private lawyers are entitled to an amount ``not to \n     exceed'' 25 percent of the Medicaid funds spent to treat \n     smoking-related disorders or ``an amount that's commercially \n     reasonable.''\n       If the fees issue goes to arbitration, Mr. Peters said, \n     it's virtually certain the ``reasonable'' fee the panel would \n     award would exceed what the lawyers could get for Medicaid \n     fund recovery.\n       But Mr. Hogan and other lawyers contend that, under the \n     contingency-fee contract that was negotiated, they are \n     entitled to ``25 percent of the [full] recovery'' amount.\n       ``The lawyers filed charging liens against the state, \n     saying they are entitled to 25 percent of everything,'' said \n     Mr. Peters.\n       ``This has embargoed 25 percent of the state's first \n     payment from tobacco companies. In other words, $187.5 \n     million is tied down in court due to the lawyers' liens,'' he \n     said.\n       In addition, Mr. Peters said, ``We had a court remove \n     $203.3 million from our escrow account for money to pay the \n     lawyers. This money had been earning 5\\1/2\\ percent interest. \n     So we're losing $31,000 a day interest. Plus the court \n     imposed a 1-percent handling fee. So we're out-of-pocket \n     $35,000 a day.''\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Alabama wants to \ngo.\n  But let me just say to my friend from Oklahoma, I am not sure he is \naware of it. All the States that have settled, the four States that \nhave settled, not one dime comes out of the Federal Treasury; not one \ndime comes out of the money that is going to be raised through the \ntobacco industry in this bill. It is all paid by the industry. They \nsettled. They agreed to pay the attorneys' fees. In fact, not one of \nthe figures that the Senators have yet used in this debate is an \naccurate or real figure. Not one. Why? Because there is not a State \nwhere an attorney has yet been paid. Not one. And the reason they \nhaven't been paid is that in every State it is going to arbitration. It \nis going to be settled by the courts. It is not going to be settled in \nthe way they are saying. So they are talking about all of these \nfictitious numbers, the initial contracts. None of the new States that \nhave come to the suits are, in fact, using the level of the early \ncontracts with the lawyers when it was at 25 percent. Do you know what \nthey are using? They are using about 2 or 3 percent now. This is a \nfictitious debate, one that we have been through before.\n  I will summarize some arguments about it a little bit later. I will \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I believe the Senator from Texas would like 3 minutes. \nI would be glad to yield to the Senator from Texas. I appreciate his \nleadership on this related issue. He has done a tremendous job in \nanalyzing this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I was yielded 3 minutes. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator did not specify.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me take 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, our colleague from Massachusetts says not \none cent of these settlements comes from the money in this bill. But \nthis bill makes the payment of these settlements possible. The consumer \nis going to pay every penny of this in higher fees and taxes. So the \nnet result is that while the Federal Government is not paying these \nbills, blue-collar workers who smoke are going to end up paying each \nand every one of these bills.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that on the front page of the \nWashington Times, in a story about these $92,000-an-hour fees paid to \nthe attorneys, had the following quote:\n\n       The lawyers laugh at a payment of $280 million for all 12 \n     law firms, which would be more than $23 million per \n     attorney. This is $23 million an attorney that they are \n     talking about as a payment. ``One lawyer said that \n     wouldn't''--that is, $23 million --``be a decent tip for \n     his house staff.''\n\n  Twenty-three million dollars would not be a decent tip for his house \nstaff.\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\n How many Americans think $23 million is a pittance? The fact that we \nhave in this bill $92,000 an hour for plaintiffs' attorneys is piracy; \nit is outrageous; it is predatory on the working men and women of this \ncountry who have to work hard for a living. Many of them have become \naddicted to tobacco and nicotine, and they are going to have to pay \nhigher prices and higher taxes to pay $92,000 an hour to attorneys who \nsay a $23 million payment for an individual attorney ``wouldn't be a \ndecent tip for his house staff.''\n  If people do not have their stomachs turned at this kind of behavior, \nat this predatory, outrageous behavior, then absolutely nothing will \nturn their stomachs. I believe we have an obligation to limit these \nfees to protect working Americans who will have to pay these prices.\n  It is important to note that we already have in the bill a procedure \nwhereby the Federal Government is sanctioning these fees with a review \nby attorneys. What the Senator from Alabama is saying is, rather than \nhaving a group of lawyers review these fees for $92,000 an hour, rather \nthan having the provision which was in the original bill, we ought to \nhave a clear definition, and the Senator from Alabama has defined it \nvery simply: Give them $1,000 an hour. How many waitresses or truck \ndrivers who will be paying this tax will take $1,000 an hour? Every \nsingle one of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 17 minutes \n34 seconds remaining; the Senator from Alabama, 5 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I ask the indulgence of my \ncolleagues: We have a colleague who has to leave in about 7 minutes, if \nwe could possibly consider yielding back some of the time so that the \nSenator from Arkansas, who has an engagement, could vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. And he \nreferred to the proposal in the bill dealing with attorneys' fees. I \nsay it is, at best, ambiguous, and it is a testament to the drafters, \nin my opinion. I am not sure what it means, but it says this: If the \nattorney involved is unable to agree with the plaintiff--that is, the \nattorney general--with respect to any dispute that may arise between \nthem regarding the fee agreement, then they can go to arbitration.\n  Now, what does that mean? When you go to arbitration, you have a fee \nagreement. You are talking about the agreement. Now, some argue, well, \nthis agreement allows the arbitrators to go around the fee agreement. \nTo that I would say, if so, then the legislation already provides for \nthe undermining, going around the agreement. You can't have it both \nways.\n  But I submit to you that it is particularly interesting. The \narbitration panel is composed of three persons, one chosen by the \nplaintiff, which is the attorney general; one chosen by the attorney, \nwhich is the plaintiff's lawyer; and those two choose the third one. \nThose are the people who entered into the agreement. What kind of \nagreement is going to come out of arbitration from that?\n  Let me just say that the $2.5 billion for four lawyers in Texas \nequals about $500 million each. That is more than we spend each year on \ndiabetes in the United States. That is the kind of money we are talking \nabout--$2.5 billion.\n  Let me make a couple of other points. The arbitration clause, as I \npointed out, is ineffective and totally a sham, in my opinion, and will \nnot protect the taxpayers. Of contract rights, they say you can't \nviolate a contract. And this I say would be the principle we are \ndealing with: A person who signs a contract can keep the U.S. Congress \nor any other agency from passing a law that conflicts with that \ncontract. It is just that simple.\n\n  That is the traditional law of America. We do it when we alter the \nminimum wage. Nobody has been crying that the tobacco companies' \ncontract to run advertising is going to be terminated by these things. \nWhen Congress legislates comprehensively, it can legislate on matters \ninvolving contracts. It is done every day. And I remind the Members of \nthis body that, under the Equal Access to Justice Act, the top fee is \n$125; under Criminal Defense Attorneys, they are paid $75 per hour. I \nthink this fee is particularly generous, Mr. President. I will share \nthis with the body. Everybody has been talking about how much this body \nis influenced by tobacco contributions. I want to say I didn't take any \ncontributions from tobacco, and I do not take tobacco contributions. \nBut this is instructive about the influence and the involvement of \ntrial lawyers from 1990 to 1994. And I submit they have been more \nheavily involved in recent years. But we have these numbers.\n  Plaintiff lawyers in these States: Alabama, my home State, Senator \nGramm's State of Texas, and California, gave $17 million. During that \ntime, the Democratic National Committee in all 50 States gave $12 \nmillion; the Republican National Committee in all 50 States gave $10 \nmillion; big oil in Alabama, California, and Texas gave $1.8 million.\n  I don't consider that determinative of this issue, but I would just \nsay this. I think some people need to ask themselves some serious \nquestions about public policy. If they care about children, if they \ncare about fairness and justice, if they care whether or not they tax a \nwaitress $1,000 a year for her cigarettes, should we be turning that \nmoney over to lawyers who are making $92,000 per hour? I submit it is \nunconscionable, it is something that should not happen. It is a matter \nof the greatest importance to this body, and I ask that this amendment \nbe supported.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am sure the Senator has seen thousands of articles where \noutside groups rate how much money people received from groups that had \ninterests before the Congress. You have seen thousands of those \narticles. Have you ever seen any of those groups rate how much money \nplaintiffs' attorneys have contributed on a bill where the plaintiffs' \nattorneys are the single largest beneficiary of the bill?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I have not. I think it is an absolutely appropriate \nquestion to ask. I think it is appropriate to ask how much tobacco \ngives. I think it is appropriate to ask how much trial lawyers give. \nAnd my best judgment is, the trial lawyers are giving more to this body \nthan tobacco companies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the time allotted to the \nSenator from Alabama has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be brief and this side will be \nbrief. We will yield back some time. I know my colleagues have pressing \nflight schedules. I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Let me say to my colleague from Texas, earlier this morning he was on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate suggesting how outrageous it was for the \nU.S. Senate to tell a State what it ought to do or how it ought to \nspend its money. He said at that time, ``If I wanted to do that, I \nwould run for the Texas legislature--I would run for the State \nlegislature.'' I assume this amendment amounts to his announcement of \ncandidacy for the State legislature, because here he is, telling them \nhow they can spend money in State contracts in the State.\n  These are private contracts. Lo and behold, here is the Republican \nParty that suddenly has decided it can interfere with the private \ncontracting of private sector enterprises. I am astonished by that. Not \nonly that, almost every single fact on which--not fact, every single \nassertion that they have made today, trying to claim it as a fact, is \nincorrect. There is no $92,000 mentioned anywhere in this legislation, \nand no lawyer has been paid $92,000 an hour. In fact, every single one \nof those cases is subject to arbitration. Take the Florida case. The \njudge threw it out because it was excessive--threw it out. And they are \ngoing to resolve what is an appropriate fee.\n  What the Senator does not say is there are a whole set of criteria \nthey have to use to decide that fee. They have to consider the time and \nthe labor required by plaintiff. They have to show time sheets. They \nare going to have to come in and prove how much\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\ntime they worked. They are going to have to show how difficult the \nquestion was and the novelty of the question. They have to show they \nhave the requisite skill for those claims or to litigate them. They \nhave to show the amount that was involved in their litigation and the \nresults that they achieved. And they have to show the undesirability of \nthe action.\n  That is not an easy standard. I suggest the notion that arbitration--\nwhich requires both sides to come up with two additional people that \nthey both agree on--is not somehow subject to a test is ridiculous. \nThat is a tough process.\n  All the other arguments we are listening to today are the exact same \narguments the Senate voted on previously. There is not one different \nthing here except that, instead of having Congress be the accounting \nfactor, now they want to make the court the accounting factor. It is \nridiculous.\n  Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, although I am speaking on the same side of \nthis proposition as did the Senator from Massachusetts, I believe it is \nappropriate for us to deal with this issue. Parties whose fee \nagreements we are interfering with have come to the Congress of the \nUnited States to ratify settlements that have already been made. If we \ncan vote here on how much money States will receive and how they have \nto spend that money, if we can change the law to shift the burdens in \ntobacco litigation, we can address the issue of attorney's fees.\n  I also agree with the amendment's sponsors that we can and should set \nthe attorneys' maximum compensation. I do not agree, however, that the \namount proposed in this amendment is reasonable. It is too much for \nlawyers who bring lawsuits in the future, when, under this bill, it \nwill be much easier to prevail against tobacco manufacturers. At the \nsame time, the amount is considerably too little for those highly \nskilled attorneys who took on the tobacco companies on novel theories \nyears ago, when their chances of winning were extremely remote.\n  If we are going to set maximum attorneys' fees, we ought to set them \non a reasonable basis, a basis that fully accounts for the relative \namounts of risk, skill, and investment on the lawyers' part. \nUnfortunately, this amendment does not do this. It does not make \ndistinctions that I believe are fair and proper. For this reason, the \namendment is not a good one, and I believe that it should be tabled.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from Washington. The reality is, the Senator from Texas has \nsaid in this bill it provides for $92,000 an hour to counsel. That is \nnot true. You cannot find that on any page of this legislation. It is \njust not accurate. It is a fiction. It is made up out of whole cloth.\n  The fact is, what is provided for is, where there is a disagreement \nbetween the parties, that an arbitration panel determine what are the \nappropriate fees based on a set of criteria that includes the level of \neffort that needed to be expended, the quality of the legal counsel's \nwork, the amount of the investment that they have made. Frankly, $1,000 \nan hour is too much if somebody just went and copied the case from \nsomewhere else and then filed it. But it is much too little in the case \nof those who invested millions of dollars in court preparation of their \nown resources without knowing whether they would be victorious or not. \nIn that case, it is much too little.\n  So the problem we have with this amendment is it is one-size-fits-\nall. That is why we adopted an arbitration approach that would allow \nthose who have a difference to have it worked out so there would be \nadequate compensation, but so there would not be the kind of ripoff \nthat is, indeed, potential without what is provided for in the \nunderlying McCain bill.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  I move to table the Sessions-Faircloth amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nmy friend, Senator Coverdell, to clarify a situation that was brought \nto my attention during consideration of the Senator's Drug-Free \nNeighborhoods amendment to S. 1415. As an original cosponsor of the \namendment, I fully support the Senator's efforts to stop the spread of \ndrugs into our communities; however, one provision has the unintended \neffect of raising serious safety concerns for general aviation pilots.\n  Specifically, the amendment permits officers to order an aircraft to \nland, but does not require any reasonable suspicion of criminal \nactivity. It also could make pilots responsible for paying thousands of \ndollars to reclaim their aircraft, even if they are totally innocent of \nany wrongdoing.\n  As a pilot for over 40 years, I can assure you that the ``order to \nland'' could be a dangerous and traumatic experience for a pilot. In \nfact, the International Standards, Rules of the Air, published by the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization says ``interceptions of civil \naircraft are, in all cases, potentially hazardous.''\n  As I understand it, the intent of the amendment was to provide \nadditional authority to U.S. law enforcement officers to curtail border \ndrug smuggling, which I am sure all us agree is a laudable goal. \nHowever, because of the potential danger and immense burden to general \naviation pilots, I have worked with my friends at the Aircraft Owners \nand Pilots Association to develop some relatively minor changes that \ncould be done to take care of general aviation's concerns.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank my friend, Senator Inhofe, for bringing this \nissue to my attention. I understand the potential safety problems \ninvolved in the\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\n``order to land'' provisions, and I agree that we cannot jeopardize the \nsafety of aircraft flying near the border for innocent purposes. I \nunderstand that we can achieve the goal of fighting drug smuggling \nwithout jeopardizing safety or undermining the rights of pilots by \nrequiring reasonable suspicion and adding innocent owner provisions.\n  In fact, it was my intention to make the changes you have suggested. \nHowever, because of a parliamentary oversight, the corrections were not \nmade prior to the vote on the amendment.\n  I appreciate your leadership in resolving this issue. With your \nassistance, I will work with the conferees should S. 1415 reach \nconference to make the necessary changes to resolve these problems or \nto eliminate the provision entirely as I understand the status quo is \nacceptable.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you. I appreciate the Senator's assistance. This is \nan issue that is very important to general aviation pilots, and I look \nforward to working with you to correct this problem.\n\n\n                         explanation of Absence\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last night I was not present to vote on the \ntwo motions to table because I was in Wilmington attending the high \nschool graduation ceremony of my godson and nephew, Cuffe Owens.\n  When I left the Senate yesterday, it was not clear that any votes \nwould take place later in the evening and I did not anticipate that I \nwould miss any votes. Nonetheless, after consultation with my \ncolleagues, I left with the belief that, If these votes were ordered, \nmy absence would not affect the outcome, and it did not. Had I been \npresent, I would have voted to table the Gramm amendment, and against \ntabling the Daschle amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after consultation with the majority \nleader and the Democrat leader and the Senator from Massachusetts, it \nis now our intention to move to an amendment on the Democratic side and \nlay it down, tomorrow morning debate it, and then move to a Gramm \namendment after that.\n  It is my understanding that it is the intention of the majority \nleader, and I am sure he will make it clear, to have votes on these \nsome time around 6 o'clock on Monday evening, dispose of those \namendments, and it would be our intention to go back to a Democrat \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2702 to Amendment No. 2437\n\n(Purpose: To disallow tax deductions for advertising, promotional, and \n   marketing expenses relating to tobacco product use unless certain \n                         requirements are met)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] for himself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Ms. Feinstein, and Mr. Conrad proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2702 to amendment No. 2437.\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. DISALLOWANCE OF TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR ADVERTISING, \n                   PROMOTIONAL, AND MARKETING EXPENSES RELATING TO \n                   TOBACCO PRODUCT USE UNLESS CERTAIN ADVERTISING \n                   REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.\n\n       (a) In General.--Part IX of subchapter B of chapter 1 of \n     subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     items not deductible) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 280I. DISALLOWANCE OF DEDUCTION FOR TOBACCO \n                   ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONAL, AND MARKETING \n                   EXPENSES UNLESS CERTAIN ADVERTISING \n                   REQUIREMENTS ARE MET.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--No deduction shall be allowed under this \n     chapter for any taxable year for expenses relating to \n     advertising, promoting, or marketing cigars, cigarettes, \n     smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, or \n     any similar tobacco product unless the taxpayer maintains \n     compliance during such year with the advertising and \n     marketing provisions of part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, that were published in the Federal Register on \n     August 28, 1996.\n       ``(b) General Definitions.--For purposes of this section, \n     any term used in this section which is also used in section \n     5702 shall have the same meaning given such term by section \n     5702.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for such \n     part IX is amended by adding after the item relating to \n     section 280H the following:\n\n  ``Sec. 280I. Disallowance of deduction for tobacco advertising, \n              promotional, and marketing expenses unless certain \n              advertising requirements are met.''\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would disallow the deduction \nfor advertising expenses for tobacco companies who violate the Food and \nDrug Administration rules with respect to advertising. It is a sensible \nand constitutionally sound way to reinforce the important provisions \nthat are necessary to prevent easy access to smoking by teenagers. The \nrecord has shown very clearly that the history of the tobacco industry \nis a history of advertising that invites, entices, some would even say \nseduces youngsters into smoking. If we are serious about preventing \nteenage smoking, underage smoking, we must have effective ways to \ncurtail the advertising to marketing that is directly targeted to \nyoungsters in our society. The record from numerous documents released \nin the ongoing litigation suggest strongly, overwhelmingly that the \ntobacco industries have for years deliberately targeted youngsters as \nyoung as 12, 13 and 14 years old to get them to start smoking.\n  If we are serious about our primary goal, which is to eliminate \naccess to smoking by underage smoker, then we must pass this amendment.\n  In anticipation of further debate tomorrow on this particular \nmeasure, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, there \nwill be no further votes tonight. The Senate will debate a Democratic \namendment and the Gramm amendment to the tobacco bill during the \nremainder of today's session and Friday's session of the Senate. The \nSenate could also consider the higher education bill, or vocational \neducation, or NASA authorization, or the reauthorization of the Drug \nCzar office. These are all bills that are relatively noncontroversial, \nor there may be an amendment or two that Senators want to offer. We are \ntrying to take advantage of time that may be available tomorrow to \nconsider one of these bills. We want all Senators to be aware that we \nare trying to clear one of these four to be considered tomorrow after \nthe Democratic amendment and the Gramm amendment. However, there will \nbe no votes during the session on Friday. There will just be debate on \nthese two amendments and any bill that can be cleared out of this group \nof four.\n  Any votes ordered with respect to the amendments on the legislation \njust identified, the tobacco bill, will be postponed to occur on Monday \nat a time to be determined by the two leaders, but not before 5 \no'clock. We would like, though, to have those two votes back-to-back on \nthe two amendments, if they are necessary, to the tobacco bill, as \nclose to 5 o'clock as possible. We may begin at 5, or shortly \nthereafter, and have the two back-to-back. Then any vote, if necessary \non any bill that is cleared, would not occur until Tuesday morning at \napproximately 9:30 or 10 o'clock. We will make that specific time \navailable later.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6149-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, for almost two and one quarter \ncenturies, the United States Army, more than any other American \ninstitution, has stood at the forefront of protecting the borders, \npeople, and ideals of our nation. Today, I am pleased to have this \nopportunity to pay tribute to the Army on the 223rd anniversary of its \nfounding.\n  Formed on June 14, 1775, the United States Army is older than the \nnation itself, and for more than two centuries, its soldiers have stood \ntall as they carried out their duties patriotically and selflessly. In \nthe history of the Army, more than 42 million Americans have raised \ntheir right hands, both in times of crisis and peace, to take an oath \nto protect and defend the nation from all enemies foreign and domestic. \nIn that time, soldiers have been called to arms numerous times in order \nto preserve this Republic. From the Battle of Cowpens during our War \nfor Independence, to Bosnia, where our troops help to maintain a \nfragile peace, those who serve prove that there is no finer citizen, no \nbetter warrior, and no more compassionate peacemaker than a soldier in \nthe United States Army.\n  The success and excellence of our soldiers and Army are due to many \ncontributing factors, but certainly the most important is that we live \nin a nation founded on the ideals of a democratic government. We have \ncreated a society that truly affords more liberties, more freedoms, and \nmore opportunities than any other nation in the world. While we may \nhave some differences amongst ourselves, and some problems which must \nbe resolved, no quarrel or dispute will ever undermine the unity of our \n50 States. It is this Constitutionally mandated, democratic form of \ngovernment, where every citizen is free to speak his or her mind, where \nevery American is protected by the laws of the land, and every person \nhas the chance to succeed that makes the United States a promised land \nto people throughout the globe. All of us recognize this is a nation \nand system worthy of defending, and our soldiers are the men and women \nwho have volunteered to carry out this critical mission.\n  While our soldiers have always been ``America's Finest'', those who \nserve in today's Army are truly a breed apart. These are men and women \nwho are well educated, well trained, and well equipped. They are \nindividuals who possess a desire to serve, a strong sense of \npatriotism, and a willingness to make sacrifices so that others may be \nsafe. We have created a fighting force that uses its mind as much as \nits might. A force that is able to adapt to fluid contingencies just as \neffectively as it is able to stick to a battle plan. There is no \nmilitary force in the world that can match the abilities, capabilities, \nand spirit of the American soldier or the United States Army, there \nnever has been and there never will be.\n  The very history of this nation and its Army helps to forge the \nspirit of the modern soldier. The soldier of today can look back on \nmore than 200 years of heritage and fighting spirit that helps to mold \nthe mettle of those who stand firm for democracy and the safety of our \nnation. Rogers' Rangers, who fought in the New Hampshire mountains \nduring the French & Indian Wars are the forefathers of today's Ranger \nBattalions. The same grit and determination that saw the first American \nsoldiers through a brutal winter at Valley Forge was evident in \nBastogne, Belgium in 1945 when the 101st Airborne Division, though \nsurrounded and outnumbered by German Forces, refused to surrender and \nby stubbornly standing fast, they helped to win the Battle of the \nBulge. The bravery demonstrated by Captain Roger Donlan, a Special \nForces Officer who commanded Camp Nam Dong in the I Corps Tactical Zone \nin 1966, who was repeatedly and seriously wounded while battling off an \nenemy battalion of superior size was recognized by his winning the \nfirst Medal of Honor awarded during the Vietnam conflict. Twenty- seven \nyears later, two Special Operations soldiers were decorated with the \nMedal of Honor for making the ultimate sacrifice in the streets of \nMogadishu, Somalia fighting to protect a critically wounded American \nhelicopter pilot. Their sacrifice allowed that pilot to live, and their \nactions proved that there is no greater bond than the one between \nsoldiers.\n  Throughout the Army's history, success has been based on an ability \nto resist complacency, and while today's soldiers are justifiably proud \nof their past, they are looking and working toward the future. In \nbattle labs across the nation soldiers, strategists, scientists, and \ndesigners are working in concert to field an Army that will be able to \ndominate the battlefield of the next century. Revolutions in weapons, \ncommunications, tactics, and strategy are taking place and are being \nincorporated into Army Doctrine. By the Year 2000, the Fourth Infantry \nDivision will become the first fully digitized division in the Army, \nand by 2004 the Army will have its first digitized corps. These \ndigitized forces will ensure that commanders know where they are, where \ntheir troops are, and where the enemy is, and with this information, \ndominate the battlefield. Through research and development efforts like \nthe ones that led to the digital division, we are assured that we will \nremain one step ahead of any nation that might threaten our security, \nand that we will truly have a force capable of meeting and defeating \nany threat to our nation, her people, and our interests.\n  As we mark this 223rd anniversary of the United States Army, it is an \nappropriate time to celebrate the successes of that service; the \nsacrifices made by millions of soldiers, including the ultimate \nsacrifice; and the invaluable contribution these men and women have \nmade to keeping the United States and her citizens safe and free. \nIndeed, the history of our Army is a proud one, and as we approach the \n21st Century, I know that its future will eclipse all its previous \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6177-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6177-S6178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEATH OF MAJ. GEN. JIM PENNINGTON\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who \nwas known to many of us in this Chamber, retired Major General Jim \nPennington, who passed away on June 5, 1998.\n  Those of us who worked on national security and veterans related \nmatters knew General Pennington very well. He served as both the \nPresident of the National Association for Uniformed Services and the \nAdministrator for the Society of Military Widows. In those capacities, \nhe was an able and effective advocate for a strong defense and for \nproviding for an appropriate quality of life for those who serve and \nhave served the Nation as members of the armed forces.\n  General Pennington had an impressive career as a soldier. He joined \nthe Army on June 6, 1944, the day the Allies invaded Normandy and began \ntheir march toward Germany and victory, and he fought in the Battle of \nthe Bulge. In his more than 37-year career, Jim Pennington rose from \nthe rank of private to sergeant major, and then ultimately major \ngeneral, the rank he held when he retired from military service in \n1981.\n  As many tens of thousands of other World War II veterans did, Jim \nPennington used the G.I. Bill to get a college education. This was an \ninvaluable program that not only provided an important benefit to those \nwho spent years of their lives in military service, but it created a \ngeneration of Americans who possessed the skills and knowledge required \nto make the United States the world's leader in matters of commerce, \nglobal security issues, and technology.\n  I had the pleasure of working closely with General Pennington on a \nnumber of issues throughout his tenure as the President of the National \nAssociation of Uniformed Services and the Administrator of the Society \nof Military Widows.

Consistent with decisions taken at the meetings of the \nContact Group of countries, consisting of the United States, the United \nKingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia, in Birmingham, England, on \nMay 16, 1998, and in Rome on April 29, 1998, the United States will \nimpose a freeze on the assets of the Governments of the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, \nand the Republic of Montenegro, and a ban on new investment in the \nRepublic of Serbia. It is our intent to exempt the Government of \nMontenegro from these sanctions wherever possible.\n  The Contact Group originally agreed in Rome on April 29 to impose \nthese sanctions in response to the increasingly dangerous situation in \nKosovo and Belgrade's failure to meet crucial requirements concerning \nthe adoption of a framework for dialogue with the Kosovar Albanian \nleadership and a stabilization package, as set out in earlier Contact \nGroup meetings in London on March 9, 1998, and in Bonn on March 25, \n1998. The G8 Foreign Ministers reaffirmed the need to impose sanctions \nat their meeting in London on May 8-9, 1998. The Russian Federation did \nnot associate itself with these sanction measures.\n  At the May 16 meeting in Birmingham, England, the Contact Group \nwelcomed the establishment of a dialogue between Belgrade and the \nKosovar Albanian leadership. With the start of this dialogue, those \nContact Group countries that had previously agreed to implement \neconomic measures against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia \nand Montenegro) and the Republic of Serbia agreed that the proposed \nmeasure to stop new investment in the Republic of Serbia would not be \nput into effect and that they would review at their next meeting the \nimplementation of the freeze on funds. However, the use of \nindiscriminate force by the police and armed forces of the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Republic of \nSerbia has undermined the basis for dialogue.\n\n  The Contact Group has concluded that the current situation in Kosovo \nis untenable and the risk of an escalating conflict requires immediate \naction. It has also found that, if unresolved, the conflict threatens \nto spill over to other parts of the region. The United States attaches \nhigh priority to supporting the security interests of the neighboring \nstates and to ensuring security of borders. It is also of particular \nimportance that developments in Kosovo should not disrupt progress in \nimplementing the Dayton peace agreement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This \nthreat to the peace of the region constitutes an unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States.\n  On June 9, 1998, by the authority vested in me as President by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States of America, including the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), \nthe National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 \nof title 3 of the United States Code, I declared a national emergency \nto respond to the unacceptable actions and policies of the Belgrade \nauthorities and issued an Executive order to implement the measures \ncalled for by the Contact Group. That order freezes the assets of the \nGovernments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of Montenegro \nthat are under U.S. jurisdiction and, in concert with the other Contact \nGroup countries, restricts access of those governments to the \ninternational financial system. That order also prohibits new \ninvestment by United States persons, or their facilitation of other \npersons' new investment, in the Republic of Serbia. It is our intent to \nexempt the Government of the Republic of Montenegro, by means of \nlicenses, from the prohibitions contained in the order wherever \npossible. That government has been included in the order to ensure \neffective implementation of sanctions against the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), of which the Republic of Montenegro \nis a constituent part.\n  The order carries out these measures by:\n  --blocking all property, and interests in property, of the \n    Governments of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \n    Montenegro), the Republic of Serbia, and the Republic of \n    Montenegro, including the prohibition of financial transactions \n    with, including trade financing for, those governments; and\n  --prohibiting new investment by United States persons, or their \n    facilitation of other persons' new investment, in the territory of \n    the Republic of Serbia.\n  The order provides that the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, is authorized to take such \nactions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, as may be \nnecessary to carry out the purposes of the order. Thus, in the event of \nimprovements in the actions and policies of Belgrade with respect to \nthe situation in Kosovo, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, would have the ability, through the \nissuance of general or specific licenses, to authorize any or all \ntransactions otherwise prohibited by the order. Also, in implementing \nthe sanctions, we intend to license transactions necessary to conduct \nthe official business of the United States Government and the United \nNations. We\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nfurther intend to issue licenses to allow humanitarian, diplomatic, and \njournalistic activities to continue.\n  The declaration of a national emergency made under Executive Order \n12808, and expanded in Executive Orders 12810 and 12831, remains in \neffect and is not affected by the June 9, 1998, order.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to increase the \nauthorized funding level for women's business centers; to the Committee \non Small Business.\n\n\nsmall business administration women's business center authorization act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Cleland, in introducing legislation with him to expand \nthe authorized level of the Small Business Administration's Women's \nBusiness Centers. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from \nGeorgia on this issue.\n  We must provide and over the last few years have provided strong \nsupport to help women business owners meet their greatest potential. I \nam happy to say this bill does just that. The additional funding that \nwould be authorized in the bill will ensure that the SBA is going to \nachieve the goal of establishing the Women's Business Center in every \nsingle State by the year 1999. It will also be used to expand the \nexisting very successful Women's Business Centers in the currently \nunderserved areas of their States.\n  Just 10 years ago Congress established a demonstration program to \nhelp women-owned businesses gain access to capital and assistance, \ntechnical assistance, in business development. This program has proven \nto be a really remarkable success. It has served nearly 50,000 American \nwomen, business owners, through 54 sites in 28 States and the District \nof Columbia.\n  Women-owned businesses have made extraordinary gains over the past \ndecade, and everyone in America is sharing the economic advantage that \nhas resulted from their endeavors. Current calculations by the Small \nBusiness Administration indicate that women now own one-third of all \nU.S. firms--more than 8 million businesses. Women-owned businesses \nemploy one out of every five U.S. workers, a total of 18.5 million \nemployees, and more people than the Fortune 500 companies. Each year, \nwomen-owned businesses now\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\ncontribute more than $2.38 trillion into the national economy.\n  In Massachusetts, where 147,000 women-owned businesses account for \nover one-third of all our companies, the Center for Women and Business \nEnterprise has worked to empower women in becoming economically self-\nsufficient through entrepreneurship. The center provides in-depth \ncourses, workshops, one-on-one counseling, and access to financing for \nwomen.\n  Unfortunately, notwithstanding this extraordinary record of women-\nowned business, credit has always been something that has been more \ndifficult for women because of credit standards, and frankly some \nstereotyping that historically has taken place.\n  Since its inception in 1995, my State's Women's Business Center has \nserved more than 1,000 women business owners, 40 percent of whom are \nminorities. One hundred cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts are \nbenefiting from the programs and the activities that are available at \nthe center.\n  I will share a couple of real stories of how this has worked and what \nit has done. Renata Matsson came to the Center for Women and Enterprise \nin October 1995 after she had developed a medical device to assist \npeople suffering from chronic eye problems. But Renata didn't know how \nto transform her invention to a product in a small business. After \ncompleting an 11-week class which taught her ``the language of \nbusiness,'' she developed a detailed business plan and applied for a \ngrant from the Small Business Administration's Small Business \nInnovation Research Program through the National Institutes of Health. \nShe was recently awarded a grant of $100,000. Today she is using that \ngrant to commercialize her technology and start her own small business.\n  Another example: 16 years ago, Nancy Engel was a young mother on \nwelfare dreaming of giving her daughter the things that she never had--\na home, financial security, and a college education. Nancy took $30 \nfrom her last welfare check and bought spices, which she then \nrepackaged and sold at a flea market. She earned $200 from that \ninvestment of her $30 from her check. She then used those proceeds to \ndevelop a small business called the Sunny Window. In 1996, she enrolled \nin the Center for Women and Enterprise's business planning course. \nSince she completed the course, Sunny Window has grown and now \ngenerates $250,000 in annual revenues selling spices, dried flower \narrangements and soaps throughout the world. It now employs seven women \nwith what Nancy calls ``part-time mothers' hours.'' Nancy was recently \nnamed the U.S. Small Business Administration's first Welfare-to-Work \nEntrepreneur of the Year for Massachusetts. Soon she will be \nvolunteering for the Center for Women and Enterprise, assisting other \nwomen entrepreneurs who are trying to make the very difficult \ntransition from public assistance to running their own small business.\n  These are just two of a myriad of stories, wonderful stories, of \nsuccess as a result of our efforts at the Federal level to assist \nwomen-owned businesses. These success stories are, however, juxtaposed \nto the reality that far too many women still face unnecessary obstacles \nto developing their own businesses, ranging from the lack of access to \ncapital to a lack of access to government contracts, to a lack of \naccess to business education or even to training opportunities, not to \nmention some of the fundamental resistance that has, unfortunately, \nexisted with respect to women's efforts to try to engage in \nentrepreneurial activities.\n  We need to expand on the policies and programs that allow women \nentrepreneurs to grow and to thrive. In turn, it is clear their \nsuccesses will benefit our country and all of our communities. We know \nthat women entrepreneurs are now breaking records. Women-owned business \nhave a startup rate twice that of male-owned counterparts. Between 1987 \nand 1992, the number of women-owned businesses increased by 43 percent \nwhile business overall grew only 26 percent.\n  Particularly notable, women-owned companies with 100 or more workers \nincreased employment by 158 percent, more than double the rate for all \nU.S. firms of similar size. These accomplishments illustrate the \nimportance of women-owned businesses to our economy, and they \nunderscore why we in Congress should support their growth and \ndevelopment.\n  Last year, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the Women's \nBusiness Centers Act of 1997, which doubled the authorization of \nfunding for women business center programs to $8 million for each of \nthe next 3 years. I was extremely pleased that the major provision of \nthat bill, as well as a mandate for the SBA to conduct studies on how \nwomen businesses fare in the contracting and finance areas, was \nincluded in the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 and was \nenacted into law with President Clinton's signature.\n  The legislation that I join Senator Cleland in introducing today \ntakes the next step in developing the women's business center program \nby increasing the authorization to $9 million in fiscal year 1999, \n$10.5 million in the year 2000, and $12 million in 2001. I underscore \nthat that is a remarkably small amount of money that we are seeking to \ndo a large job, a job which obviously is returning extraordinary \nresults to the Nation.\n  This increased funding will ensure that the SBA achieves the goal of \nestablishing at least one women's business center in each State by the \nend of the year in 1999 and will strengthen and expand the existing \ncenters. I also continue to support the development of the women's on-\nline center, which is a very useful tool for women businessowners--\nespecially those located in rural areas--who want to avail themselves \nof the women's business center technical expertise.\n  The legislation that Senator Cleland and I introduce today is the \nbeginning of a new advancement for women-owned businesses, and I am \nvery proud to be a part of it. I hope that all of our colleagues will \njoin in this important effort. I would like to take the opportunity to \nthank Senator Cleland and his staff, particularly John Johnson, for the \nwork they have done in the preparation of this legislation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry, for his work on behalf of small businesses. We are both \nmembers of the Small Business Committee here in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I speak this morning to introduce legislation with my \ncolleague, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, and fellow \ncosponsors, including Senators Daschle, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Abraham, \nD'Amato, Breaux, Dodd, Bingaman, Kohl, Landrieu, Torricelli, Leahy, \nGrassley, Snowe, Harkin, Bumpers, and Feinstein. That is an impressive \nbipartisan list of Senators.\n  This legislation, simply stated, recognizes the outstanding \ncontributions that women's business centers have made to women \nentrepreneurs across the Nation. In light of this outstanding \nachievement in the President's budget request, I am proud to offer this \nmeasure expressing the findings of Congress that funding for these \ncenters, these women's business centers, should be increased. I note \nthat the centers are the only organization, nationally, that focus \nexclusively on entrepreneurial training for women. Increased funding \nwould allow for new centers and subcenters to be established and for \ncontinued funding for existing centers, including the on-line women's \nbusiness center. Increased funding would achieve the goal of expanding \ncenters to all 50 States. Our legislation would increase funding for \nwomen's business centers under the SBA in steps, from the current level \nof $8 million to $9 million for fiscal year 1999, $10.5 million for \nfiscal year 2000, and $12 million for fiscal year 2001.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to talk about four focal \npoints of women's business centers. The first and most important focus \nis the customer. These centers have responded to women's needs by \noffering training, and during accessible hours at nights and on \nweekends. In addition to regular training courses, special instructions \non starting at-home child care businesses have also been offered. As \nthe SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez points out, the number of clients \nserved in the second year of the program increased by 40 percent. \nApproximately 44 percent of clients served were actually socially \ndisadvantaged. More than 33 percent of the clients were economically \ndisadvantaged,\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\nnearly 40 percent were minorities, and 18 percent were actually on \npublic assistance at the time.\n\n  Then there is the community focus. Women's business centers are a \nnetwork of more than 60 community-based women's business centers \noperating in 36 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Each \ncenter offers long-term training, networking, and mentoring to \npotential and existing entrepreneurs, most of whom could not or would \nnot start businesses without substantial help, and each center tailors \nits programs to the needs of the individual community it serves.\n  Next is the economic focus. In terms of job growth, significantly \nhigh numbers of full- and part-time jobs were created at average hourly \nwages at least double the minimum wage. In the area of loan growth, the \nnumber of small loans received by clients has more than doubled since \nthe first year of the program. In terms of small business growth, 78 \npercent of all center clients were startup businessowners or aspiring \nentrepreneurs. The centers taught them business basics and provided \npractical support and realistic encouragement.\n  The last focus is that of technology. The on-line women's business \ncenter, at www.onlinewbc.org, is an interactive state-of-the-art web \nsite that offers virtually everything an entrepreneur needs to start \nand build a successful business, including on-line training, mentoring, \nindividual counseling, topic forums and news groups, market research, a \ncomprehensive State-by-State resource and information guide, and \ninformation on all of the SBA's programs and services, plus links to \ncountless other resources. This site was developed by the North Texas \nWomen's Business Development Center in cooperation with more than 60 \nwomen's business centers and several corporate sponsors. This summer, \ninformation will be available in nine different languages.\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude my statement by thanking the \nSenator from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. I think this legislation \noffers small businesses and entrepreneurs in America hope, particularly \nwomen businessowners and potential women businessowners. It is the hope \nof a better life for oneself, one's family and community, which \nactually drives entrepreneurs and also drives the economic engine in \nthis country, which is so vital to our well-being as a Nation. Women's \nbusiness centers are a distributor of that hope. We in Congress need to \nrecognize that this program works. It makes a positive difference in \nthe lives of so many women and the countless citizens they employ.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in cosponsoring our \nbipartisan legislation. I look forward to its future and timely \nconsideration in the Senate Committee on Small Business. I thank my \ncolleagues for the opportunity to be here this morning to present this \nlegislation, which I think will serve the needs of so many.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation increasing the authorization for the Small Business \nAdministration's Women's Business Center program from $9 million in \n1999 to $12 million in 2001. These centers provide management, \nmarketing, and financial advice to women-owned small businesses.\n  Mr. President, the Small Business Administration's Women's Business \nCenter program finances a number of very important initiatives at the \nstate and local levels; initiatives that have proven crucial to women \nstruggling to enter the job world and to start their own businesses. \nThese initiatives have changed the lives of a significant number of \nwomen in Michigan and throughout the United States.\n  For example, Mr. President, Ann Arbor's Women's Initiative for Self-\nEmployment or WISE program was started in 1987 as a means by which to \nprovide low-income women with the tools and resources they need to \nbegin and expand businesses. The WISE program provides a comprehensive \npackage of business training, personal development workshops, credit \ncounseling, start-up and expansion financing, business counseling, and \nmentoring. In addition to helping create and expand businesses, WISE \nfights poverty, increases incomes, stabilizes families, develops skills \nand sparks community renewal.\n  In addition, Mr. President, Grand Rapids' Opportunities for Women or \nGROW provides career counseling and training for women in western \nMichigan. This nonprofit group serves about 250 women per year. GROW \nhelps women get jobs by providing them with basic training and helping \nthem get funds for more specialized training. In addition, they help \nwomen obtain appropriate clothing so that they can start work in a \nprofessional manner.\n  I salute the good people at WISE and GROW for their hard work helping \nthe women of Michigan. They provide the kind of services we need to \nrevitalize troubled areas and empower women to build productive lives \nfor themselves and their families.\n  Because the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Centers \nprogram makes these kinds of efforts possible, I believe it deserves \nour full support, and merits the increase in funding called for in this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Cleland and Kerry, in introducing legislation that \nwill bring the resources of SBA's Women's Business Center program much \ncloser to those seeking this help as they work to start their own \nbusinesses. This bill does more than recognize the contributions that \nwomen make as business owners. This bill tangibly supports and \nencourages more women to become entrepreneurs.\n  The Office of Women's Business Ownership recently released a report \nto Congress on the success of Women's Business Centers. This report \nofficially confirms what we already informally know: Women are \ninterested in owning their own businesses, and women appreciate the \ntargeted help the Centers offer that relates directly to the unique \nopportunities and challenges that women face in creating a business. \nWhile existing Small Business Administration offices and Small Business \nDevelopment Centers help women entrepreneurs, this report found that \nmore than three-fourths of the women who have turned to a Women's \nBusiness Center appreciate its special focus. SBA offices and SBDCs do \nnot have the resources available to offer the same kind of help.\n  Our legislation will supply resources needed to establish a Women's \nBusiness Center in each of the fifty states, including in my home state \nof Vermont. Passage of this bill would give women in Vermont and in \nother states direct access to information on financing, marketing and \nmanaging their own business ventures. Under the provisions of this \nbill, Vermonters would have access to the wide range of resources that \nalready are available to citizens in 36 other states.\n  The bill will also extend additional resources for the online Women's \nBusiness Center. This resource, located at www.onlinewbc.org, provides \nassistance to women who are unable to travel long distances to Centers. \nWith this online resource, women have access to much of the same \ninformation that is available at the Centers, and they can ask \nquestions of specialists, all with the click of a mouse. Our bill would \nenable the Center to expand its online services to women in business.\n  Even without the resources of a Women's Business Center, Vermont is a \nleader in women-owned businesses. The number of women entrepreneurs in \nVermont has almost doubled over the last ten years. Women now own more \nthan thirty-eight percent of all businesses in Vermont, which is above \nthe national average of thirty-six percent. Women also employ thirty \npercent of Vermont's workers, which also exceeds the national average.\n  Women have faced unique obstacles and challenges in starting and \ngrowing businesses. Some obstacles have been lowered in recent years, \nand we can all hope that this progress will continue. One step we can \ntake to promote continued progress is by bringing the resources of \nWomen's Business Centers to more women entrepreneurs. We must encourage \nmore Vermont women to tap into this incredible growth. An SBA Women's \nBusiness Center in Vermont will do just that by providing women with \nthe framework and support necessary to thrive and excel as business \nowners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\n  S. 2161. A bill to provide Government-wide accounting of regulatory \ncosts and benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  regulatory right-to-know act of 1998\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \n``Regulatory Right-to-Know Act'' of 1998. I believe that this \nlegislation will serve as an important tool to promote the public's \nright to know about the benefits and burdens of regulation; to increase \nthe accountability of government to the people it serves; and, \nultimately, to improve the quality of our government.\n  This continues the effort begun by Senator Stevens, then the Chairman \nof the Governmental Affairs Committee, when he passed the Stevens \nRegulatory Accounting Amendment in 1996. This legislation would not \nchange any statutory or regulatory standard; it simply would provide \ninformation to help the public, Congress and the President to \nunderstand the scope and performance of our regulatory system. As OMB \nstated in its first report under the Stevens Amendment, ``Over time, \nregulation . . . has become increasingly prevalent in our society, and \nthe importance of our regulatory activities cannot be overstated.'' It \nis my hope that more information on the benefits and costs of \nregulation will help us make smarter decisions to get more of the good \nthings that sensible regulation can deliver, and reduce needless waste \nand redtape at the same time. That's plain common sense.\n  Regulations have played an important role in improving our quality of \nlife--cleaner air, quality products, safer workplaces, and reliable \neconomic markets--to name a few of the good things that sensible \nregulation can produce. Achieving these benefits does not come without \ncost. In its first regulatory accounting report, OMB estimated that the \nannual cost of regulation of the environment, health, safety and the \neconomy is about $300 billion. Other studies, which include the full \ncosts of paperwork and economic transfers, estimate that regulation \ncosts about $700 billion annually. Those costs are passed on to \nAmerican consumers and taxpayers through higher prices, diminished \nwages, increased taxes, or reduced government services. The tab for the \naverage American household is thousands of dollars each year--$7,000 \nper year by some estimates. At the same time, the public wants and \ndeserves better results from our regulatory system. As the costs of \nregulation rise with public expectations of better results, the need is \ngreater than ever to get a handle on how regulatory programs are \nperforming, so we can find ways for our government to perform better.\n  It's no surprise that the seriousness of this need is not widely \nappreciated, because the costs of regulation are not as obvious as many \nother costs of government, such as the taxes we pay each year; and the \nbenefits of regulation often are diffuse. But there is substantial \nevidence that the current regulatory system often misses opportunities \nfor greater benefits and lower costs. As noted by the President's chief \nspokesperson on regulatory policy, Sally Katzen:\n\n       Regrettably, the regulatory system that has been built up \n     over the past five decades . . . is subject to serious \n     criticism . . . [on the grounds] that there are too many \n     regulations, that many are excessively burdensome, [and] that \n     many do not ultimately provide the intended benefits.\n\nOur regulatory goals are too important, and our resources are too \nprecious, to miss out on opportunities to do better.\n  It's time to move toward a more open and accountable regulatory \nsystem. I am pleased to be introducing this bill with Senator Breaux. \nIt's important that members from both sides of the aisle work together \nto solve these problems. I appreciate that Chairman Tom Bliley \nintroduced a similar bill in the House last fall, and I look forward to \nworking with him. Finally, I appreciate the effort that a few dedicated \nprofessionals put into OMB's first regulatory accounting report. While \nthis report is certainly not perfect, it shows that regulatory \naccounting is doable and can help us better understand the benefits and \nburdens of regulation. Now let's do better. This bill will promote some \nimportant improvements, including:\n  Making regulatory accounting a permanent requirement.\n  Adding requirements for a more complete picture, including, to the \nextent feasible, the costs and benefits of particular programs, not \njust an aggregate picture, as well as an analysis of regulation's \nimpacts on the State and local government, the private sector, and the \nfederal government.\n  Ensuring higher quality of information. Requirements for OMB \nguidelines and peer review should improve future reports.\n  Ensuring better compliance with basic legislative requirements which \nthe first report neglected. These deficiencies include failing to \nrecommend improvements to current programs; failing to assess the \nindirect effects of regulation; failing to provide information on \nspecific programs where feasible; and failing to provide a full \naccounting of all mandates. This bill will help address these problems.\n  As OMB said in their first regulatory accounting report, \n``regulations (like other instruments of government policy) have \nenormous potential for both good and harm.'' I believe that better \ninformation will help us to increase the benefits of regulation and \ndecrease unnecessary waste and red tape. I think we need to work \ntogether to contribute to the success of government programs the public \nvalues, while enhancing the economic security and well-being of our \nfamilies and communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the ``Regulatory Right-\nto-Know Act'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2161\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to more accurately codify the depreciable life of printed \n     wiring board and printed wiring assembly equipment; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 printed circuit investment act of 1998\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today Senator Grams and I introduce \nthe Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1998. This bill would allow \nmanufacturers of printed wiring boards and assemblies, known as the \nelectronic interconnection industry, to depreciate their production \nequipment in 3 years rather than the 5 year period under current law.\n  As we approach the 21st Century, our Nation's Tax Code should not \nstand in the way of technological progress. Printed wiring boards and \nassemblies are literally central to our economy, as they are the nerve \ncenters of nearly every electronic device from camcorders and \ntelevisions to medical devices, computers and defense systems. But the \nTax Code places U.S. manufacturers at a disadvantage relative to their \nAsian competitors, because of different depreciation treatment. This \ndisadvantage is particularly difficult for U.S. firms to bear, as the \ninterconnection industry consists overwhelmingly of small firms that \ncannot easily absorb the costs inflicted by an irrationally-long \ndepreciation schedule.\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\n  As technology continues to advance at light speed, the exhilaration \nof competition in a dynamic market is dampened by the effects of a Tax \nCode that has not kept pace with these changes. Obsolete \ninterconnection manufacturing equipment is kept on the books long after \nthis equipment has gone out the door. Companies with the competitive \nfire to enter such a rapidly-evolving industry must constantly invest \nin new state-of-the-art equipment, replacing obsolete equipment every \n18 to 36 months just to remain competitive. U.S. investments in new \nprinted wiring board and assembly manufacturing equipment have nearly \ntripled since 1991--growing from $847 million to an estimated $2.4 \nbillion.\n  But this investment is taxed at an artificially-high rate, because \ndeductions for the cost of the equipment are spread over a period that \nis several years longer than justified. The industry is at the mercy of \ntax laws passed in the 1980s, which were based on 1970s-era electronics \ntechnology. It is no wonder that the market share of U.S. \ninterconnection companies has been cut in half over this period. Our \nTax Code should not continue to undermine the competitiveness of \nAmerican businesses. The opportunity is before us to correct the tax \nlaws that dictate how rapidly board manufacturers and electronics \nassemblers can depreciate equipment needed to fabricate and assemble \ncircuit boards.\n  The Printed Circuit Investment Act of 1998 will provide modest tax \nrelief to the electronics interconnection industry and the 250,000 \nAmericans, residing in every state of the Union, whose jobs rely on the \nsuccess of this industry. This industry should get fair and accurate \ntax treatment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2162\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modify the procedures of the Federal courts in \ncertain matters, to reform prisoner litigation, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    judicial improvement act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Thurmond, Abraham, and Ashcroft, the Judicial Improvement Act \nof 1998; legislation that will restore public confidence in our \ndemocratic process by strengthening the constitutional division of \npowers between the Federal government and the States and between \nCongress and the Courts. On the whole, our federal judges are \nrespectful of their constitutional roles, yet a degree of overreaching \nby some dictates that Congress move to more clearly delineate the \nproper role of Federal judges in our constitutional system. \nIncreasingly, judges forget that the Constitution has committed to them \nthe power to interpret law, but reserved to Congress the power to \nlegislate.\n  This careful balancing of legislative and judicial functions is vital \nto our constitutional system. Regardless of how much we, as \nindividuals, may approve of the results of a certain judge's decision, \nwe must look beyond short-term political interests and remember the \nimportance of preserving our Constitution.\n  Attempts by certain jurists to encroach upon legislative authority \ndeeply concern me. I have taken the floor in this chamber on numerous \noccasions to recite some of the more troubling examples of judicial \noverreaching. I will not revisit them today. Suffice it to say that \nactivism, and by that I mean a judge who ignores the written text of \nthe law, whether from the right or the left, threatens our \nconstitutional structure.\n  As an elected official, my votes for legislation are subject to voter \napproval. Federal judges, however, are unelected, hence they are, as a \npractical matter, unaccountable to the public. While tenure during good \nbehavior, which amounts to life tenure, is important in that it frees \njudges to make unpopular, but constitutionally sound, decisions, it can \nbecome a threat to liberty when placed in the wrong hands. Alexander \nHamilton, in the 78th Federalist, warned of the problem when judges \n``substitute their own pleasures to the constitutional intentions of \nthe legislature.'' [Federalist No. 78, A. Hamilton]. Hamilton declared \nthat ``The courts must declare the sense of the law; and if they should \nbe disposed to exercise Will instead of Judgment, the consequence would \nequally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the \nlegislative body.'' [Ibid.]. And substituting the will of life-tenured \nfederal judges for the democratically elected representatives is not \nwhat our Constitution's framers had in mind.\n  In an effort to avoid this long-contemplated problem, the proposed \nreform legislation we are introducing today will assist in ensuring \nthat all three branches of the federal government work together in a \nfashion contemplated by, and consistent with, the Constitution. In \naddition, this legislation will ensure that federal judges are more \nrespectful of the States.\n  This bill is not, as some would claim, an assault on the Federal \nJudiciary. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of our Federal judges \nwould find repugnant the idea of imposing their personal views on the \npeople in lieu of Federal or State law. However, there are currently \nsome activist Federal judges improperly expanding their roles to quash \nthe will of the people. These individuals view themselves as so-called \nplatonic guardians, and believe they know what is in the people's best \ninterest. Judges, however, are simply not entitled to deviate from \ntheir roles as interpreters of the law to create new law from the \nbench. If they believe otherwise, they are derelict in their duties and \nshould resign to run for public office--at least then they would be \naccountable for their actions. It is time that we pass legislation that \nprecludes any Federal judge from blurring the lines separating the \nlegislative and judicial functions.\n  It is important to note that the effort to reign in judicial activism \nshould not be limited simply to opposing potential activist nominees. \nWhile the careful scrutiny of judicial nominees is one important step \nin the process, a step reserved to the Senate alone, Congress itself \nhas an obligation to the public to ensure that judges fulfill their \nconstitutionally assigned roles and do not encroach upon those powers \ndelegated to the legislature. Hence, the Congress performs an important \nrole in bringing activist decisions to light and, where appropriate, \npublicly criticizing those decisions. Some view this as an assault upon \njudicial independence. That is untrue. It is merely a means of engaging \nin debate about a decision's merits or the process by which the \ndecision was reached. Such criticism is a healthy part of our \ndemocratic system. While life tenure insulates judges from the \npolitical process, it should not, and must not, isolate them from the \npeople.\n  In addition, the Constitution grants Congress the authority, with a \nfew notable limitations, to set federal courts' jurisdiction. This is \nan important tool that, while seldom used, sets forth the circumstances \nin which the judicial power may be exercised. A good example of this is \nthe 104th Congress' effort to reform the statutory writ of habeas \ncorpus in an attempt to curb the seemingly endless series of petitions \nfiled by convicted criminals bent on thwarting the demands of justice. \nLegislation of this nature, actually called for by the Chief Justice \nand praised in his recent annual report, is an important means of \ncurbing activism.\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\n  To this end, I have chosen to introduce the Federal Judicial \nImprovement Act. It is a small, albeit meaningful, step in the right \ndirection. Notably, this legislation will change the way federal courts \nreview constitutional challenges to State and federal laws. The \nexisting process allows a single federal judge to hear and grant \napplications regarding the constitutionality of State and federal laws \nas well as state ballot initiatives. In other words, a single federal \njudge can impede the will of a majority of the voters merely by issuing \nan order halting the implementation of a state referendum.\n  This proposed reform will accomplish the twin goals of fighting \njudicial activism and preserving the democratic process. This bill \nmodestly proposes to respond to the problem of judicial activism by:\n\n       1. Requiring a three judge district court panel to hear \n     appeals and grant interlocutory or permanent injunctions \n     based on the constitutionality of the state law or \n     referendum.\n       2. Placing time limitations on remedial authority in any \n     civil action in which prospective relief or a consent \n     judgment binds State or local officials.\n       3. Prohibiting a Federal court from having the authority to \n     order State or local governments to increase taxes as part of \n     a judicial remedy.\n       4. Preventing a Federal court from prohibiting State or \n     local officials from reprosecuting a defendant. AND\n       5. Preventing a Federal court from ordering the release of \n     violent offenders under unwarranted circumstances.\n\n  This reform bill is a long overdue effort to minimize the potential \nfor judicial activism in the federal court system. Americans are \nunderstandably frustrated when they exercise their right to vote and \nthe will of their elected representatives is thwarted by judges who \nenjoy life tenure. It's no wonder that millions of Americans don't \nthink their vote matters when they enact a referendum only to have it \nenjoined by a single district court judge. By improving the way federal \ncourts analyze constitutional challenges to laws and initiatives, \nCongress will protect the rights of parties to challenge \nunconstitutional laws while at the same time reduce the ability of \nactivist judges to abuse their power and stifle the will of the people.\n\n  I want to take a few moments to describe how this legislation will \ncurb the ability of federal judges to engage in judicial activism. The \nfirst reform would require a three judge panel to hear and issue \ninterlocutory and permanent injunctions regarding challenged laws at \nthe district court level. The current system allows a single federal \njudge to restrain the enforcement, operation and execution of \nchallenged federal or state laws, including initiatives. There have \nbeen many instances where an activist judge has used this power to \noverturn a ballot initiative only to have his or her order overturned \nby a higher court years later.\n  For example, this change would have prevented U.S. District Court \nJudge Thelton Henderson from issuing an injunction barring enforcement \nof Proposition 209, a ballot initiative which prohibited affirmative \naction in California. Judge Henderson's order was subsequently \noverturned by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that the \nlaw was constitutional and that Judge Henderson thwarted the will of \nthe people. A three judge panel would have prevented Henderson from \nacting on his own, and perhaps would have ruled correctly in the first \nplace.\n  Now, I have no problem with a court declaring a law unconstitutional \nwhen it violates the written text of the Constitution. It is, however, \ninappropriate when a judge, like Judge Henderson, attempts to act like \na super-legislator and imposes his own policy preference on the \ncitizens of a State. Such an action weakens respect for the federal \njudiciary, creates cynicism in the voting public, and costs the \ngovernment millions of dollars in legal fees. By requiring a three \njudge panel, the proposed law would eliminate the ability of one \nactivist judge to unilaterally bar enforcement of a law or ballot \ninitiative through an interlocutory or permanent injunction.\n  In addition, new time limits on injunctive relief would be imposed. A \ntemporary restraining order would remain in force no more than 10 days, \nand an interlocutory injunction no more than 60 days. After the \nexpiration of an interlocutory injunction, federal courts would lack \nthe authority to grant any additional interlocutory relief but would \nstill have the power to issue a permanent injunction. These limitations \nare designed to prevent the federal judiciary from indefinitely barring \nimplementation of challenged laws by issuing endless injunctions, and \nfacilitate the appeals process by motivating courts to speedily handle \nconstitutional challenges.\n  We need only to look at the legal wrangling over Proposition 187 to \nsee the need for these time constraints. The California initiative was \noverwhelmingly approved in 1994 with almost 60 percent of the vote and \nwas designed to end all social services and other benefits to illegal \naliens. The referendum was supported by voters who felt that they as \ntaxpayers didn't have the ability to provide those who break \nimmigration laws with free health, education and welfare. Opponents who \nlost at the ballot box went to federal court the next day and obtained \nan injunction prohibiting enforcement of 187, and to this day it has \nnever been the law of the state of California.\n  U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer issued a preliminary injunction \nsoon after the 1994 election and ruled way back in 1995 that part of \n187 was unconstitutional. The injunction stayed in effect and she \nfinally ruled on the rest of the initiative in March of this year, when \nshe found that an additional portion of the initiative was \nunconstitutional. The proposed time limitation on injunctions would \nhave been an incentive for the judge to rule promptly on the issues at \nhand, and precluded her from indefinitely delaying enforcement of the \nproposition without ruling. What this reform essentially does is \nencourage the federal judiciary to rule on the merits of a case, and \nnot use injunctions to keep a challenged law from going into effect or \nbeing heard by an appeals court through the use of delaying tactics.\n  The bill also proposes to require that a notice of appeal must be \nfiled not more than fourteen days after the date of an order granting \nan interlocutory injunction and the appeals court would lack \njurisdiction over an untimely appeal of such an order. The court of \nappeals would apply a de novo standard of review before reconsidering \nthe merits of granting relief, but not less than 100 days after the \nissuance of the original order granting interlocutory relief. If the \ninterlocutory order is upheld on appeal, the order would remain in \nforce no longer than 60 days after the date of the appellate decision \nor until replaced by a permanent injunction.\n  The bill also proposes limitations on the remedial authority of \nfederal courts. In any civil action where prospective relief or a \nconsent judgment binds state and local officials, relief would be \nterminated upon the motion of any party or intervener:\n  a) five years after the date the court granted or approved the \nprospective relief;\n  b) two years after the date the court has entered an order denying \ntermination of prospective relief; or\n  c) in the case of an order issued on or before the date of enactment \nof this act, two years after the date of enactment.\n  Parties could agree to terminate or modify an injunction before \nrelief is available if it otherwise would be legally permissible. \nCourts would promptly rule on motions to modify or terminate this \nrelief and in the event that a motion is not ruled on within 60 days, \nthe order or consent judgment binding State and local officials would \nautomatically terminate.\n  However, prospective relief would not terminate if the federal court \nmakes written findings based on the record that relief remains \nnecessary to correct an ongoing violation of a federal right, extends \nno further than necessary to correct the violation and is the least \nintrusive means available to correct the violation of a federal right.\n  This measure would also prohibit a federal court from having the \nauthority to order a unit of state or local government to increase \ntaxes as part of a judicial remedy. When an unelected Federal judge has \nthe power to order tax increases, this results in taxation without \nrepresentation. Americans have fought against unfair taxation since the \nRevolutionary War, and this bill would prevent unfair judicial taxation \nand leave the power to tax to elected representatives of the people.\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\n  The bill would not limit the authority of a Federal court to order a \nremedy which may lead a unit of local or State government to decide to \nincrease taxes. A Federal court would still have the power to issue a \nmoney judgment against a State because the court would not \nbe attempting to restructure local government entities or mandating a \nparticular method or structure of State or local financing. This bill \nalso doesn't limit the remedial authority of State courts in any case, \nincluding cases raising issues of federal law. All the bill does is \nprevent Federal courts from having the power to order elected \nrepresentatives to raise taxes. This is moderate reform which prevents \njudicial activism and unfair taxation while preserving the Federal \ncourts power to order remedial measures.\n\n  Another important provision of the bill would prevent a federal court \nfrom prohibiting State or local officials from re-prosecuting a \ndefendant. This legislation is designed to clarify that federal habeas \ncourts lack the authority to bar retrial as a remedy.\n  This part of the legislation was co-sponsored by Congressman Pitts \nand Senator Specter in response to a highly-publicized murder case in \nthe Congressman's district. Sixteen year old Laurie Show was harassed, \nstalked and assaulted for six months by the defendant, who had a \nvendetta against Show for briefly dating the defendant's boyfriend. \nAfter luring Show's mother from their residence, the defendant and an \naccomplice forcefully entered the Show home, held the victim down, and \nslit her throat with a butcher knife, killing her. After the defendant \nwas convicted in State court, she filed a habeas petition in which she \nalleged prosecutorial misconduct and averred her actual innocence. \nFederal district court judge Stewart Dalzell not only accepted this \nargument and released the defendant, but he also took the extraordinary \nstep of barring state and local officials from reprosecuting the woman. \nJudge Dalzell stated that the defendant was the ``first and foremost \nvictim of this affair.''\n  Congress has long supported the ability of a Federal court to fashion \ncreative remedies to preserve constitutional protections, but the \nadditional step of barring state or local officials from reprosecution \nis without precedent and an unacceptable intrusion on the rights of \nstates. This bill, if enacted, will prevent this type of judicial \nactivism from ever occurring again.\n  This bill also contains provisions for the termination of prospective \nrelief when it is no longer warranted to cure a violation of a federal \nright. Once a violation that was the subject of a consent decree has \nbeen corrected, a consent decree must be terminated unless the court \nfinds that an ongoing violation of a federal right exists, the specific \nrelief is necessary to correct the violation of a Federal right, and no \nother relief will correct the violation of the Federal right. The party \nopposing the termination of relief has the burden of demonstrating why \nthe relief should not be terminated, and the court is required to grant \nthe motion to terminate if the opposing party fails to meet its burden. \nThese provisions prevent consent decrees from remaining in effect once \na proper remedy has been implemented, thereby preventing judges from \nimposing consent decrees that go beyond the requirements of law.\n  The proposed reform law also includes provisions designed to dissuade \nprisoners from filing frivolous and malicious motions by requiring that \nthe complainant prisoner pay for the costs of the filings. These \nprovisions will undoubtedly curb the number of frivolous motions filed \nby prisoners and thus, relieve the courts of the obligation to hear \nthese vacuous motions designed to mock and frustrate the judicial \nsystem.\n  Finally, the bill proposes to prevent federal judges from entering or \ncarrying out any prisoner release order that would result in the \nrelease from or nonadmission to a prison on the basis of prison \nconditions. This provision will effectively preclude activist judges \nfrom circumventing mandatory minimum sentencing laws by stripping the \nfederal judges of jurisdiction to enter such orders. This will ensure \nthat the tough sentencing laws approved by voters to keep murderers, \nrapists, and drug dealers behind bars for lengthy terms will not be \nignored by activist judges who improperly use complaints of prison \nconditions filed by convicts as a vehicle to release violent offenders \nback on our streets.\n  For an example of this activism, I offer the rulings of a jurist whom \nI have mentioned before, Federal Judge Norma Shapiro, who sits on the \nFederal bench in Philadelphia. Judge Shapiro has a different view of \nwhat prison life should be: a view completely divergent from the view \nof the general public and, most importantly, the law.\n  Judge Shapiro used complaints filed by inmates to impose her activist \nviews and wrestle control of the prison system by setting a cap on the \nnumber of prisoners that can be incarcerated in Pennsylvania. When \nfaced with the opportunity to extend her judicial powers and seize \ncontrol of the prison system, Judge Shapiro jumped at the chance and \nthe results have been disastrous.\n  The cap imposed by Judge Shapiro forced the release of 500 prisoners \na week. Because of this cap, in a time period of 18 months alone, 9,732 \narrestees were released on Philadelphia. Of course, many were re-\narrested on other charges, including 79 murders, 90 rapes, 701 \nburglaries, 959 robberies, 1,113 assaults, 2,215 drug offenses and \n2,748 thefts. [Philadelphia Inquirer]. Releasing dangerous criminals on \nto the streets to reek havoc and violence is the ultimate slap in the \nfaces of law enforcement and justice. How can we expect law enforcement \nto provide protection and safe streets if at every turn there is a \nJudge Shapiro waiting anxiously for the chance to release lawlessness \non our communities? This reform bill will prevent Judge Shapiro and \nother like-minded judges from ever endangering families and children in \nour communities again by preventing these Judges from releasing \nprisoners based on prison conditions.\n  Prison life is not supposed to be pleasant or comfortable; rather, it \nis supposed to serve as a deterrent to future crime. I would be worried \nif no prisoners were filing complaints because they actually found \nprison life to be acceptable. But it seems that some activist judges \nare willing to believe any prisoner complaint equates or rises to the \nlevel of a constitutional violation. It seems that in some courtrooms, \nif a prisoner simply files a complaint alleging prison conditions \naren't laudable or praiseworthy, chances are good that that prisoner, \nand many others, will be released from custody early, sometimes \nimmediately, thanks to the misguided activism of the judge hearing the \ncomplaint. This is absolutely unacceptable and this proposed law will \nput a stop to the agendas of some activist judges who believe every \nargument that the ACLU and guilty, but bored, convicts offer up.\n  This overdue legislation is a measured effort to improve the way the \nfederal judiciary works. It fights judicial activism and actually \nimproves the way constitutional appeals are handled. This reform bill \nis a sensible, balanced attempt to promote judicial efficiency and to \nprevent egregious judicial activism. I encourage my colleagues to act \nswiftly on this needed reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2163\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Hatch in \nintroducing the Judicial Improvement Act of 1998. Many of the \nprovisions of this bill stem from a series of hearings I held in the \nSubcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and Property Rights last \nsummer addressing the problem of judicial activism. The hearings \nfocused on the problem of judicial activism and its impact. The \nSubcommittee heard testimony from a variety of individuals, from \nconstitutional scholars to victims of activist judicial orders. The \nfinal hearing of the series focused on potential solutions to the \nproblem of activism.\n  That final hearing canvassed potential solutions ranging from \nproposed constitutional amendments, to increased public education \nefforts about the problem of judicial activism, to proposed statutory \nsolutions. The hearings convinced me that, at a minimum, we needed to \nprovide some procedural mechanisms to make it more difficult for any \nsingle judge to issue an activist order and to make it easier for \nlitigants to force the reconsideration of activist orders.\n  Since the close of the hearings, I have been working with others on \nthe Judiciary Committee to fashion legislation that would accomplish \nthese goals. Last fall, I circulated draft language concerning the \nthree legislative proposals that remain my top priorities in this \narea--requiring a three-judge panel before a federal court can strike \ndown a state initiative or an act of Congress as unconstitutional, \nexpanding provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act to cover other \nlocal and state institutions, and codifying a flat prohibition on \nfederal court orders directly increasing taxes. With the help of \nChairman Hatch, Senator Abraham and others on the Committee, we have \nadded many additional provisions and drafted a comprehensive bill aimed \nat improving the federal judiciary. Although I would not have included \nevery provision in the bill had I introduced my own bill, the bill \nreflects the collective work of the Committee and would substantially \nimprove the workings of the federal judiciary.\n  Let me take a few moments to discuss the provisions that are critical \nto addressing the problem of judicial activism. First and foremost, the \nbill addresses the problem of having a single federal judge strike down \na state referendum as unconstitutional. Nothing highlights the \nundemocratic power of a federal judge more strikingly than when a \nsingle unelected federal judge invalidates a law passed by the general \npublic through the initiative process. Even the Ninth Circuit, the \nepicenter of judicial activism in America, has acknowledged the strain \nthat a single judge's nullification of an initiative places on our \npolitical system. As the court recently noted in an opinion reversing \nsuch a single-judge nullification: ``A system which permits one judge \nto block with the stroke of a pen what 4,736,180 state residents voted \nto enact as law tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy.'' \nThe Coalition for Economic Equality v. Wilson, 122 F.3d 692, 699 (9th \nCir.), (cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 397 (1997).\n  The three-judge panel ameliorates this problem by requiring that a \nthree-judge panel be convened, and a majority of the panel agree, \nbefore a state initiative can be enjoined. The provision then addresses \nthe problem of the popular will being preliminarily enjoined for long \nperiods of time before a final appealable decision is issued by \nproviding for an expedited review of the injunction.\n  The three-judge panel provision recognizes that there may be \nsituations in\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\nwhich state initiatives run afoul of the Constitution and courts may \nneed to declare them unconstitutional. But the bill also recognized \nthat when a federal court takes such an action, it can cause \nconsiderable frustration and friction. The bill attempts to minimize \nsuch friction by ensuring that a federal court complies with a number \nof safeguards before taking such a drastic action.\n  A second key provision in the bill extends some of the protections \nincluded in the Prison Litigation Reform Act to other state and local \ngovernment institutions. During the hearings, I heard over and over \nabout the frustration of state and local officials who are saddled with \nconsent decrees entered into decades ago that allow unelected federal \njudges--rather than elected local officials--to run local institutions. \nThe bill addresses this problem by requiring the periodic \nreconsideration of such consent decrees or structural injunctions to \nensure that they remain necessary to remedy a constitutional violation. \nOnce again, the bill recognizes that our federal Constitution and \nfederal system of government may require federal courts to issue \ninjunctions covering state and local institutions, but also \nacknowledges that such sweeping injunctions create friction with local \nofficials. The best way to limit such friction is to provide a \nmechanism to ensure that the injunctions remain necessary to remedy a \nconstitutional violation. This bill does that.\n  Another key provision of particular importance to my constituents \nback in Missouri is the flat prohibition on federal court orders \ndirectly raising or imposing taxes. The people of Kansas City have \nsuffered through the activism of federal District Judge Russell Clark, \nincluding his order directly ordering local authorities to increase \ntaxes. This provision directly attacks such judicial tyranny. \nImportantly, however, the bill leave the federal court's power to order \nremedies that may lead a local or state government to raise taxes. But \nthe ultimate decision of whether to raise taxes, raise revenue through \nother means or cut spending remains that the local authorities.\n  A final point should be made about all three of these provisions: \nthey apply only to federal courts. The procedures and remedial \nauthority of state courts remain unaffected. During the Subcommittee \nhearings a number of people offered suggestions to make the federal \ncourts more directly responsive to the people. In attempting to improve \nthe federal courts, we cannot lose sight of the fact that under our \nfederal system we have both federal courts and state courts of general \njurisdiction which are fully capable of hearing federal claims. State \ncourts, moreover, are much more responsible to the people--in the \nmajority of States they are subject to direct elections or retention \nelections.\n  This bill recognizes the comparative advantages of these two court \nsystems and tries to limit the availability of those remedies that are \nthe most intrusive in the courts that are least responsible to the \npeople. If people are really convinced that courts must levy taxes and \nrun state and local institutions in perpetuity (and I, for one, am not \nconvinced such measures are every necessary), then at least the courts \nthat do so should be relatively responsive state courts, rather than \nunelected, life-tenured federal judges.\n  Before I close, let me mention a few other provisions of the bill \nthat are of particular importance to me. First, the bill contains a \nprovision that makes it clear that the same standards for judging the \nadmissibility of confessions that Congress created for federal criminal \ntrials should also apply when federal courts engage in collateral \nreview of state and federal convictions. This provision reinforces that \nthe touchstone for admissibility should be the voluntariness of the \nconfession and that a technical violation should not free a convicted \nprisoner on collateral review.\n  Second, the bill includes a provision similar to one in legislation \nintroduced by Senator Specter, which I have co-sponsored, which \nprevents a federal court from barring local authorities for ordering a \nretrial of a convicted authority. The traditional remedy in a habeas \nproceeding is release from custody. Taking the further step of barring \nretrial goes beyond the traditional office of the writ and is an \naffront to state courts and prosecutors.\n  Finally, the bill appropriately limits the practice of releasing \nprisoners early as a judicial remedy. Perhaps, the most poignant \ntestimony in the Subcommittee hearings concerned family whose son, \nDanny Boyle, was killed by an arrested felon, who but for a prison \nrelease order would have been behind bars. Danny was a promising young \npolice officer whose life and career were cut short--a victim of \njudicial activism. I am committed to working to ensure that another \nfamily does not have to come before a future Subcommittee hearing with \nsimilar testimony about a son or daughter.\n  I want to thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Abraham for working with \nme to get these provisions included in the bill. I look forward to \nworking with them to ensure that this bill moves forward and that we \ntake these modest steps to improve the federal judiciary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Judicial Improvement Act. This legislation contains various \nimportant reforms of the judicial branch that will help keep the powers \nof the courts in check with the other branches of government and with \nthe will of the people.\n  This comprehensive bill contains provisions that are important to \nmany senators, and I am especially pleased that two bills that I have \nintroduced and advocated for years are included in this reform package. \nOne would prohibit judges from imposing tax increases, and the other \nwould clarify the retroactive application of legislation.\n  This Act states that a Federal judge does not have the authority to \norder the Federal government or units of state or local governments to \nraise taxes as a legal remedy. In 1990, in Missouri v. Jenkins, the \nSupreme Court permitted a district court judge to order local \nauthorities to impose a huge tax increase to pay for his plan to \ndesegregate a school district.\n  One may wonder why a desegregation plan would be so expensive as to \nwarrant a massive tax increase. The reason is this plan was not simply \nan attempt to bring schools up to basic standards. Rather, it was an \nelaborate social experiment in the name of education. Money was no \nobject. Among other mandates, the plan called for 15 computers in every \nclassroom, a 2,000 square-foot planetarium, a 25-acre farm, a model \nUnited Nations, an art gallery, movie editing and screening rooms, and \nswimming pools.\n  Money was no object because there was no control over the judge. \nThere was no accountability. The only supervision was a higher court, \nand a slim majority of the Supreme Court gave the judge a free reign.\n  The dissent in that case clearly explained what should have been \nobvious: it violates the Constitutional separation of powers for a \njudge to order that taxes be increased. In the Constitution, Article I \ncontains the legislative powers. Article I, Section 8 begins by \nstating, ``The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect \ntaxes.'' Article III provides for judicial power, and makes no mention \nof the power to tax. Therefore, a Federal judge does not have the power \nto tax under the Constitution.\n  This is more than a matter of proper Constitutional interpretation. \nIt is an essential check on power. The ability to tax is an awesome \npower. It is true that, as Justice John Marshall once wrote, ``the \npower to tax involves the power to destroy.'' This authority must be \ncarefully checked, and the best source of control is the people. Thus, \nin the Constitution, the ability to tax was given to the legislative \nbranch, which is directly accountable to the people through the ballot \nbox.\n  By design, the Judicial Branch is different. It is not responsible to \nthe people. The Framers intentionally did not provide for judges to be \nelected by the people and even gave judges life tenure. They wanted \njudges to be insulated from the political climate and have the freedom \nto interpret the law appropriately, rather than make decisions based on \nthe will of the majority at any given moment. It is entirely reasonable \nand appropriate that judicial power does not include the power to \ntax. As Justice Kennedy stated in his thoughtful dissent in Missouri v. \nJenkins, the Supreme Court's ``casual embrace of taxation imposed by \nthe unelected life-tenured Federal Judiciary disregards fundamental \nprecepts\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\nfor the democratic control of public institutions.''\n\n  The Framers of the Constitution fully intended to separate power in \nthis manner and did not mean for judges to be involved in taxation. As \nAlexander Hamilton stated in the Federalist No. 78, ``The judiciary . . \n. has no influence over either the sword or the purse.'' In my view, \njudicial taxation is simply taxation without representation, no \ndifferent from the complaints of the American colonists about taxation \nwithout representation during the days of the Stamp Act in 1765.\n  Mr. President, if a judge can order a tax increase for a school, why \nnot a similar social experiment for a prison? It is hard to imagine any \nlimits on a Federal judge's power as expressed in Missouri v. Jenkins. \nI believe it is imperative that the Congress act to control the power \nof the judicial branch in this regard.\n  Another provision of the bill that I have long advocated would \nclarify the retroactivity of legislation. Often the Congress will pass \nlegislation but not state whether that legislation should be applied \nretroactively to conduct that occurred before the law was passed. An \nexcellent example is the Civil Rights Act of 1991. It took years of \nlitigation with decisions in over one hundred Federal courts throughout \nthe country before the Supreme Court finally decided the question.\n  The provision simply states that legislation is not retroactive \nunless the bill expressly says it is. This simple rule will eliminate a \ngreat deal of uncertainty. As a result, it will reduce litigation costs \nand help our judicial system better focus to reserve its limited \nresources.\n  This clarification should not be controversial. The Judicial \nConference of the Federal courts indicated in a report in 1995 that it \ndid not oppose this legislative fix, and the Clinton Justice Department \nstated in a letter to me in 1996 that it did not object to this \nclarification. I hope both of these provisions are passed this year.\n  The Judicial Improvement Act contains many other needed reforms that \nI will not attempt to detail, such as a requirement for a three-judge \npanel to enjoin the enforcement of certain laws. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting the judicial reforms contained in this \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 2164. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to promote \nrail competition, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                       the stb amendments of 1998\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nSurface Transportation Board Amendments of 1998. This legislation \nproposes to expand the Surface Transportation Board's existing \nauthority to address circumstances affecting rail service \ntransportation in today's environment.\n  First, I think most colleagues would agree that the STB has performed \nwell since its inception in 1996. The industries it regulates have \nexperienced a number of significant changes in the past few years. The \nSTB has acted consistently with the authority Congress gave it, and \nclearly within the deregulatory intent with which it was created.\n  This year's reauthorization gives us the first chance since we \ncreated the Board to review its practices and performance. My bill is \nbased upon the principle that Congress sets government policy and the \nExecutive Branch, through regulators such as the STB, executes that \npolicy. During hearings in my Surface Transportation and Merchant \nMarine Subcommittee, I have consistently sought to identify the limits \nof STB authority to act in certain circumstances, and to identify those \nareas beyond which STB action would require a policy decision by \nCongress.\n  It is very important that we pass a re-authorization bill this year. \nDoing that will require that we establish the middle ground between \nthose who want to roll back the clock and begin to re-regulate the \nindustry and those who think the board needs no additional authority to \nadequately address the many issues before it.\n  I believe my bill does just that. However, I stand ready to work with \nmy colleagues to further refine my proposals to move this bill through \nthe legislative process. I welcome input from any interested members.\n  My own personal view is that re-regulation is not called for. The \nStaggers Rail Act of 1980 has had very positive results for both \nindustry and shippers. But we must ensure the board has sufficient \ntools to ensure that deregulation has its intended effect of greater \ncompetition and better value to the consumer. The experiences of the \npast few years, and this year in particular, give us much to consider.\n  Mr. President, our country has endured a critical rail service crisis \nfor many, many months. My home State of Texas has felt this crisis as \nmuch as any other State, and more than most. Texas has sustained \nbillions of dollars of economic losses as the goods bound to and from \nthe State's ports, factories and refineries sit gridlocked on the \nrails. These service problems primarily have occurred in the West, but \nthere has been a ripple effect throughout the entire rail system. \nService problems continue today, and I know the railroads have been \nworking night and day to alleviate service troubles.\n\n  Mr. President, I will explain my bill at greater length in a moment, \nbut I want to stress that I have worked to craft a bill that maintains \nthe basic de-regulatory rules that the rail industry and shippers have \nplayed by since the 1980s. However, it is the shippers today who face a \nmost challenging rail shipping environment.\n  Therefore, I am proposing we take action to ensure that the Board's \nprocedures are more readily accessible to small shippers. I also am \nproposing to expand the Board's authority with regard to maintaining \nand promoting rail competition in appropriate circumstances. And, I \nbelieve strongly that we can do this without jeopardizing the integrity \nof deregulation.\n  The Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation has been \nworking for many months on issues surrounding the rail service \ntransportation. In that effort, the reauthorization of the Surface \nTransportation Board is a priority of our Committee.\n  To date we have held four rail service hearings during this \nCongress--three field hearings along with a Subcommittee hearing on the \nBoard's reauthorization. In addition, at Senator McCain's and my \nrequest, the STB held 2 days of hearings in April to address rail \naccess and competition issues at which more than 60 witnesses \ntestified.\n  In response to the information gathered during these many hearings \nboth by our Committee and the Board, today I am proposing legislation \nto address a number of areas which I believe warrant serious attention \nand in some cases, reform. I expect some will have a strong reaction to \nmy proposals, as some in the rail industry have tended to tar any \nlegislative proposals affecting their industry as ``re-regulation.'' At \nthe same time, I suspect some shipper groups will report that these \nproposals do not go nearly as far as they believe we should go. If so, \nthat sounds like we're at least within striking distance of the middle \nground.\n  I want to briefly explain the major provisions of this legislation:\n  First, the bill establishes that promoting competition within the \nrail industry is one of the criteria the STB should use in performing \nits responsibilities.\n  Second, the bill would extend the time period covering the Board's \nemergency service orders. The current 270-day emergency order authority \nwould be extended to cover a total period of 18 months. In the event an \nemergency remains in effect beyond this time frame, the Board would be \npermitted to request and receive two 6-month extensions of an emergency \nservice order. The Congress could disapprove the Board's requests and \nalso take affirmative action to grant any further extensions as may be \nnecessary.\n\n  Third, the bill includes several features to simplify the regulatory \nprocess involving small rate cases. During every hearing before our \nCommittee, shippers stressed their frustrations that for a small \nshipper, it is simply too time consuming and costly to ever bring a \ncase to the Board. This bill seeks to acknowledge those concerns and \nproposes to foreclose discovery in small rate cases, absent a \ndemonstration of compelling need. Further, it would direct the Board to \nestablish an arbitration mechanism for small shipper cases. It would \nnot require mandatory arbitration, but would allow for arbitration at \none party's request.\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\n  Fourth, my bill seeks to address concerns raised about the Board's \nmarket dominance standard. Some have advocated Congress statutorily \neliminate product and geographic competition from the Board's market \ndominance analysis as it is a very time consuming process. Yet others \ncontend these considerations remain necessary. My bill recognizes the \nBoard's April 17th decision announcing it would initiate a proceeding \nto consider whether to maintain, change, or eliminate product and \ngeographic competition from consideration in rate cases. I believe the \nBoard's action is the proper route to follow.\n  Fifth, my bill seeks to address another area of concern raised by \nshippers: revenue adequacy. At the Board's April hearings, rail and \nshipper representatives suggested referring this matter of considerable \ndebate to one or more disinterested economists, which the Board \ninitiated April 17th. My bill directs the Board to carry out its \nproposal in this area and direct rail and shipper representatives to \nselect a panel of 3 disinterested economists to examine the Board's \ncurrent standards for measuring revenue adequacy and to consider \nwhether alternative measurements of a railroad's financial health are \nwarranted.\n  Sixth, my bill seeks to address the issue of bottleneck rates. There \nis considerable debate as to the correct approach in this area, with \nsome strongly opposed to any change and others equally adamant about \ntotal reform. My proposal seeks to take a balanced approach, ensuring \nsome needed boundaries remain. It would require a carrier to provide a \nshipper with a rate for a ``bottleneck'' line segment when requested to \naccommodate a transportation contract. The railroad would be required \nto provide the shipper with a rate over the ``bottleneck'' line segment \nas long as the interchange would be operationally feasible and the \nthrough route would not significantly impair the railroad's ability to \nserve its other shippers.\n  Finally, my bill would remove the 3-year renewal requirement \nregarding antitrust immunity applicable to household goods carriers. \nWhile the continued propriety of collective actions by other types of \nmotor carriers has been the subject of debate, no similar concerns have \nbeen voiced about the collective activities of household goods \ncarriers. The repeal of the mandatory review requirement would relieve \nthe carriers of an unnecessary regulatory burden, although it would \nhave no effect on the STB's existing authority to modify or revoke \ncollective actions when the STB determines such action is necessary to \nprotect the public interest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of my bill be printed \nin the Record. I encourage my colleagues to look at this legislation \nand begin working with me now so that we may reauthorize the Surface \nTransportation Board this year and provide important policy guidance in \nregard to rail service matters.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2164\n\n        Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This effort, known as ``Operation \nCasablanca,'' has infiltrated and dismantled a group of international \nbankers, mostly in Mexico, who have been laundering drug money. The \nthreat of drug trafficking is serious enough. But to have their \nfinancial advisors leading their effort to facilitate the smuggling of \nillicit narcotics is much worse. Complicit bankers devising schemes can \nmake it much easier to move and hide the ill-gotten gains of drug \ncartels.\n  As this latest law enforcement operation illustrates, we must be sure \nthat we are taking the necessary steps to protect the citizens of our \nnation. We must prevent drug traffickers and organized crime groups \nfrom obtaining the profits of their illegal activities. Much has been \ndone and said about the movement of illegal drugs into the United \nStates. But the opposite side of the business does not always get the \npublicity, and is just as important. We need to go after the profits \nfrom drug sales and other illegal enterprises.\n  Last week, Representative Leach, Chairman of the Committee on Banking \nand Financial Services introduced legislation to amend title 31, United \nStates Code. The bill H.R. 4005, ``the Money Laundering Deterrence Act \nof 1998,'' would improve methods for preventing financial crimes. And \nas Operation Casablanca shows this legislation, is timely and needed. \nWe need to tighten up our financial control capabilities to prevent \ncriminal enterprises from abusing our financial and banking systems. \nThe bill is supported by the American Banking Association (ABA), the \nDepartment of the Treasury, the Department of Justice and the Federal \nReserve. Today, Chairman Leach's bill has already been marked up in the \nHouse.\n  I call for my colleagues to help support this companion legislation. \nI hope this would be a continuation of efforts by Congress to go after \nthe growing threat of money laundering not only to our nation, but \nworldwide.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2166. A bill to amend the National School Lunch Act and the Child \nNutrition Act of 1966 to provide children with increased access to food \nand nutrition assistance, to simplify program operations and improve \nprogram management, to extend certain authorities contained in such \nActs through fiscal year 2002, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n       CHILD NUTRITION AND WIC REAUTHORIZATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today, at the \nrequest of the Clinton Administration, the Child Nutrition and WIC \nReauthorization Amendments of 1998. I am grateful to be joined in the \nintroduction of this bill by Senator Leahy, the Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee on Research, Nutrition, and General Legislation, and by \nSenator Johnson. In my years serving on the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, and now as its Ranking Member, I have always \nplaced a very high value on the child nutrition programs, including the \nSpecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children \n(WIC). These programs have been critical in helping to meet the \nnutritional needs of millions of our nation's children.\n  This bill is the first child nutrition reauthorization bill sent to \nCongress by an Administration in two decades. It is a very commendable \neffort, with many positive features, that we will be relying upon \nsubstantially as we fashion a child nutrition bill in the coming weeks \nin the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and \nultimately in conference. In addition to reauthorizing those programs \nthat are expiring, the bill makes a number of improvements throughout \nthe child nutrition programs. It is designed to be cost-neutral over \nthe next five years, to simplify and streamline program operations, to \nreduce impediments to participation by eligible individuals, to reach \ncertain children needing additional nutritional assistance, to \nstrengthen program integrity and to enhance the nutrition provided by \nthe programs.\n  Earlier this year, I joined Chairman Lugar, Senator McConnell and \nSenator Leahy in introducing a measure, S. 1581, that would simply \nreauthorize the child nutrition programs for the next five years. That \nbill was recognized as a starting point for a careful review of the \nchild nutrition programs leading to the development of a sound, well-\ncrafted and bipartisan reauthorization bill. I believe there is broad \nsupport for improving and modifying these programs to meet changing \nneeds and demands within the overall spending limitations that we are \ncommitted to working within.\n  One of the more important features of the bill is new authority for \nnutrition assistance in after-school programs through the Child and \nAdult Care Food Program for at risk youths between the ages of 12 and \n18. We know too well that the hours just after school are full of \nopportunities for teenagers to get into trouble, whether it involves \ncrime, drug use or teen pregnancy. The availability of nutrition \nassistance can help to support organized after-school activities that \nare healthy and constructive alternatives to what might otherwise occur \nin those risky after-school hours.\n  There are also provisions in the bill designed to improve the \nnutrition provided by the programs, including an emphasis on \nestablishing adequate time for kids to eat school lunches in an \natmosphere conducive to good nutrition and an authorization of \nNutrition Education and Training grants based on $0.50 a child each \nyear with a minimum of $75,000 per state.\n  There are also provisions in the bill to improve access to the Summer \nFood Service Program by increasing the number of sites and the number \nof children that can be served by non-profit sponsors. Statistics \ncontinue to show that far fewer low income children are served in the \nSummer Food Service Program than during the school year in the National \nSchool Lunch Program, especially in rural areas. The provisions in this \nbill are designed to help address this gap.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the WIC Program. Under Secretary Shirley \nWatkins was absolutely correct when she said at a recent Agriculture \nCommittee Hearing that, ``WIC works.'' No other Federal-state program \nhas the proven cost-effectiveness of WIC, which has been shown in study \nafter study. This bill is designed to build upon the success of the \ncurrent WIC program with improvements in program management and \nintegrity.\n  While I support a very high proportion of the provisions of this \nbill, I do not necessarily support every detail of it. I will also \nmention some of the areas in which I hope the final bill will take more \nsubstantial steps than are included in this bill. In my view, more \nshould be done to increase participation in the School Breakfast \nProgram, especially among low-income children, and in the Summer Food \nService Program. I would also prefer further strengthening of after-\nschool and child care nutrition assistance. And additional steps should \nbe taken to improve integrity and accountability in the WIC program \nwhile continuing the progress toward full participation.\n  I look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues, the \nAdministration and the entire child nutrition community, to design a \nfinal bill having broad bipartisan support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in full \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2166\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. \nApp.) to increase the efficiency and accountability of Offices of \nInspector General within Federal departments, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                inspector general act amendments of 1998\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, since coming to the Senate and assuming \nthe Chairmanship of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, one \nof my top priorities has been the seemingly never-ending fight to \nferret out and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in federal government \nprograms. We've all heard the horror stories of $500 hammers and roads \nbuilt to nowhere. The waste of scarce federal resources not only picks \nthe pockets of the taxpayers but also places severe financial pressures \non already overburdened programs, forcing cutbacks in the delivery of \nvital government services.\n  Over the past year, I have seen this waste first-hand as the \nSubcommittee put a spotlight on massive fraud in the Medicare program. \nTo cite just one example, the Subcommittee's investigation revealed \nthat the federal government had been sending Medicare checks to 14 \nhealth care companies whose address, if they had existed, was in the \nmiddle of the runway of the Miami International Airport. That fraud \ncost the taxpayers millions of dollars, diverting scarce resources from \nthe elderly and legitimate health care providers.\n  This example and others like it were uncovered by my Subcommittee \nworking hand-in-hand with the Inspector General's Office, whose mission \nis to identify the eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in federal \nprograms. In many ways, the Inspectors General are the eyes and ears of \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, in particular, and the \nCongress, in general, as we strive to detect and prevent waste, fraud, \nabuse, and mismanagement in federal programs.\n  Mr. President, this year marks the 20th anniversary of the Inspector \nGeneral Act, the law that the Congress passed to create these guardians \nof the public purse. As we recognize this anniversary, it is important \nfor Congress to take a close look at the IG system.\n  During the past 20 years, the Inspector General community has grown \nfrom 12 in 1978 to 57 Inspectors General today. These offices receive \nmore than $1 billion in annual funding and employ over 10,000 auditors, \ncriminal investigators, and support personnel. The Office of Inspector \nGeneral is charged with tremendous responsibilities and is given \nconsiderable authority to uncover waste and abuse within the \ngovernment.\n  By and large, the IG community has done an outstanding job. They have \nmade thousands of recommendations to Congress, ultimately saving \ntaxpayers literally billions of dollars. Investigations by Inspectors \nGeneral have also resulted in the recovery of billions of dollars from \ncompanies and individuals who defrauded the federal government. These \ninvestigations have been the basis for thousands of criminal \nprosecutions, debarments, exclusions and suspensions.\n  The Inspectors General have a demonstrated record of success over the \npast 20 years, but as with any government program, we must be vigilant \nto ensure that the program is well managed, accountable, and effective. \nWith this goal in mind and drawing on my work with the Inspectors \nGeneral over the past year and a half, I am introducing the ``Inspector \nGeneral Act Amendments of 1998,'' a bill to improve the accountability \nand efficiency of the Inspectors General program. I am pleased to have \nmy colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, as a cosponsor.\n\n  The bill is designed to increase the accountability and independence \nof Inspectors General. It establishes a renewable nine-year term of \noffice for each of the 26 Inspectors General who are appointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate. This provision will also \nencourage Inspectors General to serve for longer periods of time so \nthat their experience and judgment can be used to fight waste, fraud \nand abuse.\n  This bill also takes steps to streamline the IG Offices themselves--\nmaking them more efficient and flexible--by consolidating existing \noffices and by reducing the volume of the inspectors general reporting \nrequirements.\n  The number of OIGs has increased more than four-fold in twenty years, \nand many of these are small offices with just a handful of employees. \nThese small OIGs can be made far more efficient and effective by \ntransferring their functions to larger, department-wide IG offices. For \nexample, my bill consolidates the current stand-alone office of the \nPeace Corps, with just 15 employees, into the State Department--\neliminating unnecessary overhead and bureaucracy but continuing \nthorough audit and oversight of the Peace Corps. Under this proposal, \nseven existing small IG offices are consolidated into the IG offices of \nmajor departments.\n  Currently, Offices of Inspectors General are required by law to \nprovide semi-annual reports to Congress. My bill would increase the \nvalue of the report process by reducing the requirement to a single \nannual report and streamlining the information required for each \nreport. For example, the new reporting requirement would require the \nIGs to identify areas within their jurisdiction which are at highest \nrisk for waste, fraud and abuse. In that way, the Congress can attack \nthose weak areas before they get worse and before the problems become \nmore difficult to solve.\n  The Inspectors General have made valuable contributions to the \nefficient operation of the federal government, but their record is not \nwithout blemish. For example, this successful record was recently \ntarnished by the activities of the Treasury Department's Office of \nInspector General. After an extensive investigation, my Subcommittee \nfound that this office violated federal laws in the award of two sole-\nsource contracts, which wasted thousands of dollars. It was disturbing \nto find that this one Inspector General's Office was itself guilty of \nwasting resources--the very office charged with preventing fraud and \nabuse. At the conclusion of that investigation, the Subcommittee asked \nthe question: who is watching the watchdogs?\n\n  Let me stress that, in my view, problems like the ones in the \nTreasury Inspector General's office are not widespread in the Inspector \nGeneral community. However, an Inspector General is not like any other \ngovernment manager. Inspectors General are the very officials in \ngovernment responsible for combating waste, fraud and abuse in Federal \nprograms. And as such, Inspectors General should be held to a higher \nstandard. To do their job effectively, Inspectors General must be above \nreproach, must set an example for other government managers to follow, \nand must not create situations where there is even the appearance of \nimpropriety. Credibility and effectiveness are lost when the office \ncharged with combating waste and abuse engages in the kind of activity \nthat the Inspector General is responsible for deterring.\n  To increase accountability, my bill requires independent external \nreviews of the Inspector General offices every three years. It gives \neach office the flexibility to choose the most efficient method of \nreview, but it does require that the watchdogs themselves submit to \noversight by a qualified third party. This provision will help ensure \npublic confidence in the management and efficiency of the IG offices.\n  Finally, Mr. President, one provision that is not included in this \nbill, but that deserves careful consideration, is the grant of \nstatutory law enforcement authority for the Inspector General of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The Medicare fraud \ninvestigation conducted by my Subcommittee revealed the dangers faced \nby HHS-IG Special Agents when they work with the FBI and others to \ninvestigate some cases of health care fraud. These agents work side by \nside with other federal law enforcement professionals, and the Congress \nshould carefully examine the best way to provide them with tools \nnecessary for them to do their jobs effectively.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today represents the first step \nin the process to improve the effectiveness, efficiency and \naccountability of the Inspector General program. These offices\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\nprovide valuable assistance to the Congress so that we can exercise our \nduty to oversee the operation of the federal government and to make \nsure that the taxpayer's money is well spent and not wasted. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort to strengthen and improve the \nInspectors General program into the next century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S.J.

Mr. President, two years ago the Congress \njoined together in a bipartisan manner to help schools and libraries \nacross the nation give students and children access to modern \ntechnology. The Telecommunications Reform Act of 1996 created a new \npartnership between the federal government, state governments, school \nsystems, and the private sector to help bring all our classrooms into \nthe 21st century. The bill expanded the universal service program--\nwhich has historically given people living in rural areas the chance to \npurchase affordable phone service--and created a new ``e-rate'' for \nschools and libraries. Creating that partnership was the most important \nact the 104th Congress took for elementary and secondary schools, and \nwe have yet to match that achievement in this Congress. It was one of \nthe most important steps we have taken toward ensuring that all our \nchildren will have the opportunity to learn the kinds of skills they \nwill need to compete in the 21st century economy.\n  Our children need that kind of bipartisan support. When I was growing \nup, it was possible to graduate from high school and get a job as a \npolice officer, a firefighter, or a clerk, and earn enough to raise and \nsupport a family. Mechanics used to train for their work on the job. \nThe nursing profession used to consist of women who apprenticed in \nhospitals.\n  Times have changed. Now, if you want to be an airline mechanic, you \nneed four years of college. Nursing is a degree program, and there are \nsub-specialties of nurses who are highly and scientifically educated. \nAn ad for a ``maintenance technician'' states the job requires an \nunderstanding of ``basic principles of electricity, mechanical systems, \nand fluid power.''\n\n[[Page S6258]]\n\n  Many of our schools, however, are not giving our children the kind of \neducation they will need to compete in this kind of economy. An \nestimated 60 percent of all new jobs created in the year 2000 will \nrequire skills held by only 22 percent of new workers. According to the \nWall Street Journal, ``Thousands of people are being turned down for \nfactory work by companies that are actively recruiting,'' because they \nlack the requisite math, communications, and computer skills.\n  Given these facts, one would think that on the eve of the \nimplementation of the e-rate we created two years ago, policy makers \nwould be rallying around the new discounts for schools and libraries \nand celebrating the program's inauguration. Instead, duplicity and \npolitical opportunism have combined to cast doubt on the future of the \ne-rate.\n  The duplicity began when certain telephone companies decided to add a \nnew line item to customers' phone bills--a ``national access charge,'' \nor a ``universal connectivity fee.'' When customers call their phone \ncompanies asking about this new charge, it is my understanding they are \noften told it was the FCC who mandated that this new charge appear on \ntheir phone bills, or that it was the Congress who levied this new tax \non them.\n  Mr. President, that is disingenuous at best. The FCC did order long \ndistance phone companies to pay into the universal service fund, in \npart to pay for the new discounts for schools and libraries. The FCC \nalso, however, ordered a reduction in the access charges long distance \ncompanies must pay for using local phone networks--fees that can \naccount for 40 or 50 percent of the cost of every long distance call. \nThe reductions in access charges were greater than the new universal \nservice charges. One would think, therefore, that long distance bills \nwould drop as a result. Have they? Have the phone companies passed the \nsavings from the access charge reductions on to their customers?\n  No. The companies have not passed on all the savings from the access \ncharge reductions, and have instead raised customers' bills in order to \ngenerate revenue for the universal service fund. They then blame the \nFCC or Congress, and customers are understandably confused, concerned, \nand upset.\n  The chorus of customer complaints now appears to be rattling the \nbipartisan coalition that came together two years ago to create the e-\nrate. Republican leaders have derided the new charge on phone bills as \nan ``illegal FCC tax,'' or a ``Gore tax,'' trying to pin the phone bill \nincreases on the Vice President.\n  I am disappointed. We have gone from partnership to partisanship. We \nhave gone from cooperation to confrontation. We have gone from thinking \nabout our children and our future to trying to score political points.\n  We can do better than that. Thirty thousand applications have poured \nin to the FCC this year from schools and libraries seeking to tap into \nthe new e-rate. Those applications represent millions of American \nchildren counting on our help to gain the skills they need to remain \ncompetitive in the next century. What are we going to tell them if the \ne-rate crumbles under the weight of partisan politics? How are we going \nto explain to them why they do not know how to use a computer?\n  I hope we will not have to do that. I hope we can all come together, \nwith the same bipartisanship and cooperation we shared two years ago, \nto fix this program, resolve legitimate concerns, and ensure that the \ne-rate becomes available to schools and libraries across the country.\n  Members of both parties have criticized the FCC for the way it has \nimplemented the program, and I do not doubt that mistakes have been \nmade. I only hope we can put aside the partisan sniping and figure out \na constructive solution to the problem we face. We ought to be proud of \nwhat we accomplished two years ago when we created the e-rate. Let us \nnot now trade that accomplishment for short-term political gain.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an editorial from yesterday's Washington \nPost on this subject be printed in the record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                 [Washington Post, Wed., June 10, 1998]\n\n                        Should We Wire Schools?\n\n       Sometime this week the Federal Communications Commission \n     will vote on whether to suspend a small program, passed as \n     part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, that collects money \n     from long-distance phone companies and uses it to offer \n     discounts on the cost of hooking up schools and libraries to \n     the Internet. The program, known as the ``e-rate,'' has been \n     contentious from the start, but lately, as it prepares to \n     begin actually considering applications for the $650 million \n     collected so far, it has become the focus of intense \n     pressure.\n       Four senators with a say over the FCC's own budget sent a \n     letter demanding that it refund the program entirely. Some \n     have hinted that the commission risks having its own budget \n     zeroed out unless it kills the schools and libraries program. \n     Others threaten investigation of what they call a ``stealth \n     tax'' imposed with questionable legality by an unelected \n     agency or, alternatively, a ``Gore tax'' designed to advance \n     the vice president's presidential prospects.\n       Why the sudden fuss over a $2 billion program that passed \n     all the usual legislative hurdles in orthodox fashion two \n     years ago? The flurry began when several long-distance \n     telephone providers said they would begin adding a \n     ``universal connectivity fee'' to individual monthly \n     telephone bills to cover the schools and libraries program \n     and other subsidies, such as the generations-old (and widely \n     supported) subsidy for keeping phone service affordable in \n     hard-to-serve rural areas. The appearance of what looks like \n     a new tax on phone bills--even if it only spells out \n     subsidies previously included in the overall bill--unnerves \n     many legislators who support the subsidies in theory. Not \n     everyone realizes that the schools and libraries fund \n     constitutes only a third of the new fee. (The FCC and the \n     companies are still sparring over whether the extra charges \n     were even justified; the commission says the fees were \n     specifically calibrated to balance year-by-year savings to \n     the companies from another aspect of the 1996 bill, a drop in \n     the access fees long-distance carriers must pay to local \n     ones.)\n       Much of the debate over the complex telecommunications bill \n     concerned the balance to be struck between deregulating the \n     communications industry--thus opening up the chance for phone \n     companies to make lots more money--and imposing some \n     obligations on them in return. One such obligation was to \n     safeguard equal access, including to new technologies. After \n     endless maneuvering and a veto threat by President Clinton if \n     the bill emerged without them, provisions mandating ``access \n     to advanced telecommunications services for schools, health \n     care and libraries,'' explicitly including ``classrooms,'' \n     were made part of the subsidies for ``universal service.'' \n     Telephone companies understandably balk at any creeping \n     enlargement of the universal service concept, which requires \n     them to offer phone service at average rates even in high-\n     cost, hard-to-wire rural areas--and, inevitably to absorb the \n     cost by charging slightly higher phone rates across the \n     board.\n       One thrust of deregulation was to make those subsidies more \n     explicit--an advantage for companies, which could compete \n     more openly on basic rates, and also for consumers, who could \n     see where their money was going. But spelling out a long-\n     hidden subsidy also exposes it to political debate. Such \n     debate need not doom the e-rate, which pulls considerable \n     support in opinion polls, any more than it is likely to doom \n     the popular rural subsidies. Nor should it. Squelching it \n     would be the real ``stealth'' move.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6257-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6258-S6259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SISTER MONICA KOSTIELNEY CELEBRATES 25 YEARS WITH MICHIGAN CATHOLIC \n                               CONFERENCE\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and \nhonor a very important woman in the Michigan religious community. \nSister Monica Kostielney, R.S.M. is celebrating 25 years with the \nMichigan Catholic Conference this year. Presently, she serves as \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer of the Conference, however, her \nlist of accomplishments extends far beyond her work in this capacity.\n  Prior to joining the Catholic Conference, Sister Monica taught \nelementary and secondary school for thirteen years. She began her \ncareer with the Catholic Conference of Michigan as a staff member in \n1972. She served as Executive Vice-President for public affairs from \n1983 until 1994, and has served as President and CEO since then. For 25 \nyears, in addition to her service to the Michigan Catholic Conference, \nSister Monica has advised many on important issues affecting all facets \nof society. She has given selflessly of her time to many other \norganizations and charities including, the Midwest Hispanic Catholic \nCommission, the Michigan Department of Education Legislative Advisory \nCouncil, the Governor's Blue Ribbon Welfare Reform Committee and the \nBoard of Directors of St. Lawrence Hospital and Healthcare Services \nDivisional Board. From 1980 to 1984, Sister Monica co-hosted ``Reel to \nReel,'' a weekly Sunday television show produced by the\n\n[[Page S6259]]\n\nDiocese of Lansing. These are just a few examples of Sister Monica's \nunwavering devotion to her community and the entire State of Michigan.\n  I want to join with Sister Monica's friends and family in \ncongratulating her on this very special occasion. She is a remarkable \nwoman whom the state of Michigan is fortunate to benefit from. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6258-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FRANKIE WELCH\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the Senate's \nattention a milestone that has particular relevance to this body. Mrs. \nFrankie Welch, who is nationally recognized for her artistic and \noriginal scarf and tie designs, is celebrating 30 years of fashion \ndesign this month. Frankie was born in Georgia, but I am pleased to say \nshe has strong ties to South Carolina, where she graduated with a \ndegree from Furman University in Greenville. It was at Furman that she \nmet her late husband, William Welch. One of their daughters chose to \ncontinue the family tradition and also received a Furman diploma.\n  Frankie Welch has designed many memorable scarves and ties. In the \n1980s, she designed a patriotic scarf for the United States Senate. She \nhas designed ties for Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald \nFord, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. Mrs. \nWelch also designed a gown for First Lady Betty Ford, which Mrs. Ford \ndonated to the Smithsonian Institution's First Ladies Collection in \n1976. Frankie and Mrs. Ford remained good friends; last month, on the \noccasion of Betty Ford's 80th birthday, Frankie was one of the speakers \nat the Ford Museum in Grand Rapids.\n  Frankie Welch is no ordinary fashion designer. She often employs her \ntalents to produce patriotic garments, and her designs demonstrate an \nexemplary love of our country. She has produced original and widely \nadmired fabric designs for such revered institutions as the St. Paul's \nCathedral in London, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the White House, and \nthe U.S. Capital. Frankie is also a philanthropist: she recently began \nthe Frankie Welch Scholarship for outstanding students of fashion \ndesign.\n  Mr. President, I think it appropriate to honor a woman who has so \noften turned her talents to patriotic themes and who has attained \nnational and international accolades. It is with great pride that I \nthank Frankie Welch for honoring our country and congratulate her on \nthirty years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6259-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THANKING GENERAL EUGENE E. HABIGER FOR CAREER SERVICE IN THE UNITED \n                            STATES AIR FORCE\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise to say thank you to a \npatriot and one of this nation's finest military leaders, General \nEugene E. Habiger, who is retiring at the end of June, 1998. Since \n1996, General Habiger has served as the Commander in Chief of United \nStates Strategic Command, Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.\n  General Habiger's career in the military began in 1959 when he \nenlisted as an infantryman in the U.S. Army. After his tour in Fort \nBenning, Georgia, he attended the University of Georgia earning a \nBachelor of Science degree in 1963. After college, Gene joined the Air \nForce and upon completion of Officer Training School in September 1963, \nhe was selected as a distinguished graduate.\n  Soon after leaving Officer Training School, as a young Captain and B-\n52 Aircraft Commander, Gene flew 150 combat missions and participated \nin the B-52 Arc Light operations during the Vietnam War. In the early \n1980s, he commanded the 325th Bombardment Squadron and later served as \nassistant deputy commander for operations, 92nd Bombardment Wing, \nFairchild Air Force Base, Washington.\n  In the late 1980s, Gene commanded the 379th Bombardment Wing at \nWurtsmith Air Force Base, Michigan, and the 2nd Bombardment Wing at \nBarksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. In the 1990s, Gene's command \nexperience served him well as vice commander, Headquarters Air \nEducation and Training Command at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas; and \nas Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel, Headquarters U.S. Air Force, \nWashington, D.C.\n  The apex of General Habiger's career came with his current assignment \nas Commander in Chief, United States Strategic Command, Offutt Air \nForce Base, Nebraska. The command has responsibility for all U.S. Air \nForce and U.S. Navy strategic nuclear forces. These powerful forces act \nas this Nation's strategic deterrent.\n  During his command at USSTRATCOM, General Habiger made major \ncontributions to the national security of the United States by \nestablishing the parameters for future strategic forces and possible \narms control agreements. His leading role in managing a stable drawdown \nof nuclear forces helped foster mutual understanding and cooperation \nwith Russia. In addition, his cooperative efforts with the Department \nof Energy shaped the process by which the United States will maintain \nthe long term safety and reliability of its nuclear weapons stockpile. \nAs the Department of Energy's customer, General Habiger insured the \nStockpile Stewardship Program is programmed and funded to develop the \nnew tools, technologies, and concepts to ensure our strategic forces \nremain safe, effective, ready, and responsive to changing needs.\n  In addition, Gene was a premier player in shaping our strategic force \nstructure. His team completed a very detailed analysis of United \nStates' Strategic Force Structure options reaching far beyond START II. \nThis unprecedented target-by-target scrub of the Single Integrated \nOperational Plan (SIOP) helped shape the conceptual and practical \ncharacter of post-Cold War US nuclear weapons policy that will be \ninstrumental in decisions for years to come.\n  Convinced that the Nation's security is best served by a stable \nstrategic relationship with Russia, General Habiger was a forceful \nspokesman for the START II Treaty and Defense Department Cooperative \nThreat Reduction activities. Twice, he accompanied the Secretary of \nDefense to Moscow to meet with the Russian Defense Minister and \nCommander-in-Chief of the Strategic Rocket Forces stressing the \npolitical, economic, and military importance of ratifying START II for \nboth the United States and Russia. Gene's work on a post-START II \nnuclear arms control agenda was reflected in national policy, and \nhelped form the basis for portions of the START III framework announced \nat the Presidential Summit in Helsinki, in March 1997.\n  Undoubtedly, General Habiger has been the unparalleled leader in \nexpanding military-to-military contacts with Russian counterparts, \nparticularly the Strategic Rocket Forces. These actions established a \nmore stable relationship with Russian leadership. As evidence of the \nhigh regard and confidence in which General Habiger is viewed in \nRussia, he was the first non-Russian to enter a Russian nuclear weapons \nstorage area. His ceaseless efforts in establishing good relations with \nRussia have significantly improved communication and understanding. For \nthe first time in history, as Commander in Chief of the US nuclear \narsenal, he can pick up the phone and talk directly to senior Russian \nmilitary leadership.\n  General Habiger and his wife, Barbara, have two sons, Karl and Kurt. \nI am sure Gene and Barbara have ambitious plans for their life after \nmilitary service and I hope they make the most of this time. From a \nprivate in the U.S. Army to a four star general in the U.S. Air Force, \nGeneral Habiger has served our military and the Nation with great honor \nand distinction. I have the pleasure of calling Gene Habiger a friend \nand I want to thank him for his contribution to our nation's \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6259-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6259-S6260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDOVER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER AND NATIONAL FEDERATION OF PRESS WOMEN AWARD \n                    WINNER--PATTY RICHARDSON HINCHEY\n\n   Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we focus on improving our \neducation system on the national state and local levels, it is my \npleasure to offer congratulations to an award-winning teacher from \nDover, Delaware who exemplifies excellence in education for her \nstudents, her community, my home state of Delaware, and indeed, this \nnation.\n  For the second consecutive year, Patty Richardson Hinchey received \nthe second place award in the category of\n\n[[Page S6260]]\n\nAchievement/Research--Faculty Adviser of Student Publications for \nSecondary Schools. This award is given by the prestigious National \nFederation of Press Women. The award recognizes the outstanding high \nschool journalism advisers/teachers.\n  Patty also won first place in the State of Delaware competition for \nthe past two years in the same category from the Delaware Press Women, \nwhich made her eligible for the national award.\n  What my colleagues might find most interesting and ironic--the name \nof the student newspaper at Dover High School for which Patty is the \nfaculty adviser is ``The Senator.'' The 24-page award-winning issue \ncaptivated the pulse of student activities, highlighted the history of \nsoon-to-be graduates, spotlighted student leadership during their four \nyears at Dover High School, congratulated Athletes of the Year, and \nfeatured articles about teachers who make a difference.\n  Patty's work on the student newspaper goes well beyond the final \nafternoon school bell. She and her students calculated spending more \nthan 6,000 hours in the last four years putting editions of ``The \nSenator'' to bed. Even more remarkable, due to a school-related \naccident leaving Patty unable to walk, she worked from her home with \nthe students to get the final issue to press on time.\n  I have spoken often about the need in this day and age to give young \npeople an ``excuse'' to stay on the road to achievement, stay in \nschool, stay away from alcohol, drugs and gangs, and stay off the \nstreets. Student newspapers, like Dover High School's, and teachers \nlike Patty Hinchey, are providing these students with that valuable \n``excuse.'' This is positive peer pressure, and our country needs more \nof it. The students know they have to keep their grades up, get their \nwork done on strict deadlines, and keep out of trouble or else they \nwill not experience the thrill and pride of seeing their byline on an \narticle they researched and wrote.\n  So, I want to thank Patty for providing these award-winning students \nthe opportunity to be their very best and strive for excellence in \ntheir work. The lessons and values they have learned working on the \nschool newspaper will serve them well throughout their lives--the \nlessons of deadlines, responsibility, accountability, how to \ncommunicate verbally and in writing, and most importantly how to get \nalong with and respect other people.\n  I could go on about how impressed I am with Patty, but listen to what \nher students say about her. The Editor-in Chief of ``The Senator'' \nsaid: ``Mrs. Hinchey is an inspirational, talented, creative, hard-\nworking, and most importantly, loving teacher. I am currently a senior \nand have been in her class since my freshman year. Over this time, I \nhave been able to observe how many students she has become close to and \nhow many people both trust and respect her.''\n  Another student, Kate Basone, Advertising Editor, said: ``Mrs. \nHinchey inspired the students to produce work that reflected their best \neffort. She would not accept articles that she felt were not up to the \nstandards of ``The Senator'' which she established. Therefore, because \nof her constant pushing and sometime pulling, many students found \nthemselves producing some of their best work.''\n  Patty is not only a talented teacher, she is a terrific mother to her \ndaughter Andrea, who is student at the University of Delaware, and a \ncareer military wife to the now retired Lieutenant Colonel John \nHinchey.\n  It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Patty Richardson \nHinchey for her outstanding accomplishments as an awarding-winning \nteacher and faculty adviser for the Dover High School newspaper ``The \nSenator.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6259-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMEMORATION OF HARLEY-DAVIDSON'S 95TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am proud to have this \nopportunity to recognize a company that truly reflects the spirit, \ngoals and achievements of a true ``American success story'' as hailed \nby President Ronald Reagan in 1987. Today, Harley-Davidson Motor \nCompany is an even more outstanding example of American ingenuity and \nperformance. They have seen record earnings 31 of the last 32 \nquarters--a prime example of their strength as a business. They have \nseen 32 consecutive quarters of record sales--clearly demonstrating the \nloyalty of their consumer base.\n  Harley-Davidson produces its entire line of the very popular \nSportster motorcycle in Kansas City, Missouri. They opened the doors of \nthis facility months ahead of schedule, and are already employing \nhundreds of Missourians. This is evidence of the positive path of \ngrowth and expansion of Harley-Davidson. The U.S. market share for \nHarley continues to grow; today it is 56 percent. Harley also has a \ngreat future in the international marketplace and the company is seeing \nincreasing demand for its products in Europe, Japan, Australia, and \nother countries.\n  Harley has long been a leader in design and safety standards. As \nearly as 1921, Harley-Davidson bikes incorporated advancements that are \nstill in use today. Twenty years later, during World War II, Harley \ndevoted its entire output of motorcycles to the war effort earned the \ncoveted Army-Navy ``E'' award for excellence in wartime production.\n  In many ways, Harley-Davidson has freed generations of American rider \nto enjoy this country by motorcycle. As Harley-Davidson approaches its \nhallmark 95th anniversary as a producer of quality American goods, I \nwant to be among the first of the long list of well wishers to say, \n``Happy Anniversary, Harley! You're still `king of the road!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6260-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6260-S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NAMING OF YEOMAN FIRST CLASS STEPHEN R. DYKEMA AS THE 1997 ENLISTED \n              PERSON OF THE YEAR FOR THE U.S. COAST GUARD\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nfellow South Carolinian for outstanding service and dedication to this \nNation. I take great pleasure in congratulating Yeoman First Class \nStephen R. Dykema for his selection as the 1997 Enlisted Person of the \nYear for the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Each day more than 25,000 enlisted men and women put their lives and \nsafety on the line to carry out the Coast Guard's diverse missions. The \nCoast Guard plays a critical role as an armed service in defending our \nNation and maintaining national security. In addition, the Coast Guard \nannually conducts thousands of fisheries enforcement boardings; \nprevents tons of cocaine and marijuana from reaching the streets; gives \nsafety instruction to more than one-half million recreational boaters; \nand saves about 5,000 lives. The American public has learned to depend \non the Coast Guard's service, both close to home and in trouble spots \naround the world.\n  That service is built on a tradition of dedication by Coast Guard \nenlisted personnel. Yeoman First Class Stephen R. Dykema is an \nindividual who epitomizes that tradition. Petty Officer Dykema was \nselected as the 1997 Enlisted Person of the Year because of his \nexemplary military bearing, leadership ability and work performance. He \ncurrently is assigned to the Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey. \nHowever, he has spent much of his time assigned to the cutter Madrona, \na buoy tender stationed in my hometown of Charleston.\n  Throughout his nine-year Coast Guard career, Petty Officer Dykema has \nreceived numerous medals and commendations. But I'd like to highlight \njust one incident that really shows why he has earned the honor of \nbeing named as Enlisted Person of 1997. During one of the Madrona's \nlonger deployments that year, a box of mail was lost. Among the box's \ncontent were bills, family letters, care packages, and Father's Day \ncards--all those routine types of correspondence upon which a sailor's \nmorale depends. Petty Officer Dykema swung into action, launching a \npersonal search for the missing box of mail. His documentation of the \nbox's history was so thorough that the day after it was released, the \nunit that had received the mail called to make arrangements for getting \nthe box to Charleston.\n  Petty Officer Dykema also is one of those rare individuals who finds \ntime to contribute to his shipmates and community. I'm told that he has \nused his personal time to help fellow crewmembers repay overpayments \nand\n\n[[Page S6261]]\n\nhelped people with their travel claims and housing problems. He also \nhas been involved in helping those less fortunate with clothing and \nfood and plays the keyboard and sings every Sunday at his church.\n  In short, Yeoman First Class Stephen Dykema has earned the \nrecognition he has received as Enlisted Person of 1997. This young man \nis a credit to the Coast Guard, to South Carolina, and to this \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6260-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SUPPORT OF S.J. RES. 50\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. \n50, which I joined the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, in introducing. \nThis resolution expresses the Senate's disapproval of the rule \nsubmitted by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) on June 1, \n1998, which requires the acquisition of surety bonds for home health \nagencies under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. HCFA's rule \nendangers the existence of small and non-hospital based home health \nagencies because of the excessive expenses and requirements that are \ncreated by this rule. I am concerned that patients will lose access to \nagencies where they can attain home health services and that many \nemployees will lose jobs because of the financial stress that is \ncreated by this rule.\n  Even the two Congressional leaders, Pete Stark and Karen Thurman, who \nintroduced the surety bond regulations, realize that the requirements \nhave gone beyond the original intent of Congress. The initial \nrequirement system was based on the successful Medicaid program in \nFlorida, yet the new requirements proposed by HCFA do not only penalize \npotentially harmful providers but also many of the health care agencies \nthat deliver essential high-quality care. HCFA's proposal differs from \nthe successful Florida model in many ways. In Florida, bond \nrequirements were required to be capped at $50,000, yet agencies under \nthe HCFA proposal must purchase 15 percent of its Medicare \nreimbursement the previous year or $50,000 worth of bonds, whichever is \ngreater.\n  A report done by the United States Small Business Administration in \nits April 15, 1998 letter asking HCFA to remove the 15 percent \nprovision in the surety bond regulation recognizes that HCFA failed to \ncomply with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires agencies to \naccount for the impact of a proposal on all small entities and to \nconsider alternatives to reduce the burden on those agencies. This \nreport states that HCFA did not conduct regulatory flexibility analysis \nof the proposal's impact on small entities. HCFA was not monitoring the \nimpact of this regulation on all small home health providers but only \nthose with ``aberrant billing practices.'' Therefore, many of the high-\nquality small home health care agencies are being pushed out of the \nhealth care sector because of the outrageous bond requirements.\n  HCFA also requires all home health care agencies to buy surety bonds \nregardless of their credit history, whereas in Florida those agencies \nwith at least one year in the Medicare program and no payment history \nproblems were exempted. HCFA also requires these companies to secure \nbonds every year regardless of performance. These excessive \nrequirements and costs will push many smaller, freestanding home health \nagencies out of business. If these companies are forced to shut down, \nthe elderly and disabled will lose these essential services. For, this \nrule should prevent fraud, yet it should not penalize the law-abiding \ncompanies for the abuses of less than 1% of the agencies.\n  Since this rule submitted by HCFA seems to impose conditions that go \nbeyond those bonding companies bear in the course of their normal \nbusiness, many surety companies are not offering bonds to Medicare home \nhealth agencies. Even those offering bonds are creating a prohibitive \ncost or demanding collateral equal to the face value of the bond or \npersonal guarantees that exceed the face value of the bond. Because of \nthe effects of this rule, small and non-hospital based agencies now \nrisk loss of their Medicare provider number, and their employees and \nMedicare patients can also be adversely effected.\n  The capitalization requirement in HCFA's proposal creates a barrier \nto market entry because entry is based on factors such as overhead \ncosts, location, profit margins, and competition in the area.\n  With all of these expenses and requirements, one would assume that \nonly health care agencies that have abused the system would be required \nto abide by this rule. Yet, this system penalizes small home health \ncare agencies that have been serving the elderly and disabled with \nhigh-quality for years. This rule should prevent fraud, not limit the \naccess to care for those serviced by the Medicare and Medicaid \nprograms. Because this rule will hurt many small home health care \nagencies with these exorbitant expenses and requirements, and therefore \ncause many elderly and disabled people to lose access to health care, I \nstrongly suggest that this rule submitted by HCFA be reworked with \nconsideration given to these responsible, small health care providers \nthat provide essential services for thousands of U.S. citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6261-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          USS ``BRUCE HEEZEN''\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

These students won the U.S. Navy's \nnational competition to be the first group of civilians ever granted \nthe privilege of naming a United States Navy ship. These diligent young \npeople from Oak Lawn Elementary School in Cranston overcame \nextraordinary competition being selected as finalists from more than \n2,000 entries from across the United States.\n  Last Friday, Secretary of the Navy John Dalton announced the Oak Lawn \nstudents' proposal to name the Navy's next oceanographic ship the \nU.S.S. Bruce Heezen was the winner of this competition. Heezen was a \npioneer in mapping the ocean floor who died aboard a Navy submarine \ntaking him to look for the first time at the ocean terrain.\n  I would like to extend my warmest congratulations to these bright \nstudents and their teacher for their great achievement. I share with \ntheir families and community in recognizing the fabulous work they did \nin terms of conducting extensive group research and a wide range of \nindividual projects. I also commend them for enthusiastically sharing \ntheir discoveries and knowledge with other schools in the area to \neducate their fellow students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6261-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPANSION OF THE SEABORG CENTER AT NORTHERN MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

On Thursday, \nJune 11, 1998, a groundbreaking will take place for the new complex.\n  The Seaborg Center is named for Nobel Laureate Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg \nof the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Dr. Seaborg is perhaps the most \nimportant scientist of his time. A native of Ishpeming, he was co-\ndiscoverer of Plutonium, ten elements and more than 100 isotopes. Dr. \nSeaborg's list of achievements extends far beyond these discoveries, \ntherefore, it is quite appropriate for this educational facility to be \nnamed after him. The Center will provide educational institutions at \nall levels with materials, consultative services and training in math \nand science education. It serves the entire Upper Peninsula of \nMichigan, over 56 school districts from the Northern Michigan \nUniversity campus and from three satellite centers.\n  I personally visited the original facility and recognized the \nimportance of obtaining funding to upgrade the facility. It is for this \nreason that I submitted a request for funding. I am very pleased to see \nthat this project is getting underway. It could not be happening at a \nmore exciting time, in light of Northern Michigan University's upcoming \ncentennial celebration. I extend my best wishes and congratulations to \neveryone involved with making the Seaborg Center project possible.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``National Park Service \n     Concession Management Improvement Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 402. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       In furtherance of the Act of August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. \n     535), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1, 2-4), which directs the \n     Secretary of the Interior to administer areas of the National \n     Park System in accordance with the fundamental purpose of \n     conserving their scenery, wildlife, natural and historic \n     objects, and providing for their enjoyment in a manner that \n     will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future \n     generations, the Congress hereby finds that the preservation \n     of park values requires that such public accommodations, \n     facilities and services as have to be provided within those \n     areas should be provided only under carefully controlled \n     safeguards against unregulated and indiscriminate use, so \n     that heavy visitation will not unduly impair these values and \n     so that development of such facilities can best be limited to \n     locations where the least damage to park values will be \n     caused. It is the policy of the Congress that such \n     development shall be limited to those that are necessary and \n     appropriate for public use and enjoyment of the unit of the \n     National Park System in which they are located and that are \n     consistent to the highest practicable degree with the \n     preservation and conservation of the units.\n\n     SEC. 403. AWARD OF CONCESSION CONTRACTS.\n\n       In furtherance of the findings and policy stated in section \n     402, and, except as provided by this title or otherwise \n     authorized by law, the Secretary shall utilize concession \n     contracts to authorize private entities to provide \n     accommodations, facilities and services to visitors to areas \n     of the National Park system. Such concession contracts shall \n     be awarded as follows:\n       (a) Competitive Selection Process.--Except as otherwise \n     provided in this section, all proposed concession contracts \n     shall be awarded by the Secretary to the person, corporation, \n     or other entity submitting the best proposal as determined by \n     the Secretary through a competitive selection process. Such \n     competitive process shall include simplified procedures for \n     small, individually-owned, concession contracts.\n       (b) Solicitation of Proposals.--Except as otherwise \n     provided in this section, prior to awarding a new concession \n     contract (including renewals or extensions of existing \n     concession contracts) the Secretary shall publicly solicit \n     proposals for the concession contract and, in connection with \n     such solicitation, the Secretary shall prepare a prospectus \n     and shall publish notice of its availability at least once in \n     local or national newspapers or trade publications, and/or \n     the Commerce Business Daily, as appropriate, and shall make \n     the prospectus available upon request to all interested \n     parties.\n       (c) Prospectus.--The prospectus shall include, but need not \n     be limited to, the following information:\n       (1) the minimum requirements for such contract as set forth \n     in subsection (d);\n       (2) the terms and conditions of any existing concession \n     contract relating to the services and facilities to be \n     provided, including all fees and other forms of compensation \n     provided to the United States by the concessioner;\n       (3) other authorized facilities or services which may be \n     provided in a proposal;\n       (4) facilities and services to be provided by the Secretary \n     to the concessioner, if any, including, but not limited to, \n     public access, utilities, and buildings;\n       (5) an estimate of the amount of compensation, if any, due \n     an existing concessioner from a new concessioner under the \n     terms of a prior concession contract;\n       (6) a statement as to the weight to be given to each \n     selection factor identified in the prospectus and the \n     relative importance of such factors in the selection process;\n       (7) such other information related to the proposed \n     concession operation as is provided to the Secretary pursuant \n     to a concession contract or is otherwise available to the \n     Secretary, as the Secretary determines is necessary to allow \n     for the submission of competitive proposals; and\n       (8) where applicable, a description of a preferential right \n     to the award of the proposed concession contract held by an \n     existing concessioner as set forth in subsection (g).\n       (d) Minimum Requirements.--\n       (1) No proposal shall be considered which fails to meet the \n     minimum requirements as determined by the Secretary. Such \n     minimum requirements shall include, but need not be limited \n     to--\n       (A) the minimum acceptable franchise fee or other forms of \n     consideration to the government;\n       (B) any facilities, services, or capital investment \n     required to be provided by the concessioner; and\n       (C) measures necessary to ensure the protection and \n     preservation of park resources.\n       (2) The Secretary shall reject any proposal, regardless of \n     the franchise fee offered, if the Secretary determines that \n     the person, corporation or entity is not qualified, is not \n     likely to provide satisfactory service, or that the proposal \n     is not responsive to the objectives of protecting and \n     preserving park resources and of providing necessary and \n     appropriate facilities and services to the public at \n     reasonable rates.\n       (3) If all proposals submitted to the Secretary either fail \n     to meet the minimum requirements or are rejected by the \n     Secretary, the Secretary shall establish new minimum contract \n     requirements and re-initiate the competitive selection \n     process pursuant to this section.\n       (4) The Secretary may not execute a concession contract \n     which materially amends or does not incorporate the proposed \n     terms and conditions of the concession contract as set forth \n     in the applicable prospectus. If proposed material amendments \n     or changes are considered appropriate by the Secretary, the \n     Secretary shall resolicit offers for the concession contract \n     incorporating such material amendments or changes.\n       (e) Selection of the Best Proposal.--\n       (1) In selecting the best proposal, the Secretary shall \n     consider the following principal factors:\n       (A) The responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives of \n     protecting and preserving park resources and values and of \n     providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services \n     to the public at reasonable rates.\n       (B) The experience and related background of the person, \n     corporation, or entity submitting the proposal, including but \n     not limited to, the past performance and expertise of such \n     person, corporation or entity in providing the same or \n     similar facilities or services.\n\n[[Page S6264]]\n\n       (C) The financial capability of the person, corporation or \n     entity submitting the proposal.\n       (D) The proposed franchise fee: Provided, That \n     consideration of revenue to the United States shall be \n     subordinate to the objectives of protecting and preserving \n     park resources and of providing necessary and appropriate \n     facilities to the public at reasonable rates.\n       (2) The Secretary may also consider such secondary factors \n     as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (3) In developing regulations to implement this title, the \n     Secretary shall consider the extent to which plans for \n     employment of Indians (including Native Alaskans) and \n     involvement of business owned by Indians, Indian tribes, or \n     Native Alaskans in the operation of a concession contracts \n     should be identified as a factor in the selection of a best \n     proposal under this section.\n       (f) Congressional Notification.--The Secretary shall submit \n     any proposed concession contract with anticipated annual \n     gross receipts in excess of $5,000,000 or a duration of ten \n     years or more to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources of the United States Senate and the Committee on \n     Resources of the United States House of Representatives. The \n     Secretary shall not award any such proposed contract until at \n     least 60 days subsequent to the notification of both \n     committees.\n       (g) Preferential Right of Renewal.--\n       (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary \n     shall not grant a concessioner a preferential right to renew \n     a concession contract, or any other form of preference to a \n     concession contract.\n       (2) The Secretary shall grant a preferential right of \n     renewal to an existing concessioner with respect to proposed \n     renewals of the categories of concession contracts described \n     by subsection (h), subject to the requirements of that \n     subsection.\n       (3) As used in this title, the term ``preferential right of \n     renewal'' means that the Secretary, subject to a \n     determination by the Secretary that the facilities or \n     services authorized by a prior contract continue to be \n     necessary and appropriate within the meaning of section 402 \n     of this title, shall allow a concessioner qualifying for a \n     preferential right of renewal the opportunity to match the \n     terms and conditions of any competing proposal which the \n     Secretary determines to be the best proposal for a proposed \n     new concession contract which authorizes the continuation \n     of the facilities and services provided by the \n     concessioner under its prior contract.\n       (4) A concessioner which successfully exercises a \n     preferential right of renewal in accordance with the \n     requirements of this title shall be entitled to award of the \n     proposed new concession contract to which such preference \n     applies.\n       (h) Outfitter and Guide Services and Small Contracts.--The \n     provisions of subsection (g) shall apply only to concession \n     contracts authorizing outfitter and guide services and \n     concession contracts with anticipated annual gross receipts \n     under $500,000 as further described below and which otherwise \n     qualify as follows:\n       (1) Outfitting and Guide Contracts.--For the purposes of \n     this title, an ``outfitting and guide concession contract'' \n     means a concession contract which solely authorizes the \n     provision of specialized backcountry outdoor recreation guide \n     services which require the employment of specially trained \n     and experienced guides to accompany park visitors in the \n     backcountry so as to provide a safe and enjoyable experience \n     for visitors who otherwise may not have the skills and \n     equipment to engage in such activity. Outfitting and guide \n     concessioners, where otherwise qualified, include, but are \n     not limited to, concessioners which provide guided river \n     running, hunting, fishing, horseback, camping, and \n     mountaineering experiences. An outfitting and guide \n     concessioner is entitled to a preferential right of renewal \n     under this title only if--\n       (A) the contract the outfitting and guide concessioner \n     holds does not grant the concessioner any interest, \n     including, but not limited to, any leasehold surrender \n     interest or possessory interest, in capital improvements on \n     lands owned by the United States within a unit of the \n     National Park System: Provided, That this limitation shall \n     not apply to capital improvements constructed by a \n     concessioner pursuant to the terms of a concession contract \n     prior to the effective date of this title; and\n       (B) the Secretary determines that the concessioner has \n     operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract \n     (including any extension thereof); and\n       (C) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal \n     for a proposed new contract which satisfies the minimum \n     requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to \n     subsection (d).\n       (2) Contracts with anticipated annual gross receipts under \n     $500,000.--A concessioner which holds a concession contract \n     where the Secretary has estimated that its renewal will \n     result in gross annual receipts of less than $500,000 shall \n     be entitled to a preferential right of renewal under this \n     title if--\n       (A) the Secretary has determined that the concessioner has \n     operated satisfactorily during the term of the contract \n     (including any extension thereof); and\n       (B) the concessioner has submitted a responsive proposal \n     for a proposed new concession contract which satisfies the \n     minimum requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to \n     subsection (d).\n       (i) New or Additional Services.--The Secretary shall not \n     grant a preferential right to a concessioner to provide new \n     or additional services in a park.\n       (j) Secretarial Authority.--Nothing in this title shall be \n     construed as limiting the authority of the Secretary to \n     determine whether to issue a concession contract or to \n     establish its terms and conditions in furtherance of the \n     policies expressed in this title.\n       (k) Exceptions.--Notwithstanding the provisions of this \n     section, the Secretary may award, without public \n     solicitation--\n       (1) a temporary concession contract or extend an existing \n     concession contract for a term not to exceed three years in \n     order to avoid interruption of services to the public at a \n     park, except that prior to making such an award, the \n     Secretary shall take all reasonable and appropriate steps to \n     consider alternatives to avoid such interruption; and\n       (2) a concession contract in extraordinary circumstances \n     where compelling and equitable considerations require the \n     award of a concession contract to a particular party in the \n     public interest.

PROTECTION OF CONCESSIONER INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Leasehold Surrender Interest Under New Concession \n     Contracts.--\n       (1) On or after the date of enactment of this title, a \n     concessioner which constructs a capital improvement upon land \n     owned by the United States within a unit of the National Park \n     System pursuant to a concession contract, shall have a \n     leasehold surrender interest in such capital improvement \n     subject to the following terms and conditions:\n       (A) A concessioner shall have a property right in each \n     capital improvement constructed by a concessioner under a \n     concession contract, consisting solely of a right to \n     compensation for the capital improvement to the extent of the \n     value of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest in \n     the capital improvement.\n       (B) A leasehold surrender interest--\n       (i) may be pledged as security for financing of a capital \n     improvement or the acquisition of a concession contract when \n     approved by the Secretary pursuant to this title;\n       (ii) shall be transferred by the concessioner in connection \n     with any transfer of the concession contract and may be \n     relinquished or waived by the concessioner; and\n       (iii) shall not be extinguished by the expiration or other \n     termination of a concession contract and may not be taken for \n     public use except on payment of just compensation.\n       (C) The value of a leasehold surrender interest in a \n     capital improvement shall be an amount equal to the initial \n     value (construction cost of the capital improvement), \n     increased (or decreased) in the same percentage increase (or \n     decrease) as the percentage increase (or decrease) in the \n     Consumer Price Index, from the date of making the investment \n     in the capital improvement by the concessioner to the date of \n     payment of the value of the leasehold surrender interest, \n     less depreciation of the capital improvement as evidenced by \n     the condition and prospective serviceability in comparison \n     with a new unit of like kind.\n       (D) Where a concessioner, pursuant to the terms of a \n     concession contract, makes a capital improvement to an \n     existing capital improvement in which the concessioner has a \n     leasehold surrender interest, the cost of such additional \n     capital improvement shall be added to the then current value \n     of the concessioner's leasehold surrender interest.\n       (E) For purposes of this section, the term--\n       (i) ``Consumer Price Index'' means the ``Consumer Price \n     Index--All Urban Consumers'' published by the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics of the Department of Labor, unless such index is \n     not published, in which case another regularly published \n     cost-of-living index approximating the Consumer Price Index \n     shall be utilized by the Secretary; and\n       (ii) ``capital improvement'' means a structure, fixture, or \n     non-removable equipment provided by a concessioner pursuant \n     to the terms of a concession contract and located on lands of \n     the United States within a unit of the National Park System.\n       (b) Special Rule for Existing Possessory Interest.--\n       (1) A concessioner which has obtained a possessory interest \n     as defined in Public Law 89-249 under the terms of a \n     concession contract entered into prior to the date of \n     enactment of this title shall, upon the expiration or \n     termination of such contract, be entitled to receive \n     compensation for such possessory interest improvements in the \n     amount and manner as described by such concession contract.\n       (2) In the event such prior concessioner is awarded a new \n     concession contract after the effective date of this title \n     replacing an existing concession contract, the existing \n     concessioner shall, instead of directly receiving such \n     possessory interest compensation, have a leasehold surrender \n     interest in its existing possessory interest improvements \n     under the terms of the new contract and shall carry over as \n     the initial value of such leasehold surrender interest \n     (instead of construction cost) an amount equal to the value \n     of the existing possessory interest as of the termination \n     date of the previous contract. In the event of a dispute \n     between the concessioner and the Secretary as to the value of \n     such possessory interest, the matter shall be resolved \n     through binding arbitration.\n       (3) In the event that a new concessioner is awarded a \n     concession contract and is required to pay a prior \n     concessioner for possessory interest in prior improvements, \n     the new concessioner\n\n[[Page S6265]]\n\n     shall have a leasehold surrender interest in such prior \n     improvements and the initial value in such leasehold \n     surrender interest (instead of construction cost), shall be \n     an amount equal to the value of the existing possessory \n     interest as of the termination date of the previous contract.\n       (c) Transition to Successor Concessioner.--Upon expiration \n     or termination of a concession contract entered into after \n     the effective date of this title, a concessioner shall be \n     entitled under the terms of the concession contract to \n     receive from the United States or a successor concessioner \n     the value of any leasehold surrender interest in a capital \n     improvement as of the date of such expiration or termination. \n     A successor concessioner shall have a leasehold surrender \n     interest in such capital improvement under the terms of a new \n     contract and the initial value of the leasehold surrender \n     interest in such capital improvement (instead of construction \n     cost) shall be the amount of money the new concessioner is \n     required to pay the prior concessioner for its leasehold \n     surrender interest under the terms of the prior concession \n     contract.\n       (d) Title to Improvements.--Title to any capital \n     improvement constructed by a concessioner on lands owned by \n     the United States in a unit of the National Park System shall \n     be in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 406. REASONABLENESS OF RATES.\n\n       The reasonableness of a concessioner's rates and charges to \n     the public, unless otherwise provided in the contract, shall \n     be judged primarily by comparison with those rates and \n     charges for facilities and services of comparable character \n     under similar conditions, with due consideration for length \n     of season, peakloads, average percentage of occupancy, \n     accessibility, availability and costs of labor and materials, \n     type of patronage, and other factors deemed significant by \n     the Secretary. A concessioner's rates and charges to the \n     public shall be subject to approval by the Secretary pursuant \n     to the terms of the concesssion contract. The approval \n     process utilized by the Secretary shall be as prompt and \n     unburdensome to the concessioner as possible and shall rely \n     on market forces to establish reasonableness of rates and \n     charges to the maximum extent practicable.\n\n     SEC. 407. FRANCHISE FEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A concession contract shall provide for \n     payment to the government of a franchise fee or such other \n     monetary consideration as determined by the Secretary, upon \n     consideration of the probable value to the concessioner of \n     the privileges granted by the particular contract involved. \n     Such probable value is a reasonable opportunity for net \n     profit in relation to capital invested and the obligations of \n     the contract. Consideration of revenue to the United States \n     shall be subordinate to the objectives of protecting and \n     preserving park areas and of providing adequate and \n     appropriate services for visitors at reasonable rates.\n       (b) Amount of Franchise Fee.--The amount of the franchise \n     fee or other monetary consideration paid to the United States \n     for the term of the concession contract shall be specified in \n     the concession contract and may only be modified to reflect \n     substantial, unanticipated changes from the conditions \n     anticipated as of the effective date of the contract. The \n     Secretary shall include in concession contracts with a term \n     of more than five years a provision which allows \n     reconsideration of the franchise fee at the request of the \n     Secretary or the concessioner in the event of such \n     substantial, unanticipated changes. Such provision shall \n     provide for binding arbitration in the event that the \n     Secretary and the concessioner are unable to agree upon an \n     adjustment to the franchise fee in these circumstances.\n       (c) Special Account.--All franchise fees (and other \n     monetary consideration) paid to the United States pursuant to \n     a concession contract shall be covered into a special account \n     established in the Treasury of the United States. The funds \n     contained in such special account shall be available for \n     expenditure by the Secretary, subject to appropriation, until \n     expended for use in accordance with subsection (d).\n       (d) Use of Franchise Fees.--Funds contained in the special \n     account shall be transferred to a subaccount and shall be \n     allocated to each applicable unit of the National Park \n     System, based on the proportion that the amount of concession \n     contract fees collected from the unit during the fiscal year \n     bears to the total amount of concession contract fees \n     collected from all units of the National Park System during \n     the fiscal year, to fund high-priority resource management \n     and visitor services programs and operations.\n\n     SEC. 408. TRANSFER OF CONCESSION CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Approval of the Secretary.--No concession contract or \n     leasehold surrender interest may be transferred, assigned, \n     sold, or otherwise conveyed or pledged by a concessioner \n     without prior written notification to, and approval of the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Conditions.--The Secretary shall not unreasonably \n     withhold approval of such a conveyance or pledge, and shall \n     approve such conveyance or pledge if the Secretary in his \n     discretion determines that--\n       (1) the individual, corporation or entity seeking to \n     acquire a concession contract is qualified to be able to \n     satisfy the terms and conditions of the concession contract;\n       (2) such conveyance or pledge is consistent with the \n     objectives of protecting and preserving park resources and of \n     providing necessary and appropriate facilities and services \n     to visitors at reasonable rates and charges; and\n       (3) the terms of such conveyance or pledge are not likely, \n     directly or indirectly, to: reduce the concessioner's \n     opportunity for a reasonable profit over the remaining term \n     of the contract; adversely affect the quality of facilities \n     and services provided by the concessioner; or result in a \n     need for increased rates and charges to the public to \n     maintain the quality of such facilities and services.\n\n     SEC. 409. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE CONCESSIONS MANAGEMENT \n                   ADVISORY BOARD.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is hereby established a National \n     Park Service Concessions Management Advisory Board \n     (hereinafter in this title referred to as the ``Advisory \n     Board'') whose purpose shall be to advise the Secretary and \n     National Park Service on matters relating to management of \n     concessions in areas of the National Park System.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], for Mr. Murkowski \n     and Mr. Bumpers, proposes an amendment numbered 2703.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 129 line 22 strike ``without appropriation'' and \n     insert the following: ``subject to appropriation.''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \n1693, the ``Vision 2020 National Parks System Restoration Act.'' I want \nto commend Senator Thomas, the bill's author, for his efforts in \nbringing this bill to the floor. As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNational Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation, he has been \nwilling to compromise and work with all involved parties, including \nSecretary Babbitt, Senator Bennett, and me in an effort to enact a \nmeaningful and comprehensive bill for our national parks. It has been a \npleasure to work with him on this important legislation and I look \nforward its passage before I leave the Senate this year. I would also \nlike to particularly thank Senator Bennett, who has once again been \nvery helpful and constructive in developing a bill that can garner such \nbroad bipartisan support, as I believe this bill has.\n  Although this is a comprehensive bill that makes a number of positive \nchanges in the way national parks are managed, for me, the most \nsignificant provisions are found in title IV--the National Park Service \nConcessions Management Improvement Act.\n  Mr. President, for almost 19 years I have worked to reform the \nconcessions policies of the National Park Service to increase \ncompetition, provide better services, and to ensure a better return for \nthe American public. Over the past two decades, we have held dozens of \nhearings, and we've debated this issue in mark-ups and on the Senate \nfloor.\n  As you know, during the 103rd Congress Senator Bennett and I \nsponsored a bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 90-9, and passed \nin the House of Representatives with only minor changes by a vote of \n368-30. Despite the overwhelming vote margins, we were unable to pass a \nfinal bill before the Congress adjourned. Given the magnitude of those \nvotes, it is very frustrating to be here once again debating park \nconcession reform.\n  While I support passage of this bill and believe it will enhance the \nPark Service's ability to better manage our National Park System, the \nbill before us today is a real compromise between Senator Thomas and \nmyself. The bill--particularly the concession title--does not contain \nall of the policy changes that I would like to see made. However, \npassage of this bill will finally allow the Park Service to have \nmeaningful competition for park concession contracts.\n  Most importantly, the bill will repeal the 1965 Concession Policy \nAct--a 30-year old anachronism--including its most anti-competitive \nprovision, the granting to incumbent concessioners of a preferential \nright to renew their contract by simply matching the terms and \nconditions of a superior offer.\n  Other important provisions in the concession reform title include: \nmaintaining existing statutory protections for outfitter and guide \ncontracts and small contracts with less than $500,000 in annual gross \nrevenue; a prohibition against giving any concessioner a preferential \nright to provide new or additional services; and language linking the \nvalue of facilities built by a concessioner to actual construction \ncosts, adjusted for inflation, rather than the ``sound value'' \npossessory interest allowed under current law.\n  While the concession title has been of particular interest to me, the \nbill before us today includes several other titles which I believe will \ngreatly enhance the Park Service's management authorities. The bill \nincludes directives for the Park Service to improve career development \nand training for its employees and to establish a strong scientific \nresearch program in national parks. It codifies criteria for the Park \nService to use in evaluating areas proposed for addition to the \nNational Park System. It gives the Park Service much needed authority \nto collect and retain fees for commercial filming activities in \nnational park units, and it extends the Recreational Fee Demonstration \nProgram for park fees for another six years. The bill also will allow \nthe Park Service to develop and market annual park admission passports \nto increase public awareness about parks and to raise new revenues. \nThere are a few other titles included in the bill, but those are the \nmost significant provisions.\n  Mr. President, the concession reform provisions in this bill are a \ngreat step forward for the National Park Service and the taxpayers. I \nstrongly support these and the other provisions in this legislation, \nand I hope my colleagues will join me in helping to pass this bill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe considered read and agreed to, the committee substitute be agreed \nto, the bill be considered read the third time and passed, the \namendment to the title be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements relating to the bill appear at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2703) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1693), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed.\n  (The text of the bill (S. 1693), as amended, will be printed in a \nfuture edition of the Record.)\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n  ``A bill to provide for improved management and increased \naccountability for certain National Park Service programs, and for \nother purposes.''\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate has just passed \nlandmark legislation which will serve to restore, reinvigorate and \nrebuild our National Park System. S. 1693 addresses a wide variety of \nPark Service operations from failing infrastructure to improve \nmanagement and accountability for park programs.\n  The Administration reports that it will take over $8 billion to bring \nour park facilities, historic structures, roads and trails up to an \nacceptable standard. Over the years while we have expanded the National \nPark System with new units and new responsibilities we have deferred \nmaintenance and reduced funding in many important park programs. As a \nresult we now have\n\n[[Page S6269]]\n\nwhat can be best described as a National Park System that is worn-out \nand broken--a System in need of attention. Quite frankly, Congress does \nnot have the available monies to address or devote to the problems \ncurrently encountered by park managers, however meritorious they may \nbe.\n  During this Congress, Senator Thomas, Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNational Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation, has take a pro-\nactive approach to National Park Service reform. While conducting over \nfifteen over-sight and legislative hearings on the problems confronting \nthe National Park System. He found that despite reports of $300,000 \nouthouses, the National Park Service and Congress have failed to deal \nwith the lack of personnel and fiscal resources desperately needed in \nour parks. Unfortunately, the needs are not limited to a certain number \nof parks or areas of the United States. The units of the National Park \nSystem require a major face-lift from coast to coast, in my State of \nAlaska, and parks on the islands of Hawaii and in American Samoa.\n  While the lack of fiscal resources can be addressed. Throwing money \nto any government agency without accountability is in no one's \ninterest. In this regard the legislation requires the Secretary to \ndevelop a comphensive training program for employees in all \nprofessional careers, for the purpose of assuring that the work force \nhas available the best, up-to-date knowledge, skills and abilities with \nwhich to manage, interpret and protect the resources of the National \nPark system.\n  The Secretary is also directed to implement a clear plan for \nmanagement training and development to enable only those qualified to \nmove into positions of park superintendents and regional managers.\n  The legislation also addresses park budgets and accountability. Today \nindividual park budgets, if you can find one, are a haze of smoke and \nmirrors. When this legislation is enacted into law each unit of the \nSystem will prepare a budget and make it available to the public.\n  Mr. President, let me repeat, ``make available to the public'' a five \nyear strategic plan and an annual performance plan pursuant to a \npublished park budget on an individual park-by-park basis. There will \nbe accountability for the expenditure of all appropriated funds as well \nas monies collected from enhanced fee collection programs. There will \nno longer be management in the darkness. Light will be shed where no \nlight has shown before.\n  During the 105th Congress we found that decisions by park service \nmanagement are often not based on sound science, in fact, in many parks \nthroughout the country the Service knows very little about the natural \nresources they are supposed to protect. This legislation directs the \nSecretary to undertake a program in inventory and monitoring of \nNational Park System resources to establish baseline information and to \nprovide information on the long-term trends in the condition of \nresources under his jurisdiction. In addition, the Secretary is \ndirected to establish a comprehensive network of college and university \nbased cooperative study units in order to complete the baseline \ninformation inventory.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned earlier that one of the problems with the \nPark System is that over the last 20 years we have more than doubled \nthe number of units in the System. There has never been a formal \nprocedure to consider new areas which might be eligible for inclusion \nin the System, nor has any criteria been established by which a \npotential park area would be evaluated. I direct your attention to \nTitle III of S. 1693 in which the legislation establishes procedures \nand criteria for Congress and the National Park Service to consider \nwhen studying potential new areas that may be added to the System.\n  Mr. President, Title IV of this legislation deals with concession \nreform. After eight years of debate this very contentious issue has \nbeen resolved. Both Senator Bumpers and Senator Thomas deserve a great \ndeal of credit to have turned this issue into a bi-partisan one. \nSenator Bennett as well as Secretary Babbitt also deserve recognition \nfor their work and positive approach to working on the finer points of \nthe concessions legislation.\n  I have long been an advocate of granting an interest in property to \nthose in the private sector who invest in our park facilities such as \nhotels, lodges, and restaurants. The private sector requires this \nincentive or interest to borrow from a bank--collateral--to invest in \nneeded capital improvements. The advantage is that we can improve \nvisitor facilities with private sector dollars as opposed to taxpayer \ndollars. However meritorious, possessory interest has been a large \nsticking point in ever reaching resolution on concession reform.\n\n  As in any great bi-partisan compromise, no one got everything they \nwanted. The concession folks lost their right of preference in renewal \nbut are allowed to maintain a form of possessory interest. We were able \nto place private sector expertise into the concession management \nprogram with an advisory committee made up of individuals in the \nhospitality industry and the Secretary is directed to contract-out \ncertain concession management functions.\n  I firmly believe that this legislation will enhance concession \nprogram management, increase competition among prospective concession \noperators, improve the delivery of goods and services to park visitors, \nimprove facilities and increase revenues from concession franchise \nfees.\n  Mr. President, the legislation extends the popular Recreational Fee \nDemonstration Program from the year ending in 1999 to 2005 and extends \nthe fee collection authority to all 376 park areas. This should be a \nvaluable shot in the arm for increasing park operating funds.\n  For the first time since 1948 commercial film producers will pay a \nfee for using these unique backdrops; our parks, for major motion \npictures and advertisement in addition to allowing the parks to recover \ntheir direct costs such as security activities and permit processing. \nIn return the parks will do a better job in processing permits. As time \nis money it is much easier on the film industry to hear the word ``no'' \nearly on in the process rather than wait weeks to receive a decision.\n  Mr. President, the Park Service is directed by this legislation to \nestablish a National Passport Program based on the familiar and popular \nDuck Stamp used by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The collectable stamp \nand related competition and posters etc. should produce additional \nrevenues for major park projects. In addition to the National Passport \nProgram which will provide the user entrance into any one of the fee \nareas an international passport will be sold overseas for use by \nforeign visitors.\n  On another note we ask the National Park Foundation to share their \nexpertise with many of the park's friends groups to encourage expansion \nof the volunteer ranks as well as to develop entrepreneurial programs \nat the local level.\n  We have looked at the National Park System and found that many of our \nparks are adjacent to state and county parks. There is no reason why \nthe NPS cannot share their personnel and resources with these local \nagencies and vice-versa. In other words you don't need two snowploughs \nwhen one could be shared. This legislation changes the law and provides \nthe Park Service with the authorization to enter into agreements with \nother local agencies.\n  Our own United States Park Police are often the forgotten step-child \nof the National Park Service. Their particular needs and requirements \nare unknown even though we have asked for reports from the \nAdministration on a number of occasions. Within a year we have that \nreport so that Congress can act in an appropriate manner while \naddressing the critical needs of the Park Police.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Members of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources who came together in a bi-partisan fashion and \nreported the bill to the full Senate 20 to 0. The Senate can be proud, \nfor this legislation represents a new beginning for the National Park \nSystem which will carry it into the next century, alive, vibrant and \nserving the hundreds and millions of park visitors yet to come.\n  Perhaps, most important, our natural, cultural and historic resources \nfor which these parks have been set aside will be better protected and \nmanaged for future generations.\n\n[[Page S6270]]\n\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues for their support on \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate for approving \nS. 1693, the ``Vision 2020 National Parks Restoration Act.'' This is \nthe culmination of over two years of work and reflects a lifetime of \nconcern I have had about protecting our nation's parks. America's park \nsystem needs attention and it needs our help soon. I believe this bill \nwill provide it.\n  When we began this effort more then a year ago I came to the floor \nand challenged Senators to imagine for a moment an America without \nnational parks. How would we feel without Yosemite, Independence Hall, \nor Grand Canyon protected for public enjoyment? How much of our \nnational identity reflected in these icons--the Statue of Liberty, \nYellowstone, or the National Capital Mall--would be lost? How much \nwould be missing without the rugged, adventurous American spirit \nembodied in Glacier Park or Denali? That was the challenge. The U.S. \nSenate has risen to answer that challenge by passing this bill today.\n  I'm profoundly proud of what we have accomplished. This effort has \nbeen on behalf of the millions of park visitor that flock to the wide \nopen spaces or the rich historic sites. It's for taxpayers who expect \nthe very best return for their money. And it's for the future \ngenerations of people, for whom we've worked hard, to preserve the very \nbest of our public land heritage.\n  I want to express my deep appreciate to the chairman of the Senate \nEnergy Committee, Chairman Murkowski, as well as Senator Bumpers and \nSenator Bennett, who have labored long in this area of parks support, \nand I thank them for all of their hard work in this legislation. The \ncompromise we developed in order to pass this measure is in the finest \ntradition of the Senate. The negotiations were tough, and nobody got \neverything they wanted in the bill. However, we have put together a \ngood piece of legislation that will make a positive and proactive \nchange to help our national parks.\n  I also want to recognize the hard work of the staff, particularly Dan \nNaatz of my staff, and Jim O'Toole of the committee staff.\n  Over the last two years, we have spoken to dozens of groups \ninterested in preserving our parks. We have traveled across the country \nand listened to the concerns of folks ranging from the motion picture \nindustry to natural resource experts. We have heard the suggestions as \nwell as the criticisms of our colleagues and worked to evaluate areas \nwhere we could make positive improvements for our parks. Throughout all \nof these meetings and hearings, one message came through loud and \nclear--the value of national parks is one of the cultural constants for \nAmericans.\n  The Vision 2020 bill provides a systematic approach to addressing the \nneeds of the National Park Service. The restoration bill takes a broad \napproach, with eight titles covering the compromise bill.\n  Mr. President, the Senate can be proud of passing this landmark piece \nof legislation. As Americans, one of the finest legacies that we can \nleave our children and grandchildren is the National Park System that \nis healthy, vibrant and alive. We have an obligation to strengthen our \noutstanding system of parks, the system that over 100 other nations \nhave modeled after ours.\n  Finally, I want to recognize the important contribution of the \nSecretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, in developing this compromise \nbill. As folks know, the Secretary and I don't agree on all issues. \nHowever, to his credit, the Secretary recognized the important work we \nare doing and dedicated time and manpower of his agency to help. I \nthank the Secretary for his help.\n  Today is a good day for our parks. It's a good day for the U.S. \nSenate. Our commitment is to leave our children and grandchildren these \nwild and historic places healthy and whole. Today we are one big step \nforward toward achieving that worthwhile aspiration. I once again want \nto thank the Senate for passing S. 1693 and urge the House of \nRepresentatives to take up this bill as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/11/senate-section/article/S6261-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES AND KOREA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

As the \nreport explains, the Treaty will not require implementing legislation.\n  This Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between \nthe law enforcement communities of both countries. It will thereby make \na significant contribution to international law enforcement efforts. \nThis Treaty will supersede and significantly improve upon the Treaty \nbetween the Government of the United States and the Government of \nAustria for the extradition of fugitives from justice, signed at Vienna \non January 31, 1930, and the Supplementary Extradition Convention \nsigned at Vienna on May 19, 1934.\n  The provisions in this Treaty follow generally the form and content \nof extradition treaties recently concluded by the United States.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Treaty and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

The provisions of the Convention are fully explained in the \nreport of the Department of State that accompanies this message.\n  The Convention sets out norms and procedures to safeguard children \ninvolved in intercountry adoptions and to protect the interests of \ntheir birth and adoptive parents. These safeguards are designed to \ndiscourage trafficking in children and to ensure that intercountry \nadoptions are made in the best interest of the children involved. \nCooperation between Contracting States will be facilitated by the \nestablishment in each Contracting State of a central authority with \nprogrammatic and case-specific functions. The Convention also provides \nfor the recognition of adoptions that fall within its scope in all \nother Contracting States.\n  The Convention leaves the details of its implementation up to each \nContracting State. Implementing legislation prepared by the \nAdministration will soon be transmitted for introduction in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives. Once implementing legislation is \nenacted, some further time would be required to put the necessary \nregulations and institutional mechanisms in place. We would expect to \ndeposit the U.S. instrument of ratification and bring the Convention \ninto force for the United States as soon as we are able to carry out \nall of the obligations of the Convention.\n  It is estimated that U.S. citizens annually adopt as many children \nfrom abroad as all other countries combined (13,621 children in Fiscal \nYear 1997). The Convention is intended to ensure that intercountry \nadoptions take place in the best interests of the children and parents \ninvolved, and to establish a system of cooperation among Contracting \nStates to prevent abduction of, and trafficking in children. We have \nworked closely with U.S. adoption interests and the legal community in \nnegotiating the provisions of the Convention and in preparing the \nnecessary implementing legislation.\n  I recommend that the Senate give its advice and consent to \nratification of this Convention, subject to the declaration described \nin the accompanying report of the Department of State.\n                                                  William J.
