Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit this morning \nabout the balanced budget amendment and really how important it is to \nour children, our grandchildren, and really to the future of this \ncountry.\n  As a nation, we find ourselves at a very critical juncture. The \nchoices we face today are stark: It is either stagnation or growth, \npoverty or prosperity, hope or hopelessness for our Nation's children. \nThroughout the history of this world, great nations have risen and \ngreat nations have fallen. Many have perished simply as a result of one \nfatal fiscal miscalculation at a critical time--a time at which we find \nourselves today.\n  We must move forward because we have a moral obligation to pave a \ntrail and to light the way. Yet, a single misstep as we enter into the \n21st century could cast our children off the path and into darkness.\n  Now, despite the improvement of our short-term fiscal outlook in the \npast decade, we face great danger from the fiscal imbalances ahead that \nswing over us like a sword dangling from a thread. Without a balanced \nbudget amendment to address these risks, I am afraid that the national \ndebt will destroy this Nation.\n  The debt today stands at over $5.3 trillion, and the cumulative \ndamage of the national debt to the economy over the past 40 years has \nbeen enormous. Our Nation has fallen from its perch as the world's \ngreatest creditor to become the world's greatest debtor Nation in \nhistory.\n  A child born today enters the world already $20,000 in debt and faces \nan additional $1,300 every year just to pay the interest on that debt.\n  By the year 2007, the national debt will rise to $8.5 trillion, and \nchildren born then will inherit a share of nearly $30,000. That is \n$30,000, whether poor, middle-class, or well off. Every child in every \nhousehold in this land is affected.\n  Now, as historian John Steele Gordon writes in his new book, \n``Hamilton's Blessing: The Extraordinary Life and Times of Our National \nDebt,'' the size of the debt itself is not the problem--it is the fact \nthat we have run it up to such extraordinary levels without \njustification.\n  Gordon's research shows that in the first 184 years of our \nindependence, the Nation borrowed a total of $300 billion to fight the \nwars that made and preserved our Nation. But he goes on to say that, in \nthe last 36 years, we have taken on more than 17 times as much new \ndebt--at first, in an attempt to maximize economic output, but in \nrecent years, as he explains, no good reason whatsoever has been the \ncause behind this.\n  Mr. President, the imbalance between the Government's entitlement \npromises and the funds it will have available to pay for them will \nalone bankrupt this Nation.\n  Now, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform has \nwarned us that in the year 2012, projected outlays for entitlements and \ninterest on the national debt will at that time consume all tax \nrevenues collected by the Federal Government. In 2030, projected \nspending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Federal employee \nretirement programs alone will consume all of our tax revenues, leaving \nnothing to educate our kids, to keep their streets safe, to cure their \ndiseases, or to protect the environment.\n  Shortsighted politicians repeatedly refuse to make tough choices, and \nthe knowledge that we have no clear public policy to address this \nimbalance darkens our future even more.\n\n  Although the solutions to our problems are anything but simple, we \nmust not shy away from them any longer. The balanced budget amendment \nwill force Congress and the administration to work together to defuse \nthis time bomb. Without it, the deficit spending will continue, and \nthat is despite all the rhetoric from both Congress and the White House \nto the contrary.\n  Even if we indeed balance the budget through a statutory requirement, \nwe all know that this is not a guarantee that our budgets will balance \nin the future. Our national debt will take several generations to \neliminate now. We not only need the will to balance the budget, but we \nalso need the means to follow through, to keep the budget balanced, and \nto begin to return the borrowed money. We need the balanced budget \namendment. Talking about the protection of our children, without \naddressing the long-term risks that are poised to imprison them is \ncorrupt.\n  Mr. President, I have heard my colleagues many times on the other \nside of the aisle this week raise the word children as if it were a \nprotective shield. ``We can't enact the balanced budget amendment,'' \nthey say, ``the education of our children will suffer.'' ``We can't \nenact the balanced budget amendment, the nutritional health of our \nchildren is at stake.'' ``We can't enact a balanced budget amendment, \nour children's medical needs will go unserved.''\n  They have also used the phrase that we have attacked children because \nthey are the path of least resistance. Well, we know the work that we \nundertake every day in this Chamber has a profound effect on every \nAmerican child, just as it affects every taxpayer, every working \nfamily, and every senior citizen. I am certain there is not a single \nSenator in this Chamber who would deny a child a good education, deny a \nchild a hot meal, or deny a doctor's tender care.\n  Yet, through our own greed, we have denied that very same child a \nfuture free of a debt that they did not incur and which they do not \ndeserve to bear.\n  Now, I ask you this, Mr. President: Who was protecting our children \nwhile Congress amassed a debt of $5.3 trillion? Those children were not \nhere to be able to say don't do that. We took the path of least \npolitical resistance when we put our children into debt. They did not \nhave a voice on this Senate floor to stop us from doing that.\n  Who stood up for America's children while Congress signed their names \nto a mortgage that they will never be able to escape?\n  Who came to the floor of this Chamber crying out for the children \nwhen we sacrificed their financial security for another piece of pork, \nor another Federal program?\n  I will tell you this, Mr. President. The same Senators who today \nraise the shield of children as their argument against the balanced \nbudget amendment were nowhere to be found when America's children \nneeded them most.\n  Only the balanced budget amendment will protect our children from the \nsuffocating excess of a Congress free to spend dollars that it does not \nhave.\n  So, Mr. President, the legal authority of the balanced budget \namendment will ensure that we do not drown our children in a sea of \ndebt. The moral authority of a higher power demands that we do nothing \nless.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota \nfor his remarks on behalf of the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. I think he makes a very poignant statement when he \nalludes to the condition of our children in the future. I have always \nenjoyed reading Thomas Jefferson's admonitions about\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\nthe future of the democracy. I can't state it with the eloquence with \nwhich he did, but he makes the point that the Senator from Minnesota \nmakes, and I think it is worth revisiting. He essentially said that it \nis morally wrong for a contemporary generation to make decisions about \ndebt for future generations. It is morally wrong, Mr. President, for a \ncontemporary generation to use the resources of generations yet to \ncome. In essence, any time a contemporary generation is in the business \nof consuming the resources of those yet to come, they are engaged in \nabrogating the freedom of those yet to come, which is an unconscionable \nact for Americans because this is a Nation that was born in freedom and \nindependence and has invested unlimited sacrifice to preserve it.\n\n  Yet, we seem to want to overlook it when we look at these 28 budgets \nfrom Republican and Democratic Presidents, all of whom in their own way \nwere a part of abrogating freedom of somebody yet to come because they \nall used resources of people who have no voice--nothing to say. Our \nlegacy is to hand them debt. And how terribly inappropriate it is.\n  I was reviewing some financial policy recently. I think it is called \ngenerational economics. What that means is something like this. My \nmother and father kept 80 percent of their lifetime wages to do the \nthings that we have always depended on and asked for the American \nfamily to do. It has been the core ingredient in terms of taking care \nof America, and they raised myself and my sister; got us through school \ngracefully; housed us all through our medical needs and trying to \nprepare us for stewardship. My sister, who is 10 years younger than I, \nwill keep about 45 percent of her lifetime wages--her parents 80 and \nshe 45. Currently, an average family in the State of Georgia can keep, \nafter direct taxes and cost of government, about 45 percent of their \nwages. So she has half the resources. A lot of it she does not get is \nin this pile of 28 budgets. But worst of all is the fact that a child \nwho was born on January 1 of this year, 1997, will keep, under the \ncurrent scheme of things, 16 percent of their lifetime wages. In other \nwords, it will take 84 percent of their wages to fulfill these \nobligations that continue to mount. I would have to say, Mr. President, \nthat that child born on January 1 of this year could never be \nconsidered to be free by any definition in our Constitution or in the \nbasic tenets and fundamentals of American life.\n  So from the turn of the century we have gone from a family that keeps \n80 percent of the fruits of its labor to contemporarily keeping about \n45 percent, to a child today faced with having to forfeit 84 percent of \nwhat their life's earnings are to fulfill the largess of all of these \nbudgets.\n  I don't know what kind of proof we need to advise us that we need to \nchange the way we manage our financial affairs just to look at the \ngenerational impact, and then to go back and be reminded that Thomas \nJefferson said what we are doing right here is an abrogation of freedom \nand independence and that we are in the business of denying freedom for \nAmericans yet to come.\n  The 80, 40, 16 says it all to me. If you want to just talk about \nmonetary circumstances, we are headed toward doubling the deficit, \nwhich means we are piling more paper on this pile right here. Just in \nthe term of this President we are going to double the deficit. We are \ngoing to add about another $100 billion to it. Then, after that, it \nlooks like a NASA space shuttle. It just skyrockets. So the fuel and \nthe engines of using the future resources seem unchecked and \nunbalanced.\n  So if these 28 years of evidence are not enough to compel somebody to \nunderstand that we need to change the way we manage this debt, then you \ncan simply look at the current budgets before us and see that we are \ngoing to continue to add debt on debt on debt.\n  Sometimes when you talk to people in America about the scope of what \nwe have been doing, about the 80, 40, and 16 percent, about the size of \nthe current debt, which I think is $5.3 trillion looking at the big \npicture--of course, I have been talking about 7 minutes or so, but it \nis probably closer now to $5.4 trillion--it is depressing and sobering. \nAnd I always like to leave the message with more optimistic tone.\n  I point out that balancing our budgets, moving to a balanced budget \npath, passing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, does not \nrequire draconian effort. Actually, they represent modest, sound, and \nreasoned steps to take control of our financial affairs, which saves \nthe country for the future, which is laudable, and for which every \ngeneration of Americans have been charged of doing--take steps to \nguarantee that they turn the country over to the future in good hands \nrather than crippled--that by taking these reasoned steps, balanced \nbudgets, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, that it not \nonly saves the country for the future, but it creates the immediate \npositive effect on every citizen today. Every family, every business, \nand every community has an immediate positive effect. It lowers \ninterest rates. It makes more capital available for businesses to seek \nand generate more business. More businesses will be started, \nparticularly small businesses. The job lines will be shorter. It will \nbe easier to get a job. If you are graduating from high school or \ngraduating from college and you are in the job market, or there has \nbeen a change, it is going to be a lot easier.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, a balanced budget amendment would \nproduce around $2,000 new disposable income, putting it into the \nchecking account of every Georgia family, and, Mr. President, every \nKansas family. I suppose the average family in our two States is pretty \nsimilar. They make about $40,000 a year. Probably both parents are \nworking. And as I said, by the time the Government marches through \ntheir checking account, they have less than half of that left. That \ngets them down to around $20,000, $23,000 to do everything we ask them \nto do.\n\n  Now, think about it. What is the effect of putting $2,000 back into \nthat checking account? That is the equivalent of a 10-percent pay \nraise. And we all know the kind of stagnation that has occurred, \nbecause of this kind of activity, in those checking accounts over the \nlast several years.\n  Think of the opportunity that this creates for school and education \nand health care, which we have been talking so much about, for \nchildren, to have $2,000 of new resources for every average family \nacross the country. Look at it as if you are a mayor or county \ncommissioner. We would likely save about $333 million in lower debt \nservice in the State of Georgia or $103 million for the capital city of \nAtlanta, GA. Every school district, every county, every municipality, \nevery State will immediately begin to benefit from our taking these \nkinds of steps to rein in and manage our budget.\n  We had a host of people down here suggesting you just do not need a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution; you just need the will. \nI do not know how many years we have to discuss our lack of will to \nunderstand that we need to change the rules. We passed the line-item \nveto for the first time, and that is a new tool. That is on the right \ntrack. A lot of people were concerned: Would a Republican Congress give \nthe Democrat President the line-item veto? They did. They did because \nthey believed we do need new disciplinary tools to manage our financial \naffairs.\n  I have to say that I have concluded--and I think, on balance, this is \ncorrect--if you are against a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution, you are really not for balanced budgets. The President \nhas told us we should have balanced budgets, and he ought to be \nsupporting us in this effort. I have to say, Mr. President, that if \nthis fails--I hope it does not; it is going to be close, but if it \nfails, the President will bear the responsibility for it because he has \ndecided to fight this. The power of the President is enormous. But if \nyou are for balanced budgets, then you are for a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I do not think you know any individual, and I doubt \nthat you know any family, nor any business, that has been successful in \nachieving that which it needs to do, its mission in life, that has \nabused his or her, their, its financial health. You just do not know \nanybody like that or you will not know them very long. So it is with \nnations.\n  I was speaking yesterday to a group of foreign ambassadors and \ndignitaries who are visiting the United States on\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\nan educational program to try to understand our Congress, our \nGovernment, and our Nation. I told them that if you really want to \nunderstand the nature of the decisions and the environment in the \nUnited States, you have to understand her domestic financial crisis. \nYou have to understand what the Senator from Minnesota said. He talked \nabout the fact that the bipartisan entitlement commission has shown us \nthat within a very short period of time, just a handful of Federal \nprograms consume 100 percent of our Treasury.\n  I was simply telling these foreign visitors that to have an \nappreciation for what is happening in the debate over the resources we \ndevote to our national defense and to world order, to the debate over \nwhat we can make available to foreign assistance, it is being driven by \nthis pile of 28 different budgets that are out of balance and that this \ngeneration of Americans, you and I, Mr. President, and all of our \ncitizens, are going to be charged with dealing with this dilemma. We \nhave known about this problem all these years, but it was always going \nto be somebody else to work it out. There is no generation for us to \ngive the baton to. We are the last watch. It is you and I. We are going \nto make the decision, whether it is indecision or decision, on our \nwatch that will determine what kind of country we give to the next \ngeneration.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note the Senator from West Virginia is \ngoing to be recognized at 11. I wonder if the Senator from Georgia is \ngoing to take the full time until 11 o'clock.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Does the Senator from Vermont need a moment or two? I \nwould be glad to yield the remainder of my time--\n  Mr. LEAHY. I need about 2 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. To the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am sorry; I did not see the presence of the Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I would advise the Senator from Georgia, I have about 3 \nminutes of remarks.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Let me ask this, I say to the Senator from West \nVirginia. The Senator from Kentucky used about 2 minutes of the time \nunder our control, and I wonder if I might ask unanimous consent that \nour time last until 11:02, and I would grant 2 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the closing 2 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1252-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BALANCE THE BUDGET FOR AMERICA'S FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. KYL.

It is 53 cents of every dollar just to pay \ninterest on the bills that Congress and the President have racked up in \nyears past.\n  That 53 cents of every dollar does not even begin to pay down the \nnational debt, which is increasing at a rate of $4,500 per second--a \ndebt that threatens our children's very future. It now totals more than \n$5.3 trillion, or about $20,000 for every man, woman, and child in the \ncountry.\n  Some people say that a balanced budget would mean drastic cuts in \nimportant programs. But it is really the deficit--the debt--that is \nsavaging our ability to respond to the Nation's needs. How much more \ncould we do for the American people if we did not have to set aside 53 \ncents of every income-tax dollar just to pay interest? How much more \ncould people do for themselves if their tax bills were cut in half and \nthey had that 53 cents to spend on their own needs?\n  It is really a balanced budget--not more deficits--that offers the \ngreatest protection for the important programs our Government provides. \nA balanced budget will ensure that we have the money, for example, to \ntake care of our obligations to seniors and those in need, to make \nstreets safe for law-abiding citizens, and to make our country secure. \nIt is, after all, those programs--those programs that are priorities \nfor the American people--that will be funded first under a balanced \nbudget.\n  Of course, setting priorities would be something new for the Federal \nGovernment. We are used to operating with a national checkbook that has \nhad an unlimited balance. That has allowed Congress to spend as much as \nit wants for whatever it wants. And when you have an unlimited balance \nto draw from, every program is as important as the next.\n  But as any family knows, when you have to live within your means, you \ncannot have everything. The basics come first. In the context of a \nbalanced Federal budget, that means things like Social Security, \nMedicare, and national security move to the front of the line.\n  That is what it means to prioritize. It is just plain common sense.\n  Most economists predict that a balanced budget would facilitate a \nreduction in long-term interest rates of between one and two percent. \nThat means that more Americans will have the chance to live the \nAmerican dream--to own their own homes. A 2-percent reduction on a \ntypical 30-year mortgage in Arizona would save homeowners over $220 a \nmonth. That is $2,655 a year.\n  A 2-percent reduction in interest rates on a typical $15,000 car loan \nwould save buyers $676. The savings would also accrue on student loans, \nand credit cards, and loans to businesses that want to expand and \ncreate new jobs. Reducing interest rates is probably one of the most \nimportant things we can do to help people across this country. It is \nmoney in the pocket of every American.\n  Mr. President, we need to balance the budget. The American people \nwant us to balance the budget. But the only way to ensure that we \nreally get there is to pass the balanced budget amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the end of \nmy comments, an article in the Wall Street Journal of January 31, 1997, \nentitled ``Black Leaders Try to Deny Thomas' Status as Role Model,'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there have been a number of articles in \nvarious papers over the last couple of years about groups that tried to \nblock Justice Clarence Thomas from speaking at various schools. I abhor \nthis kind of activity.\n  Justice Thomas was nominated by the President of the United States, \nwent through his hearing, we had a vote on it up or down, and he was \nconfirmed. That is the major trial that he should have to go through. \nHe has the same rights, first amendment rights, as every one of us to \nspeak. I am proud of the fact I come from a family that made the first \namendment a hallmark, in bringing up the three Leahy children. I have \nbeen in this body for 22 years, defending the first amendment from \nattacks from any side, and I am proud of the achievements that has \nbrought about. But I would say that those who try to block anyone from \nspeaking disregard the first amendment.\n  McCarthyism of the left is as bad as McCarthyism of the right. If \nsome disagree with what Justice Thomas says, then let them seek their \nown forum to express that disagreement. Do not block the statements \nfrom being made in the first place. That is wrong. We, in this country, \nought to understand that those who try to block speech, from the right \nor from the left, do a disservice to our Constitution, do a disservice \nto our country, and, most important,\n\n[[Page S1255]]\n\nthey do a disservice to the diversity that makes up the greatest \ndemocracy in history.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal Jan. 31, 1997]\n\n         Black Leaders Try to Deny Thomas Status as Role Model\n\n                         (By Edward Felsenthal)\n\n       WASHINGTON.--When Benjamin Carson, a prominent African-\n     American surgeon, was helping organizers find an inspiring \n     speaker to close a weeklong ``Festival for Youth'' in \n     Delaware this month, he pushed for Supreme Court Justice \n     Clarence Thomas.\n       It wasn't only Justice Thomas's exalted title and status as \n     one of the country's highest-ranking public servants that \n     attracted Dr. Carson. It also was his remarkable rise from \n     poverty. The two men were acquainted through their membership \n     in the Horatio Alger Society, a group whose members have \n     overcome significant odds to achieve success.\n       But when the Baltimore surgeon issued the invitation, he \n     never dreamed that he would set off a political firestorm. \n     After an organized protest from a regional chapter of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \n     which threatened to picket the talk, Justice Thomas backed \n     out.\n       Normally, ethnic organizations are only too eager to have \n     top elected or appointed officials visit and speak to \n     community groups, especially young people. But the Delaware \n     protest was the latest incident in an unusual drive against a \n     public official by some black leaders to deny the \n     conservative, 48-year-old justice a position as a role model \n     within the African-American community.\n\n\n                       unflattering cover stories\n\n       Last year, after a school-board member and local parents \n     threatened to protest, a Maryland school temporarily \n     retracted an invitation for Justice Thomas to speak at an \n     awards ceremony for eighth graders. Emerge, an influential \n     magazine among the black intelligentsia, has run two \n     unflatering cover stories on the justice, one portraying him \n     wearing an Aunt Jemima-style kerchief, the other portraying \n     him as a lawn jockey. His judicial decisions also have \n     attracted unusual personal attacks, including a stinging open \n     letter from former U.S. Judge Leon Higginbotham.\n       Justice Thomas, whose bitter 1991 confirmation hearings \n     became a national spectacle because of Anita Hill's \n     allegations of sexual harassment, is certainly no stranger to \n     controversy. But the recent protests are extraordinary \n     because they have little or nothing to do with the highly \n     charged issues raised during his difficult confirmation. \n     Instead, they have to do almost entirely with Justice \n     Thomas's conservative views and decisions criticizing \n     policies such as affirmative action.\n       While feminist groups took the lead in fighting against his \n     Supreme Court nomination, this time the criticisms of Justice \n     Thomas are being leveled almost entirely by other blacks. \n     Various civil-rights leaders claim--sometimes in terms that \n     are astonishingly abusive even by Washington standards--that \n     Justice Thomas has betrayed his race by opposing the \n     affirmative-action policies that his critics say helped get \n     him where he is, and by voting with the court's conservatives \n     on other civil-rights issues.\n       ``If white folks want to have Justice Thomas serve as a \n     role model for their kids, that's their business,'' says \n     Hanley Norment, president of the NAACP's Maryland branch. Mr. \n     Norment, who helped plan the protest against Justice Thomas \n     at the Delaware festival, dismisses him as a ``colored lawn \n     jockey for conservative white interests.''\n\n\n                           dissenting voices\n\n       A number of black leaders, including national NAACP \n     President Kweisi Mfume, have raised concerns about the \n     campaign against Justice Thomas, and some say African-\n     Americans should take pride in his accomplishments. ``This is \n     an embarrassment,'' says Michael Meyers, executive director \n     of the New York Civil Rights Coalition. Justice Thomas \n     ``doesn't hold my views on affirmative action. He doesn't \n     hold my views on race. But he is on the United States Supreme \n     Court, and he's entitled to . . . respect.''\n       That sentiment is echoed even in some seemingly unlikely \n     places. ``Of course, he's a role model,'' says Charles \n     Ogletree, the Harvard Law School professor who was Anita \n     Hill's lawyer during the confirmation hearings. His success \n     proves ``that you can come up from poverty and have a huge \n     impact in our society.''\n       Justice Thomas's career has engendered conflicted feelings \n     in black America from the moment he hit the national scene as \n     chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in \n     the Reagan administration. Although mainstream black groups \n     such as the NAACP were worried that he was hostile to many \n     civil-rights laws, they opted not to fight his 1989 selection \n     to the federal appeals court in Washington. And although many \n     of those same groups later decided to oppose his elevation to \n     the Supreme Court, some believed that his humble origins \n     might ultimately make him more sympathetic to their civil-\n     rights agenda.\n       That hasn't happened. He has joined the court's \n     conservative wing in ruling that it's unconstitutional to \n     draw up voting districts primarily on the basis of race. He \n     concurred in a 1995 ruling that put strict limits on federal \n     affirmative action, saying such programs ``stamp minorities \n     with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop \n     dependencies.'' He also concurred that year in a decision \n     that curbed school desegregation, expressing astonishment \n     that ``courts are so willing to assume that anything that is \n     predominantly black must be inferior.''\n       Other justices participated in these decisions, too, of \n     course. But Justice Thomas's African-American critics seem to \n     view his role as uniquely unforgivable, and that sentiment in \n     turn has provoked the concern about his influence on black \n     youth.\n\n\n                         it doesn't affect him\n\n       Justice Thomas won't comment on the Delaware incident, but \n     friends insist he isn't ruffled. ``He's been around long \n     enough dealing with the so-called civil-rights community \n     [that] it doesn't affect him,'' says Stephen Smith, a \n     Washington lawyer and former law clerk for Justice Thomas.\n       After the area NAACP leaders threatened their protest, \n     Justice Thomas wrote festival organizers to say that, while \n     he doesn't object to ``peaceful demonstrations,'' he didn't \n     want to distract from the event's focus on children. Finally, \n     says a gleeful Mr. Morment, the Maryland NAACP official, \n     ``the guy made some decision that we agree with.''\n       Other black leaders say they too would object if the \n     justice were invited to speak to kids in their area. It is a \n     way of ``getting his attention'' to communicate that ``we're \n     disappointed with the actions that you've taken, and so \n     therefore we can't hold you up as a role model,'' says Hazel \n     Dukes, president of the New York conference of the NAACP.\n       It is in one sense ironic that Justice Thomas has provoked \n     such criticism: On a court whose members are more likely to \n     be found speaking at high-brow judicial conferences than \n     obscure local convention halls, Justice Thomas has shown a \n     special interest in talking with ordinary people, \n     particularly the young. His message is ``inspiring and \n     uplifting,'' says Norman Hatton, a vice principal at the \n     Thomas G. Pullen School in Landover, Md., where the justice \n     spoke at the awards ceremony last summer.\n       Indeed, even some NAACP leaders are adopting a more \n     conciliatory approach. In a recent speech, Mr. Mfume, the \n     national president, criticized the Maryland chapter, saying \n     protests against Justice Thomas shouldn't rise to such a \n     level that they impede his right to speak. ``We must never \n     rush to silence free speech,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter \n     how we feel about Justice Thomas.''\n       Dr. Carson, the surgeon, adds: ``Children shouldn't be \n     forced to watch ``a bunch of silly adults . . . put people \n     into corners and castigate them. . . . If anything is a bad \n     role model, that is.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Thomas].

Under the order, the Senate will now resume \nconsideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S. J. Res. 1) proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced \n     budget.\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Dodd amendment No. 4, to simplify the conditions for a \n     declaration of an imminent and serious threat to national \n     security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Byrd] is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the measure before the Senate is a proposed \namendment to the Constitution mandating a balanced budget annually. It \nis unconstitution-like. I am not saying it is unconstitutional. If it \nis riveted into the Constitution, of course it would be constitutional. \nBut I am saying it is unconstitution-like in its words, which lack the \nvision, the simplicity, and the majestic sweep of language that we find \nin the Constitution. Rather, it sounds and reads like a bookkeeping \nmanual on principles of accounting. The amendment is replete with words \nlike ``outlays,'' ``fiscal year,'' ``receipts,'' ``estimates of outlays \nand receipts,'' ``receipts except those derived from borrowing,'' \n``repayment of debt principal,''--words which\n\n[[Page S1256]]\n\nare out of keeping with the graceful language used by the Framers in \nwriting the original Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The amendment \nis made up of 8 sections constituting a total of circa 310 words, more \nthan were used by the Framers in stating the Preamble to the \nConstitution and in establishing a Congress composed of two Houses, \nestablishing a House of Representatives, establishing a Senate, \nestablishing the Presidency, establishing the Supreme Court, and \nincluding the article setting forth the mode by which the Constitution \nwould be considered ratified and in effect. Moreover, it is a \nmasterpiece of confusing details, deceptive illusions, and doublespeak.\n  It is misleading. I am talking about this amendment now that we have \nbefore the Senate. It is misleading, contradictory in its terms, and is \nultimately bound to disappoint the American people and undermine their \nfaith in the credibility of the Nation's basic document of law and \ngovernment.\n  We all agree--all 100 of us--that continued massive deficits are bad \nfor the country, and we are all in agreement that action must be taken \nby the legislative branch, working in cooperation with the executive \nbranch, to bring our budgets under control and into balance at some \npoint, yea, even to provide for surpluses so that the country can begin \nto retire the principal and reduce the interest on the national debt, \nwhich, in only the last 16 years, has assumed colossal proportions \nbeyond anything that was even imagined during the previous 192 years \nand 39 administrations in the history of the Republic. I am saying \nduring the 192 years previous to the first Reagan administration. I \nneed not remind my colleagues and those who are listening to the \ndebate--although I shall--that until the beginning of the first \nadministration of Ronald Reagan, total debt of the U.S. Government was \na little under $1 trillion, while, beginning with the first \nadministration of President Reagan and continuing up to this time, over \n$4 trillion has been added to that debt. In other words, four-fifths of \nthe total debt held by the public have been added in the last 16 years, \nfour-fifths--four times the amount of debt that was accumulated during \nthe first 192 years in the life of this Republic, during the first 39 \nadministrations in the life of this Republic, up until the first \nadministration of President Reagan.\n  Does anyone challenge that? Does anyone wish to stand on this floor \nand say, ``That ain't so''?\n  It is no wonder, then, that the American people have lost faith in \ntheir Government, and if this proposed constitutional amendment is \napproved by both Houses of Congress and ratified by the necessary \nthree-fourths of the State legislatures, the people of this country \nwill have no cause for reassurance that our fiscal and deficit problems \nwill ever be resolved. I fear that the situation will not have been \nmade better but, rather, will have been made worse.\n  I have not been able to listen to all of the speeches that have been \nmade by all of the proponents of the amendment.\n  I have tried to listen to as many as I could. I have not been able to \nhear them all. But of those that I have heard, there has not been one--\nnot one--that has addressed itself to the details of this amendment.\n  We have heard many times that the devil is in the details. I have not \nheard a single proponent--not one--explain the amendment section by \nsection or stated how and why the adoption of this amendment will, \nindeed, bring down the deficit and lead to a balanced budget. I would \nlike for them to explain each section and explain how that section is \ngoing to bring the deficits down.\n  All of the speeches that I have heard merely talk about the need for \ngetting the deficit under control. I am for that. But none has \nexplained how this particular proposed constitutional amendment is \ngoing to do the job. All I have heard have been ``the sky is falling'' \nspeeches--oh, the sky is falling--which have simply stated the need for \ngetting our house in order, to which we all can agree and stipulate.\n  So they say deficits are bad; our national debt is too large; we need \nto get the deficits under control. Nobody disagrees with that. That is \nall the speeches I have heard. As I say, I have not heard them all. But \nall of the speeches by the proponents I have heard have amounted to \nthat: Deficits are bad; we have to do something about them.\n  And what do they propose to do? Adopt this amendment. They don't \nexplain how it will rectify the situation.\n  So I continue to wait to hear a single proponent--just one--who will \ncome to the floor and explain clearly as to how each section will \ncontribute to the common objective that we all seek; namely, a balanced \nbudget, and explain beyond any doubt that these sections of this \namendment, as so constructed, will do the job. You can bet on it.\n  Everyone is in agreement that consistently operating with deficits is \nundesirable, but we are told to accept on faith this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. We are told it will do the job, but we are \nnot told how it will do the job. We are not given the details as to the \nsacrifices and the pain the people must endure in order to achieve \nyearly budget balance. We are only told that continued deficits are not \ngood, which we all know to start with, but that this amendment will fix \nthe problem. We are, therefore, importuned to buy what really amounts \nto a ``pig in a poke.'' And as far as the explanation of the amendment \nthus far is concerned, we cannot even be assured that there is a pig in \nthat poke.\n  So now let us proceed to take a look section by section at the \namendment, which we are all being implored to support and which, if we \nbuy on to this amendment, the American people will, likewise, be \nbeseeched to ratify in their State legislatures throughout the country: \nDon't look at the details, don't bother, just accept on faith. Things \nare bad, deficits are bad, we have to do something about it. Ipso \nfacto, vote for this amendment. It will do the job.\n  For the benefit of the American people who do not have a copy of this \namendment and who are watching and listening to the words spoken on \nthis floor, I have had the entire amendment placed on this chart and \nwill now go through it section by section in the hopes of shedding a \nlittle light at least on what I believe to be a very anti-Democratic, \nanti-Republican, and anticonstitutional proposal. Not unconstitutional, \nbut anticonstitutional.\n  So let us start at the beginning. The Bible says, ``In the \nbeginning.'' You can't get much beyond that, ``In the beginning, God * \n* * ''\n  Well, in the beginning, let's take the very top section. Let's start \nat the top.\n  Section 1 of the constitutional amendment states:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed--\n\n  Shall not exceed--\n\n     total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of \n     the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by \n     law for a specific--\n\n  For a specific--\n\n     excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.\n\n  Mr. President, and Mr. and Mrs. America, this states that for every \ndollar that is spent in any fiscal year, there shall be $1 of income. \nThat is what it says. In other words, for every dollar that goes out in \na given year, a dollar will have to come in, unless three-fifths of the \nMembers of both Houses of Congress provide by law for a specific excess \nof outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.\n  If Congress is bound to spend more than it takes in, how can it do \nit? It can only do so by a rollcall vote and by passing a law which \nstates the specific excess by which dollars spent will exceed dollars \nreceived. It will not be enough for Congress to provide by law in a \ngiven year that outlays ``may exceed receipts.'' That is not enough. To \ncomply with the language of this section, Congress will have to state \nspecifically the excess of outlays over receipts that it is willing to \napprove.\n  Moreover, this cannot be done by a simple majority in each House of \nCongress, as is the case with most other laws that are passed by \nCongress. The stickler here is that three-fifths of the whole number of \neach House will have to approve the specific excess. Got to be exact, \nthe exact amount. ``All right, Senators, we're getting ready to vote. \nWe've got to know the exact amount by which the outlays will exceed the \nreceipts, because it has the words `specific excess'.''\n  For example, the Senate is composed of 100 Members and three-fifths \nof them will be required to loose this amendment from its chains. \nThree-fifths of\n\n[[Page S1257]]\n\nthe whole number of the Senate means that at least 60 Members of the \nSenate would have to vote in favor of permitting the specific excess of \ndollars paid out over dollars taken in. Sixty Members. Fifty-nine will \nnot be enough.\n  It will not matter if there is a snowstorm outside the doors and only \n59 Senators can get to the Senate to vote. That is a quorum--that is \nover a quorum. But that will not matter. Even if they all vote to allow \noutlays to exceed receipts by an exact and specific amount, that will \nnot be enough.\n  Now, this may appear to be a very simple matter on the surface, but \nupon closer examination it will be anything but simple.\n  Why do I say this? Because there is no way on God's green Earth that \nhuman beings can precisely predict what the total outlays will be for a \nfiscal year until that fiscal year has expired and the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment has tallied up the final figures of what the income versus \nthe spending was for the year just ended. No way--no way--that anyone, \nthat any human being or any computer contrived by any human being can \ndetermine before the fiscal year is out the exact amount by which \noutlays for any fiscal year have exceeded the receipts of that fiscal \nyear. No way. It is impossible. No way, until the fiscal year has \nexpired and the U.S. Treasury Department has tallied up the final \nfigures of what the income versus the spending was for the year just \nended. You will not know until that happens.\n  And only then, which is usually late in the month of October--perhaps \nthe third or fourth week of October--several weeks after the end of any \nfiscal year, are the facts known as to the exact amount of the outlays \nand the exact amount of the receipts, and, consequently, whether or not \nthere was a deficit, and, if so, specifically how much was the excess \nof outlays over receipts. We will not know it by the end of the fiscal \nyear.\n  So what are we going to do then? The fiscal year has ended. September \n30 is gone. We do not know what the excess was. How then can three-\nfifths of the Members of the Senate vote for a ``specific excess of \noutlays over receipts'' when the final books are not closed, the \namounts are not tallied. Nobody knows.\n  I might stand on my feet and say, ``Mr. President, how much is the \nexcess?'' Nobody can tell me. And we will not know it for perhaps 3 or \n4 weeks after September 30, after the fiscal year has ended.\n  Therefore, there is no way for Congress to provide by law for a \n``specific excess of outlays over receipts'' during the fiscal year in \nquestion. The specific amount of any excess of outlays over receipts \ncannot be known by the human mind until the U.S. Treasury has totaled \nup the figures for a fiscal year that has already ended 2 or 3 weeks \nearlier and advised Congress of the results.\n  Consequently, we are being presented in the very first section of the \namendment with a requirement that cannot be met. It cannot be met. Now, \nlet us examine more closely. Take the first portion of Section 1: \n``Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for \nthat fiscal year * * *'' That language is very clear. It cannot be \nmisconstrued or misunderstood. It means exactly what it says. It does \nnot say that total outlays ``may not exceed.'' It does not say that \n``Total outlays for any fiscal year may not exceed total receipts.'' It \ndoes not say that ``Total outlays for any fiscal year should not exceed \ntotal receipts.'' Nor does it say that ``Total outlays for any fiscal \nyear ought not exceed total receipts.'' It says, total outlays shall \nnot--shall not--shall not--exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, \nno ifs, ands or buts. The Federal budget, under this language, must be \nbalanced every fiscal year right down to the bottom dollar. There is no \nwiggle room--wiggle room--none.\n\n  Now, let us understand what this means. We are told by the proponents \nof this amendment that the Federal Government should have to balance \nits budget every year, like a family does. How many times have I heard \nthat? ``Oh, we ought to do like the average American family. We ought \nto do like a family does or do like the State governments do it. The \nFederal Government ought to do like the State governments do it. They \nbalance their budgets. The American family balances its budget. And the \nFederal Government ought to do the same.'' How many times have I heard \nthat? How many times have you heard it, Mr. President?\n  The truth is that the American family does not and the truth is the \nState and local governments of this country do not do what this \namendment requires the Federal Government to do. The fact is that the \nunified Federal budget is not the same as a family budget. The fact is \nthat the unified Federal budget is not the same as the budgets that \nState and local governments are required to balance--or that they are \nsupposed to balance. They are not the same.\n  Unlike those budgets, unlike the State budgets, the unified Federal \nbudget includes all spending that occurs in a fiscal year regardless of \nwhether that spending is for recurring operating costs of the Federal \nGovernment or whether that spending is for public investments.\n  Now, would anybody stand and challenge that? Would anybody tell me \nthat the States are operating under the same kind of unified Federal \nbudget that the Federal Government is operating under? Yet they say we \nought to do like the States. The Federal Government ought to balance \nits budget like the States balance their budgets. Just one--I would \nlike to hear a Senator challenge that statement.\n\n  Under the unified Federal budget, capital investments, such as roads, \nairports, transit systems, military procurement for weapon systems, \nmilitary aircraft, battleships, missiles, are required to be paid for \nin full as the purchases are made. This is a system of budget \naccounting that no business, no State or local government, and no \nfamily has to abide by.\n  Let us consider the family budget. I consider my family budget a \ntypical family budget. I can remember when I had to buy a bedroom \nsuite--on May 25, 1937; soon it will be 60 years. On May 25, 1937, I \nbought a bedroom set, looking forward to the day when I pay that \npreacher $2 and take my wife away. We would not be going on any \nhoneymoon. Of course, we have been on a honeymoon now for 60 years, but \nwe would not be going anywhere. There would not be any gifts, would not \nbe any flower girls, would not be any best man--except Robert Byrd. I \nbought a bedroom suite, paid for it at the company store where I was \nemployed as a meatcutter and in produce sales, $5 down, $7.50 every 2 \nweeks until it was paid off.\n  So that is the way most families have to manage. Most families that I \nknow have to borrow money to buy their homes, have to borrow money to \nbuy their farms, they have to borrow money to purchase necessary assets \nsuch as automobiles with which they get to work and get home from work, \nand they have to borrow money to provide their children with a college \neducation. I do not think that one will find very many Americans who \nwould want to have to balance their family budgets in a manner that \nwould require them to pay for the entire cost of their home in the same \nyear, the entire cost of the farm in the same year, the entire cost of \nthe automobile in the same year, or the entire cost of a college \neducation for their children. Yet that is what the U.S. Government \nwould be required to do by this section of this amendment.\n  Mr. and Mrs. America, be on your guard; you need to know that. When \nyou listen to these proponents say that the Federal Government should \nbalance its budget just like the States balance theirs--listen, \nGovernors, you know better than that. When the proponents say that the \nFederal Government should balance its budget just like the average \nAmerican families balances its budget, hold on. Pay attention. That is \nnot what it does.\n  Similarly, the proponents tell us that most States and local \ngovernments are required to have balanced budgets. What the proponents \nfail to point out is the fact that State governments are required to \nbalance only their operating budgets. Do not tell me that ``ain't'' so, \nbecause it is. The States are allowed to have separate capital budgets, \nwhich are excluded from the annual budget balancing requirement. A \nState may be required to keep its operating budget in balance each \nyear, but the budget with which it floats bonds for the construction of \nschool buildings or highways and other capital investments is not \nrequired to be balanced\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\neach year. I know. I know that is the way the West Virginia \nConstitution operates. It does not require a unified budget as this \namendment would or as the Federal Government does operate on a unified \nbudget.\n  If such capital investment budgets were required to be balanced each \nyear, as this amendment would mandate that the Federal Government do, \nthe States in many instances would not be able to build schools and \nhighways and bridges. Is that not so, Governors who may be listening? \nIs that not so, State legislators who may be listening? The capital \nbudgets of States are excluded from the annual budget-balancing \nrequirement of the State constitutions. Under this balanced budget \namendment, however, the Federal Government would be forbidden to adopt \ncapital budgeting, and this would gravely endanger our ability to \npurchase the kinds of public assets or make the kinds of public \ninvestments that are so critical to this Nation's future economy and to \nits future security.\n\n  The language of this first section of the amendment, if the amendment \nis ever adopted and ratified, will prohibit the Federal Government from \npurchasing capital assets and repaying the costs of them over time for \nthe simple reason that it says that each year, the total outlays shall \nnot exceed the total receipts; shall not exceed the total income of the \nFederal Government. Rather, the Federal Government would be required to \npay for the entire cost of all these capital investments as they are \npurchased. I believe if the American people focus on this issue alone, \nit should be enough to convince them of the unwisdom of placing such a \nstraitjacket on Federal budgeting into our Constitution.\n  But the proponents of the amendment will say, ``Hold on. Hold on, \nSenator. This language allows a waiver of the budget balancing \nrequirement.'' Sure enough, there is a portion of section 1 which \nreads, ``. . .unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House of \nCongress shall provide by law for a specific excess of outlays over \nreceipts by a rollcall vote.''\n  So the two halves of this sentence do not match up. This sentence is \nclassic doublespeak. Mr. and Mrs. America, that is exactly what we are \ndoing here, engaging in doublespeak. It is a kind of ``have it both \nways'' sentence--the kind of stuff that politicians are so proficient \nat crafting. On the one hand, we are saying that the Federal \nGovernment's spending shall not exceed its income, that it must live \nwithin its means, and that that concept is important enough to rivet \ninto the Constitution of the United States. But in the very same \nsentence, without skipping a beat, the language also says that all that \nis so unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House waive that \nrequirement.\n  So there is a requirement for a supermajority vote of three-fifths of \neach House to approve a waiver, and that constitutes minority control \nin each House, which is anathema--anathema--to the principle of \nmajority rule, anathema to the democratic--small ``d''--rule, the \nprinciple of majority rule, a cardinal principle of representative \ndemocracy. That is basic in this Republic. It means that a minority can \nblock action. The requirement of a supermajority three-fifths vote is a \nprescription for gridlock. A majority of three-fifths would be \ndifficult to get on a politically charged vote of this kind where \npartisanship would rear its ugly head. What would happen, then, when \nthe President's advisers tell him late in a fiscal year, or at the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year, that despite previous estimates to \nthe contrary--or if it is the last of October, in the next fiscal \nyear--there was a substantial deficit and that Congress has not been \nable to produce the necessary three-fifths vote in each House to waive \nthe requirement set forth in section 1 for a balanced budget.\n  The clock is ticking. The fiscal year is running out. And a deficit \nlooms large, large on the horizon. The President's advisers tell him he \nis constitutionally bound to balance the budget.\n  Now, Mr. President, those Senators didn't do it. They could not \nmuster the three-fifths vote to waive that provision in section 1.\n  The President is, therefore, told to impose the necessary cuts in \nspending for the remainder of the fiscal year in order to achieve \nbudget balance. He has no choice.\n  At this late point, during any fiscal year, what could the President \ndo? He would have no choice but to make arbitrary cuts in Federal \nspending, which could mean a reduction in payments to which many \ncitizens are entitled under the law. Among the programs for which \nmonthly checks are issued by the U.S. Treasury are Social Security \nbenefits, military and civilian retirement benefits, veterans \nbenefits--hear me, veterans--veterans benefits, payments for Medicare \nand Medicaid, and payments to contractors. To those who say that your \nSocial Security check, or--veterans, lend me your ears--your veterans \npension, or your military or civilian retirement checks are safe under \nthis constitutional amendment, I can assure you that they are not. \nMoreover, it is highly likely that the judiciary will find itself \nembroiled in yearly budget decisions.\n  I see in this committee report these words on page 23--words in the \ncommittee report that comment on section 6 of the amendment:\n\n       The provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment \n     that would result in a shift in the balance of powers among \n     the branches of Government.\n\n  How can any committee report say, with any authority that is \ndependable authority, that the provision precludes any interpretation \nof the amendment? Is that not what the committee report said? ``The \nprovision precludes any interpretation of the amendment. . .'' That is \nsaying to the courts, Mr. Justice, your court is precluded from \ninterpreting the amendment in any way that would result in a shift of \nthe balance of powers among the branches of Government. How much is \nthat piece of paper going to be worth? Yet, a committee report says it. \n``The provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment that \nwould result in a shift of the balance of powers among the branches of \nGovernment.''\n  The President impounds the moneys. He feels he has to impound them. \nHe has to stop the checks. He has to put a halt on the mailing of the \nchecks. He impounds moneys. Does that constitute a shift in the balance \nof powers between the legislative and executive branches? And, Mr. \nProponent, are you going to tell me that the courts will abide by this \ncommittee language here, that they will feel bound by this committee \nlanguage, they will be ``precluded''? That is what this language says, \nthat ``the provision precludes any interpretation of the amendment that \nwould result in a shift in the balance of powers among the branches of \nGovernment.''\n  Let me also say at this point that section 1 of the amendment is a \nhollow promise. It says the budget shall be balanced, but it does not \nsay how the budget must be balanced. It does not say how the deficits \nshall be reduced. Where are the proponents? This is what I have been \nwaiting to hear. I am opposed to this constitutional amendment. I want \nsomeone to tell me and to convince me and prove to me, by their written \nwords, that I am wrong, that I am not reading these sentences \ncorrectly, that they don't say what I have said they say. I want \nsomeone to show me that I am wrong.\n  It does not say how or where to cut Government spending. It does not \nsay how or whether revenues should be increased. There isn't a \nproponent of the amendment that I have heard stand on the floor and \nsay, ``This is how we are going to make this section work. We are going \nto have to raise taxes.'' I haven't heard a proponent stand up on this \nfloor--not one--and say the President's proposed tax cut is going to \nhave to be forgotten, or that the tax cuts proposed by the Republican \nParty--the GOP, the Grand Old Party--are going to have to be forgotten. \nNot only should we not have the tax cuts--I say we should not cut \ntaxes. Here is one Senator who, if I were a proponent of this \namendment, I would say, well, I am against cutting taxes. I believe we \nought to balance the budget. I believe we ought to wipe out these \ndeficits. But this language does not say how or where to cut Government \nspending. It does not say how or whether revenues should be increased. \nAnd all of the Republicans, in 1993, stated that the reason they did \nnot vote for that budget balancing package--which worked--most of them \nused the excuse that it increased taxes. That may be what we will have \nto do again. But the language\n\n[[Page S1259]]\n\nin this amendment doesn't say whether revenues should be increased.\n  But never mind, the proponents of the amendment have provided an \nescape hatch right in the amendment itself. Take a look at section 6.\n  Section 6 states, ``The Congress shall enforce and implement this \narticle by appropriate legislation * * *'' There is nothing new about \nthat. Congress has the power now, working with the President, to \nbalance the budget. But this amendment says, ``The Congress shall \nenforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which \nmay rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.''\n  I hope that the new Members of the Senate will pay close attention to \nthis language. I can understand that when new Members come here, they \nhaven't had any experience with the terminology or the Federal budgets, \nwith the estimates of revenues and outlays from year to year, and how \nthose estimates have been off. I can understand that. So I can forgive \nnew Members. But I hope they will listen. Section 6 states that, ``The \nCongress shall enforce and implement this article by appropriate \nlegislation, which may rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.'' \nThis is the Achilles' heel of the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  I especially would like the proponents of this amendment to come over \nhere and defy what I am saying about section 6 of this constitutional \namendment.\n  While section 1 is the core of the amendment, because it says that \nthe budget shall, not may, but shall be balanced every year, section 6 \nin the very same amendment says that we don't really have to balance \nthe budget as section 1 would require. The proponents of this amendment \nare telling us in section 6 that they are just kidding in section 1 \nwhen they say that the budget must be balanced. In section 6, they are \nsaying, ``We don't really mean it, Mr. and Mrs. America.'' In section \n1, the amendment says that ``outlays shall not exceed receipts'' in any \nfiscal year, but section 6 says only that estimates of outlays shall \nnot exceed estimates of receipts in any fiscal year.\n  So, if this amendment is adopted, the sacred document of the \nConstitution will say, in no uncertain terms, in section 1 that \nCongress shall balance the budget every year. But just read a little \nfurther, and the Constitution of the United States will say, forget \nsection 1, Congress doesn't really have to balance outgo with income, \ndoesn't have to balance outlays with receipts. All we have to do is \njust rig the estimates, so that estimated spending will not exceed \nestimated income for any given fiscal year.\n  Isn't that what this says?\n  Section 1, therefore, makes the entire balanced budget proposal as \nphony as a $3 bill. Better still, phony as a $2.50 bill; phony. If the \nescape hatch is used, we will be right back where we have been so many \ntimes in the past, balancing the budget will be smoke and mirrors, and \nanyone who can read the English language knows it. Because there it is \nas plain as the nose on your face: ``The Congress shall enforce and \nimplement this article''--meaning the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget--``by appropriate legislation, which may rely on \nestimates of outlays and receipts.'' Section 6 makes this proposed \nconstitutional amendment a fraud; a fraud. I shall have more to say \nabout section 6 at another time, but I will say this much: I say it \nmakes the amendment a fraud.\n  Let the proponents read what the committee report says about section \n6. Let me read from the committee report. Page 23 of the committee \nreport: ``The Congress shall enforce and implement * * * creates a \npositive obligation on the part of Congress to enact appropriate \nlegislation to implement and enforce the article.'' Then the committee \nlooks at the words ``which may rely on estimates of outlays and \nreceipts.''\n  The committee report goes on to say this: ``Estimates''--the word \n``estimates''--``means good faith, responsible, and reasonable \nestimates made with honest intent to implement section 1.'' The \ncommittee knows that it is providing a loophole that is large enough \nfor Atilla to drive his 700,000 horsemen through, large enough for \nTamerlane, large enough for Amtrak--because it says in the first \nsection the budget must be balanced, the budget shall be balanced; \noutlays may not exceed receipts.\n  Then it comes along in section 6 and says, ``Well, we don't really \nhave to do that; don't really have to pay any attention to that \nlanguage. What we really mean is that the estimates of outlays shall \nnot exceed the estimates of receipts. And the record will show, as I \nwill on another day, that it is impossible for the estimates--insofar \nas the record is concerned, it has been impossible for the estimates to \nbalance or to come out as stated. It is impossible for anyone to \nestimate what the revenues are going to be. It is impossible for anyone \nin this Government to estimate what the revenues will be. It says, \nwell, estimates really mean good-faith, responsible, and reasonable \nestimates.\n  What is meant by ``good faith''? How do we know when they are ``good \nfaith'' estimates? How do we know when they are ``responsible'' \nestimates? How do we know when they are ``reasonable'' estimates? How \ndo we know when those estimates are made with ``honest intent''? We \nhave seen the numbers ``cooked.'' David Stockman was the Director of \nOMB during the early years of the Reagan administration. The numbers \nwere ``cooked,'' and David Stockman said so. So they were rigged.\n  The committee goes on and says, ``This provision gives Congress an \nappropriate degree of flexibility''--you bet it does --``in fashioning \nnecessary implementing legislation. For example, Congress could use \nestimates of receipts or outlays at the beginning of the fiscal year to \ndetermine whether the balanced budget requirement of section 1 would be \nsatisfied so long as the estimates were reasonable and made in good \nfaith. In addition, Congress could decide that a deficit caused by a \ntemporary, self-directing drop in receipts or increase in outlays \nduring the fiscal years would not violate the article.''\n  This is the committee report I am reading from, and it is talking \nabout section 6 in this constitutional amendment. The language goes on \nto say in the committee report: ``Similarly, Congress could state that \nvery small or negligible deviations from a balanced budget would not \nrepresent a violation of section 1.'' How much is ``small''? How much \nis ``very small''? What would be a ``negligible deviation''?\n  We have a $1.7 trillion budget. Let us say that the deviation is $50 \nbillion. Is that ``small''? Is that ``very small''? Let us say the \nestimate only missed it by $50 billion. That is $50 for every minute \nsince Jesus Christ was born. Is that small enough? It is only 3 percent \nof the total budget, $50 billion. As a matter of fact, you can make it \n$51 billion of a $1.7 trillion deficit. It would only be off 3 percent. \nIs that ``negligible''? Is that small enough?\n  It goes on to say: ``If excess of outlays over receipts were to \noccur, Congress could require that any shortfall must be made up during \nthe following fiscal year.''\n  Now, this is the committee report explaining the amendment. And that \nis shilly-shally. That is what the committee report says. I did not say \nit. Section 6 provides the loophole, it provides the way out, the way \nto get around section 1 in the amendment, the way to get around this \nbalanced budget amendment. I will have more to say about that section \nat a later time.\n  Now let us look at section 2 of the balanced budget amendment. \nSection 2 states, ``The limit on the debt of the United States held by \nthe public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the whole \nnumber of each House shall provide by law for such an increase by a \nrollcall vote.''\n  In practical terms, what this section means is, again, if a minority \nin the Congress decides that they do not want to go along with the \npolicies of the majority, they can put this country into default on its \ndebt. If the United States ever defaulted on the payment of its debt, \nthat action would send the world financial markets into utter chaos. \nThis is the same as any family's filing for bankruptcy. Forget about \never getting another mortgage on the home or another automobile loan. \nAny lender, knowing that you have already skipped your payments and \ngone bankrupt, is going to charge you an exorbitant rate of interest on \nyour next loan, that is, if you can ever get another loan.\n  Failure to raise the debt limit or ceiling, when required, would have \nfar-reaching effects on the U.S. Treasury's\n\n[[Page S1260]]\n\nability to pay Social Security and veterans' pensions and other \nobligations, and the Nation's creditworthiness would be destroyed. \nMillions of people depend on Federal payments, including employees, \npensioners, veterans, investors, contractors, as well as State and \nlocal governments. If the debt ceiling is reached and the necessary \nsupermajority vote of both Houses is not achieved, all of these \npayments must be stopped.\n  The fact is that over the last 16 years, there have been 30 occasions \nwhen the Congress has voted to increase the debt limit. And yet, on \nonly 2 of those 30 occasions have we met the three-fifths requirement \nof this balanced budget amendment. It is not going to be easy. A \nminority will have many opportunities to play politics with this \nphraseology in this amendment. Only on 2 of those 30 occasions have we \nmet the three-fifths requirement for this balanced budget amendment. On \nthe other 28 occasions, less than three-fifths of the whole number of \nboth Houses voted by rollcall to provide the necessary increase in the \ndebt limit.\n  I have seen the occasion arise many times when this party or that \nparty, one party or the other, will play politics with this language. I \nhave seen situations in which the Democrats laid back, would not vote \nfor an increase in the debt limit. They would make the Republicans do \nit. And I have seen the occasions when the Republicans would lay back \nand not vote to raise the debt ceiling, make the Democrats do it.\n  One particular instance comes to mind. This is just an example:\n  ``On Friday, October 12, 1984, the 98th Congress adjourned after the \nSenate, in a final partisan political battle, narrowly approved an \nincrease in the national debt ceiling to $1.82 trillion. Senate \nRepublicans cleared the way for adjournment when, without the vote of a \nsingle Democrat''--I was the minority leader--``without the vote of a \nsingle Democrat they,'' meaning the Senate Republicans, ``approved an \nincrease in the national debt ceiling. `There will be no more votes \ntoday,' said Baker,'' meaning Howard Baker, ``as he smiled broadly. \n`There will be no more votes this session. There will be no more votes \nin my career.' His Senate colleagues and spectators in the galleries \ncame to their feet to give the Tennessee veteran a roaring ovation as \nhe sat in his front-row seat. Baker joined in the light laughter \nsaying, `Frankly, I first thought that applause was for me. But then I \nrealized that it was for sine die adjournment.' ''\n  ``Following the vote on the debt limit, Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan said, `For 4 years, Republicans have always made us Democrats \npass a debt limit. Then they campaigned against it. Now it's their debt \nlimit. Let them pass it.' ''\n  So those are the games that were played, and they will be played \nagain.\n  Section 3 of the amendment is as follows: ``Prior to each fiscal \nyear, the President shall transmit to the Congress a proposed budget \nfor the U.S. Government for that fiscal year, in which total outlays do \nnot exceed total receipts.''\n  So this section means then that the President of the United States \nmust send a balanced budget to the Congress before each fiscal year \neven though during a recession the President may deem it advisable to \nrecommend a fiscal deficit in order to help get the country back on its \nfeet. That will happen from time to time. The language of section 3 \nwould preclude his doing so. He is not supposed to recommend a fiscal \ndeficit. He is required by the constitutional amendment to recommend a \nbalanced budget.\n  Notwithstanding this requirement, however, a President's Office of \nManagement and Budget could ``cook the numbers,'' as was done during \nthe administration of President Reagan. Didn't David Stockman say so? \nThat is not just Robert Byrd talking. They cooked the numbers to \nreflect whatever income and spending numbers the administration wanted. \nAnd they can do it again. They will do it again--cook the numbers.\n  The President's budget could, for example, forecast that the economy \nwill grow faster than it really will grow, and therefore would take in \nmore tax revenues; or the administration could forecast that interest \nrates would be much lower than most economists predict, or that \nunemployment would drop during the upcoming budget year, thereby \ncausing the budget to be in balance. Cook the numbers.\n  In short, the President and his staff can, as we have seen in the \npast--don't say, ``It ain't so,'' because it is--come up with any \nnumber of rosy scenarios in order to make the numbers balance. \nConsequently, simply telling the President of the United States that he \nmust send a balanced budget to the Congress does not in fact get us any \ncloser to balancing the budget. The American people will again be \ntreated to ``make believe,'' ``Alice in Wonderland'' budgets while we \npoliticians just keep on playing the same old shell game in ways that \nwill fool the American public.\n  Section 4 reads:\n\n       No bill to increase revenue shall become law unless \n     approved by a majority of the whole number of each House by a \n     rollcall vote.\n\n  What the proponents of this amendment are doing is making it more \ndifficult for Congress to close tax loopholes--to get rid of what are \ncalled tax expenditures. Mr. President, that little piece of the \neconomic pie amounts to about $500 billion in lost revenues every year. \nThis is not to say that all of these tax writeoffs are bad policy. \nCertainly the mortgage interest deduction has allowed many more \nAmericans to own homes than may have otherwise been the case. So, many \nof the writeoffs are wholesome and healthful for the economy. But, at \nsame time, some of these writeoffs are simply tax loopholes which, like \nleeches, suck the blood from the economic body politic.\n  No one likes to raise taxes, but it is something that has to be done, \nand for 208 years, Congress has been able, by a simple majority vote in \nboth Houses, to increase revenues. It does have to be done, from time \nto time, no matter how much we may dislike having to vote to do it. \nYet, this section would require a kind of ``floating'' supermajority in \nboth Houses in order to increase revenue. Let me explain this term \nwhich I have invented. For over two centuries, the Constitution has \nrequired only a simple majority in each House to raise revenues. For \nexample, let us say that there are 90 Senators present and voting on a \nmeasure to raise taxes. Up to this point, a simple majority, just 46 \nSenators of the 90, could pass the bill. Under this proposed \nconstitutional amendment, with 90 Senators voting, 51--51 Senators, not \n46; 51 Senators, or five more Senators than a simple majority--would be \nnecessary.\n  Now, depending upon what day of the week, what hour of the day, of \ncourse, a supermajority of five votes would be necessary rather than a \nsimple majority of one vote. But let us say that 80 Senators are \npresent and voting. A simple majority would require 41 Senators to pass \nthe bill. With this new constitutional amendment in place, at least 51 \nSenators would be required--or 10 more votes than is presently \nrequired. Hence, a supermajority of 10 in that hypothetical case would \nbe necessary. And so on. If 70 Senators voted, ordinarily 36 Senators \ncould pass the bill. But under this constitutional amendment, 51 \nSenators would be required, or 15 additional Senators over and above a \nsimple majority; a supermajority of 15. So it is a ``floating \nsupermajority.'' This is why I refer to it as a ``floating \nsupermajority.'' It floats, or changes, depending upon the number of \nSenators present and voting, so that if the supermajority of five votes \nis necessary to pass the tax bill on a Wednesday, let us say, a \nsupermajority of 10 votes or 15 votes may be necessary if the passage \nof the bill should occur on Thursday or Friday. It could be 9 o'clock \nin the morning in one case and 4 o'clock in the afternoon in the other. \nSo it would fluctuate. It is not an exact number. It will float from \nday to day and from hour to hour, depending upon the clock and the \ncalendar.\n  Section 5 states:\n\n       The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for \n     any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect. \n     The provisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal \n     year in which the United States is engaged in military \n     conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \n     to national security and is so declared by a joint \n     resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number of each \n     House, which becomes law.\n\n  Mr. President, Congress does not always declare war anymore. Even \nwhen it does declare war, the declaration\n\n[[Page S1261]]\n\nmay not necessarily be lifted when the shooting stops. Congress \ndeclared war against Germany in 1941. Not very many Americans, and not \nall the Members of the U. S. Senate, perhaps, realize that this \ndeclaration of war existed until September 28, 1990. Consequently, if \nthis constitutional amendment to balance the budget had been a part of \nthe U.S. Constitution during that period, the Congress could have \nwaived the balanced budget requirement every year for almost a half \ncentury--because a declaration of war was ``in effect,'' technically.\n  So, here again, this section requires a ``floating'' supermajority, \nas did section 4, in order to receive the necessary approval by both \nHouses of Congress.\n  If the Nation is not engaged in a conflict that causes an imminent \nand serious military threat to national security, then a three-fifths \nmajority would be required to waive the amendment for national security \nreasons. I would like to remind my colleagues just to think back with \nme to the 1990-1991 timeframe and recall President Bush's military \nbuildup in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the actual Desert Storm \nengagement, a very expensive military buildup was necessary to provide \nthe materiel and the personnel to conduct that conflict. Under this \nconstitutional amendment, should a similar situation arise, the \nPresident would be required to achieve a three-fifths majority of both \nHouses in order to enact into law a waiver under section 1 because the \nwaiver under section 5 would not be applicable, in that we would not be \n``engaged'' in a military conflict; we are just getting ready for one. \nWe are just rolling up our sleeves. We are just preparing. We are \ngetting things all lined up, but we are not actually in a military \nconflict. But that has to be done because you cannot provide the \nmateriel, the equipment, the engines of war just overnight. \nFurthermore, under section 5, a three-fifths majority could be required \nto increase military spending to deter aggression, provide military aid \nto our allies, or to rebuild forces after a military conflict.\n  Until such a three-fifths majority is achieved, what happens to the \nNation's defenses? What happens to our national security? Will our \nallies be able to count on the United States to stand shoulder to \nshoulder with them if a necessity for such should materialize in the \nfuture?\n  Will they have any confidence that the United States will act? They \nhave to be more confident than I am confident that the three-fifths \nvote would be here in this Senate.\n  Section 7 states:\n\n       Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United \n     States Government except those derived from borrowing.\n\n  ``Total receipts shall include all receipts of the United States \nGovernment except those derived from borrowing.''\n\n       Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United \n     States Government except for those for repayment of debt \n     principal.\n\n  Under the definition of section 7, Social Security checks and \nveterans benefits, veterans pension checks, Medicare reimbursement \nchecks--they are outlays. Does anyone dispute that? Those are outlays. \nThe senior citizens of this country and the veterans of this country \nare being asked to accept on blind faith the fact that their Social \nSecurity checks or their Medicare benefits will be secure if this \nconstitutional amendment is adopted here and ratified later by the \nrequisite number of States.\n  They are being told--Social Security recipients are being told, the \nrecipients of veterans checks are being told--that even though the \nSocial Security trust fund is not specifically exempted from the \nbalance mandate, they have no need to worry, because Congress is on \nrecord as agreeing to balance the budget without touching the fund.\n  The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \ncommonly known as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, placed Social Security off \nbudget beginning in 1986. This legislation, with its protections for \nSocial Security, passed the Senate by a vote of 61 to 31 with a strong \nbipartisan majority. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 reinforced \nthese earlier protections for Social Security by placing it even more \nclearly off budget. What the American people are not being told by the \nproponents of this amendment, however, is that a mere statute--a mere \nstatute--protecting Social Security is subordinate to the Constitution \nof the United States, which is the supreme law--the supreme law--of the \nland. It will top, it will trump any statute. The supreme law. Here it \nis, the Constitution of the United States. Tops any statute.\n  Nor would the good intentions of the present Congress be binding on \nfuture Congresses. I say to the veterans and to the senior citizens of \nour country, be on your guard. If this proposal becomes a part of the \nU.S. Constitution, your checks--your checks--will be at risk of being \nreduced in the future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, section 8 says:\n\n       This article shall take effect beginning with fiscal year \n     2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning after its \n     ratification, whichever is later.\n\n  Which means simply that it can't take effect prior to fiscal year \n2002. So those of us who are up for reelection in the year 2000 could, \nif it was our desire, vote for this amendment, go on home, sit in the \nold rocking chair, and just rock away, because the hammer isn't going \nto fall on me. This thing will not go into effect until 2002, at the \nearliest.\n  What does that mean? That also means that Members of the House and \nSenate will be relieved of the pressure until 2002. So we can just go \non our merry way. It will all be taken care of, it will all become \nautomatic, this is self-enforcing, it's automatic. The sky is falling; \nthe debt is bad; the deficit is terrible; just vote for the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget; it's just that simple.\n  This section amounts to nothing more than a feel-good section. What \nthis is saying is that we can wait to actually balance the budget. We \ndo not need to do it now, Mr. President. This year of 1997 may well be \nthe most opportune time in many, many years to achieve a balanced \nFederal budget. The President has submitted a budget that is projected \nto balance by the year 2002. We have already made substantial progress \ntoward that end. The deficit has already been reduced over 60 percent \nin the last 4 years. It is time to finish the job that we started 4 \nyears ago and enact legislation that will achieve a balanced budget by \n2002, not wait until 2002 to start to balance the budget.\n  So, Mr. President, when looked at in its entirety, this proposed \nconstitutional amendment amounts to nothing more than constitutional \nflimflam, constitutional pap. If it is adopted, we would have turned \nmajority rule on its head and replaced it permanently with minority \nrule. And in the meantime, we will have perpetrated a colossal hoax--h-\no-a-x--on the American people, and our children will have been robbed \nof their birthright to live under a constitutional system of checks and \nbalances and separation of powers.\n  We have all heard the moaning and groaning, the shedding of tears \nabout our children, how they are going to bear the fiscal burden that \nhas been placed upon them. I share that feeling. I voted for the \npackage in 1993 that reduced the Federal deficit by $500 billion, \nsomething like that, $500 billion, which has resulted in four \nconsecutive years of reduced deficits.\n\n  I voted for that. No Senator on that side of the aisle can say that \nhe voted or she voted for that. They will say, ``Well, the reason I \ndidn't is because it increased taxes.'' Well, that may be part of the \npain that we will have to undergo to relieve that burden from our \nchildren's backs.\n  I do not think the President should be advocating tax cuts now. I do \nnot think that the GOP, the grand old party, should be advocating tax \ncuts at this time. Forget about the tax cuts and relieve the burden on \nour children's backs by that much.\n  I am concerned too about my grandchildren and my great grandchildren \nand their children, that they will not live under a Constitution such \nas that which was handed down to us by our forefathers.\n  But let me remind my colleagues who may be listening, let me remind \nthe American people who may be listening, this amendment does not \nrequire that the budget be balanced. It does if we only look at section \n1. But when we look at the amendment in its entirety and go down to \nsection 6, we realize full well that it does not mean that. We are only \nrequired to balance the estimates, the estimates of revenues, the \nestimates of outlays. So what this amendment does is require us to \nbalance the estimates.\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am reminded of Plato's Allegory of the Cave. In his \n``Republic,'' Plato, in a dialogue with a friend, speaks of human \nbeings living in a cave, with their legs and their necks chained so \nthat they can only look toward the rear of the cave. They are prevented \nby the chains from turning around, from turning their heads toward the \nentrance of the cave. And above and behind them is a fire blazing, \ncausing shadows to appear on the walls of the cave, the shadows \ncreating strange images that move around the walls, as the flames \nflicker and as men and objects pass between the fire and the human \nbeings who were chained. The den has an echo which causes the prisoners \nto fancy that voices are coming from those moving shadows.\n  At length, one of the human beings is liberated and compelled \nsuddenly to stand and turn his neck around and walk toward the cave's \nentrance, walk toward the light at the entrance. As he is compelled to \nmove toward the cave's opening, he suffers pains from the light of the \nSun and is unable to see the realities, unable to see the realities of \nwhich in his former state he had only seen the shadows. He even fancies \nthat the shadows which he formerly saw were truer than the real objects \nwhich are now revealed to him.\n  He is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent until he is \nforced into the presence of the bright noon day sun and he is able to \nsee the world of reality.\n  Mr. President, as I listened to my colleagues who are proponents of \nthe balanced budget amendment, I hear them year after year urging \nsupport of a constitutional amendment, and they use the same old \narguments year after year. They must be getting tired of hearing those \narguments over and over. I know I am tired. They seem never to view the \namendment with reality but always with their backs turned toward the \nlight and their faces turned toward the darkness, as it were, of the \nrear of Plato's allegorical cave. As in his Allegory, they seem to be \nimpervious to a realistic view of the amendment, but continue to insist \nthat it is really the elixir, the silver bullet, and they seem to \nresist holding it up to the light but prefer, instead, to concentrate \non its shadows, its feel-good platitudes.\n  I view the amendment as a flickering, unrealistic image on the walls \nof the cave of politics. Most of the proponents of the amendment are \nunwilling to take a look at the amendment, section by section, phrase \nby phrase, clause by clause, and word by word, preferring to live with \nthe image that has so long been projected to the overwhelming majority \nof the American people by the proponents of the amendment. It is a \nfeel-good image that will not bear the light of scrutiny, and the \nechoes that come back from the walls of the cave of politics are the \nmagic incantations that we hear over and over and over again in this \nso-called debate--``vote for the amendment''--which really is not a \ndebate at all. It has not been thus far. Maybe it will become one. If \nit were a debate, the proponents would be on the floor, even now, \nchallenging the conclusions that I have drawn and expressed and telling \nme that I have not been reading the amendment correctly--``No, the \namendment does not say that,'' they should be saying--in which I have \nproclaimed it to be a fraud.\n  Elijah smote the waters of the Jordan with his mantle and the waters \nparted, and he and Elisha crossed over the Jordan on dry land to the \nother side of the Jordan. I have seen that old river of Jordan, one of \nthe great rivers of the world. I thought it was going to be a wide, \ndeep river. Not a wide river. Not a deep river. Some places it might be \n2 feet deep, that great old river of Jordan.\n  I bet my friend here sings songs about that old river of Jordan.\n\n       On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,\n       and cast a wishful eye\n       To Canaan's fair and happy land\n       where my possessions lie.\n  So Elijah smote the waters with his mantle and the waters parted, and \nhe and Elisha crossed over on dry land to the other side of the Jordan. \nThis constitutional amendment will never be the mantle that will part \nthe waters of political partisanship and divisiveness, ``cooked \nnumbers,'' and doctored estimates so as to provide a path across the \nriver of swollen deficits to the dry land of a balanced budget on the \nopposite banks of the stream. Where are those who will challenge what I \nhave said about section 6, who will say that I am wrong about this \namendment's unworthiness of being placed in the Constitution, who will \ncite the errors of my argument and explain to this Senate the \namendment, section by section, and explain why this amendment will \nwork, how it will work, where the cuts will be made, and how the \nrevenues will be increased. All of these good things do not just happen \nonce the amendment is added to the Constitution.\n  If this amendment is the panacea that so many in this body claim it \nto be, then certainly it could stand the scrutiny of point-by-point, \nsection-by-section debate. It is flawed, as I believe, and if it is \nflawed, as I believe, we must dare to hold it to the light and expose \nit. The American people should not be sent such a far-reaching \namendment without an exhaustive discussion of the havoc that it could \ncreate.\n  This is not a campaign slogan--``pass the balanced budget \namendment.'' It is not a Madison Avenue jingle designed to sell soap. \nWhy not just put it on the bumpers of our automobiles as a bumper \nsticker--``pass the constitutional amendment.'' This is an amendment to \nthe most profound and beautifully crafted Constitution of all time. And \nwe owe the American people the best, most thorough debate on its \nprovisions of which we are capable as lawmakers and as their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Let us all come out of the cave and not fear or shrink from the \nbright rays of the Sun on the language of this amendment.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 6\n\n       (Purpose: To strike the reliance on estimates and \n     receipts.)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may offer an \namendment at this time and that it be laid aside pending the \nconsideration of other amendments that may have been introduced \nalready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I shall read the amendment:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 12 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       Section 6. The Congress shall implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, that does away with balancing by estimates.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 6.\n       On page 3, strike lines 12 through 14 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``Section 6. The Congress shall implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will be happy to consider a time limit on \nthis amendment and vote on it on a future day. I am agreeable to trying \nto work out a time limit at some point. I just offer it today so that \nit may be made part of the Record and may be printed and that we may, \nthen, with this understanding, return to it at a future day.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has done a service to this body, as he has for so many years \nin so many different issues at so many different times.\n  In part of this debate over the last 2 days, I have on more than one \noccasion urged the proponents of this constitutional amendment to step \nup to what I call the Byrd challenge. I know the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia knows that I say that most respectfully \nbecause when the distinguished Senator from West Virginia lays down a \nchallenge on a constitutional issue, every one of us, Democrats or \nRepublicans, should pay attention because what he is doing is \nchallenging the U.S. Senate to rise above politics, rise above polls of \nthe moment, but to stand up for our Constitution for the ages. Polls \ncome and go. Polls change. The Constitution stands for the ages.\n\n[[Page S1263]]\n\n  I think of the vote as the war clouds gathered in Europe before World \nWar II, the vote to extend the draft, I believe it was by one vote. \nThose who voted to extend the draft cast a very unpopular vote for the \nmost part. Where would democracy be today if they had not had the \ncourage to step beyond the polls of the moment? Look at the Marshall \nplan. I remember former President Nixon telling me that he remembers 11 \npercent of the people in this country were in favor of the Marshall \nplan, but if Harry Truman had not had the courage to push forward and \nhad not Members of this body and the other been willing to stand up, we \nwould not have had the democracy stand where it does today.\n  If this great country, the greatest democracy, the most powerful \neconomy, the most powerful Nation in history, hamstrings itself into \nsomething in the Constitution where it cannot reflect basic economic \nrealities, those of us who succumb to the passing moments of a poll may \nregret, and our children may regret, that we did not listen to the Byrd \nchallenge.\n  I repeat what I said before many times, the Byrd challenge is here. I \nask proponents of this constitutional amendment to focus on the words \nof this proposed amendment, explain what they mean, explain how this \nproposed constitutional amendment will work. Senator Byrd has explained \nthis amendment word by word, section by section, phrase by phrase, and \nwhat he has done is asked the obvious questions--what does it mean?\n  Mr. President, we are in this Chamber, the Chamber that shows respect \nfor silence, for the silence is thundering in response to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, because there has been no \nresponse to his question, what do these phrases mean, what do these \nwords mean, what do these sections mean?\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator. I hope that Senators \nwill look carefully at section 6 of the proposed constitutional \namendment and that they will also look very carefully at the words of \nthe committee report, which deals specifically with section 6. The \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont is on the Judiciary Committee. He \nwrote some differing views from those of the majority of the committee, \nand they are printed in the committee report. But inasmuch as my \namendment strikes most of section 6, I hope that Members--and I \nparticularly call to the attention of new Members of the body, section \n6 and the language in the report which provides the loopholes that will \ngive us all a way out of having to live up to this constitutional \namendment give us a way out of having to balance the budget, in the \nevent that it is adopted by both Houses and ratified by three-fourths \nof the States.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. I \nclose only with this: None of us in this body owns a seat in the U.S. \nSenate. We are privileged and honored to serve here at the time we are \nhere, and then we go on. But our Constitution does own a place in our \ncountry. It has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights. We \nshould never rush pell-mell into an amendment to this Constitution \nwithout thinking through the consequences.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I think it is important for the American \npeople to know how significant and important this debate is on the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. I served 16 years in \nthe House of Representatives and am now in my third year in the U.S. \nSenate. Some have argued that when we debate this amendment, we are \nhearing the same old argument over and over again. That is true, \nbecause we have the same problem year in and year out. That is why \nthose of us who support a constitutional amendment feel so strongly \nabout the necessity to have this amendment in the Constitution of the \nUnited States because it will ensure stability and security for the \nfuture of this country and for our children and our grandchildren.\n  Having served in this overall institution for 19 years now, we have \nheard the debate on the constitutional amendment. This is about our \neighth time in either the House or the Senate, or both, that we have \nbeen debating this issue. Guess what? Each and every time we have heard \nthe same arguments over and over again as to why we don't need a \nconstitutional amendment, that it is not necessary, that we can do it \non our own, that if only we had the will or the discipline, we could \nenact a balanced budget, that it is simply not necessary. Well, if that \nwas the case, why then don't we have a balanced budget? Why is it that \nwe are still trying to enact a balanced budget? Why is it that we are \nstill trying to reach an agreement with the President of the United \nStates on a balanced budget?\n  The President said the other day in his State of the Union Address, \n``We don't need to rewrite the Constitution of the United States. All \nwe need is your vote and my signature.'' Well, we gave him our vote on \na balanced budget. It was submitted to the President of the United \nStates last year. Guess what? We didn't get his signature.\n  That is the problem. We can all have our disagreements about the \nparticulars. But in the final analysis what is required in a balanced \nbudget amendment is that you have to agree to the bottom line. There is \na bottom line. What this amendment says is that total outlays will not \nexceed total receipts in any fiscal year. I know that is a concept that \nis difficult to understand in this institution because it is nothing \nthat we have ever been required to do. What we feel is important to the \nsecurity interests of this country is to ensure that we have balanced \nbudgets in perpetuity.\n  Almost every State in the country is required to have a balanced \nbudget. Yes. Most of them are required to balance their budgets because \nof a constitutional amendment in their State constitution, like my \nState of Maine. My husband served for 8 years as Governor. Believe me, \nthey didn't argue with particulars of the constitutional amendment. \nThey understood what they had to do because they took an oath of office \nas each and every one of us does in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House \nof Representatives. We are required to uphold the Constitution of the \nUnited States as each and every Governor is required to uphold their \nState constitution.\n  So what they did in good faith is reach an agreement on a budget, and \nin their case a biennial budget. Yes, if their estimates were wrong, \nthey made adjustments. Their constitutions are not prescriptions for \nperfection. It is an attempt to comply with the constitution. That is \nwhat the Governors and the State legislatures do all across the \ncountry. If their estimates are wrong, if their projections for \ninterest rates, unemployment rates, or inflation rates are wrong, they \nmake adjustments throughout the year or at the end of the year, because \nthey understand they are required to balance the budget.\n\n  So, I find it sort of nothing short of extraordinary that we sit here \nand argue, ``Well, this amendment is providing too much flexibility \nbecause we are relying on estimates.'' Yet, on the other hand we are \nfacing numerous challenges and propositions to a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget that would enhance our flexibility \nbecause there are those who argue, from across the aisle and other \nopponents, who say, ``Well, a constitutional amendment is too \nrestrictive, we can't respond to circumstances such as recessions or \ndownturns of the economy, a national economic emergency of some kind.'' \nSo we are getting it from both sides--from those who say it is too \nrestrictive and other opponents who argue saying it isn't restrictive \nenough. That is the problem here. Because in the final analysis, if we \nare truly interested in ensuring that we balance our budget, I suggest \nthat we could overcome our institutional opposition by passing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n\n[[Page S1264]]\n\n  As I have said in the past to those who argue that, ``Well, it is \njust really a gimmick,'' if there was a gimmick, Congress would have \npassed it long ago because Congress loves gimmicks. But this \nconstitutional amendment isn't a gimmick. It is an attempt to put our \nfiscal house in order.\n  It is interesting. We get this coming and going, if you listen to the \ndebate. We have charts that show declining deficits. But what about the \ncharts that show the deficits moving up beyond the turn of the century \nand even before that time? We will be required in the year 2002 alone \nto reduce the deficit to balance the budget by $188 billion. But the \nopponents will not tell you about the deficits in future years that \nwill double and triple--double and triple. In the year 2025 alone, the \ndeficit will be in that one year alone $2 trillion. You know 2025 isn't \nthat far away, if you think about your children and your grandchildren \nand the staggering debt that they will be required to assume because we \nare just passing it on.\n  In fact, if we do not manage this debt, the next generation will be \nrequired to pay an 82-percent tax rate and see a 50-percent reduction \nin their benefits. And that is a fact.\n  Are we not required or obligated to address that question? An 82-\npercent tax rate and a 50-percent reduction in benefits. That is what \nwe are leaving to the next generation. I know I and others as strong \nproponents of this amendment share a true responsibility to begin to \naddress this question. I would like to think that we have faith in this \ninstitution sufficient enough to know that this can happen. But it will \nnot and it has not.\n  The last time we balanced the budget in the U.S. Congress was the \nsame year that Neil Armstrong landed on the Moon. That is what these 28 \nunbalanced budgets on this desk represent. That is the point. Since \n1950, we have only had five surpluses--five. In a century, practically \nspeaking, 27 times. That is the track record. That is the historical \ntrack record.\n  Is that the gamble we want to take for the next generation? I say \nnot. And that is why I am prepared to take the risk in terms of the \ninterpretation of a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, \nbecause it is that important to our future. And so each and every time \nwe hear everybody saying: ``We can do it; it is important, I agree; we \nshould have a balanced budget; we can do it on our own,'' just think \nfor a moment. We have not had one since 1969.\n  The fact is we cannot even agree statutorily. We had that debate last \nyear for a long time. In fact, a group of us on a bipartisan basis \noffered our own plan to try to serve as a catalyst for this debate. In \nfact, we received 46 votes. And I did not like everything in that \nbudget, I have to tell you. But I was willing to agree to it because I \nthought the bottom line was that important. I do not doubt for a moment \nthat it is difficult to reach an agreement among 100 Senators or 435 \nMembers of the House, so a total of 535, plus the President of the \nUnited States. But there has to be some give-and-take in this process, \nsome flexibility in order to reach the bottom line. Unfortunately, we \nhave too much flexibility because we are not required to balance the \nbudget. Oh, sure, we have some statutes, but Congress has long ignored \nthose statutory requirements to balance the budget--long ignored them. \nThat is why a constitutional amendment is so important.\n  I frankly think there is no greater issue, no issue more central to \nthe economic future of our country as well as to our children and to \nour grandchildren than balancing the budget. I know the administration \nis touting an economic recovery, but I have to tell you there are not a \nlot of people in my State participating in a full economic recovery. \nMany people are feeling very anxious about the future, about their \nchildren's future. The overwhelming majority of Americans--in fact, \nsome polls say as high as 88 percent--have said that they do not \nbelieve the next generation will achieve the American dream.\n  I say that is disheartening, and yet I can understand why people \nwould feel pessimistic, because they know they are working hard to try \nto make ends meet, and they know their children will be working hard to \nmake ends meet in order to maintain a decent standard of living.\n  We have heard, well, household income is up. But the real household \nincome in America today is down below the levels of 1990 when we were \nfacing a recession. And certainly my State and New England, California \nwere the hardest hit regions in this country. But that is because there \nare more people working in the family today; they are having more jobs \nin order to make ends meet.\n\n  There was a cartoon last year showing the President touting the \nmillions of jobs that had been created, and the waiter serving him \nlunch said, ``Yeah, and I have four of them.'' That is the point. \nPeople are having to work longer and harder than ever before to make \nends meet.\n  So then you look at the tax burden. We have heard a lot of discussion \nabout taxes. The tax burden is high. It now represents 38 percent of a \nfamily's income--more than food, shelter, and clothing combined. So not \nonly are people working longer and harder in more jobs, but also they \nare facing a rising tax burden.\n  Then we hear about economic growth, and we have seen the projections \nfor the future--2.3, 2.1, 2.5, but the average projected growth for \nAmerica in the next 5 years is about 2.3 percent. If we had had that \ngrowth rate for the last 30 years, we would not have achieved today's \neconomy until the year 2003. We would have had 13 million fewer jobs in \nAmerica.\n  The point is that this balanced budget is crucial to American \nfamilies because it means more income in their pockets. That is the \nbottom line. That is the mathematics of it all, because the less the \nGovernment spends, the less it borrows, the more money American \nfamilies will have in their pockets. That means savings to them. It \nmeans their car loans, their student loans, their mortgages will be \nless costly. That is a fact. In fact, all combined, they could realize \na savings of $1,500 a year because interest rates will be less.\n  That is real money to the average American family. It is less money \nthey have to give to their Government. It is more money that they have \nto spend. Frankly, that is what this debate is all about, how we can \nimprove the standard of living for American families and begin to think \nabout our priorities here in the Congress and the priorities for our \nNation. But when you do not have to meet a bottom line like every \nfamily does in America, every business, every State, you do not have to \nthink about what is a priority anymore. You do not have to think how \nwell or efficiently or effectively we will spend the hard-earned \ntaxpayers' dollars. We just do not have to think about it because we \ncan just incur deficits year in and year out. Even the President's \nbudget that he submitted to the Congress last week adds another $1 \ntrillion over the next 5 years. And that is supposed to be a balanced \nbudget.\n  That is what we are talking about. So that is why I happen to think a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget is the only course of \naction that we can take to ensure prosperity for the future.\n  I know we can have our differences, but in the final analysis we \nought to agree that this is the one step we can take. A balanced budget \nwill be great for American families. It will be great for America \nbecause it will expand economic growth, and economic growth is the \nengine that drives a healthy economy. It will help to increase wages, \ncreate more jobs, unleash millions, billions of dollars in capital to \nallow this country to expand and to grow. I do not think we ought to \naccept budgets that compromise our economic standards, our economic \nopportunities, because that is what unbalanced budgets do. We are \nfacing a very competitive future in this global economy. The American \npeople understand that. They understand that, and they are worried \nbecause they are not certain how their children will be able to prepare \nfor that competitive economy.\n\n  That is why education has become a central issue and a central part, \nI know, of our agenda here in the Senate, and a central part of the \nPresident's agenda--because we are going to have to prepare to make \ninvestments in education, not only for the basic education needs of \nAmericans but also in continuing education so they are constantly \nprepared for the changes in skills and technology. But, in order to\n\n[[Page S1265]]\n\nmake those investments, we have to set priorities in our budgets. We \nhave to have more money to spend. That is why I think balancing the \nbudget and investing in education are not mutually exclusive goals; \nthat you can be fiscally responsible but at the same time be visionary, \nbe compassionate about the investments that we need to make as \npriorities for America. That is what a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget will do, because it will require us to do it each \nand every year, to examine and reexamine our priorities and how well \nthese programs are functioning.\n  We have an obligation to make sure that every dollar that is spent is \nspent wisely and efficiently. Under the current budget process, there \nis no such requirement.\n  John F. Kennedy once said, ``The task of every generation is to build \na road for the next generation.'' I cannot think of a more important \nroad than the one that leads to fiscal security for future Americans. \nWe have no less an obligation to ensure that, because never before has \none generation delivered to the next generation a lower standard of \nliving. But we are in danger of doing that now, and that is why I think \nit is so important that we grapple with reality and reach the \nconclusion that the only way we can ensure that prosperity and security \nfor Americans is by enacting a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget.\n  I yield floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I see several of my colleagues are waiting. I am only \ngoing to speak 6 or 7 minutes. Do I have to ask unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will observe that at 1:30 the Senate \nwill proceed, under the previous order, to the Dodd amendment for 4 \nhours.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will just take what time is left.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a question? Mr. President, \nthe Senator indicated he wished to speak for 6 or 7 minutes. The \nSenator from North Carolina, apparently, wishes to speak for 3 minutes, \nand I had come to the floor wanting to speak also on the legislation.\n  I ask the Senator to propound a unanimous-consent request that he \nspeak for 7 minutes, the Senator from North Carolina follow for 3 \nminutes, after which I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would observe that we would need \nunanimous consent to deal with the Dodd amendment, as to whether or not \nthat time would be extended.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time be taken \nout of both sides equally in the Dodd amendment, because I think we \nhave more than enough time. If we need more time, we will ask unanimous \nconsent to get more.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank Senator Hatch very much for taking care of \nthat, Mr. President. I appreciate that very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine had a very good \nstatement that we all ought to take cognizance of, and that is based on \nher experience, being that her husband was Governor of Maine and they \nhad to live within a balanced budget, year after year after year. It \ndoes force discipline upon policymakers. She gave an eloquent statement \nfrom that point of view, as well as a lot of other good reasons why we \nneed a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1255-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1265-S1267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AT DOD\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to speak on a problem that I have been speaking \nabout in the Department of Defense, but it also emphasizes the need for \nhaving a balanced budget, because the shenanigans that go on in the \nDefense Department would not go on if we had more discipline in this \ntown in regard to the expenditures of taxpayers' money.\n  On January 28, I spoke here on the floor about irresponsible \nfinancial accounting policies being pursued over at the Department of \nDefense. This policy is the responsibility of the chief financial \nofficer at the Pentagon. The person holding that position now is Mr. \nJohn Hamre, but it would be applicable to anybody holding this \nposition. The chief financial officer is supposed to be tightening \ninternal controls and improving financial accounting. That is exactly \nwhy we passed, in 1990, the Chief Financial Officer's Act. Mr. Hamre \nshould be cleaning up the books at the Pentagon and watching the money \nlike a hawk. If that had been the case, we would not need to have a \nconstitutional amendment for a balanced budget, if we had been doing \nthat properly over the last 25 years.\n  Sadly, the job is not being done. To make matters worse, the \nbureaucrats are pushing a new policy on progress payments that will \nloosen internal controls and cook the books. This new policy is \nembodied in draft bill language that was being circulated in the \nPentagon for review as recently as January 30. I expressed my concerns \nabout the new policy in my statement on January 28. In a nutshell, this \nis what I said then and it is still appropriate today:\n  I am afraid that this new draft language would subvert the \nappropriations process that is so key to keeping tight control on how \nthe taxpayers' dollars are expended by the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  I even alerted the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to the \nbad aspects of this language. The new language is not one bit \nconstructive. It would not fix Defense's crumbling accounting system. \nIt would merely condone and perpetuate crooked bookkeeping practices.\n  Since raising this issue here on the floor, I have exchanged letters \nwith Mr. Hamre. I ask unanimous consent that correspondence be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I was astounded yesterday to see \n     that you went to the floor of the Senate to personally attack \n     me. You made no effort to discuss your concerns with me \n     either directly or through your staff. You did not contact me \n     to ask me to explain my position on a draft proposal \n     circulating within the Department for comment. And the \n     ``concerned citizen'' you cite in your letter who provided \n     this information has never contacted me. This was a Pearl \n     Harbor attack, and I am very disappointed in it.\n       Frankly, we have done more in the past 3 years to clean up \n     financial management problems in the Department than anyone \n     else has done in the past 30 years. Secretary Perry deserves \n     high praise for making this a priority. I have certainly \n     dedicated myself to this task. You can ask any objective \n     individual in town and they would tell you we have made \n     enormous progress.\n       In the past 3 years we have closed over 230 inefficient \n     accounting offices and consolidated them into new operating \n     locations with improved business practices and equipment. We \n     have closed over 300 payroll offices and transferred accounts \n     from some 25 old outdated payroll systems into a new modern \n     system with a 500 percent improvement in productivity. We \n     have reduced problem disbursements by over 70 percent in 3 \n     years. We have instituted new policies that freeze activity \n     on accounts that are in deficient status, and I am forcing \n     the Services to obligate funds to cover negative unliquidated \n     obligations. We are prevalidating all disbursements of funds \n     for all new contracts and have lowered the prevalidation \n     threshold on existing contracts.\n       Yet without even offering to discuss the issue with me, you \n     blast me from the floor of the Senate, claiming I am ``ready \n     to throw in the towel'' on financial management reform. That \n     is nonsense, and I am disappointed that you would suggest it. \n     I don't blame you personally. I worked for the Senate for 10 \n     years and I know how busy Senators are. I know that you are \n     often given material by staff who represent the fact as \n     correct. But it is disappointing that you would not even ask \n     me to come over to discuss it with you. After you had heard \n     my side, it would be perfectly fair for you to blast me if \n     you still disagreed. But you didn't even ask me to meet with \n     you.\n       For the record, the language which you criticized has \n     nothing to do with the M account as you allege. It would not \n     ``thumb our nose'' at the appropriations process or the law \n     as you state in your speech. It would not pool funds at the \n     contract level. This language merely clarified that progress \n     payments are a financing device to lower borrowing costs. In \n     their 40 year history, progress payments were never designed \n     to do anything other than finance a contract. Every progress \n     payment we make is linked directly to the source funds \n     identified to the contract, and detailed audits are conducted\n\n[[Page S1266]]\n\n     before the contract is closed. We don't reimburse contractors \n     for the full costs they incur precisely to guarantee that we \n     don't overpay contractors. This language was designed to \n     clarify a problem we have with progress payments. Progress \n     payments cannot be linked to funding sources unless the \n     acquisition community mandates that every contractor in the \n     country change its accounting systems to accommodate DoD \n     fiscal law prohibitions and invoice us in terms of \n     congressional appropriation categories. That would not be \n     good business sense and violates the underlying purpose of \n     progress payments.\n       Next time, Senator Grassley, please contact me first before \n     you attack me on the floor of the Senate. You actually set \n     back financial management reform by your attacks because \n     people pull back from actions just to avoid the criticism.\n           Sincerely,\n     John J. Hamre.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1997.\n     Hon. John J. Hamre,\n     Under Secretary of Defense, 1100 Defense Pentagon, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: I am writing in response to your letter of \n     January 29, 1997, expressing anger and disappointment about \n     my recent speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate about the \n     lack of ``Accountability at the Department of Defense.''\n       Your anger and disappointment seem to flow from one main \n     source. You think I made no effort to discuss this matter \n     with you before blasting you on the floor of the Senate. You \n     state, and I quote:\n       ``You made no effort to discuss your concerns with me \n     either directly or through your staff. You did not contact me \n     to ask me to explain my position on a draft proposal \n     circulating within the Department for comment.''\n       John, that statement is totally false, and I demand an \n     apology.\n       As soon as the draft language on progress payments came to \n     my attention, my staff contacted your personal office \n     directly at 703-695-3237 to express concern about it. That \n     was the very first thing we did. My staff was informed that \n     you were out of the building on travel and to call Navy \n     Captain Mike Nowakowski, one of your congressional liaison \n     officers. That was done immediately. Initially, on January \n     14th, Captain Nowakowski reported that he could find no trace \n     of the draft language on progress payments but indicated that \n     he would keep looking. At that time, my staff communicated my \n     grave concerns about the proposal in detail, including a \n     warning that I would go to ``battle stations'' if this \n     language was, in fact, under active consideration. When \n     Captain Nowakowski was unable to locate the language, I was \n     able to obtain a copy elsewhere. My office faxed the document \n     to him at 4:03 pm on January 14th. During a subsequent \n     conversation on January 22nd, Captain Nowakowski confirmed \n     that the language was indeed under review within the \n     department. He also told me that he had personally briefed \n     you on all my concerns.\n       John, those are the facts. The facts show that I did \n     everything humanly possible to communicate my concerns \n     directly to you. Your letter is out of line and inconsistent \n     with the facts.\n       Furthermore, I believe Captain Nowakowski is telling the \n     truth. He briefed you in detail about my concerns. He made \n     that statement on January 22nd and reconfirmed it again this \n     morning. I shared my concerns with you--as best I could \n     through that unresponsive and cumbersome bureaucracy that is \n     your office. So why did you say I made no effort to discuss \n     my concerns with you either directly or indirectly through my \n     staff? And why didn't you react and respond to my concerns? \n     You should have called me and asked to see me. My door is \n     always open to you.\n       John, you know that when I am disturbed about some \n     development at the Pentagon, I usually go to the floor and \n     talk about it. My staff informed one of your other \n     congressional liaison officers--``Hap'' Taylor--that I was \n     planning to do exactly that. When I do it, it is usually an \n     unpleasant experience for some. But it's unpleasant only for \n     those who fail to be responsible and accountable for the \n     taxpayers' money. Since I am not a member of the Armed \n     Services Committee, I think of the floor as my committee \n     forum for defense issues.\n       John, you owe me two things. First, you owe me an \n     explanation. If Captain Nowakowski is tell the truth--and I \n     believe he is, then you need to explain the inaccurate \n     assertions in your letter. Second, you owe me an apology.\n       I look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles E. Grassley\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 30, 1997.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I have received your January 30 \n     letter demanding an apology. I am sorry that I won't do that \n     because I believe I am the wronged party. You blasted me on \n     the floor of the Senate and I wrote you a personal letter. It \n     seems to me that a modicum of decency would hold that if you \n     intend to criticize me by name on the floor of the Senate, I \n     should have a chance to talk with you first before you do \n     that. Yet you didn't do that.\n       You state in your letter ``I did everything humanly \n     possible to communicate my concerns directly to you.'' I \n     really don't know how you can conclude that. On two separate \n     occasions in the past I had breakfast with you. I have spoken \n     with you in previous occasions on the phone and at hearings. \n     I have repeatedly stated my willingness to meet with you at \n     any time. You have written me numerous letters and I have \n     written back. Yet on this occasion you did not call my \n     office, you did not ask me to come to meet with you, you did \n     not send me a letter outlining your concerns.\n       My staff aid, Captain Nowakowski, told me that your \n     staffer, Mr. Charles Murphy, had a copy of this language and \n     ``had some serious concerns.'' At the time the document was \n     in circulation for comment and did not represent Department \n     policy. It is still in the coordination stage. We hadn't \n     decided on what to do yet, so it was inappropriate to respond \n     to a staff call expressing concerns on something that the \n     Department had not adopted. Even then, Charlie (whom I have \n     known for 10 years and consider a friend) didn't call me or \n     ask to meet with me to relay your concerns.\n       Senator, I do respect you, but I owe you no apologies.\n           Sincerely,\n     John J. Hamre\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ted: I am writing to express concern about a \n     legislative proposal that is under consideration within the \n     Department of Defense (DOD).\n       This provision, if approved, would significantly loosen \n     controls over progress payments. DOD progress payments total \n     about $20 billion per year. A copy of the proposed language \n     is attached.\n       First, the Inspector General (IG) has been keeping a close \n     eye on this whole problem for a number of years. IG audit \n     reports consistently show that the department regularly \n     violates the laws that the proposed language would undo. This \n     is like legalizing the crime--instead of trying to fix the \n     problem.\n       Second, this proposal is inconsistent with Comptroller \n     Hamre's commitment to begin the process of matching \n     disbursements with obligations before a payment is made. In \n     last year's Report No. 104-286 (pages 18-19), your Committee \n     directed Mr. Hamre to develop a detailed plan, including \n     dollar thresholds and milestones, for eliminating all problem \n     disbursements. The attached language would put that whole \n     idea on a back burner indefinitely.\n       Third, the attached language would subvert the \n     appropriations process. If DOD is to be authorized to merge \n     and pool acquisition monies--R and procurement funds--at \n     the contract level, then Congress must make some kind of \n     corresponding adjustment in the way those monies are \n     appropriated. To do otherwise might make the appropriations \n     process irrelevant somewhere down the road.\n       I would like to ask you to urge Mr. Hamre to reconsider the \n     attached proposal and search for a better way to solve the \n     problem. Ted, there is obviously a problem in the payments \n     process. We need to understand the problem before we try to \n     fix it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Hamre's letters tell me that he may not understand \nthis issue. He seems confused. It is confusion like this that dictates \nmore fiscal discipline in this town, and that can only come from a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.\n  His letter of January 29, I think, contains two contradictory \nstatements. In one breath he says that payments and appropriations are \nin sync. In the next breath, he admits that payments and appropriations \nare out of sync.\n  But then he goes on to say that the cost of getting them in sync \nwould just be too high, that we cannot worry about whether payments are \nmatched with a particular product or a particular invoice or \nappropriation account. He says, ``that would not be good business \nsense.'' It would place an unfair burden on the contractors.\n  Just think, when it comes to matching disbursements of money with an \ninvoice, it might also place an unfair burden on contractors and \ngovernment accountants.\n  So just what is the thinking of the chief financial officer? Clearly, \nthere is a problem in the Department of Defense's payment process. \nThere is a major disconnect. On the one hand, we have a whole body of \nlaw governing the use of appropriations; on the other, we have payments \nfor factory work that are supposed to be matched with corresponding \nappropriations.\n  Unfortunately, the law and the payments just don't mesh. They can't \nbe reconciled. So long as the two are not\n\n[[Page S1267]]\n\nin sync, the Pentagon is operating outside the law, and it doesn't \nreflect the fiscal discipline that we need in this town and that we \nwould get with a constitutional amendment.\n  Unfortunately, the new policy in this draft language that is floating \naround the Pentagon does not put them back in sync. It will keep them \nout of sync permanently.\n  To understand the root cause of this problem, we need to step back in \ntime. Bureaucrats do not like it when congressional overseers revisit \nhistory, but that is what we need to do. We need to revisit an old IG \nreport, the inspector General's audit report dated March 31, 1992. That \nis number 92-064. It is on the Titan IV Missile Program.\n  That is where the problem was first detected and exposed, and that is \nthe problem the bureaucrats are trying to cover up in this new policy.\n  The Titan IV was not an isolated case. Unfortunately, the practices \nuncovered on Titan IV typified common practices throughout the \nDepartment. This report showed the Defense Department regularly \nviolates the laws that the draft language would undo. Instead of fixing \nthe problem, this proposed language would legalize the crime.\n  Mr. President, the laws that were violated were designed to protect \nCongress' constitutional control over the purse strings. Progress \npayments to Martin Marietta on the Titan IV contract were made in \nviolation of those laws. Those payments were made on a predetermined \nsequence of appropriations. Those are words that mean the money was \ndrawn from available appropriation accounts using a random selection \nprocess.\n  What a way--random selection to justify the expenditures of the \ntaxpayers' money. That is a blatant violation of the law. That is the \ninspector general talking, Mr. President, not the Senator from Iowa.\n  Yet, as difficult as it may be to comprehend, this unlawful procedure \nwas sanctified by Air Force Regulation 177-120, starting February 15, \n1988. In other words, that is an outlaw decree.\n  Congress appropriates money for specific purposes. Those purposes are \nspecified in law, and that is how the money must be spent. That's what \nthe law says. The Pentagon bureaucrats promise to straighten up this \nmess after the fact, down the road, after the money goes out the door. \nThey try to retroactively adjust--that's their language--adjust the \nledgers--to make it look like the payments and the appropriations were \nin sync.\n  That is fine and dandy, Mr. President. It makes the books look nice \nand neat, but the books then do not reflect the reality of how the \ntaxpayers' money was spent or what the appropriators intended. The \nbooks do not tell you how the money was really spent. If they don't do \nthat, then they are inaccurate, and that's what I call cooking the \nbooks.\n  Back in 1992, the inspector general tried to shut down the Defense \nDepartment's unlawful payment process. Mr. President, the inspector \ngeneral told the Department to get on the stick, obey the law, fix the \nproblem.\n  Well, guess what? The big wheels over at the Pentagon nonconcurred \nwith the IG. That means, take a hike, in other words. They said the \npayment process was working just fine; it doesn't need any fixing; \ndon't mess with it.\n  We should be thankful that the IG had courage and did not back down.\n  This dispute came to a head, after years of talk, in March of 1993. \nThere was a high-level powwow at that time. The financial wizards in \nthe Pentagon got together and signed a peace treaty. They said, \nbasically, obey the law.\n  They were given 120 days to do it.\n  The treaty was signed by: Ms. Eleanor Spector, Director of Defense \nProcurement; Mr. Al Tucker, Deputy Comptroller; and Mr. Bob Lieberman, \nassistant IG for auditing.\n  Mr. President, 4 years have passed since that agreement was signed. \nThose same officials are still in the same place. But nothing has been \nfixed.\n  Now, we have the DOD CFO telling us that nothing will be fixed. The \nstatus quo will be institutionalized and legalized. Titan IV is the \nmodel for the future.\n  CFO Hamre is responsible for this mess.\n  Why didn't Mr. Hamre enforce the March 1993 agreement? What exactly \nhas happened in the 4 years since the agreement was signed? How did we \nend up where we are?\n  We need to know the answers to these questions.

Mr. President, the White House Commission on Aviation \nSafety and Security is going to present its recommendations to the \nPresident today, and I commend the commission for its work and support \nmost of its recommendations.\n  Aviation safety should be a prominent feature on the list of \nbipartisan issues upon which we can find common ground this year. There \nare 22,000 commercial flights every day in the United States. The \nAmerican air traffic control system served 550 million passengers last \nyear. Mr. President, in my home State of North Carolina, 22 million \npeople last year passed through the Charlotte airport.\n  The safety of literally millions of Americans hangs in the balance of \nour commitment to aviation modernization. I have a rather personal \ninterest in this issue. I was in a plane crash in 1983 and wound up in \na lake surrounded by fire in an airplane without wings.\n  I want to stress the importance of the commission's call for rapid \nmodernization of our air traffic control system. These efforts to \nupgrade the system will necessitate certain costs, and no one in this \ncity is more concerned about the taxpayers than I, but the system is \ndecades old and on the verge of collapse.\n  Mr. President, one of the better-kept secrets around Washington seems \nto be the $1.4 billion that we have squandered on a failed effort to \nupgrade the aviation computer network over the last several years. IBM \nworked for years to create a modern air traffic control computer system \nand spent more than $1 billion of the taxpayers' money. The exact \nfigure is unclear, but the contractors think--they think--that they \nwill be able to salvage some of this work--some of it--as the process \nstarts anew.\n  The system at O'Hare Airport in Chicago includes computers that are \nmore than 30 years old, and, as you know, its failures leave some air \ntraffic control personnel with blank screens. The lives of the \npassengers are in the hands of air traffic controllers hobbled by a \nsystem that is both inadequate and obsolete.\n  The Federal Government called for installation of a Doppler radar \nsystem to detect wind shear at airports around the country. However, \nMr. President, the system is operative at just a few airports. This \nCongress maintains an obligation to the air passengers of this country. \nClearly, this obligation is not yet met, and too much money has been \nwasted.\n  As a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nintend to keep a keen eye on the dollars as I always do, but I also \nwant to see a cost-effective modernization of the system. We owe a safe \nsystem to the taxpayers. Their tax dollars are paying for it, and they \nare entitled to it, and they need it. It is incomprehensible that the \ncomputers at one the busiest airports in the world can go blank. This \nis a condition that boggles the mind.\n  I believe the hiring policies of airline companies and airports also \nmerit serious thought. The airlines need to be certain that the people \nwho service and maintain airplanes do not have questionable \nbackgrounds. These security issues are critical to the safety of the \nAmerican flying public.\n  There are other safety concerns of note. The American airplane fleet \nis aging. We need to ensure that inspections are thorough and frequent \non these older aircraft. There is nothing wrong with an older airplane, \nbut it needs to be inspected and updated, lest problems go undetected \nand new technologies go unused.\n  We need to take these and other steps to ensure that the American air \ntraveler is safe. We can ensure safe skies without excessive \ninconvenience and delay, and, Mr. President, I am committed to just \nthat.\n\n[[Page S1268]]\n\n  I thank the Commission for its efforts. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues and the administration to implement some of these \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor of the \nSenate to respond to and to discuss some items on the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  There has been a great deal of talk about the constitutional \namendment here on the floor of the Senate. There have been press \nconferences on both sides and a great deal of literature distributed in \nthe Senate. I want to talk about what the issue is and what the issue \nis not.\n  The issue is not, as some would have us believe, a discussion between \nthose who think it is meritorious to balance the Federal budget and \nthose who think we should not balance the Federal budget. Generally \nspeaking, most Members of the Senate believe it is important for this \ncountry's long-term economic interest to find a way to balance the \nFederal budget. We ought to do that. This Federal Government has spent \nmore than it has taken in for a good long while. I would just say, that \nit is the irresponsibility of Democrats and Republicans that have \nallowed that to happen.\n  It is true that there is a difference in how they want to spend \nmoney, but there is not a plug nickel's worth of difference between \nRepublicans and Democrats about how much they want to spend. One side \nmight want to spend more for Head Start and another might want to spend \nmore for B-2 bombers or whatever. But nevertheless, if we take a look \nat the aggregate appetite for spending you will not find a plug \nnickel's worth of difference on either side of the aisle. Priorities \nand choices, though would be different.\n  But both political parties--Presidents who are Republican, year in \nand year out, Presidents who are Democrat, not quite as many, I might \nadd--both have submitted budgets to the Congress that are wildly out of \nbalance and that have had substantial deficits. So this is not a case \nwhere one can stand on slippery sand and say, ``It's your fault. You're \nthe folks who are at fault over here.'' It is everybody's fault. And it \nought to stop. We ought to balance the Federal budget because that will \nbe good for this country.\n  The debate here is, shall we alter the Constitution of the United \nStates? Shall we change the Constitution of the United States? I would \nobserve that if it is done, 5 minutes from now the Federal debt and the \nFederal deficit will not have been altered by one penny. We will have \naltered the constitution of the United States, but we will not have \nchanged by one penny the Federal deficit or the Federal debt.\n  I want to talk a bit about that because I think there are \ncircumstances under which we should alter the Constitution. There are \ncircumstances under which I will support a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. But I think when we do change the U.S. Constitution \nwe ought to do it with great care and we ought to do it right, because \nyou do not get many chances to correct a mistake.\n  First, I want to talk about debt. The discussion about debt is an \ninteresting one because we have people coming to the floor of the \nSenate and they say, ``Well, these Federal deficits that we have had, \nyou know, everybody else has to balance their budget. Business has to \nbalance its budget. Consumers have to balance their budgets.''\n  We have about $21 trillion of debt in this country, about $21 \ntrillion of debt. This chart shows what has happened to debt. The \ngrowth of debt in my judgment has not been very healthy for this \ncountry, not in the public sector, not in the private sector.\n  This shows what has happened to business debt, corporate debt, \nhousehold debt, Federal Government debt. Take a look at the curve. And \n$21 trillion worth of debt.\n  Now someone might stand up and say, ``Well, everybody else has to \nbalance their budget.'' That is not true. If so, what is all this debt \nabout? In fact, we have developed a culture in this country in which it \nis fine for the private sector to send a dozen solicitations to college \nstudents who have no jobs and no visible means of support saying to \nthem, ``Please take our credit card. You have a $1,000, $2,000, or \n$5,000 approved limit. Just go ahead and take our credit card. We want \nyou to have a credit card. You don't have a job, no income. Take our \ncredit card.'' That is the culture in our country. Is it good for this \ncountry? I do not think so.\n\n  I said also, the culture is walking down the street as a consumer, \nand the picture window of the business literally raps on your elbow and \nsays, ``Hey, you, walking in front of me here,'' the window says, \n``Come in and buy this product. It doesn't matter you can't afford it. \nDoesn't matter you don't need it. Buy the product. Take it home. You \ndon't have to make a payment for 6 months. And we'll give you a rebate \nnext week. And charge it.'' That is the culture. Is it right? No, it is \nnot right.\n  We ought to change that. We ought to change it here in the Federal \nsystem by balancing our budgets responsibly. And we have a problem well \nbeyond this Federal system. Take a look what is happening with credit \ncard debt in this country. Take a look at consumer debt.\n  My point is, we ought to be concerned about the Federal debt and the \nFederal deficit, but we ought not stand up and say that is the only \nplace debt exists. We have a whole culture of debt that raises real \nsignificant questions about where we are headed and how we are going to \nget there.\n  The discussion today is about altering the Constitution in order to \nrequire budgets be in balance. Last evening I was privileged to see a \npreview of something that is going to be on public broadcasting on the \nlife of Thomas Jefferson. It is a wonderful piece written by Ken Burns. \nIt describes Thomas Jefferson writing the Declaration of Independence \nat age 33. I got a copy of that today. I can only imagine having the \nkind of talent that he had. I mean, he was almost unique in the history \nof the world in his ability to think and write and express for us the \nspirit of what this democracy is.\n  Thirty-three years old and in a boarding house he writes:\n\n       When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary \n     for one people to dissolve their political bands which have \n     connected them with another, and to assume among the powers \n     of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the \n     Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent \n     respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should \n     declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these \n     rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their \n     just powers from the consent of the governed.\n\n  You can see Thomas Jefferson's handwriting and his corrections, the \nwords he has crossed out, the words he has added when he wrote this \nmarvelous, wonderful document.\n  The year following the writing of this document when he was 33 years \nold, a group of 55 white men, largely overweight, we are told, convened \nin a small room in Philadelphia called the Assembly Room in \nConstitution Hall. They said it was so hot that summer in Philadelphia \nthat--and those folks had such ample girth--that they had to cover the \nwindows to keep the Sun out because it got very warm and they did not \nhave air-conditioning in those days. And those 55 men wrote for this \ncountry a constitution.\n  The Constitution itself is quite a wonderful document. Thomas \nJefferson was in Europe at the time. He contributed to the writing of \nthe Constitution by sending substantial writing back about the Bill of \nRights. The Constitution of course is the living document that is \nunique in the history of this world.\n\n       We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more \n     perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic \n     Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the \n     general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to \n     ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this \n     Constitution for the United States of America.\n\n\n[[Page S1269]]\n\n\n  Language so clear and so wonderfully written, they established the \nfoundation of this country, the fabric of a democracy that has now \nbecome the most successful surviving democracy on this Earth.\n  The spirit of that document, the spirit of that Constitution is, I \nthink, attested to by virtually all who serve here in what it means to \nus, our families, our future, to our country. When we decide that we \nshould consider altering that Constitution, provisions for which were \nmade in the very Constitution, we should do it carefully.\n  We have had people propose all kinds of schemes to alter the \nConstitution of the United States. I am told there was a proposal to \nalter the Constitution that would require a President first coming from \nthe northern part of America and then followed by a requirement that \nthe next President come from the South.\n  There have been thousands of proposals--some good, some bad, some \nbaked, some half-baked--to change the Constitution of the United \nStates. In fact, it was not very long ago that we had three proposals \nto alter the Constitution, in the last session of Congress, proposed to \nbe voted on by the U.S. Senate, in the period of 6 weeks--three \nseparate proposals to alter the work of Franklin, Madison, Mason, \nGeorge Washington, and so many others, who over 200 years ago framed \nthis issue.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. When I got the unanimous consent-agreement, I did so that \nall time would be divided equally. Can the Senator give me an \nindication of how long he will be speaking?\n  Mr. DORGAN. About another 10 to 12 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could we divide the time so the Republican time will be \ntaken off our time and the Democratic time is taken off your time? It \nwould be fairer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not have a problem with that. There will be ample \ntime for everyone to speak. I am happy to accommodate the Senator.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for the next 12 minutes \nand it come off the Democratic time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I observe that there will be no limit of time for anyone \nhere to speak to their last breath about any subject they so choose on \nthis issue, I guess.\n  I will continue because I wanted to provide a framework for what I \nwas going to say. I respect the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch. He \nhas been on this floor on this issue and he has not wavered. He \nbelieves very strongly in what he is doing. I would support him if he \nwould make one change in the constitutional amendment.\n  A columnist said, ``Call his bluff,'' naming me by name. I say to the \nSenator, you make the change and I vote with it. I expect the change \nwill not be made. If you do, chalk me up. I am one more vote.\n  I want to talk about that change and the dimensions of it and the \nresponse of it. The change is in the issue of Social Security. We have \nhad a lot of debate about this. Some said this is the biggest red \nherring in the world. Two political pundits this weekend said this is a \nfraudulent issue. Of course, pundits are either 100 percent right or \n100 percent wrong and no one knows which or who. A columnist said this \nis a totally fraudulent issue. I want to describe the issue once again \nand describe why I think not only is it not fraudulent, it is one of \nthe most significant issues we will face in fiscal policy. A position \non this issue is now prepared to be put into the Constitution of the \nUnited States in a way I think hurts this country.\n  Let me describe it. Social Security is a remarkably successful \nprogram in this country. We decided some long while ago that we would \nhave people pay in a payroll tax and that payroll tax would accumulate \nmoney which would be available to people when they retire. What has \nhappened is we have developed kind of a ``bulge'' in our population, a \nvery large group of children who were born just after the Second World \nWar. I mentioned the other day, kind of kidding, but it was true, there \nwas a tremendous outpouring of love and affection after the Second \nWorld War. A lot of folks came back and a lot of this love and \naffection blossomed into the largest baby crop in the history of our \ncountry. It caused some real long-term demographic problems, because \nwhen they hit the retirement rolls, what will happen is we will have \nthe fewest numbers of workers supporting the largest number of retirees \nin this country's history.\n  What was to be done? About 13 years ago, a discussion was held about \nhow do we finance that when the largest baby crop hits the retirement \nrolls and we do not have enough money. The answer was, let's accumulate \nsome surpluses in the Social Security system to be used when we need \nthem later. I do not expect there is disagreement about that, that we \nhave a circumstance where we accumulate $70 million more now than we \nneed to be put into a trust fund to be saved for the future. If there \nis disagreement, I want to hear that, but those are the facts.\n  Now, what is happening is a proposal is now made to alter the U.S. \nConstitution with this language, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, and the language says that all receipts and \nexpenditures shall be counted for purposes of completing a balanced \nbudget, and therefore the Congressional Research Service says ``because \nthe balanced budget amendment requires that the required balance be \nbetween the outlays for that year and the receipts for that year,'' the \nmoneys that we are ``saving in the surplus would not be available as a \nbalance for the payments of benefits.'' That means if we save $70 \nmillion extra this year for Social Security to be made available in the \nyear 2015 or 2020, and in the year 2020 we balance the rest of the \nbudget but want to spend that surplus we have in the Social Security \naccounts, the Congressional Research Service says you cannot do it. You \ncannot do it. This ought not be a controversial conclusion. I do not \nknow of anyone who disagrees with it. You cannot do it unless you raise \ntaxes in the rest of the budget to accommodate it.\n\n  I say if that is the case, why are we raising more money than we now \nneed in Social Security if it will not be saved and it will not be \navailable for future use?\n  I want to read to my colleagues something from the Social Security \ntrustees last year:\n\n       ``Total income for Social Security is estimated to fall \n     short of the total expenditures in the year 2019 and will \n     continue thereafter under the immediate assumptions, but in \n     this circumstance the trust funds would be redeemed over that \n     period to cover the difference until the assets are exhausted \n     in 2029.\n\n  That is what the Social Security trustees said. CRS says that cannot \nbe done because the trust funds will not be able to be used in those \nyears unless you have raised taxes on the other part of the budget or \ncut spending in the other part of the budget, and I say in the year \n2029 it would require $600 billion that year alone.\n  I have a 9-year-old son. This is not rocket science. I think he would \nunderstand that double-entry bookkeeping does not mean you can use the \nsame money twice. You cannot say I am using this money to show a \nbalanced budget and then use this money to save over here for Social \nSecurity. You do it one way or the other. You cannot do it both ways.\n  My Uncle Joe used to own a gas station. Can you imagine him coming \nhome to my Aunt Blanche and saying, ``We lost money this year, Blanche, \nbut I put away money for my employees because I bargained with them and \nI told them I put money in their retirement account. So we got money in \ntheir retirement account for their pensions. But since I lost money in \nthe service station, what I intend to do is take their money out of the \nretirement account I have put it in and use it over here so I can tell \npeople I don't have a loss on my service station anymore.'' My aunt \nwould say, ``Joe, you cannot do that. It is illegal. Somebody will send \nyou to jail for that.'' Joe would say, ``Well, the folks down there in \nWashington, DC, seem to think it is OK. They think they can take $1 \ntrillion in the first 10 years and put it first in this pocket and then \nin that pocket, thumb their suspenders and puff on their cigars and \nsay, ``We balanced the budget.''\n  Guess what? The year in which the budget is presumably balanced and \nthe year in which all of those who will\n\n[[Page S1270]]\n\nstand up on the highest desk in this Chamber and bray and bellow and \ntrumpet and talk about how they balanced the budget, I ask every \nAmerican to look at one number. What happened to the debt in that year \nin which they balance the budget? The answer: They say they balanced \nthe budget and they have to increase the Federal debt limit by $130 \nbillion, the same year in which they claim they balance the budget. \nWhy? Because the budget has been balanced.\n  And it is not just me. I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is \non the floor, he raised the same points the other day. There are \nRepublicans in the House, two or three dozen, that raised the same \npoints. I do not know how he and others will vote on final passage, but \nI say, as controversial as this is, I agree with what the Senator from \nPennsylvania said on the floor the other day. I agree with what \nCongressman Neumann and others are saying in the House. I agree with \nthe presentation I am making. This is an issue that is not \ninsignificant, $1 trillion in 10 years, and it is much more than that \nin the 20 to 25 years that you have to look out to see what will be the \nconsequence of this kind of proposal.\n  Let me frame it in a positive way. I believe we ought to balance the \nFederal budget. I will support altering the Constitution to place in \nthe Constitution a requirement to balance the Federal budget. We will \nvote on an alternative, on a substitute constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget that does that. I will offer it. I intend to vote \nfor it. I will not vote for a constitutional amendment that \naccomplishes this--that essentially reduces by 10 years the solvency of \nthe current Social Security system and guarantees that which we are \nsupposed to be saving will not be saved and that which we are supposed \nto be saving cannot, by virtue of the language of this constitutional \namendment, be available for use by Social Security recipients when it \nwas promised.\n  Sometimes I get the feeling that the only thing we do in this Chamber \nis talk to ourselves. We just talk back and forth with ``budgetspeak'' \nand language and a priesthood of dialog that only we understand and \nthat seems almost totally foreign to the American people. I will bet \nyou that with a lot of this discussion that's the case. The American \npeople, I think, want a balanced budget and should expect that we can \ndo what is necessary to balance the budget. But let me emphasize again \nthat, although I believe there is merit to alter the Constitution to \nrequire a balanced budget, if we alter the Constitution at 2:05, by \n2:10--which is 5 minutes later--we would not have changed by one penny \neither the Federal debt or Federal deficit. That will only be altered \nby decisions on taxing and spending made individually by Members of \nthis Congress, deciding what is a priority and what isn't, how much \nshould we spend or should we not spend, or how we raise revenues or how \ndon't we raise revenues. Only those decisions will bring us to a place \nwe want to be--a balanced budget that provides for the long-term \neconomic health of this country.\n  My hope is that, in the coming days, when we finish this debate, we \nwill have accomplished something in that we will all have resolved not \nonly to perhaps make a change in the Constitution, if we can reach \nagreement on how that is done, but we will have resolved that we \nshould, as men and women, balance the budget. Changing the Constitution \nis not balancing the budget. Some want to substitute that as political \nrhetoric. But, ultimately, the question of whether we balance the \nbudget will be determined by the choices that we make individually.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Connecticut on the floor. I \nwanted to say to the Senator that I used a bit of the time in the 4-\nhour block. I hope he didn't mind. I wanted to make this point. I hope \nto come back in general debate, and I hope that the Senator from Utah \nand I can engage on the consequences of this language because I think \nit is a trillion-dollar question that remains unanswered. I would like \nto have a dialog back and forth rather than just presentations that \nvanish into the air when the presentations are completed. I thank the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Sessions]. The Senator from Pennsylvania \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have checked with the managers of both \nsides and he has agreed to yield me 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent \nthat I may proceed as in morning business for a period of up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

HERMAN, TO BE SECRETARY OF LABOR\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly on the issue of the pending nomination of Ms. Alexis M. Herman \nto be Secretary of Labor, and I urge that Ms. Herman be given a hearing \non the subject so that there may be a determination, one way or the \nother, about her qualifications to be Secretary of Labor.\n  I talked at some length to Alexis M. Herman yesterday. A request had \nbeen made by the White House for me to meet with her, perhaps in my \ncapacity as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee that has \njurisdiction over the Department of Labor. And I met with Ms. Herman in \nthe context of a number of questions that have been raised about her \nqualifications to be Secretary of Labor.\n  There has been an issue raised about her handling of her position as \nliaison for public matters in the Office of Public Liaison, as to \nwhether there had been some activities that went over the line in \npolitical activities or fundraising. I questioned Ms. Herman about that \nat some length, although not in a dispositive form. But it seems to me \nthat she is entitled to be heard on the subject and to have a decision \nmade one way or the other about whether she is qualified or \ndisqualified.\n  I questioned her about the circumstances where there was a coffee, \nwhich had started out in her department, where she had issued an \ninvitation to Mr. Gene Ludwig, who was Comptroller of the Currency, to \na meeting with bankers, at a time when she thought it was going to be a \nsubstantive meeting and it would not involve fundraising. Later, she \nfound out that there were individuals from the Democratic National \nCommittee who were involved, and she then did not attend the meeting \nherself, but had not informed Mr. Ludwig about the nature of the \nmeeting in order to withdraw the invitation to him.\n  There have been other questions raised about the Anti-Deficiency Act, \nand perhaps other matters. But I think it is very important when \nsomeone is nominated for a position and there is public controversy and \npublic comment, that that individual have his or her ``day in court'' \nto have a determination made as to whether she, or he, may be qualified \nto handle the position.\n  I thought it was very unfortunate, when Prof. Lani Guinier was \nnominated for a key position, Assistant Attorney General in the \nDepartment of Justice, that her nomination was withdrawn without having \nan opportunity for her to be heard. At that time, I met with her and \nread her writings and I thought she was qualified. But I thought, \nsurely, there should have been a determination by the committee. I \nrecall the withdrawal of the nomination of Zoe Baird, who was up for \nAttorney General of the United States, and I recollect when Judge \nGinsburg had been nominated for the Supreme Court; neither of them had \nfinished their hearings. I think it is very important, in the context \nwhere we are trying to bring good people into Government and, \ninevitably, they are under a microscope, which is the way it is, and \nthat is understandable. But they ought to have a chance to be heard and \nhave their day in court and have a chance to defend themselves and have \nthe public know what has gone on. If they pass, fine, and if they do \nnot, so be it. But they ought to have that opportunity.\n  I respected the decision made by Judge Bork back in 1987 when he \nwanted the matter to go forward and to come to a vote so that there \nwould be a determination, because I think it is very unfortunate and \nunwise that when somebody allows their name to be put forward and you \nhave these allegations in the newspapers about misconduct or \nimpropriety, the impression is left with the public that that is, in \nfact, the conclusion, if the White House withdraws\n\n[[Page S1271]]\n\nthe name--as the White House did with Prof. Lani Guinier--or if the \nperson doesn't move forward to a hearing.\n  I talked to my colleague, Senator Jeffords, who chairs the Labor \nCommittee, and Senator Jeffords has advised me that he is reviewing the \noutstanding questions, and the prospects are that there will be a \nhearing. But after meeting with Ms. Herman and having some say over her \nDepartment's activities in my capacity as chairman of the \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I did want to voice my sentiments on this \nsubject to urge that her nomination go forward. I do not have a final \nview as to the merits, yes or no. But I think she is entitled to be \nheard.\n  Aside from the allegations that have been made about her, she has a \nvery distinguished record. She is a graduate of Xavier University and \nhas worked in the public and private sectors. She has quite a \ndistinguished record as a businesswoman, has served in the \nadministration of President Carter, and has served in the current \nadministration. She may well be qualified, or the contrary may be the \ncase. But I think it ought to be heard so she can have a determination \non the merits. I thank my colleagues, Senator Hatch and Senator Dodd, \nfor allowing me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before turning to the subject of my \namendment here, let me commend my colleague from Pennsylvania for his \ncomments. I associate myself with his remarks regarding Alexis Herman \nand the hope expressed by him that a hearing will be held promptly for \nAlexis Herman. She deserves that hearing.\n  I have known Alexis Herman for some time. She is eminently qualified, \nMr. President, to fulfill the position of Secretary of Labor. There \nhave been issues raised, and the purpose for which we have hearings is \nto allow those issues to be aired and to give a person an opportunity \nto respond. In the absence of that hearing, of course, the allegations \nremain. In many instances, as the Senator from Pennsylvania has pointed \nout, there is never the kind of opportunity to respond with the same \nvoice and the same positioning with which the allegations are \noftentimes made.\n  Under our system it is absolutely essential in my view that she be \ngiven that opportunity. I am totally confident that she will respond to \nthose issues when she is asked publicly to respond to them. It is part \nof the process here going back years that when people are nominated for \nhigh office in any administration they are always advised not to \nrespond or comment but to save their comments for a hearing. Oftentimes \nit happens that the nominee is left in the position of having to face \nan assault of questions that are raised and never gets the opportunity \nto respond because you are advised to the contrary. Then for whatever \nreason, if you never get that hearing, they stay out there.\n  So I applaud my colleague from Pennsylvania for coming to the floor \nthis afternoon and raising this issue. I join with him in urging that \nour committee--and I sit on the Labor Committee--set up a hearing as \nsoon as possible and move forward. Then, as the Senator from \nPennsylvania has pointed out, the committee and/or this body will \nexpress its opinion one way or the other. But we will resolve the \nmatter and not leave the individual out there to hang, if you will, in \nlimbo. With all of the appropriate suggestions that the Senator from \nPennsylvania has made, as we try to attract people to come serve in our \nGovernment and they watch examples like this, it is very difficult to \nconvince people to step forward when they see what can happen to \nsomeone who is, in my view, entirely innocent of any of the allegations \nraised but never gets the opportunity to address them.\n  So I applaud my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1270-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1271-S1296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 4\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the Dodd amendment No. 4, with the time between \nnow and 5:30 p.m. divided with 107 minutes to Senator Hatch and 95 \nminutes to Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment I have \noffered here this afternoon. We have several hours of debate. It may \nnot be necessary to consume all of that time. I will notify my \ncolleagues. Others may want to come over and address the issue. \nAlthough we have set a time of 5:30 p.m. for a vote, we may find \nourselves having exhausted all of the brilliance on both sides of this \namendment and able to move to a vote earlier than that. It would take \nunanimous consent to vote earlier, but that may happen at some time \nhere this afternoon.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, let me state once again what this \namendment does. I urge my colleagues and others to pay attention. I \nwill put aside the debate of whether or not we ought to have a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. That matter has been \ndebated and will be debated over the next several days.\n  The amendment that I raise, Mr. President, does not address the \nunderlying question of whether or not we ought to have a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. But it addresses section 5, and \nsection 5 only, of the proposed amendment. It raises what I believe to \nbe a very legitimate issue in dealing with the national security of \nthis country.\n  This is an amendment that I offer which you could support and do no \ndamage--in fact, I would think strengthen--the argument in support of \nthe constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. I myself have \nserious underlying problems with the constitutional amendment. I do not \nwant my colleagues to have any illusions about that. But I am going to \nput aside that debate and ask my colleagues to draw their attention to \nsection 5 and an amendment that I will offer that I think addresses a \nlegitimate concern.\n  My amendment corrects two serious flaws in this section. Let me read \nthis section, if I can. Section 5 of the proposed amendment, not my \namendment, the proposed constitutional amendment, says:\n\n       The Congress may waive the provisions of this article \n     for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in \n     effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for \n     any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security and is so declared by \n     a joint resolution adopted by a majority of the whole \n     number of each House which becomes law.\n\n  First of all, this most important section currently contains \nlanguage, in my view, that would seriously undermine--the distinguished \nPresiding Officer is a former Attorney General, and someone who has had \na serious amount of experience in judicial matters will appreciate that \nevery word in the constitutional amendment is not a casual word. These \nwords must be selected very, very carefully. So I do not treat this \nlightly at all.\n  ``A declaration of war''--these are the words that are most of \nconcern to me--and ``the United States is engaged in a military \nconflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security . . .''\n  The provisions of the balanced budget are waived only if war is \ndeclared, or if the United States is ``engaged.'' The balanced budget \namendment is quite clear in specifying that our Nation must be engaged \nin military conflict before a waiver can be granted.\n  The problem, as I see it, is that prudent foreign policy often \nrequires responding to serious threats before we actually become \ninvolved in military conflict. Yet, the language of this amendment is \n``engaged''--not ``might be engaged or there is a threat of \nengagement''--but rather is ``engaged'' in military conflict.\n  Throughout our history this Nation has often found itself necessarily \nengaged in conflict but yet in situations where immediate action was \nessential. The gulf war is one example that immediately comes to mind. \nI will discuss that example and others in the debate shortly.\n  My amendment removes this section 5 and would lift the provisions of \nthe balanced budget amendment under a declaration of war or if the \nUnited States faces an imminent and serious military threat to national \nsecurity. The requirement of being engaged is dropped.\n  The amendment that I offer would also clearly define the role of \nCongress in certifying the existence of an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat. Under the current language, in section 5 the courts \ncould conceivably be\n\n[[Page S1272]]\n\ncalled on to determine whether or not an imminent and serious military \nthreat to national security exists.\n  My amendment--the amendment that I offer and is at the desk--makes \nclear that a resolution passed by Congress is the sole requirement for \ncertifying that such a threat exists.\n  Finally, the amendment that I have offered restores a reasonable \nstandard for voting. The balanced budget amendment creates a \ncumbersome, I believe, standard for passing the resolution certifying \nthat a military threat exists. It says a ``majority of the whole number \nof each House'' must pass the resolution. In the case of the U.S. \nSenate, this means that 51 Senators would have to vote in favor of the \nresolution, no matter how many Senators were present and voting. This \ncould be absolutely critical, particularly in a time of national \ncrisis. When not all Senators are able to reach Washington on short \nnotice, for instance, we could be prevented by our own Constitution \nfrom quickly and properly responding to an international emergency.\n  Furthermore, the ``whole number'' standard leaves open the question, \nI point out, of whether or not the Vice President would be allowed to \ncast a vote should we arrive at a tie of 50-50. My amendment alleviates \nthis problem by requiring a simple majority of those present and voting \nfor passage of the waiver resolution.\n  Mr. President, I am well aware of the heartfelt support, as I \nmentioned at the outset, of these remarks on the part of my colleagues \nwho are squarely for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I also know that many of us--myself included, clearly--have \nunderlying problems with the whole balanced budget amendment. But I \nthink we should all be able to agree, regardless of where we are \npositioned on the issue of a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, we should all be able to agree that any amendment to the \nConstitution should in no way shackle our country in time of an \nemergency.\n  The amendment that I offer, Mr. President, I think helps ensure that \nthe Nation remains prepared and able to respond in time of an \ninternational crisis.\n  For these reasons, I hope that it will enjoy the support of a broad \nmajority of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, I want to cite the language of the amendment that we \nare offering.\n  Let me recite the copy of the amendment that I am offering:\n\n       On page 3, line 7, strike beginning with ``is'' through \n     line 11 and insert, ``faces an imminent and serious military \n     threat to national security as declared by a joint \n     resolution.''\n\n  The point being here, if you are not actually engaged, or you don't \nhave a declaration of war and the Nation, in preparation for such a \nconflict, wants to exceed the balanced budget requirements, we should \nbe able to do that.\n  I do not know of anyone who would believe that, as important as this \namendment is, it should have a higher priority than the national \nsecurity interests of the country. Yet, my fear is based on the exact \nlanguage of section 5--that that is the problem we have posed before \nus. If it requires a declaration of war, or requires, as the language \nreads, ``is engaged in a conflict,'' it seems to me that we would have \nto wait for one of those two conditions to be met in order to waive any \nconstitutional requirements prohibiting deficit financing.\n  And so I would urge the adoption of this amendment which says, \n``faces an imminent and serious military threat to national security as \ndeclared by a joint resolution,'' so that we do not allow the courts to \ndecide. You can imagine a debate going on here about whether or not an \nimminent and serious threat existed, someone runs to the Federal courts \nand says, ``I don't think it is an imminent and serious military \nthreat,'' and we have a panel of judges deciding whether or not that \nthreat exists. I do not think any of us want to see that happen. So the \njoint resolution allows that a simple majority of Senators would be \nable to declare the threat in order to waive the provisions of the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, that there are historical \nexamples for this that I think point out the problem. They are \nhistorical and they may be 100 years old or 20 years old. None of us \ncan say with any certainty what we may face tomorrow or next week or \nnext year or the next century. But I will cite five examples to point \nout the problems.\n  Imagine, if you will, that this section in a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget were in place at the time we faced these five \ncrises. Ask yourself how would we have responded, what would have been \nthe implications, putting aside whether or not you were for or against \nthe particular issue at hand.\n  The gulf war is one; lend-lease, back in the late 1930's, early \n1940's, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, the Panama crisis back under \nthe Bush administration, and the defense buildup during the Reagan \nadministration.\n  Let me cite, first of all, the gulf war example. Saddam Hussein, as \nmany in this Chamber will recall and, invaded Kuwait on August 1, 1990. \nWe were running a deficit, I would point out, Mr. President, at that \ntime of $221 billion, on August 1, 1990, putting us in gross violation \nrequirements of the balanced budget amendment. There were only 2 months \nleft in the fiscal year, no time to adjust spending or to raise taxes, \nI might point out. We were not certain ourselves how we were going to \nrespond to that situation, but an invasion of Kuwait clearly had \nhappened. Saddam Hussein was threatening not only Kuwait where he had \ninvaded but Saudi Arabia, and clearly our security I think. By \ncontrolling Saudi Arabia, of course, he would have become a dominant \nforce in the gulf, and the obvious implications of that for the United \nStates and the West are clear.\n  We had to deploy troops to protect our allies and our security, and \nthe President did so. But we were not engaged in a conflict, and we had \nnot gone through the lengthy process of making a declaration of war. It \nwas merely a question of whether or not we were going to be able to \nplace those troops immediately in the Middle East in anticipation \nbecause an imminent threat certainly occurred, but we were not engaged. \nIt was not until January 16, 1991 that we began the air war. The \ninitial deployment to defend Saudi Arabia, Desert Shield as it was \ncalled, was 100,000 troops. The eventual deployment to prepare to \ninvade Kuwait was 500,000 troops. The total cost was $71 billion. The \ndeficit, as I pointed out, was $221 billion.\n  Our action, I would argue, could not have happened under a balanced \nbudget amendment under section 5 because we were not engaged in \nmilitary conflict. A resolution allowing military action to force out \nHussein passed the Senate in January 52 to 47, after a lengthy debate \nabout whether or not we ought to use military force immediately.\n  My colleague from Utah certainly was here and remembers that debate. \nMy colleagues on both sides of the aisle who supported the action in \nthe gulf ought to remember this and remember what happened.\n  If the balanced budget amendment had been in effect in 1990, a \nminority of Senators could have blocked those Senators who supported \naction and we would not have been able to have the waiver. I do not \nknow what the implications would have been.\n  In 20-20 hindsight, we say, look, it was clear. As things worked out, \nthere was an imminent threat. There was a debate here, heated debate in \nthe country about what our action should be. You can imagine in \naddition to the complicated questions of whether or not we ought to \nrespond, we would have had to go through and waive constitutional \namendment requirements. This would have been with all of the people in \nthis country divided, as many were, over whether or not we ought to be \ninvolved in the Middle East, putting United States servicemen and women \nat risk. With all the questions, we then either would have had to go \nthrough a process of declaring war, which we have not done in 55 years, \nor go through a process of waiting for an actual engagement to occur. \nAs section 5 says, engaged--not likely to be engaged, not might be \nengaged, not a threat of engagement. It says you must be engaged.\n  So my amendment, as I pointed out earlier, which talks about the \nimminent threat, facing an imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security, is a far better standard and test, it seems to me, \nin order for us to respond to those situations.\n\n[[Page S1273]]\n\n  Let me cite the example, if I can, of lend-lease. There is no one in \nthis Chamber who was serving at the time. Our colleague from South \nCarolina, Senator Thurmond, of course, remembers this debate, I am \nsure, very vividly, as someone who served in World War II, I believe \nthe only remaining colleague of ours who served in World War II.\n  Britain was in a crisis. We were highly divided in this country in \nthe late 1930's as to whether or not the United States ought to be \ninvolved. In fact, I think surveys at the time indicated most Americans \nwere opposed to the United States being involved in a European \nconflict. We had in fact America First groups. Charles Lindbergh, I \nrecall, was a leading proponent of the United States staying out of \nWorld War II. The conflict in Europe was raging. So we had a \nsignificant debate in this country over whether or not we ought to be \ninvolved.\n  I do not know of anyone today who would argue that the leadership of \nFranklin Roosevelt, putting together the creative lend-lease program, \nproviding the military assistance Britain needed in its great hour of \ncrisis, did not make all the difference in the world. And but for the \nlend-lease program, the map of Europe might look substantially \ndifferent, not to mention what might have occurred elsewhere had we not \ntaken that action.\n  We were not engaged in the conflict, under the standard asked to be \nmet in this balanced budget amendment. You were not likely to get a \ndeclaration of war in 1939 given the divisions in the country. And yet \nwe had a deficit. Now, it was not a huge deficit. It was, in March of \nthat year, 1941, $4.9 billion. It sounds pretty small by today's \nstandards, but as a percentage of the budget it was probably not \nsubstantially different than today. And even with someone with the \nprowess of Franklin Roosevelt, can you imagine if we had to go then \nthrough the waiver process in order to get the kind of resources \nnecessary. I do not want to dwell on this particular instance but \nnonetheless I think the point is quite clear. We would have required a \nwaiver. We were highly divided as a country. As it turned out, lend-\nlease got a lot of support. In the vote that occurred, actually a \nmajority, a substantial majority here supported lend-lease. But \ncertainly those who are students of history recall the great division \nin the country on this issue complicating the problem, and the \ndifficulty that Franklin Roosevelt would have had in responding to that \nsituation.\n  The Cuban missile crisis, in 1962. Again, we were not engaged. There \nwas clearly a threat, in my view, to the security of the United States. \nWe were not going to declare war at that particular point at all. The \nPresident had to respond to that situation. We had a deficit of $7.1 \nbillion in 1962. But under the standards as laid out in the balanced \nbudget amendment, the proposed language in section 5, the buildup that \nPresident Kennedy initiated to respond to that would have required us \nto go through all these difficulties of requiring waivers. Or you would \nhave had to have the courts decide if in fact it met the standard of an \nimminent and serious military threat.\n  The invasion of Panama, again, another example. The deficit in 1989 \nwas $153 billion. The cost of the operation was $163 million. Clearly \nwe would have had to go through this process as well.\n  And the Reagan years of the buildup in defense. Again, you could \nargue--certainly everyone would have, I think--that there was an \nimminent danger of conflict with the Soviet Union. We were not going to \ndeclare war against them. We were not engaged in a military conflict \nagainst them. We had sizable deficits, and we increased defense \nspending between 1980 and 1988 from $134 billion to $290 billion. Of \ncourse, we were accumulating $1.5 trillion in debt at the same time. \nThe amendment says: Declaration of war, engaged in a conflict. Many \nargue today the ultimate collapse of the Soviet Union was a direct \nresult of our buildup at that time; that it was the Soviets' inability \nto meet that buildup, although they tried, that caused the kind of \neconomic collapse that resulted in the downfall of the Soviet Union. \nYet, we would have gone through this process, and you can only imagine \nthe debate--and there was a significant one, by the way, over whether \nor not we ought to support that buildup or not--you can imagine what \nwould have been heard around these Chambers about the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget and whether or not we ought to be doing \nthis. It could have complicated that process seriously.\n\n  I think you could have met the test in 1980 through 1988, of saying \nthe Soviet Union posed an imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security, and then had a joint resolution passed, as my \namendment that I am offering today would have allowed us to do, that \nwould have gotten you through the process. That is why I am offering \nthe amendment. I am not just striking section 5, I am offering new \nlanguage as an alternative.\n  So the Reagan buildup, I think, is another good example of what could \nhave occurred. I am not arguing for or against it, where people were on \nthat issue, but just imagine the kind of debate that would have ensued.\n  Let me also point up another argument here that I think deserves \nmention. One of the difficulties in preparing, of course, is you do not \nwant to give your potential adversary any additional opportunities to \ntake advantage of what is inherently a process that is slow in this \ncountry, our legislative form of government, our democracy. If a \npotential opponent knows that we have this balanced budget amendment, \nwith section 5, that requires a declaration of war, that we have to be \nengaged, that we need waivers with a whole House voting, 218 House \nMembers, 51 Senators, that is a pretty significant advantage to give. \nThat is one more set of hurdles that we have to go over in order to \nrespond.\n  I do not think that is engaging in hyperbole, Mr. President. Why \nwould we in any way try to make it more cumbersome for the Commander in \nChief of this country--not necessarily this one, because this amendment \nwill not go into effect until long after this President has left \noffice, but some future Chief Executive of our Nation--to be able to \nrespond to those situations? I am not saying they ought to be able to \ndo it without any check by the Congress, but I think stating the \ncountry needs only to face an imminent threat and then get a joint \nresolution ought to be enough to get a waiver of this amendment. To \ninsist upon a declaration of war or actual engagement seems to me to be \nsetting far too high a standard when the national security interests of \nthis country could be in jeopardy. Yet, that is exactly what we are \ndoing with this amendment.\n  So, for those reasons I hope my colleagues will look favorably upon \nthis amendment, even if you are for the underlying amendment. I think \nthis improves the underlying amendment. Some have suggested we should \nnot have offered this amendment because, for those of us who have \nserious doubts about setting fiscal policy in the Constitution, the \nadoption of this amendment certainly takes away one of, I think, the \nmost significant arguments against the balanced budget amendment. That \nis that we place the language of this amendment in a higher priority, \nin a higher standard, than the national security interests of the \ncountry.\n  I see my colleague from Michigan is here. I have some more comments I \nwould like to make in a few moments, but unless my colleague from Utah, \nwho may want to be heard at this particular moment, so desires--I have \njust been informed, by the way, I made the mistake of saying ``Senator \nThurmond,'' and I have quickly been informed by several offices, Mr. \nPresident, here--not the senior Senator from Utah, but Senator Bumpers, \nSenator Chafee, Senator Warner, Senator Inouye, Senator Akaka, and \nSenator Hollings, Glenn, Helms, Roth, and Stevens have been ringing up \nthe phones here. I apologize to my colleagues. I thought they were much \nyounger than that, and assumed they were. How am I doing here? Am I \nrecovering from that faux pas?\n\n  However you want to do this. I will yield the floor at this point, \nand, obviously, the Senator from Utah has priority.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand the distinguished Senator from Michigan would \nlike to make his remarks. I have some remarks I would like to make \nimmediately thereafter, so I ask unanimous consent I defer to him so he \ncan make his remarks in support of the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\nConnecticut, and then I would like to proceed immediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. How much time does the Senator request?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask how much time the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent he be permitted to speak for 8 \nminutes and then the floor return to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I support the Dodd amendment because it would simplify \nthe national security exception to the balanced budget amendment before \nus, and it would do so in a common-sense way that I would think both \nsupporters and opponents of the balanced budget amendment should be \nable to support.\n  As currently drafted, the balanced budget amendment before us would \nlimit the national security exception to cases in which the United \nStates is already ``engaged in military conflict.'' This language would \nseriously limit our defense options by precluding the use of the \nexception to prepare for imminent military conflict.\n  The way the amendment before us is written, our troops must actually \nbe engaged in battle in order for the exception to apply. The Dodd \namendment addresses this problem by extending the waiver authority to \nany case in which the United States ``faces an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security, as declared by a joint resolution \nof Congress,'' even if we are not yet engaged in military conflict.\n  Former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry opposed the balanced budget \namendment largely because, in his words, of ``the total lack of \nflexibility we would have in dealing with contingencies.''\n  Here is what Secretary Perry said:\n       Even if threats to America's global interests were \n     increasing or our forces deteriorating, the BBA could lead to \n     deep defense cuts. . . .\n       The fact that these consequences could be avoided with \n     three-fifths approval of each house of Congress is no \n     safeguard. Preservation of an adequate defense posture would \n     become dependent on exceptional political efforts. . . . Even \n     when a three-fifths majority minus one in either house \n     believed that BBA cuts were unjustified, the minority view \n     would prevail. Not exactly ideal for the world's most \n     powerful democracy and best hope for future peace and \n     stability.\n\n  This is not an academic issue--the security of our country could be \nat stake in a very real way. As former Secretary of Defense James \nSchlesinger testified at the same hearing, ``we would have had great \ndifficult winning World War II'' without significant deficit spending \nin the years before we entered the conflict. Dr. Schlesinger explained \nas follows:\n\n       You will recall that the turning point in the Pacific war \n     was the Battle of Midway. The ships, the carriers that won \n     the Battle of Midway were built as a result of deficit \n     spending during the latter part of the 1930's. It was the \n     consequence of legislation on naval construction under \n     conditions of severe deficit that were embodied in the \n     Vinson-Trammell legislation.\n       At Midway the battle was won by the Yorktown, launched in \n     1937 after that legislation, the Enterprise, launched in \n     1938, and the Hornet in 1941. Those ships would not have been \n     available under strict interpretation of this amendment. Even \n     the battle of the Coral Sea might have been lost in the \n     Pacific war. . . . [A]lmost all of the capital ships of the \n     U.S. Navy had been laid down before the end of 1941, all of \n     our battleships and virtually all of our carriers, the Iowa \n     class, most of the Essex class, and the like.\n       . . . I point this out because this Nation was not at war \n     until December 8, 1941, and the relief that was provided in \n     this amendment would not have been applicable until December \n     8, 1941.\n\n  Mr. President, the appropriations bills that funded the construction \nof the ships that won the Second World War were all enacted at a time \nwhen we were running record peacetime deficits, and I say record \ndeficits. The Senator from Connecticut made reference to some of these \ndeficits, and they sound small by current standards, but by any kind of \napples-and-apples comparison, they are very large.\n  In 1939, the deficit was $2.8 billion, which was over 30 percent of \nour total outlays. The deficit now, as a percentage of our outlays, is \nsomething like 7 percent. But in 1939, the $2.8 billion deficit was a \nsignificant percentage of our outlays, over 30 percent.\n  In 1940, the deficit was $2.9 billion, over 30 percent of our \noutlays. In 1941, the deficit was $4.9 billion, as the Senator from \nConnecticut said, and that was about 36 percent of our outlays. Our \ndeficit now, as a percentage of outlays, is only about 7 percent. \nPlenty large, but still a lot less than it was in those years.\n  So we would have been in a situation in those years where 60 percent, \nor three-fifths of the votes, would have been required in order to do \ndeficit financing for those classes of ships which won those battles \nwhich won World War II. And that is why Dr. Schlesinger's comments \nabout the outcome of World War II are so significant. These are real-\nworld battles which are determined by those votes.\n  The Naval Act of 1938, which authorized construction of every \ncategory of warships--3 battleships, 2 carriers, 9 cruisers, 23 \ndestroyers and 9 submarines--passed the Senate on May 3, 1938, with 56 \nvotes. Now, that is two votes short of the three-fifths majority that \nwould have been required by the balanced budget amendment, had it been \nin effect at that time.\n  So the stakes involved in the Dodd amendment are very significant.\n  I wonder if the Senator will yield me 2 additional minutes, if that \nwill be all right with the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, those two votes, which determined whether \nwe would build those ships, had a huge effect on the outcome of this \nwar. There is no reason, if we are serious about protecting our \nnational security, why we should require that we actually be engaged in \na conflict. If a joint resolution of the Congress says that conflict is \nimminent, which it was in 1938 and 1939 and 1940, surely that ought to \nbe enough to allow us to act by majority vote in order to save this \ncountry.\n  Finally, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, the same \nkind of issues could have been raised during the gulf war that were \nraised by Dr. Schlesinger relative to World War II.\n  If I still have time left, I want to finish with one other point that \nthe Dodd amendment corrects. How much time does this Senator have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One more minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The Dodd amendment addresses a second problem with the text of the \nbalanced budget amendment. The joint resolution, as currently drafted, \nrequires that the United States be engaged in military conflict which \n``causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security \nand is so declared'' by Congress.\n  That word ``and'' in the current language creates two requirements: \nFirst, that there be a declaration by Congress and, second, that there \nbe an imminent and serious threat to national security. In other words, \nthe word ``and,'' creates a second requirement--the actual existence of \na threat--which opens this up to judicial review and creates a real \nproblem which is corrected by the Dodd amendment.\n  The last thing that we need at a time when our Nation faces an \nimminent and serious threat is to place in question the legitimacy of \nFederal spending to meet that threat. When our national security is at \nstake, we cannot afford to wait for the courts to give a stamp of \napproval to emergency spending programs. The Dodd amendment would \naddress this problem by making it clear that a congressional \ndeclaration that an imminent and serious threat to the national \nsecurity would alone be sufficient to trigger the exception.\n  Mr. President, most of us hopefully want to bring the budget back \ninto balance, but we must achieve that goal without undermining our \nability to defend our vital national interests in the face of imminent \nthreats or danger. Regardless whether we support the balanced budget \namendment or oppose it, I would hope that we could all support the Dodd \namendment and ensure that we have the flexibility we need to protect \nour national security where we face an imminent and serious threat.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I did not realize the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut had not finished his remarks. I will be happy \nto allow him to finish.\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. No, go ahead.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I will proceed then on our time. I have \nto oppose this amendment proposed by the Senator from Connecticut, and \nI hope all of my colleagues will do the same.\n  Senator Dodd has offered an amendment to section 5 of the balanced \nbudget amendment. I might add, section 5 is a very important part of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. We realize \nthat protecting the security of the Nation is the most important \nresponsibility that we have. Indeed, it is the most important duty for \nany government. Thus, we have dealt with that problem in section 5 of \nthe balanced budget amendment. In that provision, we allow the \nrequirements of this amendment to be waived in two circumstances. One \nis ``any year in which a declaration of war is in effect.'' The other \nis when the Nation is ``engaged in a military conflict which causes an \nimminent and serious military threat to national security and is so \ndeclared by a joint resolution adopted by a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House, which becomes law.''\n  Those are two very important protections. They protect us from all \nthat the distinguished Senator has been talking about, and, frankly, \nhis amendment, I think, gums this up pretty badly.\n  The balanced budget amendment, therefore, deals with the two \nsituations in the modern era in which the Nation faces a challenge to \nits ability to survive, situations in which there is a declared war \nbetween this Nation and another country and situations in which there \nis a military conflict that is unaccompanied by a declaration of war, \nbut that nonetheless causes an imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security.\n  In those circumstances the authors of the balanced budget amendment \nbelieve that the Nation may need greater flexibility than the amendment \notherwise allows. At the same time, the carefully balanced text of that \nprovision makes sure that the circumstances in which such a waiver can \nbe more easily accomplished are limited only to those situations in \nwhich such a waiver is necessary.\n  I have the greatest respect for my colleague from Connecticut, \nSenator Dodd. We are very close friends, but his amendment would upset \nthe balance that we have achieved in section 5.\n  Senator Dodd's amendment would permit a waiver of the balanced budget \namendment whenever we face a serious military threat by a simple joint \nresolution, but he explicitly removes the requirement that the \nresolution become law. That is troublesome in this context. Ordinarily, \nbeing silent about such a matter would be of no consequence. After all, \nany Member of this Chamber, like any Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, can introduce a joint resolution or can submit a \nresolution on this matter. The real work comes in getting a bill or a \nresolution passed. But here, by removing the requirement from section 5 \nof the BBA, [the balanced budget amendment], that the joint resolution \n``become law,'' Senator Dodd's amendment could be read by an activist \ncourt as eliminating the requirement that the resolution actually \nbecome law.\n  Thus, in order to waive the balanced budget amendment under the Dodd \namendment, the President would not have to sign the resolution, would \nnot have to put himself on the line, or herself on the line, and \nneither House of Congress would have to pass or even vote on the \nresolution. No committee would have to mark up the resolution. No \nhearings need be held. Apparently, all that it would require is that \nany Member of either body merely introduce a joint resolution declaring \nthat the United States faces a serious military threat.\n  That sole action would apparently suffice to waive the balanced \nbudget rule for the entire fiscal year under the Dodd amendment. \nClearly, that would be a bizarre state of affairs. I would be much more \nimpressed with this amendment if it was sponsored by those who \nliterally have been long-time supporters of a balanced budget \namendment. Literally, this is an amendment that looks as though it is \nmaking every attempt to gut the balanced budget amendment.\n  Madam President, both the balanced budget amendment waiver for \nnational security and the Dodd amendment use the threshold phrase of \n``an imminent and serious military threat to national security'' as \nbeing a situation in which the balanced budget amendment requirements \ncould be waived. Even though both the balanced budget amendment and the \nDodd amendment used that phrase, there are two critical differences \nbetween the two.\n  The first critical difference is the following: Unlike the Dodd \namendment, this amendment that is currently pending, the balanced \nbudget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, that we want to pass, also \nrequires that the United States actually be ``engaged in military \nconflict'' in order to waive the balanced budget rule by less than a \nthree-fifths vote. By contrast, the Dodd amendment does not require \nthat this Nation be engaged in such military conflict. In fact, the \nDodd amendment would delete the term ``military conflict'' from the \nfinal balanced budget amendment.\n\n  That alone is a significant difference between Senate Joint \nResolution 1 and the amendment offered by our distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I understand what a military conflict is. It involves \nshooting, combat, or the like. By contrast, the term ``threat'' is far \nmore expansive and far more pliable. That term embraces a broad range \nof situations that could fall far short of the type of circumstance in \nwhich section 5 of Senate Joint Resolution 1 as presently written would \nallow the balanced budget amendment's requirements to be waived.\n  It is easy to imagine various events that could occur that would \ntrigger the waiver provisions of the permissive Dodd amendment. For \nexample, last year China fired several missiles in the vicinity of \nTaiwan, a valuable friend of the United States, as is China. That could \nhave triggered the provisions of the Dodd amendment if somebody merely \nfiled a resolution, pursuant to the Dodd amendment. The United States \nalso has been witness to oil embargoes which also could trigger the \nDodd amendment in the future. These events and others--you can go down \na long list--would have allowed the Congress to easily waive the \nrequirements of the balanced budget amendment if the Dodd amendment \nbecame part of the final, passed balanced budget amendment.\n  Indeed, ever since the advent and proliferation of nuclear weapons, \nit could be cogently argued that the United States has ``faced an \nimminent and serious military threat to national security.'' You can \nargue that every year in a sense. And that threat would be presented \nnot just by the republics of the former Soviet Union or by China, which \nare nuclear powers, but also by other countries that may be on the cusp \nof developing nuclear weapons, chemical weapons, biological weapons, \nand so forth, by terrorist nations, to say nothing of any other weapons \nthat may come along. So anyone who sought refuge or seeks refuge from \nthe tough choices necessary to balance the budget could invoke this \nthreat and waive the balanced budget rule. So it would never be \neffective, that is, if the Dodd amendment is adopted. That is just as \nclear as the amendment.\n  The second difference between the balanced budget amendment, Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, the amendment we are trying to pass as written, and \nthe Dodd amendment is closely related to the first. The balanced budget \namendment requires that the military conflict cause the imminent and \nserious military threat to national security. That would be the only \ncircumstance under which the balanced budget amendment's requirements \ncould be waived. The existence of a military conflict, therefore, is \nnot sufficient by itself to allow Congress to escape the requirements \nof the balanced budget amendment. No. That military conflict also must \nhave a particular effect; namely an imminent and serious military \nthreat to national security.\n  These two requirements in Senate Joint Resolution 1, Madam President, \nwhich the distinguished Senator from Connecticut would like to amend \nwith this permissive language, are two important requirements. As much \nas we pray that these events do not occur, we must face the reality \nthat there may be times when our Nation is at war. We also must face \nthe reality that there may be times when our Nation is embroiled in a \nmilitary conflict imminently threatening national security\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\nbut unaccompanied by a formal declaration of war, such as occurred \nduring the gulf war. When either such event occurs, the Nation and the \nCongress may need greater flexibility than the balanced budget \namendment would allow. I am sure we all agree that protecting the \nsurvival and safety of our Nation is our most pressing responsibility.\n  Senator Dodd's proposal does not serve these goals. His amendment is \nnot designed to allow the military to deal with threats to national \nsecurity that do not rise to the level already discussed by me. Nor is \nhis amendment limited to permitting the military to increase spending \nto respond to such a threat. No. His amendment would waive all the \nrequirements of the balanced budget amendment even though Congress has \nnot declared war and even though the President has not committed our \nArmed Forces to a military conflict. His amendment provides an escape \nhatch for all other--for all other--situations.\n\n  In short, Madam President, the Dodd amendment is a gigantic loophole. \nIts effect is to weaken and confuse the standard by which the balanced \nbudget amendment may be waived and thus weakens the balanced budget \namendment itself. In this age, it is well established that nations with \ngreater economic power stand a much better chance of prevailing in \nsustained military conflicts. There is nothing that would be better for \nour economic strength than to pass Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  If we pass this loophole offered by the Senator from Connecticut, it \nwill be abused and thus allow our debt to continue to increase. In \nyears when we should be in balance, the debt will continue to pile up. \nOur children will be saddled with even more debt, and we will be \nwoefully unprepared as a nation if it is ever necessary to defend our \nliberty in the future.\n  By the terms of the President's proposed budget, we would spend \nnearly as much on net interest in the debt next year as we will on the \ndefense needs of our Nation--just to pay the interest on the debt. That \nmakes the need for the balanced budget amendment about as clear as it \ncan be.\n  If we continue to allow this debt to skyrocket, if we put loopholes \nsuch as this into the balanced budget amendment, if we do not stop this \nfiscal insanity that currently pervades our Nation, we will simply not \nhave the economic strength to stand on our own militarily or to protect \nour interests in times of threat. There is nothing better for our \nNation's defense than to adopt Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced \nbudget amendment, and be certain that we will have the economics \nnecessary to keep our military the best equipped, best trained force in \nthe world.\n  Indeed, the Dodd amendment could be abused in a way that hurts our \nmilitary preparedness. Congress could purposely underfund the military \nat the beginning of the fiscal year to use the extra funds for other \nprograms.\n  In fact, I suspect that is what is really deep down behind this. If \nwe can waive the balanced budget for almost any reason that we call a \nthreat to our national security, without the constraints that we have \nwritten in section 5, which is what the Dodd amendment would do, then \nthose who want that to happen and want that loophole so that we can \nwaive it any time we want to under almost any circumstances could spend \nmore on liberal spending programs rather than really doing for the \nmilitary what needs to be done.\n  Our amendment requires them to do what is right for the national \nsecurity interests of this country, if this matter is going to be \nwaived. It requires the President and the Congress to take some \nresponsibility in that matter, and it does not just waive all these \nobligations that we think have to be there.\n  But under the Dodd amendment, they could underfund the military, \nknowing that during the course of the year they could take any \ninternational conflict and use it as a justification to waive the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  In effect, if we pass this amendment by the Senator from Connecticut, \nthose who support it would generate their own crisis by having \npurposefully underfunded the military. I mean, if we in fact abuse the \nway the balanced budget amendment would be used, that is what it would \namount to under the Dodd amendment.\n  Madam President, this sort of gaming of the system shows that the \nDodd amendment is a risky gimmick that will endanger both our military \nreadiness and our economic strength.\n  I might add that the amendment that will come later on Social \nSecurity is even a more risky gimmick that will endanger Social \nSecurity for all of our senior citizens because they would take it off \nthe budget so that it does not have to be dealt with not just in times \nof surplus, but in times of tremendous default and in times when there \nare not enough moneys there to run it. We have to keep it on budget to \nkeep the pressure on everybody to do what is right to keep Social \nSecurity going for our seniors.\n  Let me just take a few moments and elaborate on the military \nreadiness issues.\n  The Dodd amendment is too vague. It merely acknowledges the status \nquo--that there exists national security threats that are routinely \nhandled by the readiness components of our defense budget. Its adoption \ncould actually undermine our ability to provide a responsive surge to \nescalating threats to our vital interests.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut does not acknowledge \nthe differences of national security interests, nor does it tell us \nwhat is at stake. It is too broad, and by consequence so vague as to \nallow exceptions to the balanced budget amendment based on the status \nquo, day-to-day operation of our defense policy.\n  To quote from former Secretary of Defense William Perry:\n\n       Vital U.S. interests can be at risk when the United States \n     or an ally is threatened by conventional military force, \n     economic force, by economic strangulation, or weapons of mass \n     destruction. These threats to vital interests are most likely \n     to arise in a regional conflict and, by definition, may \n     require military intervention.\n\n  Madam President, as you can see, the Dodd amendment would allow the \nwaiver of the balanced budget amendment at almost any time in our \ncountry's history where there is any kind of military threat that fits \nwithin the broad language that the then Secretary of Defense, in \ncontrast, as seen from the statement, says that vital interests can be \nplaced at risk by threat. And he continues, such threats by our vital \ninterests ``may require military intervention.''\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 complies with current defense thinking. It \nsays that when the President takes a step beyond the normal acts of \nprotecting national security interests and places our forces in harm's \nway, then should Congress, and only then should Congress, consider by \nmajority vote suspending the balanced budget amendment restraints on \ndefense spending.\n  My next objection is that military spending is not and was never \nintended to be the only way to meet national security threats. In fewer \nwords, still, Madam President, the amendment does not acknowledge \neither the multiple military and nonmilitary strategies that meet our \nnational security requirements, nor does it appear to realize that we \nemploy a military strategy only when diplomatic and other foreign \npolicy remedies fail.\n  Finally, the Dodd amendment contradicts and challenges some basic \nreadiness, budgeting and programming concepts that both the President \nand the Congress support. The Secretary of Defense says, ``The number \none priority of the Defense Department is maintaining the readiness and \nsustainability of U.S. forces.''\n  The concerns of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut are \nadequately covered by the program-budget process. This is explained by \nthe Secretary of Defense as follows:\n\n       The U.S. national military strategy outlines a broad \n     spectrum of commitments, specifically that U.S. forces must \n     be prepared to fight and win the nation's wars, deter \n     aggression and prevent conflict, and conduct peacetime \n     engagement.\n\n  The same report goes on to say that ``U.S. forces are ready to meet \nthese missions.''\n  Now, Madam President, the day-to-day national security risks that the \nDodd amendment worries about are, as we can see, already inventoried \nand covered in our defense budget.\n  Let me return to another statement of the former Secretary of \nDefense, William Perry:\n\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\n\n       [The] challenge is to make sure the Department of Defense \n     has the right resources allocated to the right purposes in \n     support of readiness.\n\n  Here, the Secretary emphasizes the need for the types of priority-\nmaking that the amendment before us would eviscerate since, again, \neverything under the DOD amendment becomes a priority.\n  But, to balance this debate, let me turn to Secretary Perry, who \nwisely cautioned:\n\n       Even with a solid foundation of readiness funds in the DOD \n     budget, the costs of unbudgeted contingency operations can \n     reduce resources to carry out training, maintenance, and \n     other readiness-related activities.\n\n  We share with Secretary Perry the need to stress readiness and the \ncorresponding need to be able to respond to exceptional or contingency \nthreats.\n\n  In summary, Madam President, the balanced budget amendment as drafted \noffers a level of support to current defense planning that strengthens \nour defense policy. In stark contrast, the amendment of my friend from \nConnecticut would place our national security interests at a level of \ngreat risk by undermining the sound budget formulation, priority-\nmaking, and management practices that Congress and the President have \nworked out over the past decade.\n  Now, I do not think I need to say anything more about the Dodd \namendment. I hope that all my colleagues will vote it down because this \namendment would just be another way of eviscerating or doing away with \nthe effectiveness of Senate Joint Resolution 1, once passed by us and \nratified by three-quarters of the States. We have adequately protected \nour national security interests the way article 5 is written, and we do \nit in a way that does not allow phony loopholes so the people can spend \nmore on liberal projects. I guarantee you, if we adopt the Dodd \namendment that will cause the amendment to be waived over for almost \nany reason. And all the moneys raised will probably not be for the \nmilitary over the year the amendment is thrown out. Those moneys will \nbe spent on liberal social programs, precisely what we want to \nemphasize. If we do waive the balanced budget amendment and we provide \na means to do that during serious crises, if we do waive it then, we \nhave to stand up and vote to do so and we do it because we have to \nbolster our military, and it can be done only under very rare \ncircumstances where it really needs to be done. Under the Dodd \namendment, it can be done under almost any circumstance, almost any \ntime anybody files a resolution to do so. That would just plain do away \nwith the effects of the balanced budget amendment.\n  I think that is enough for me to say about the Dodd amendment. I take \na few minutes now, because I think it is important to do so, to pay \nrespect to my dear colleague and friend who spoke earlier on the floor, \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Everybody knows the esteem that all of us have for the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia. The Senate means as much to him as anybody \nwho has ever sat in the Senate. This country means a great deal to him. \nHe feels very deeply about his positions, and he argues them forcibly \nand eloquently. I really do, indeed, after having thought for quite a \nwhile about what he said this morning and early afternoon--he spoke for \nabout an hour and 40 minutes, as I recall--I thought I should at least \nspeak a little bit about that here today if I can.\n  The balanced budget amendment is appropriate in its subject matter \nand approach to be included in the Constitution. It establishes a \nprocess-based control on the part of the Federal Government's spending \nabilities, specifically, on its ability to borrow. Inasmuch as \nborrowing affects all future Americans, our children and grandchildren, \nit is appropriate to place rules on the Federal Government to protect \nthose Americans who will be affected but are not now represented in \nthis political process.\n  Now, Madam President, I call myself a student of the Constitution, \nand I do not undertake to amend it lightly. However, our history \nclearly shows the need for a balanced budget constitutional amendment \nif we are ever going to balance the budget. Although the text of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 is modest in length, it is very significant. Its \nlanguage has been worked out by Members of both parties over many, many \nyears of fine tuning, and that language has now reached the point where \nit is a bipartisan, bicameral approach.\n  Since constitutional amendments are of such importance, I will take a \nfew minutes to walk through the provisions of the balanced budget \namendment and discuss how they will cure us of our addiction to debt. \nSince the distinguished Senator from West Virginia did walk through \nthese, I would like to maybe do the same. I will have more to say on \nthis later.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield, to respond to a couple of issues \nraised by the pending amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I yield if I do not lose my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for that. I want to respond to a \ncouple of provisions. The amendment we have before us, the amendment \nthat I offered here, requires that we face an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security as declared by joint resolution. I \nwas informed ``as declared by joint resolution'' does not mean someone \nreally introducing a resolution, but that a joint resolution would have \nto pass both Houses. But I am fully prepared to offer an amendment. It \nwould take unanimous consent to clarify any ambiguity about my \nintention here. This is not a declaration by an individual Member, but \na decision by both Houses that an imminent and dangerous situation \nexists. I will modify my amendment so as to remove any question of my \nintention here and what the legislative office, in drafting this, \ninformed this Senator that the language ``declared by joint \nresolution'' certainly means. If there is any doubt in anybody's mind, \nI'll do that. The last thing I want to do is have any one Senator able \nto offer a resolution that would trigger a waiver of the balanced \nbudget amendment.\n\n  Second, I think it is important because the Secretary's name has been \nraised by my friend from Utah on numerous occasions. Allow me, for the \nbenefit of my colleagues, to read from prepared testimony from the \nSecretary of Defense:\n\n       We are here today not to give you a comprehensive \n     discussion of the balanced budget amendment, but rather to \n     discuss specifically one very important aspect, which is the \n     effect it would have [the balanced budget amendment] on our \n     national security and particularly the effect it would have \n     on our defense programs. Almost any reasonable assumption of \n     how the balanced budget amendment would be implemented in \n     spinning budgets and in specific programs would affect the \n     defense programs in a fundamental way and I believe would \n     fundamentally undermine the security of the Nation.\n\n  Let me emphasize that and repeat it:\n\n       . . . I believe it would fundamentally undermine the \n     security of the Nation. In addition to that, the balanced \n     budget amendment would threaten frequent interruptions of \n     many long-term processes that are essential to maintaining a \n     prudent defense posture.\n\n  The statement goes on longer, but those particular words certainly \ndon't leave any doubt as to where the Secretary of Defense stands on \nthis issue.\n  Third--and then I will allow my colleague from Utah to pick up where \nhe wanted to--I urge my colleagues to read the report language in \nsection 5 of the Judiciary Committee on this amendment, as it gives an \nexplanation of what section 5 means. On page 22, Madam President, I am \nquoting, and it is dated February 3, 1997:\n\n       This section, as amended, guarantees that Congress will \n     retain maximum flexibility in responding to clear national \n     security crises, such as in declared war or imminent military \n     threat to national security.\n\n  Now, if that is what it did, I would not offer this amendment. But it \ndoes not. It should take into consideration the declaration of war or \nimminent military threat to national security. But that is not what the \namendment says. The amendment says in section 5, which is before us:\n\n       . . . the United States is engaged in military conflict, \n     which causes an imminent and serious military threat to \n     national security.\n\n  It is the ``engaged'' part that I have such difficulty with here, \nbecause if it just said ``imminent military threat to national \nsecurity,'' then you could say, fine, I understand that. We have a \nthreat out there; we are not engaged yet, but we have a threat. So we \nought to be able to pass a joint resolution here that declares that \nthreat to exist, and the waiver then would apply. But\n\n[[Page S1278]]\n\nthis is not flexible. My colleagues ought to understand that. It is not \nflexible. You must have a declaration of war and/or this Nation must be \nengaged in military conflict, and it requires all 218 House Members and \nall 51 Senators--not 49 to 48, but 51--to then waive the provisions.\n  I think that is so restrictive. As important as my colleagues believe \nthis amendment is in dealing with the fiscal matters of this country--\nand I am not here to argue that point today, Madam President, because \nthat is an ongoing debate. I accept the sincerity of those who propose \nthis amendment. But I hope no one would suggest that, as important as \nthe fiscal matters of this country are, we would make it so restrictive \nfor the Nation to respond to a military crisis that we would require a \ndeclaration of war or actual engagement in a conflict before we could \ndecide to waive these provisions in order to respond to them. I think \nthat is threatening.\n\n  This is a dangerous section, as written, regardless of how one feels \nabout the constitutional amendment. This is dangerous. This is clearly \ndangerous. I ask my colleagues--this is not report language now. We are \ntalking about the actual words included in the organic law of our \ncountry, the organic law. Every word, every letter is important. It is \nnot insignificant. These are not casual words. To require a declaration \nof war or to be actually engaged in military conflict before you can \nwaive the provisions of this constitutional amendment, I think, is \ndangerous indeed. I am offering an amendment which does not strike it \naltogether but which says ``faces an imminent and serious military \nthreat to national security as declared by a joint resolution.'' That \nway, if there is an imminent threat to our national security, a \nmajority of us here and in the other body can pass a resolution that \ndeclares that to be the case, and then we ought to be able to waive the \nprovisions and respond to them.\n  My colleagues know as many examples as I do where we have not met the \nthreshold of a declaration of war or been engaged in a military \nconflict. Examples where we, the overwhelming majority, I suspect, \nwould have assumed there was enough of an imminent threat out there \nthat we should have responded. We also see a highly divisive country \nwhen we see that. I do not offer this lightly, as others have \nsuggested, as somehow a back-door approach for liberal spending \nprograms. This goes right to the heart of our Nation's response to a \ncrisis and whether or not we elevate the importance of fiscal prudence \nhere to such a status that it exceeds the ability of the Nation to \nrespond under its primary, essential function, and that is to protect \nthe security of our Nation.\n  I suggest, Madam President--in fact, I will read this. On page 22, \nthe last section--they define, by the way, in these sections what each \nword means. The bottom of page 22 of the report.\n\n       . . . is engaged in military conflict.\n\n  Here is how the report defines those words:\n\n       ``. . . is engaged in military conflict,'' is intended to \n     limit the applicability of this waiver to situations \n     involving the actual use of military force which nonetheless \n     do not rise to the level of a formal declaration of war.\n\n  This isn't my language. This is the report language. I am not \ninterpreting this language. It must involve the actual use of military \nforce before they meet the threshold of imminent danger.\n  There are just hundreds of cases where something that does not \ninvolve actual use of force can meet the threshold of imminent danger. \nYet, the authors of the section, very clearly --and you can imagine a \nFederal court, some day in the next century, reading this language as \nto what the words mean, and it doesn't say likely use of force or maybe \na use of force, but actual use of force. We have the awkward situation, \nto put it mildly, of this Nation responding to its primary function--\nthat is, to protect its citizenry when placed under threat.\n  Again, I will offer at the appropriate moment--I don't know why I \nneed to, but if certain people think I have drafted this in a way to \nsuggest that any one Member can offer a resolution and that is going to \ntrigger a waiver--again, I submitted my language to the legislative \noffices here to prepare this, and they tell me that the ``declared by a \njoint resolution'' meets that standard of what the intent is here--\nclearly, not just any one Member offering a resolution, but obviously \nboth Houses passing it. I haven't gotten to the language in the \namendment about the whole House, in terms of having 51 people. We have \nseen situations where Members don't get back, for whatever reason, \nwhere some crisis faces the Nation and Members can't get here. What a \nridiculous situation to place this body in. I know we're not living in \nthe horse-and-buggy age here, when Members couldn't get here and where \nthey sat around and waited for enough Members to arrive which would \nallow a majority of both Houses to respond. But we sat here and \ndetermined that somehow meets purity, and insisted upon the whole of \nboth Houses, and then, of course, I believe we excluded the Vice \nPresident from casting a vote in a tie. You have to have 51 votes of \nthe Members, and the Vice President while the Presiding Officer is not \na Member of this body. And I think that is a shortcoming as well. It is \nminor compared to the actual language here that requires a declaration \nof war, or as the report language defines is engaged in military \nconflict, it must involve the actual use of military force. I think \nthat standard is way too high for us to be able to waive the provisions \nof this balanced budget amendment to respond to a security crisis in \nthis country.\n\n  You can vote for my amendment, and you can be for the balanced budget \namendment. It does not threaten the underlying purpose of a balanced \nbudget amendment. I believe it is a lot wiser to be cautious on all \nissues of national security. This is not some secondary or collateral \nissue. This is the primary function of any government. The primary \nfunction is to protect the security of the people. We have set a \nstandard here that I think places that primary responsibility in some \njeopardy.\n  So for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment. \nAnd I will be glad to yield the floor at this point. I will raise a \ncouple of additional issues in a few minutes. But let me yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, of course the underlying amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut threatens the very purpose of the balanced \nbudget amendment. Even if he does make this small change of adding \nlanguage that makes the resolution became law, this certainly would \nimprove his amendment. That is a small matter. The reason he would have \nto do that, if his intention is that the resolution be passed by both \nbodies and signed by the President, is because he has deleted \nspecifically our requirement that any resolution become law, meaning it \npasses both Houses and it is signed by the President.\n  So there is no other way the court would construe it other than the \nway I have suggested it. But that is a small matter because Senator \nDodd's new amendment, assuming that he modifies his current amendment, \nclarifies his intent in one regard. He would make it clear that a joint \nresolution must become law. That would be an improvement.\n  But my other criticisms remain. There would be too many instances in \nwhich Senate Joint Resolution 1's requirements could be waived. Today, \nany action by a foreign nation can pose an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to our Nation. Under Senator Dodd's amendment, any such \naction would allow Congress to engage in increased social spending, and \nwaive this balanced budget amendment.\n  To me that is ridiculous. It isn't a protection. It is just another \nway to continue business as usual. I frankly am not for that, and I do \nnot think most others will be either.\n  Look closely at the Dodd amendment that allows all spending to \nincrease--not just military spending. The ostensible purpose is to \nprotect us militarily and our national security. But it waives the \nbudget for all spending. It makes one wonder why. And it allows \nvirtually any action by any country--certainly countries like Russia or \nChina--to justify increased social spending.\n  I have to admit that my colleagues are ingenious at wanting to keep \nthe status quo going, and that is their\n\n[[Page S1279]]\n\nright to unbalance the budget and spend and spend and spend so they can \ngo home and claim, ``Look at what we are doing for you.'' They are \nputting us into bankruptcy. And all of us are doing it, both parties, \nwithout any restraint. Now they want to remove this restraint. To be \nhonest with you, I think basically what people want to do is just keep \nbusiness as usual.\n  Secretary Perry in accepting the Dodd amendment would admit that the \nreadiness principles are wrong that he articulated. For example, he \nwould be saying that current threats are not covered. The Dodd \namendment has no plan for a contingency. National security is always a \njustifiable budget buster regardless of the crisis of the moment.\n  Let us just read the language that the Senator would change. The way \nthe original amendment, the underlying amendment, Senate Joint \nResolution 1 reads, section 5 says, ``Congress may waive the provisions \nof this article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in \neffect.'' That is the same. ``The provisions of this article may be \nwaived for any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in \nmilitary conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat \nto national security and is so declared by a joint resolution adopted \nby a majority of the whole number of each House which becomes law.'' \nThat is what the current amendment says. That is a tremendous \nprotection. Declaration of war or waiver by a joint resolution passed \nby the whole number, a majority of the whole number of both Houses, \nmeaning a constitutional majority, which becomes law and signed by the \nPresident. Under those circumstances this balanced budget amendment can \nbe waived.\n  There are those who are strong supporters of the balanced budget \namendment which didn't want this language in here. Senator Heflin and a \nnumber of us worked this out so that both sides would feel that they \nare adequately taken care of. But it is no secret. There are a lot of \npeople who do not want this section at all because they believe that a \npatriotic group of Senators and Congresspeople would naturally waive \nthe balanced budget amendment by a higher vote, by the three-fifths \nvote necessary to do it to put us into more debt to pay for it. But we \nhave made it a much lesser standard. It will be a constitutional \nmajority required by both Houses.\n  Look at the way the distinguished Senator from Connecticut would have \nthis read. ``The Congress may waive the provisions of this article for \nany fiscal year in which a declaration of war is in effect.'' ``The \nprovisions of this article may be waived for any fiscal year in which \nthe United States is engaged in military conflict which causes'' but in \nwhich the United States ``faces an imminent and serious military threat \nto national security.'' And then he strikes ``and is so,'' and then \njust says ``as declared by a joint resolution,'' period. I imagine he \nis willing to modify his amendment and add ``which becomes law.'' The \n``which becomes law'' would make this amendment a little bit better. \nBut, frankly, it doesn't solve the problem of the easy ability anybody \nwould have for anything that can be called ``facing an imminent and \nserious military threat to our national security'' which can include \nalmost anything. That would be the easiest way to waive this amendment \nat any time any social spending becomes the desire of the people and \nthe Congress. And, by the way, that is what is causing our problems for \n28 straight years now--social spending.\n  I am so afraid I am going to knock these over sometime and squash \nsomebody, and they would squash somebody. It would probably break \nsomebody's leg. I have been told by a number of Senators that we are \nviolating OSHA. Too bad OSHA doesn't have control over this separated \npower. But there is no other way to show to the American people just \nhow really bad it is--28 straight years of unbalanced budgets. And now \nwe are going to put changes in this amendment that would allow us to go \nto 29, 30, right up to 68 years, or more. We will never get it under \ncontrol, if we have amendments like this. So we have to stand up and do \nwhat is right.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a question or so?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. First of all, I raised the issue about the Vice President \nbecause it is unclear.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Vice President would not have a right to vote here, \nbut he doesn't have a right to vote for this amendment either.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me ask my question. Under section 5, as drafted in the \nproposed constitutional amendment, then the vote by the whole of both \nHouses would exclude the vote by the Vice President. Is that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is correct, just like a vote for this constitutional \namendment excludes the Vice President, and countless other votes \nexclude the Vice President.\n  Mr. DODD. We are talking about a waiver issue here.\n  Mr. HATCH. In any event, he would be excluded.\n  Mr. DODD. Is there any other situation which my colleague from Utah \ncan cite in which we have excluded the vote of the Vice President in a \ntie vote?\n  Mr. HATCH. Every constitutional amendment that has ever been passed.\n  Mr. DODD. I am talking about a matter that would come before this \nbody.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. On cloture votes; all cloture votes. You will have \nto have 60 votes.\n  Mr. DODD. That is a procedural vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Procedural or not, that is what this vote would be.\n  Mr. DODD. To waive.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. That would be both procedural and substantive. \nCloture votes are substantive and procedural.\n  Mr. DODD. A cloture vote is not a tie vote. There you have to have a \nnumber of votes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Neither would they be. In other words, what we are doing--\n--\n  Mr. DODD. You don't get cloture 50-50.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, you get cloture at 60----\n  Mr. DODD. Right. On matters that require a simple majority, will my \ncolleague cite a single example where a simple majority is required in \nthis body where the vote of the Vice President would be excluded?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. Every vote where it is not 50-50.\n  Mr. DODD. I am saying where the vote is 50-50.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, where the vote is 50-50, where that is required, \nyes, but we are talking about a constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I am not talking about the amendment. I am talking about a \nprovision----\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish.\n  Mr. DODD. That requires that this body act, and that is the provision \nof the constitutional amendment, requires that the whole House of both \nChambers vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is right.\n  Mr. DODD. And it requires 51.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. DODD. My question is, can my colleague from Utah cite a single \nexample where a supermajority is not required, where there is a 50-50 \ntie, that the vote of the Vice President would be excluded in that \nsituation?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes. In every vote in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. DODD. No, in the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish. I cannot cite a single example in the \nSenate, but that is irrelevant. The fact is the reason we are writing \nthe constitutional amendment is to provide a means whereby you have to \nhave a constitutional majority, without worrying about the Vice \nPresident, who is not a Member of this body other than to preside, if \nhe wants to, and break majority vote ties. We are saying that we need a \nconstitutional majority of at least 51 Senators to resolve this \nproblem, and at least 218 Members of the House. And since it is a \nconstitutional amendment, we would be changing the current method of \nbudgeting to require higher majority votes in order to waive the \nbalanced budget amendment requirements. That is what we are doing.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me ask my colleague a couple other questions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DODD. Under the language of this amendment, would the decision to \nsend 100,000 troops to the gulf----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Because I do think I just need to make a couple more \ncomments on the Vice President.\n  Mr. DODD. I am sorry.\n  Mr. HATCH. Just to make the record. The question does arise, as the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S1280]]\n\nphrased, as to how Senate Joint Resolution 1 affects the obligations of \nthe Vice President, as President of the Senate, to vote in case of a \ntie vote in the Senate. The answer is that a balanced budget amendment \ndoes not change the Constitution's basic reliance on simple majority \nvotes or the Vice President's role in casting a vote in those cases \nwhere Senators are equally divided.\n  Article I, section 3 of the Constitution provides that ``The Vice \nPresident of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but \nshall have no vote, unless they be equally divided.''\n  By the plain meaning of this provision, the Vice President is not a \nmember of the Senate. He is merely the Presiding Officer, the President \nof the Senate, a neutral empire, and thus cannot vote or take part in \nthe deliberations of the Senate. And even though our current Vice \nPresident is a former member of the Senate, he is no longer a member of \nthe Senate. He is a member of the executive branch. But he does have \nthat function.\n  The only exception to this is where there exists a tie vote. In that \ncase to ``secure at all times the possibility of a definitive \nresolution of the body, it is necessary that the Vice President should \nhave only a casting vote.''\n  That was taken from Federalist Paper No. 68 written by Hamilton.\n  But the situation where the Vice President can break a tie vote only \napplies to a simple majority vote, the run-of-the-mill ordinary vote of \nthe Senate. It very seldom happens but it can happen under those \ncircumstances. Where the Constitution, however, provides for a \nsupermajority vote, in situations where the Framers of the Constitution \nfeared the passions of the majority rule would retard reasoned \ndeliberation, there really is no occasion for a tie vote, and therefore \nthe Vice President may not vote.\n  These include the two-thirds requirement of each House to override a \nveto. When the President formally rejects legislation passed by both \nHouses of Congress, the drafters of the Constitution contemplated the \nsimple democratic majoritarian rule does not serve the best interests \nof this country. A constitutional majority will not even do in that \ninstance. Congress may override the President's veto only by a \nsupermajority vote.\n  The two-thirds vote requirement of the Senate to give its advice and \nconsent to treaties and the two-thirds vote requirement of the Senate \nto convict on impeachment are other examples where the Vice President \nhas absolutely no vote whatsoever.\n  I add the votes on cloture. You are going to have at least 60 votes \nin order to invoke cloture. You could go on I think.\n  In each of these cases the Vice President has no role in casting a \ndeciding vote.\n  The balanced budget amendment supermajority provisions, whether the \nthree-fifths number of the whole number of each House of Congress--that \nsection 1 waiver to allow outlays to exceed receipts; section 2 waiver \nto increase the limit on the debt, or the constitutional majority \nprovisions--a majority of the whole number of each House--section 4 \nrequirement to raise revenue, section 5 requirement to waive amendment \nwhen the United States is involved in military action that is a threat \nto national security--would work the same way as the Constitution's \nother supermajority provisions.\n  Because these supermajority provisions require a majority vote of the \nwhole number of each House of Congress, and it is clear that the Vice \nPresident is not a Member of either House, these provisions, like the \ntwo-thirds vote in the Senate for treaties, is an exception to the \nsimple majority vote general rule that the Vice President may vote in \ncases of a tie in the Senate.\n  Moreover, with a supermajority requirement, a tie vote is \nmeaningless. For instance, 60 votes in the Senate would be required to \nraise the debt ceiling, where a three-fifths vote is required under \nsection 2 of this amendment, and 51 votes would be needed to raise \ntaxes as required by section 4. A 40 to 40 vote or even a 50 to 50 vote \ndoes not meet that requirement. Therefore, the Vice President would \nhave no role in casting a deciding vote. But that does not in any way \ndiminish his constitutional authority.\n  Madam President, what we are debating here is very important. What \nthe balanced budget amendment does is establish a constitutional \nrequirement that Congress live within its means, that we quit doing \nthis to America, as represented by these 28 years in a row of \nunbalanced budgets since 1969. All the supermajority requirements are \nsaying is that if Congress wants to waive the Constitution, a simple \nmajority will not do. You have to have a true majority--in the case of \nthe section 4 requirement to raise revenue and section 5 requirement to \nwaive the amendment when the United States is involved in a military \naction that is a threat to national security--or a supermajority in the \ncase of the section 1 waiver of the balanced budget requirement or the \nsection 2 waiver of the debt limit. And every Senator and every \nCongressman must be on record and thereby accountable to his or her \nconstituency.\n\n  Now, I have at least 3 or 4 hours more that I could go on on this \nsubject.\n  Mr. DODD. I am not going to press my colleague. The point I wanted to \nmake, if my colleague will yield further, is that we are creating an \nunprecedented exception. The waiver provision--put aside the \nconstitutional amendment. I am not debating that. I am debating this \none section.\n  Mr. HATCH. All right.\n  Mr. DODD. Under this one section we are carving out a unique \nexception for the first time in the history of this country. Section 5 \nsays adopted by a majority of the whole House and its Members. We \nexclude the Vice President in a 50-50 tie.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right.\n  Mr. DODD. In casting a vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. That's right.\n  Mr. DODD. We do not do that under any other circumstance in the 208-\nyear-old history of this Republic----\n  Mr. HATCH. Other than the ones I have listed.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague. It is not a supermajority here. It \nis a dangerous precedent in my view. So on a 50 to 50 vote on whether \nwe met the other standards would fail and the President of the United \nStates would not be able to act.\n  Let me ask my colleague from Utah just a couple quick questions. I \ncited examples earlier, putting aside whether you agreed or disagreed \nwith the action taken. In August 1990, when President Bush sent 100,000 \ntroops to the Middle East, were we in actual--to quote the language of \nthis section 5, were we engaged, in the Senator's opinion, in military \nconflict at that point?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. DODD. Were we engaged at that point in August 1990 for the United \nStates----\n  Mr. HATCH. When we sent troops to Saudi Arabia?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. By the way, the interpretation of engaged is actual \nuse of military force.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, we already had had attacks by the Iraqis and we were \nthere to protect our people. I would say that.\n  Mr. DODD. How about lend-lease, under President Roosevelt?\n  Mr. HATCH. One thing about lend-lease that I felt was very important \nis that during that period of time if we had any deficits at all, they \nwere very minor.\n  Mr. DODD. They were large. They were 36 percent of the overall \nbudget, much larger than they are today.\n  Mr. HATCH. Before that they were minor in comparison to what we have \ntoday.\n  Mr. DODD. The point I am trying to get at here is the question of \nactual--the language here of section 5 is ``is engaged in military \nconflict.'' I make a strong case to the Senator here that in those \nsituations we were not engaged in military conflict.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure, we were.\n  Mr. DODD. We ultimately became engaged.\n  Mr. HATCH. They were moving forces and materiel and----\n  Mr. DODD. That's not engagement.\n  Mr. HATCH. It may not be, until we shot the first shot, but the fact \nis that is what happened, and when it did happen, I cannot imagine \neither House of Congress not voting to provide a constitutional \nauthority to provide whatever help the military needed.\n  Mr. DODD. Doesn't it make more sense to leave out your declaration of\n\n[[Page S1281]]\n\nwar language here and then have the threshold as an imminent threat? We \nall have to vote here. It's not as if it happens by one person. But at \nleast you could respond without a court. Because I could imagine you \nmight take the position in the Persian Gulf that that could have been \nthe outcome. Let us say I disagreed with you. I run to Federal court. I \nread the language there and I cite the report language and the report \nlanguage says, under this section, ``is engaged in military conflict \ninvolving the actual use of military force.''\n  My point to the court would be that is not actual use of military \nforce. Therefore you cannot waive this provision.\n  Mr. HATCH. You don't think moving billions of dollars worth of \nmilitary force into the Persian Gulf----\n  Mr. DODD. I think actual use of military force is my interpretation. \nI don't understand----\n  Mr. HATCH. That might be an argument in this body. If it is, then \nthose who want to increase military spending or waive this budget, all \nthey have to do is get a constitutional majority to do so. We are just \nsaying it should not be easy to waive the constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I don't think this is easy, as you are suggesting it is. \nBut you are putting a straitjacket, in my view----\n  Mr. HATCH. Hardly.\n  Mr. DODD. Putting a straitjacket on the ability of this country in \nfuture years to respond to a threat to national security by insisting \non a declaration of war and actual conflict--actual conflict.\n  Mr. HATCH. Hardly. What we are saying is if it's an actual conflict \nand something that deserves the United States of America risking its \nsoldiers and its young men and women, then the President ought to \ndeclare a war or come up here and say, ``I want a constitutional vote \nto support me.''\n  Mr. DODD. My colleague knows how mischievous people can be in \nutilizing things like this.\n  Mr. HATCH. Not when it comes to our young men and women. Give me a \nbreak.\n  Mr. DODD. If you are short of a conflict and try to get ready for it \nand try to get the votes to prepare for it, we have seen the debates \nthat rage here.\n  Mr. HATCH. True, and those debates----\n  Mr. DODD. And you are offering, I suggest, to a potential enemy a \nwonderful arrow, an additional arrow in their quiver, where they can \nsit there and say, ``They are at the end of the fiscal year. These \npeople have difficulties. They'd have to rearrange their budget. It is \ngoing to require votes of the whole House. People could not show up.'' \nI see this as an advantage. You are subjugating, I say with all due \nrespect to my wonderful friend, you are subjugating national security \ninterests to the fiscal concerns you raise in this budget. Your \npriorities are switched. As important as fiscal matters are, to place \nin jeopardy the ability of the United States to respond quickly and \nefficiently to an imminent threat to its national security, for the \nlife of me, I don't understand why we would be risking that.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could regain my control of the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are saying precisely the opposite. We are saying to \nkeep this country secure, to have this country remain the greatest \ncountry in the world, quit spending it into bankruptcy and put some \nfiscal mechanism in the Constitution that requires us to quit spending \nit into bankruptcy. If we want to have a strong military, then, by \ngosh, let us be willing to stand up and vote for it.\n\n  I have to tell you, this Senator for 21 years has been a strong \nsupporter of a strong national security. I voted for virtually \neverything that would help this country and protect our young men and \nwomen. I think, in a time of imminent threat to this country, I have \nnever seen a case since I have been here where liberals, moderates and \nconservatives alike would reject protecting our young men and women. We \nare not going to see it in that case.\n  But I will tell you this, there is no justification whatsoever to put \ninto this amendment the changes that the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut wants, which would allow the amendment to be waived for \nalmost any circumstances and, frankly, waived for what? Because they \nare going to spend more money on the military? Give me a break. It is \ngoing to be so they can continue spending the way they always have, so \nthey can continue to build this mountain of paper, of national debt \nthat we have had for 28 straight years, and out of the last 66 years, \n58 years of debt.\n  That is what we are trying to stop. If we want a strong military, if \nwe want strong national security, if we want to protect ourselves from \nimminent threats, if we want to protect ourselves from war, if we want \nto protect ourselves from being invaded, if we want to protect \nourselves and our allies, then by gosh we better get spending under \ncontrol. And this balanced budget amendment is about the only thing the \nvast majority of us in Congress right now can think of that will help \nus to do it.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. What the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut would do is it would just plain make it so anybody could \nwaive the balanced budget amendment for any reason at any time. And I \nguarantee it will not be waived to increase military spending.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, my colleague had read this \namendment. My colleague is getting a bit emotional. If he would read \nthe amendment----\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not getting emotional.\n  Mr. DODD. ``Faces an imminent and serious military threat to national \nsecurity as declared by joint resolution.''\n  Mr. HATCH. I read that.\n  Mr. DODD. Is my colleague suggesting, that the majority would go \nalong willy-nilly with this resolution because they wanted to spend \nmore on the program. Are we not faced with the perverse situation of \nhaving Presidents declare war in order to meet the standard of some \nimminent threat here?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think so.\n  Mr. DODD. This language is very clear. It is pointed at a very \nimportant situation that would be before us. And to suggest somehow \nthis is a back-door attempt to fund spending programs on domestic \nissues, does my colleague really believe the majority in the Senate \nhere today would vote for a back-door domestic spending increase----\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I don't think it would.\n  Mr. DODD. On the grounds there was imminent threat to our national \nsecurity?\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think a majority would vote to do that. But I am \nsaying that is what this amendment would allow a majority to do, a \nsimple majority. We are saying that is wrong. We have provided enough \nof a safety hatch to protect the country the way the amendment is \nwritten. If we adopt the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut, my goodness gracious, we could have the balanced budget \namendment waived for a year any time we want to and it would just \nnullify the effectiveness of the balanced budget amendment.\n\n  I do not see anything wrong with the President either declaring war \nor coming up here to make a case he needs more money for the military, \nbut he or she ought to come up here----\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, that is what the amendment \nsays.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I am not yielding here. I want to finish my comments.\n  Mr. DODD. I thought the debate was kind of healthy.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield to my colleague, but I would like to be able \nto at least finish a sentence now and then, or at least once in a \nwhile.\n  I think it is very important that Presidents make their case, and I \nthink Presidents can make their case, whoever the future Presidents \nwould be. I think we would be very loathe to reject a President's case \nthat the national security is being threatened. I cannot imagine the \nCongress doing that, to be honest with you, since the Second World War. \nUp to then we kind of blithely went along, acting like nothing is ever \ngoing to happen because we are way over here. This is now a very small \nworld, and our country knows we have to back keeping ourselves strong \nbecause we are, frankly, the bulwark for freedom all over the world.\n  One thing I really don't think we should do, and I think a vast \nmajority\n\n[[Page S1282]]\n\nin this body will also not think we should do, is to make it possible \nto waive this amendment at the mere majority vote of some future \nCongress, just because somebody alleges, through a resolution, that \nthere is some imminent threats.\n  I yield to my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. President, the Dodd amendment is more loophole than law.\n  Whatever the Senator's intentions, this amendment actually would put \na two-step loophole in the balanced budget amendment and in the \nConstitution:\n  Step one: Declare a military threat with a simple majority;\n  Step two: Deficit spend as much as you want, on whatever you want.\n  That's it. The plain words of this amendment actually do nothing to \nhelp military preparedness.\n  The relevant wording of the amendment, as it would be amended by \nSenator Dodd's words are as follows:\n\n       The provisions of this article may be waived for any year \n     in which the United States faces an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security as declared by a joint \n     resolution.\n\n  Nothing in the Dodd amendment requires its deficit spending to be \ndedicated to defense. Nothing in the Dodd amendment requires its \ndeficit spending to be dedicated to meeting the ``imminent and serious \nmilitary threat.'' After declaring a military threat, Congress could \nthen vote to cut defense spending--maybe with the argument that a \ngesture of peace and good will would defuse that imminent military \nthreat. Then Congress could vote, by simple majority, for unlimited \ndeficit spending for any and all non-military spending programs. Would \nCongress use this loophole cynically as an excuse to deficit spend? I'm \nreminded of the movie, ``Field of Dreams,'' in which the lead character \nwas told, ``If you build the ball field, they (the players) will \ncome.'' When it comes to the hard choices of balancing the budget, you \ncould say, ``If you build the loophole, they will borrow and spend.''\n  The Dodd amendment still follows that old, status quo, borrow-and-\nspend mentality. There are those who really cannot conceive of a world \nwithout deficit spending.\n  They believe the American people want to have their cake, eat it too, \nand send a big credit card bill to the next generation. They believe \nyou can have everything, if only you keep deficit spending. The trouble \nis, if we don't stop deficit spending, we will lose everything: our \nprosperity, millions of jobs, economic security for our senior \ncitizens, and the American Dream of a better life for our children.\n  I suggest we really can have an adequately prepared defense and \nregularly balanced budgets, too.\n  In fact, the more we balance our budgets, the more we will have to \nspend on defense--and every other priority--because of a healthy, \ngrowing economy, because we'll stop devoting about 15 percent of our \nannual budget just to net interest payments.\n  And, in fact, at the very height of the cold war, during the 15\\1/2\\ \nyears of the Truman and Eisenhower administrations, we still managed to \nbalance the budget 7 times before spending on domestic social programs \nreally took off in the 1960's.\n  The debt is the threat to defense. Escalating interest payments crowd \nout all other priorities. In 1976, 7.2 percent of the Federal budget \nwent to make interest payments on the Federal debt. In 1996, net \ninterest consumed 15.5 percent of the budget. As a result, Defense and \nother programs have already felt the budget knife.\n  According to the report of the National Entitlement Commission \nchaired by our colleague Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, and our former \ncolleague Senator Danforth:\n\n       By 2012, unless appropriate policy changes are made in the \n     interim, projected outlays for entitlements and interest on \n     the national debt will consume all tax revenues collected by \n     the federal government.\n\n  That means no money left for defense--or capital investment, \neducation, the environment, national forests and parks, law \nenforcement, science, or other domestic discretionary programs.\n  The balanced budget amendment is the best friend our national defense \ncould have. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that moving \ntoward a balanced budget during fiscal year 1998-2002 will reduce \nFederal debt service costs over that period by $36 billion and improve \neconomic performance enough to produce a ``fiscal dividend'' of another \n$77 billion in revenues and interest rate savings, making more money \navailable over the long-term for priorities within a balanced budget.\n  Committing to a balanced budget--and it's not a convincing commitment \nwithout this constitutional amendment--actually helps pay for itself.\n  The balanced budget amendment places trust in the people--the Dodd \namendment distrusts the people. I am willing to risk my priorities \nunder a balanced budget. That's the whole point of balancing the \nbudget--it requires us to set priorities.\n  When former Senator Simon used to join us on this floor in sponsoring \nthe Balanced Budget Amendment, he was quite clear in his priorities \nunder a balanced budget:\n  Raise taxes, cut defense, increase social programs. And I have been \nquite clear in my priorities under a balanced budget: Restrain the \noverall growth of spending; cut wasteful domestic social programs; \nsafeguard our national defense; and cut taxes to be fairer to families \nand spur economic growth, if possible.\n  But Paul Simon and I both felt it was so imperative that we require \nbalanced budgets, that we were both willing to risk our individual \npriorities for the greater good--the economic survival of our Nation \nand the security of our children. If we balance budget, we take the \nrisk that our individual priorities may or may not prosper. If we don't \nbalance the budget--if we don't pass this amendment--we risk the future \nof our Nation and our children. I trust the American people to have the \nright priorities--and to elect Senators and Representatives who reflect \nthose priorities, at last, in a series of balanced budgets.\n  The balanced budget amendment--Senate Joint Resolution 1 unamended--\nalready takes national security into consideration. Look back at our \nhistory.\n  Traditionally, our Nation ran deficits during wars and paid back its \ndebts during peacetime. Senate Joint Resolution 1 would restore exactly \nthat norm of behavior. Only in the last few decades has the Government \nborrowed and spent in good times and bad, in war, peace, and cold wars.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 is careful and precise: A waiver may be had \nby a simple majority in the case of a declared war. There are serious \nconsequences--both to the people here at home and in terms of \ninternational law--when you declare war. It is an act of survival, an \nact of the highest urgency.\n  Next, Senate Joint Resolution 1 requires a vote by a ``majority of \nthe whole number''--a constitutional majority--to deficit spend if we \nare actually in a military emergency and engage our armed forces. This \nis a slightly higher threshold--added by former Senator Heflin, who was \nboth a deficit hawk and a defense hawk--and it is appropriate, since we \nare talking about a conflict here that is still legally not a declared \nwar.\n  Finally, in all other cases, we require a three-fifths vote to \ndeficit spend because deficit spending has become a cancer on our \neconomy and it should be hard to run up ever-higher debt.\n  Mr. President, what the amendment does, and I think the Senator from \nConnecticut is well aware, is it returns us to the traditional pattern \nof defense spending. We used to, in times of war and national \nemergency, deficit spend only to pay it off afterward because we \nbelieved in the fiscal solvency and the fiscal importance of a balanced \nbudget. Somehow, about three decades ago, we went screaming away from \nthat idea. We borrowed through World War I and then we paid it back. We \nborrowed through World War II, and we worked every effort to pay it \nback. That is exactly what the constitutional amendment does. In \nneither of those cases did we find ourself in imminent danger, other \nthan our own philosophy as a nation.\n  But, when it came to rally to the cause of human freedom for this \ncountry, we deficit spent. But we paid it back afterward. The tragedy \nof today is that we fail to recognize that form of fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n\n[[Page S1283]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield for a question, but could I yield \non your time?\n  Mr. DODD. Please. I am not suggesting here--let us put aside the \nunderlying debate on the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget. Even if my amendment were to be adopted, I say to my colleague \nfrom Utah, he knows I have serious reservations with the underlying \namendment. I merely wanted to address this one section here.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand.\n  Mr. DODD. The language--I urge again my colleague to read it--I am \nnot making the language up and writing the report language--says, ``in \nwhich a declaration of war is in effect,'' and, also, ``The provisions \nof this article may be waived for any fiscal year in which the United \nStates is engaged in a military conflict.''\n  Put aside the issue of how we vote here. The language says ``is \nengaged in a military conflict.'' I turn to the report language that \ndefines those words. On page 22, it says it must involve the actual use \nof military force.\n  I just know my colleagues can think of numerous examples--not phony \nones, not insignificant ones--where there was imminent threat, the \nnational security of this country was in jeopardy, we were not engaged, \nwe were not actually using military force, but we would have wanted to \nwaive the provisions of this particular section in order to respond to \nit.\n  Whether you are for or against the constitutional amendment, it seems \nto me is a collateral issue at this point. The question I raise is: \nThis language is so restrictive, it requires a declaration of war or \nactual engagement. Courts will interpret every word of this language in \nthe constitutional amendment.\n\n  My suggestion is not to get rid of this altogether. Keep in the \ndeclaration of war, but add or replace the language ``engaged'' and \ntalk about the imminent threat to the national security and require a \nresolution to be adopted by both Houses so that it isn't just one \nperson's interpretation, but that a majority of those present and \nvoting in both Houses.\n  That is not a slight hurdle to overcome, particularly when it amounts \nto waiving the provisions of a balanced budget amendment. I presume my \ncolleagues will take that seriously. But we ought to be able to do it \nshort of actual engagement in a conflict, and if we don't, I think we \nrestrict this Nation's ability to respond to future conflicts that \ncould jeopardize our national security and the people of this country.\n  We do not take our jobs lightly. We would have to meet that \nthreshold. We would understand by doing so, we would waive the \nprovisions of the Constitution. That is a very serious matter to \nundertake. It is not just a casual resolution. But it seems to me we \nought to be able to do so in preparation for something that may involve \nthe engagement of our men and women, our forces, and prepare them for \nit and prepare the Nation for it. We cannot do that under section five \nas presently written.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Faircloth]. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my colleague, as I can see, feels very \ndeeply about his position. I am not casting aspersions on him. I know \nhe is very sincere in what he is doing here today, but all we are \nsaying is unless the President declares a war, which he has in his \namendment, that this article can't be waived for a fiscal year, for any \nfiscal year unless the United States is ``engaged in military conflict \nwhich causes an imminent and serious military threat to national \nsecurity and is so declared by a joint resolution adopted by a majority \nof the whole number of each House, which becomes law.''\n  If we take what the distinguished Senator from Connecticut wants, \nthen it would be a tremendous loophole. It would allow people who are \nnot as sincere as he is to come in here and waive, on simple majority \nvote, the whole balanced budget amendment for almost any reason at all \nit will ruin our chance for fiscal responsibility.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is confusing the question of \ncongressional authorization of military action with spending measures. \nThe balanced budget amendment has no effect on the ability of Congress \nto approve actions like Panama. It has no effect at all. What the \nbalanced budget amendment does require is that when it comes to paying \nfor those actions, that we act responsibly and only waive the amendment \nin the case of a declaration of war or if we have a three-fifths vote \nof both bodies to do so. It is just that simple.\n  Or, if we actually are ``engaged in a military conflict which causes \nan imminent and serious military threat to national security and is so \ndeclared by a joint resolution adopted by a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House,'' in other words, by a constitutional majority, \nthat is all this amendment does.\n  I think to a degree, the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is \nmixing the President's Commander in Chief authority to act with \ncongressional authority to provide resources. The Commander in Chief \ncan act. There is nothing that stops the Commander in Chief from \nacting, and if the moneys are there, he can act in ways that utilize \nmore money. But the fact of the matter is, if the moneys are not there, \nhe or she is going to have to come up here and make a case, and I can't \nimagine where there is an imminent and serious military threat to \nnational security that the Congress will not provide the necessary \nvotes. We do not challenge the President's authority. Rather, the \nbalanced budget amendment opponents resist congressional control over \nall spending, including defense, and that is really what is the thrust \nof this amendment, in the eyes of many.\n  I respect my colleague from Connecticut. Yes, I get a little excited \nabout these kind of amendments, too. The whole purpose of a balanced \nbudget amendment is to give us some mechanism to try and stop this \ncharade, and, frankly, I think most people in America, if they really \nlook at it, become very cynical about Congress, because they see this \ncharade that's been caused over 28 straight years now. They see us \ntrying to find every way we can to spend more and more. Some are so \ncynical that they believe people around here spend so they can keep \nthemselves in office and go home, beat their breasts, and say, ``Look \nwhat I have done for you.'' They never say ``with your own money, your \nown borrowed money.''\n  We are trying to stop this charade. We are trying to at least put \nsome dents in it, and the balanced budget amendment might do that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think that Senator Dodd has put his \nfinger on a very serious flaw in the language of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Section 5 of the proposed amendment requires the United States to be \nengaged in military conflict before a waiver may be obtained. The \nmilitary conflict must be one that causes an imminent and serious \nmilitary threat to national security. Moreover, the Senate report's \nsection-by-section on this language compounds the problem by indicating \nthat only certain kinds of military conflict may qualify. Only military \nconflict that involve the actual use of military force may serve as a \nbasis for this waiver.\n  I hope that this is not what the authors, sponsors and proponents of \nthis constitutional amendment truly intend. If it is, they are creating \nconstitutional circumstances that make military spending and \npreparations easier only when military force is actually used and \nmilitary conflict ensues. Arming to deter aggression would no longer be \nthe preferred course, aiding allies in a conflict rather than \ndispatching U.S. military forces would no longer be as viable and \nalternative and rebuilding our military capabilities after a conflict \nwould no longer be possible without a supermajority vote of three-\nfifths of the Congress. I cannot believe that anyone in the Congress \nwould propose such restrictive measures.\n  I have spent much of my time in the Senate working with Republican \nand Democratic administrations to avoid the actual use of military \nforce. This amendment is written in such a way that it serves to \nencourage such use. Nothing that would serve to place our men and women \nin harm's way more quickly or leaves them less well equipped or \nprepared should garner the support of this Senate. I hope that all \nSenators will consider favorably Senator Dodd's important amendment. I\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\n urge the manager and the sponsors of the resolution to abandon their \n     no-amendments strategy and consider the merits of the Dodd \n     amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I think maybe we spent enough time on this. \nI would like to spend a few minutes replying to Senator Byrd, who I \nrespect deeply and who is one of the people I most admire in this body. \nHe spoke for about an hour and a half, an hour and 40 minutes this \nmorning in a very intelligent and eloquent way, but I think there are a \nnumber of things about his remarks that do need to be clarified.\n  Like I say, the text of section 1 of this amendment before the body \nis modest in length. It is very significant. It is language that has \nbeen worked out over many years in a bipartisan, bicameral way. \nConstitutional amendments are of great importance, and I would like to \njust take a few minutes to walk through the provisions of the balanced \nbudget amendment and discuss how they would cure our so-called \naddiction to debt.\n  The core provision of Senate Joint Resolution 1 is contained in \nsection 1, which establishes, as a fiscal norm, the concept of a \nbalanced budget amendment. That section mandates that:\n\n       Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that year, unless three-fifths of the whole \n     number of each House of Congress shall provide by law for a \n     specific excess of outlays over receipts by a rollcall vote.\n\n  This section does not require a particular process the Congress must \nfollow in order to achieve a balanced budget. There are many equitable \nmeans of reaching that goal. Each program will have to compete on its \nown for the resources available. Thus, the balanced budget amendment, \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, does not dictate any particular fiscal \nstrategy upon Congress.\n  Section 1 also provides reasonable flexibility by providing for a \nwaiver of the balanced budget amendment. In order to invoke this \nwaiver, both Houses of Congress must provide by law for a specific \ndefault which must pass by a three-fifths rollcall vote. This careful \nbalancing of incentives creates enough flexibility for Congress to deal \nwith economic or other emergencies. However, the waiver will not be \neasy when a future Congress is simply trying to avoid the tough choices \nnecessary to balance the budget. Many supporters of the balanced budget \namendment have suggested that in the future it might be in the Nation's \ninterest to plan to run a reasonable surplus to ensure easier \ncompliance with its terms and to be able to begin to pay down the debt \nwith any surplus funds.\n  Another important aspect of this section is that in a year that the \nCongress chooses to waive the balanced budget rule, it must do so ``for \na specific excess of outlays over receipts . . .'' That means that the \nmaximum amount of deficit spending to be allowed must be clearly \nidentified. By forcing Congress to identify and confront a particular \ndeficit, this clause will prevent a waiver for a specific purpose, such \nas an economic downturn, from opening the door to a whole range of \ndeficit-funded spending.\n  Another key feature of section 1 is that it requires any waiver to be \nby rollcall vote. A rollcall vote will be required to ensure the \nrequired three-fifths vote has been recorded so that the American \npeople will be able to see who stood for fiscal responsibility and who \nfor adding more debt on our children's and grandchildren's heads. The \nbalanced budget amendment will increase accountability in Government. \nGone will be the days of late-night unrecorded voice votes to spend \naway America's future. If there is to be a deficit, the American people \nwill know who wanted it and why they wanted it. They can make their own \njudgment as to who has the right priorities.\n  Section 2 provides that:\n\n       The limit on the debt of the United States held by the \n     public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the \n     whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an \n     increase by a rollcall vote.\n\n  So that is pretty clear. Section 2 works in tandem with section 1 to \nenforce the balanced budget amendment. Section 2 focuses public \nattention on the magnitude of Government indebtedness.\n  To run a deficit, the Federal Government must borrow funds to cover \nits obligations. If borrowing will go beyond a previously enacted \nstatutory limit, the balanced budget amendment will require a three-\nfifths vote in order to raise that limit.\n  This section acts as an incentive to not only balance the budget in \ngood times, but to start paying down the existing debt that is so high \nnow that it is mind-boggling. By doing so, Congress will provide more \nflexibility for itself by opening more breathing room between the \nactual debt and the debt limit. This is, in truth, what we should have \nbeen doing for years.\n  We hear so much about the recent and temporary decline in the annual \ndeficit. It is amazing to me that some people consider a smaller \nincrease in the debt a reason to celebrate. I do not think it is. The \ndebt is still increasing. We must balance the budget. It is over $100 \nbillion this year, that deficit.\n  We must balance the budget and stop increasing the debt at all. \nIndeed, our goal should be to run a surplus during prosperous times so \nthat we can start paying down the debt and meet threats to our national \nsecurity.\n  I wonder how a credit card company would respond if I told them that \nalthough my debt was more than three times my annual income, I \noverspent by less this year than I did last year. They would sure as \nheck cut me off, as they would any of us.\n  Section 3 provides:\n\n       Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall transmit to \n     the Congress a proposed budget for the United States \n     Government for that fiscal year, in which total outlays do \n     not exceed total receipts.\n\n  That is important. While this may not seem important to some people, \nconsider how long it has been since we had a balanced budget--28 solid \nyears now. These are all unbalanced budgets for 28 years. That is why \nthis stack of books next to me is so high.\n  The President's budget does not balance this year either. He claims \nit will get us to balance by 2002. I hope we can work with him to do \nthat. But without a balanced budget amendment, I fear it is not going \nto happen. If you look at his budget, 75 percent of the cuts are in the \nlast 2 years, when he is out of office. So it is pretty clear to me \nthat it is not as sincere an attempt as I would like to see it. The \nPresident understands this game. His budget, like I say, saved 75 \npercent of the cuts for only after he leaves office--another plan to \nleave it to the future and let the next guy pay the bill.\n  It is time for us to break our habit of deficit by default. People \npropose deficit spending in Washington without a second thought. I \nbelieve that by the simple action of having the President propose a \nbudget that balances in that fiscal year, we will go a long way towards \nchanging the debt-happy attitudes in this town and that, in turn, will \nhelp us stay in balance after we reach it.\n  Section 4 requires approval by a majority of the whole number of each \nHouse by a rollcall vote for any bill to increase revenue. This will \nprovide a responsible and balanced amount of tax limitation and improve \ncongressional accountability for revenue measures. It is important to \nstop borrowing, but to unduly borrow burdens hard-working Americans and \nwould also be deleterious to the Nation and to its citizens.\n  Section 4 will help us to curb spending and taxing by requiring a \nmajority of the whole Congress, not just those voting at a given time, \nand by forcing Members of Congress to go on record with a rollcall \nvote. These reforms are a crucial part of putting our fiscal house in \norder.\n  Section 5 guarantees--and I will not read it; we have been reading \nthat--but it guarantees that Congress will retain maximum flexibility \nin responding to clear national security crises such as a declared war \nor imminent military threat to national security.\n  This section provides a balance between the need for flexibility to \nreact to a military threat to the Nation and the need to keep the \nbalanced budget amendment strong. Clearly, if the United States is \ninvolved in a declared war, the situation is serious and the waiver of \nthe balanced budget rule should not be overly difficult. Unless clear \nsituations, but still in instances of military conflict, the threshold \nis slightly higher.\n\n  In order to waive the balanced budget rule Congress must pass the \nwaiver by a majority of the whole number of both Houses and it must \nbecome law, must\n\n[[Page S1285]]\n\nbe signed by the President. This prevents the balanced budget amendment \nfrom being too easily waived.\n  Thus, taken together, section 5 allows the country to defend itself \nbut also protects against a waiver that is borne more of a desire to \navoid the tough choices needed to balance the budget than of military \nneed.\n  Section 6 states:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation, which may rely on estimates of \n     outlays and receipts.\n\n  This section makes explicit what is implicit. The Congress has a \npositive obligation to fashion legislation to enforce this article. \nSection 6 underscores Congress' continuing role in implementing the \nbalanced budget requirement. This provision precludes any \ninterpretation of the amendment that would result in a shift in the \nbalance of powers among branches of Government.\n  We have heard from time to time claims by opponents of the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment that the President or the courts will \nbecome unduly involved in enforcing the amendment. This section, \ntogether with the plethora of legal precedent and documents, shows that \nsuch claims are misplaced.\n  This provision also gives Congress appropriate flexibility with which \nto fashion the implementing legislation by permitting reliance on \nestimates. Since obviously no one can predict the future with absolute \ncertainty, we must rely on estimates when we plan budgets. This \nprovision recognizes that we must rely on estimates to make the \nconstitutional amendment workable.\n  Section 7 defines ``receipts,'' ``outlays.''\n  Section 7 defines receipts and outlays. Receipts do not include money \nfrom borrowing--it is high time we stopped thinking of borrowing as a \nnormal source of income. Outlays do not include money used to repay \ndebt principle. This will further encourage future Congresses to start \nto pay down our mammoth debt.\n  Perhaps more than any other section, opponents try to change this one \nmost often. By altering the definitions of receipts and outlays they \nknow they could tear a giant loophole in the balanced budget amendment. \nSo they come forth with a parade of exemptions, for every interest \nunder the sun, and each would provide those who are addicted to debt a \nway to get their fiscal fix. We must not allow it. The supporters of \nhonest, fiscal responsibility should not be distracted from their goal \nof balancing the budget in spite of the desires to respond to all \nmanner of sympathetic political causes.\n  Finally, section 8 states that the amendment will take effect in 2002 \nor 2 years after it is adopted, whichever is later. This will allow \nCongress a period to consider and adopt the necessary procedures to \nimplement the amendment, and to begin the process of balancing the \nbudget.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me reiterate that the balanced \nbudget amendment is the only way we are going to be able to balance the \nbudget. We have tried statutes, they don't work. We have tried \nmustering the political will, it hasn't worked. And we have tried just \nletting the debt grow, that can't work. We need to end our cycle of \ndebt with a hard and fast rule, that cannot be easily discarded when it \nbecomes inconvenient. We need the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, let me respond to a few charges which have been \nleveled against the amendment.\n  Some suggest a conflict between the general requirement of balance \nand the allowance for a waiver.\n  Allowing for a waiver by vote is not inconsistent with the purpose of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, which is to make it harder to borrow as a \ngeneral matter, yet provide flexibility to borrow in case of need \ndemonstrated by the appropriate consensus.\n  Section 6 of Senate Joint Resolution 1 provides that ``Congress shall \nenforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation, which \nmay rely on estimates of outlays and receipts.'' To be sure, reliance \non good faith estimates is necessary to make the balanced budget \namendment workable. No budget cannot be balanced to the penny; \nparticularly the $1.6 trillion Federal budget.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment contend that this reliance \non estimates is improper because CBO budgetary estimates are not always \nprecisely accurate, specifically if you compare the estimates for the \nbeginning of the fiscal year with what the actual numbers are at the \nend of the fiscal year. It seems to me that by definition an estimate \nis not necessarily going to match up to the exact figures at the end of \nthe year. But that is no reason to stop using estimates. They are a \nreasonable and logical way to approach the uncertainty inherent in \ntrying to predict the future.\n  The balanced budget amendment will still function smoothly even given \nthis lack of absolute certainty at the beginning of the year. If, over \nthe course of the fiscal year outlays exceed receipts in a way not \npreviously anticipated, we have two choices. We can either pass a \nreconciliation bill to bring the budget back into balance, or, if \nnecessary, we can waive the balanced budget rule for that year as \nprovided for in the text of the amendment.\n  Further, under the Budget Act, both OMB--for the President's budget \nestimate--and CBO by law must provide for three budgetary estimates: \none at the beginning of the fiscal year, the second as a mid-course \ncorrection, and the last before the end of the fiscal year. Thus, there \nexists a statutory fine-tuning process that assures a degree of \naccuracy--not perfect accuracy--but one that provides for workable \nbudgetary estimates. If we see during the course of the year that our \nestimates are going to be off, we have time to make the necessary \ncorrections.\n\n  I believe that reliance on estimates is both reasonable and sound. If \nwe did not permit a reliance on estimates, I have little doubt that \nsomeone on the other side would be on the Senate floor arguing that the \nbalanced budget amendment would be unworkable because it does not let \nus rely on estimates.\n  The bottom line is that at the beginning of the year, we have no \ncrystal ball, only reasonable estimates to work from. The balanced \nbudget amendment accepts that plain truth and accordingly provides for \nthe use of estimates. We use budget estimates in Congress every day. \nThe President just sent a budget that he claims will balance by 2002. \nThat is an estimate. We will pass a budget resolution here in the \nSenate, and that will rely on estimates. The balanced budget amendment \nmerely continues this time-honored, logical, and reasonable practice.\n  If the opponents of the balanced budget amendment succeed, we will be \ncondemning our children to even higher debt, even higher taxes, and \neven lower wages, by any estimate. I hope that everyone in the Senate \nwill keep that in mind as this debate continues.\n  The Senator raises two points that were discussed in the committee \nreport that accompanied Senate Joint Resolution 1. While I understand \nthe concerns, I believe that they are based on a misreading of the \nreport.\n  The report allows that, ``Congress could decide that a deficit caused \nby a temporary, self-correcting drop in receipts or increase in outlays \nduring the fiscal year would not violate the article.'' This does not \nmean that the budget will be out of balance at the end of the year. It \nsimply states that the budget need not be in perfect balance every \nsecond of the year. And there is nothing in the text of the balanced \nbudget amendment to indicate that it should. However, the temporary \ncondition described in the committee report must be self-correcting by \nthe conclusion of the fiscal year, in order to avoid a three-fifths \nvote. I see no harm in allowing this flexibility during the course of \nthe year.\n  Additionally, the report states that Congress could permit negligible \ndeviations be made up in the next year. Again, this is not nearly as \nremarkable as some have made it out to be. We all know that sometimes \nthe very last few outlays and receipts of the year are not known until \nafter the fiscal year is over. The balanced budget amendment neither \nrequires nor envisions that this logistical truth become a problem. In \nsuch an event, the Congress could provide itself with the flexibility \nto make up any negligible deficits to be made up the next year. What is \ncrucial is that the funds must be made up, thus keeping us in balance. \nIt simply would not make any sense to bring the Government to a halt \nover a 4-cent deficit.\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\nAnd the balanced budget amendment does not require that we do. That is \nall that this statement in the committee report is saying.\n  Some opponents claim that the BBA is too inflexible. It has been \nrepeatedly referred to as a ``straightjacket.'' On the other hand, we \nalso hear that the BBA is not stringent enough. In fact, the balanced \nbudget amendment strikes just the right balance between strict \nprovisions to counter the strong incentives in Congress to deficit \nspend and the reasonable flexibility necessary for the amendment to \nfunction in the real world.\n  What we need to do is focus on the problem--our national debt is over \n$5.3 trillion and climbing. Only the balanced budget amendment will put \nus in a position to end that climb.\n  Meeting the requirements of the balanced budget will require a \nheightened vigilance of Congress; it will require that the Federal \nGovernment be more aware of and concerned about our borrowing and \nspending habits. No, it will not be as easy as simply spending and then \nborrowing if we did not plan well. It will require that we plan better \nand be better stewards over that plan. I think that is appropriate, \ngiven the importance of the problem, and of our duty.\n  The point has also been raised that Congress will not know precisely \nif we are in balance of the size of the deficit to the dollar before \nthe end of the year. That is why we have the workable flexibility of \nrelying on estimates, yet we will need to plan and administer the \nprocess with care.\n  Congress may and should shoot for a small surplus to avoid a last \nminute unforseen deficit, and if the estimates near the end of the year \nsuggest we will run a deficit, we can approve a deficit at the high end \nof the estimates. If we approve an estimate that is slightly larger \nthan we needed, it is not like we actually spent the money.\n  While some may say that relying on estimates creates a loophole, I \nsubmit that the risks of this provision are substantially less than our \ncurrent process of simply spending and borrowing as a matter of course.\n\n\n                      debt ceiling super majority\n\n  Concerns have also been raised that under section 2 it will be too \nhard to get the three-fifths currently required and that a minority in \nCongress will be able to hold us hostage with the threat of forcing a \ndefault. For one thing, threatening default is not likely.\n  This Nation has never defaulted on its debt. And let me tell you, if \nthis country ever reached a point where there were 41 Senators, nearly \nthe entire current Democratic membership of the Senate, who were so \nmilitantly disillusioned with this Nation that they were truly willing \nto let us default on our debt, the 60-vote requirement to raise the \ndebt ceiling would be the least of our problems.\n  Now, the opponents of the three-fifths requirement cite the budget \nbattles of last Congress as evidence that it is sometimes difficult to \nraise the debt limit. But Mr. David Malpass, an expert on financial \nmarkets who testified at the Judiciary Committee's hearings, showed \nthat those very budget battles--where the word ``default'' was being \nbandied about with regularity--were seen by the markets as a very \npositive step. Indeed, he noted that ``The U.S. bond market had a very \nstrong rally from August 1995 through January 1996, with yields falling \nfrom 6.9 percent to 6.0 percent.'' He termed this as a very significant \npositive development for the economy.\n  Through all the tumult and uncertainty of those budget battles, \nAmerican investors were excited and encouraged that Congress was \nfinally moving towards a balanced budget. That encouragement manifested \nitself in lower interest rates, which in turn is the kind of market \nconditions that can help us balance the budget and strengthen the \neconomy.\n  Mr. Malpass was prescient enough to foresee this very objection to \nthe balanced budget amendment when he wrote:\n\n       Financial markets are practical. [T]he threat of a default \n     would not be taken seriously as long as both the \n     Administration and Congress expressed the intention not to \n     default. The requirement of a super-majority would not affect \n     this calculation.\n\n  A step toward fiscal discipline like passing a solid balanced budget \namendment would similarly be viewed positively by the markets. Enacting \na weakened one, one like the proposal before us contemplates, with no \nreal debt limit restraint, would undermine the amendment's credibility \nand its effectiveness.\n\n  We have a choice--we can either continue on the downward spiral of \nmore debt, higher interest rates, higher taxes, and lower incomes, or \nwe can move ahead with the balanced budget amendment and lower interest \nrates, lower taxes, with greater job growth and a stronger overall \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, we already have several supermajority requirements in \nthe Constitution. Some were in the original text, some have been added \nby amendment. The one thing they have in common is that they were all \nmeant to come into play in unusual circumstances. That is what we \nexpect of the balanced budget amendment, that the vote to raise the \ndebt of this Nation be an unusual circumstance.\n  Those who believe the supermajority vote will be the rule rather than \nthe exception betray their mental habit of thinking in terms of deficit \nspending. We must break this habit and make deficit spending the \nexception instead of the rule. The balanced budget amendment does not \nrequire a supermajority to pass a budget--only a budget that is out of \nbalance. The balanced budget amendment creates a positive incentive for \ncurrent majorities to avoid borrowing to avoid supermajority votes and \nrisking the kind of intrigue opponents say could happen when \nsupermajorities are required. This is wholly appropriate and reasonable \nto break Congress of its borrowing habit.\n  The debt ceiling has sometimes been raised by supermajorities and \noften it has been raised by simple majorities. What is important is \nthat we have never defaulted. When we have had to have the votes, the \nnecessary votes have always been there. When votes are tallied, it is \neasy for Members to vote against raising the debt ceiling, knowing that \nthe ceiling will be raised. I expect when we are living under the \nbalanced budget amendment, once again, the necessary votes will be \nthere, but not many more than necessary, because Members may wish to \nvote against it knowing the necessary votes are there.\n  Let me conclude with some comments on the objections to \nsupermajorities in Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  According to Prof. Harvey Mansfield, Jr. of Harvard, in his scholarly \nbook ``The Taming of the Prince,'' the real genius of our Constitution \nis that having placed all power in the hands of its citizenry, the \nAmerican people consented to restraints on that power. Understanding \nthat direct or pure democracies in history were inherently unstable and \nfickle, the Framers placed restraints on popular rule and congressional \npower--what we now call supermajority requirements.\n  Let me mention some of them: Article I, section 3, the Senate may \nconvict on an impeachment with a two-thirds vote; article I, section 5, \neach House may expel a Member with a two-thirds vote; article I, \nsection 7, a Presidential veto is overridden by a two-thirds vote of \neach House; article II, section 2, the Senate advises and consents to \ntreaties with a two-thirds vote; article V, a constitutional amendment \nrequires two-thirds of each House or a constitutional convention can be \ncalled by two-thirds of the State legislatures, and three-quarters of \nthe State legislatures must ratify; article VII, the Constitution \nitself required ratification of 9 of the 13 States; the 12th amendment \nrequires a quorum of two-thirds of the States in the House to choose a \nPresident and a majority of States is required to elect the President, \nthe same requirements exist for the Senate choosing the Vice-President; \nthe 25th amendment, dealing with the President's competency and \nremoval, requires that if Congress is not in session within 21 days \nafter Congress is required to assemble, it must determine by two-thirds \nvote of both Houses that the President is unable to discharge the \nduties of his office.\n\n  The Constitution requires that a supermajority approve a \nconstitutional amendment. To pass the balanced budget amendment, we \nmust have 67 Senators vote for it. Is this inappropriate? Or should we \nallow some number between 26 and 51, or 50 with the Vice-\n\n[[Page S1287]]\n\nPresident casting the tie-breaking vote to approve the balanced budget \namendment? The Constitution requires that three fourths of the States \nratify the balanced budget amendment. Perhaps our majoritarian friends \nwould prefer that some number of States between 26 and 51 ratify the \namendment, with the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, or Guam casting \na tie-breaking vote if the States are evenly divided.\n  Mr. President, if majority rule were the fundamental principle of our \nGovernment, as I have heard some in this debate say, we would not have \nthe Government we do. We would have a unicameral parliamentary system \nwithout judicial review, and indeed without the Bill of Rights or a \nwritten Constitution, because each of those features of our Government \nis an intrusion into the principle of majority rule. And they are \ncertainly not the only examples.\n  The first amendment does not say Congress shall not abridge free \nspeech unless a fletting majority wants to. It does not say that \nCongress shall not interfere with the free exercise of religion or \nestablish a religion, unless a majority of those present and voting \nwant to. The first amendment takes those options away from even \nsupermajorities of Congress, except through constitutional amendment. \nShall we tear up the Bill of Rights and the Constitution because they \ncontain checks on the power of transient majorities? I do not think so.\n  As I have said, as Thomas Jefferson said, as even Professor Tribe has \nsaid, the power of transient majorities to saddle minorities or future \nmajorities with debt is the kind of infringement on fundamental rights \nthat deserves constitutional protection. The Framers wished to protect \nlife, liberty, and property; they reacted harshly against taxation \nwithout representation. As I have pointed out throughout this debate, \nour deficit spending taxes generations which are not now represented; \nit takes their property and their economic liberty. It is wholly \nappropriate that we at least increase the consensus of those currently \nrepresented to allow them to shackle those who are not--future \ngenerations--with the debt, the taxes, and the economic servitude that \ngo with citizenship in a country with high national debt.\n  Mr. President, opponents of the balanced budget amendment charge that \nsupermajority requirements will create some new kind of sinister \nbargaining among factions to gain advantage in return for supporting \nthe necessary consensus. This objection strikes me as strange because \nthat kind of negotiation is as old as the legislative process. It \nhappens now in the search for a majority.\n  Mr. President, under the balanced budget amendment, majorities will \ncontinue to set budget priorities from year to year. Only if the \nmajority attempts to borrow money from future generations to pay for \nits priorities would there have to be a supermajority vote. This allows \na minority to play the conscience of the Nation and protect future \ngenerations from the type of borrowing sprees we have seen in recent \ndecades.\n  I would note, Mr. President, that those who believe the supermajority \nvote will be the rule rather than the exception betray their mental \nhabit of thinking in terms of deficit spending. We must break this \nhabit and make deficit spending the exception instead of the rule. The \nbalanced budget amendment does not require a supermajority to pass a \nbudget--only a budget that is out of balance. The balanced budget \namendment creates a positive incentive for current majorities to avoid \nborrowing to avoid supermajority votes and risking the kind of intrigue \nopponents say could happen when supermajorities are required. This is \nwholly appropriate and reasonable to break Congress of its borrowing \nhabit.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely clear that to restore the \nconstitutional concept of limited government and its protection of \nliberty--as well as to restore fiscal and economic sanity--we must pass \nthis balanced budget amendment. We need the supermajority provisions of \nSenate Joint Resolution 1--a modern day ``auxiliary precaution'' in \nMadison's words--to put teeth into the balanced budget amendment--to be \na force to end business as usual here in Congress--and most important, \nto foster the liberty of limited government that the Framers believed \nto be essential.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I would on the Senator's time. I think our time is running \ndown. I know some others want to speak. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time do I have?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time is remaining for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-three minutes for Senator Hatch and 40 \nminutes for Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield on that basis, that this----\n  Mr. BYRD. Be attributed to the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. He might prefer to finish before entertaining questions----\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to. Listen, my friend from West Virginia, I \nam happy to accommodate him any time I can. I know how sincere he is. I \nknow the efforts that he put forth this morning in making his eloquent \nstatement. I am happy to yield, if he desires me to, at this time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator undertaking to----\n  Mr. HATCH. Under those circumstances.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator addressing the concerns I expressed this \nmorning, as I went down the amendment section by section, or is he \nmerely reading the various sections?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am undertaking to explain some of them. I believe that I \nwill do so some more tomorrow or when we get back from recess. But I am \nmaking an effort to do some explanation here today. And, hopefully, I \nam explaining away some of the difficulties that the distinguished \nSenator has raised.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will say that I will make more specific responses later.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator explain to me why the Judiciary \nCommittee, in its analysis of section 6, took the pains to explain that \n```estimates,''' for example, ``means good faith, responsible, and \nreasonable estimates made with honest intent to implement section 1,'' \nwithout also indicating in the committee report the definition of what \nis meant by ``good faith,'' what is meant by the word ``responsible,'' \nwhat is meant by the word ``reasonable'' in connection with the word \n``estimates''?\n  Mr. HATCH. I believe any reasonable interpretation of section 6 knows \nthat there is no way--and the distinguished Senator was right when he \nmade the comment earlier in the day--that there is no way of absolutely \nbeing accurate on estimates. We have to do the best we can to estimate \nthe outlays and receipts at the beginning or at some time during each \nyear for the next succeeding year. There is just no question about it, \nbecause there is no way we can absolutely predict what will happen in \nthe future. But I think through implementing legislation we can resolve \nthe budgetary problems with regard to estimating outlays and receipts \nin a way that would be workable. And we would have to do so under this \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Under the same terms I would, on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I ask the distinguished Senator, who is going to be the \njudge of whether an estimate has been rendered in good faith, whether \nit is a responsible estimate, or whether there is a reasonable \nestimate?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the terms of the committee report should be given \nthe ordinary dictionary meaning. I think that is the way we would have \nto do it. But Members of Congress would be responsible. Members would \ndefine them.\n  Mr. BYRD. Members of the Congress will be the judge as to whether an \nestimate is responsible?\n  Mr. HATCH. We are today, of all of the estimates. We will have to be.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will allow me to use a chart, this chart \nshows the estimated revenues annually from 1980 to 1996. If the Senator \nwill notice, in each of these years, keeping in mind that the green \nline means that the estimate was right on target----\n  Mr. HATCH. Or above target?\n  Mr. BYRD. No. The green line means the estimate was, indeed, right on \ntarget. It was not above or below the line. It was not too high. It was \nnot too low.\n\n[[Page S1288]]\n\n  Would the Senator agree with me that based on this chart, in every \nyear from 1980 to 1996, the estimate was wrong? It was off. It was not \ncorrect. In some years the revenues were more than estimated and in \nsome years they were less than estimated. The point of the chart being \nto show that the estimates have never been absolutely correct. In many \ninstances they have varied; in one instance here, $78 billion. The \nestimate was off $78 billion. In another instance, the estimate was off \n$65 billion.\n  This is the record. This is not a Member's estimate here of what \nshould have been in each of those particular years. This is the record. \nThese bars indicate what went wrong, by how much the estimate was off \nfor each year. Would the Senator tend to believe that in the future the \nestimates are going to be better than they have been on this chart, \nwhich represents 17 years of experience?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer the first question. Here are 28 years of \nsimilar inaccurate estimates. Wait, wait, let me make my point. Here \nare 28 years of missed estimates. We have been wrong every time in 28 \nyears and we have been wrong because these are all unbalanced budgets.\n  I agree with the Senator on the second question. Yes, from 1980 to \n1996 we have been wrong every time on estimates. On a couple of \noccasions not very wrong, but during all of that period, the whole 28 \nyears since 1968 and during all of the period between 1980 and 1996 we \ndid not function pursuant to a balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. What makes the Senator believe----\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could finish my remarks.\n  Under the Budget Act, CBO and OMB give estimates each year. CBO is \nthe Congressional Budget Office; OMB is the Office of Management and \nBudget. They correct the estimates twice during the year as they \nacquire new data. Congress ultimately has to decide how you balance the \ndifferences.\n  Now, we should plan to get above balance, as the usual course. Most \nyears we should try to stay above balance with regard to estimates and \ntry to stay on the course by amended estimates through the year. That \nis what we will have to do. I think the implementing legislation will \ndo that.\n  Let me make another comment, and I will turn back to my dear \ncolleague. Meeting the requirements of the balanced budget amendment \nwill require a heightened vigilance of Congress. It is apparent it will \nmake us get tough on budgets. During those years we had five different \nstatutory balanced budget approaches that led us to that morass and \nthis morass. What we are saying is that the balanced budget amendment \nwill require us to have a heightened vigilance in the Congress. It will \nrequire that the Federal Government be more aware of and concerned \nabout borrowing and spending habits. No, it will not be as easy as \nsimply spending and then borrowing if we do not plan. It will require \nthat we plan better and that we use better standards in that planning. \nI think it is appropriate, given the importance of this problem and the \nduty we owe to our country.\n  Now, I think what I am saying is, I agree with my colleague. He makes \na very compelling point here that we have not been very accurate in \nestimating receipts, in estimating outlays and receipts through the 16 \nyears, although I say through 28 years, or 58 of the last 66 years, we \nhave run unbalanced budgets. One reason is we have relied on statutory \nschemes that have been circumvented in every one of those years, none \nof which have really worked. The distinguished Senator, by the way, to \nhis credit, pointed out that some of those statutory schemes at the \ntime would not work. I believe some of the rest of us felt that way as \nwell.\n\n  What we are saying is from 1997 on, or whenever this amendment is \nratified and becomes law and part of the Constitution, by the year 2002 \non, and really before that if we can get it ratified before then, we \nare going to no longer have the luxury of these inaccurate estimates. \nWe will have to do a better job. We will have to be more vigilant. We \nare going to have to heighten that vigilance, and we will have to meet \nthe requirement of a balanced budget or face the music of having to \nstand up and vote for higher deficits or more spending by supermajority \nvotes.\n  I think comparing this time and saying, because we have been \ninaccurate during times when statutory methods have not worked, with \npost-balanced-budget-amendment-enactment times where we will have to be \nmore vigilant and we will have to come up with a way of being accurate \nduring the year--right, OMB and CBO now only check that twice. We are \ngoing to have to do a much better job.\n  Now, can we be absolutely accurate? Everybody knows we cannot.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the point.\n  Mr. HATCH. There is no way you can. I do not want to keep going with \nthis system and then this system when we have an alternative that \nreally would put some fiscal discipline in the Constitution that makes \nus get serious.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield under the same set of circumstances.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator does not want to continue with this system. He \nrefers to this system as a statutory system. And yet--and yet--the \namendment itself tells us who will enforce this amendment once it is in \nthe Constitution.\n  I will read it from section 6:\n\n       The Congress shall enforce and implement this article by \n     appropriate legislation.\n\n  So we are going to continue to enforce it. We are going to continue \nto operate under a statutory system. That is what I am saying. We have \nbeen operating under a statutory system. This amendment says we will \ncontinue to operate under a statutory system because it says that the \nCongress will enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation.\n  What makes the Senator feel that under the new statutory system, that \nthe estimates will be any better than they have been under the old \nstatutory system when both systems are going to be the work of the \nCongress?\n  Mr. HATCH. You mean under the new constitutional system if this \nbecomes----\n  Mr. BYRD. There will not be any different system because the Congress \nitself will enforce that amendment by appropriate legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer that question. You have raised a point that \nCongress will not know precisely if we are in balance or a deficit to \nthe exact dollar before the end of each year. That is why we have the \nworkable flexibility of relying on estimates. Yet we will need a plan \nto administer that process with care.\n  Now, Congress may, and I think this would become the norm, instead of \nnow just planning on deficits, Congress may and should plan for a small \nsurplus to avoid a last-minute, unforeseen deficit. If the estimates \nnear the end of the year suggest we will run a deficit, we can approve \na deficit at the high end of the estimates. If we approve an estimate \nthat is slightly larger than is needed, it is not like actually \nspending the money. While some may say relying on estimates creates a \nloophole, I submit that the risks are substantially less than our \ncurrent process of spending and borrowing, and that is exhibited by \nthese 28 years of unbalanced budgets. That has been the matter of \ncourse. I think we have to change course, and I think the normalcy--I \nthink the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, if I know him as \nwell as I think I do, would be leading the fight to have at least small \nsurpluses each year to take care of any fluctuations that might occur. \nI don't think he would permit us to get into this mess, which neither \nhe nor I have been able to prevent under the current statutory scheme. \nBut under a balanced budget amendment, we are going to have to be real.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. This is not going to be real--section 6. It is not real. It \ntalks about estimates. Now we are going to switch from section 1, which \nsays total outlays shall not exceed total receipts in any fiscal year. \nIn the first place, how do we know whether the outlays have exceeded \nthe receipts before the end of the fiscal year, or even two or three \nweeks subsequent to the end of the fiscal year? That is number one. \nNumber two, then, we switch to estimates. Why do you proponents of the \namendment purport to do two things--one, in the first section, balance \noutlays with receipts--no ifs, ands, or buts--to the exact dollar. But \nin section 6, they say, well, just forget about section 1 and balance \nthe estimates. We have all seen how the estimates run.\n\n[[Page S1289]]\n\n The estimating is going to be done by the very same people, under the \namendment, as have been doing the estimating prior to the adoption of \nthe amendment.\n  The proponents are promising, absolutely pledging to the people of \nthe United States, that this amendment will balance the budget. That is \nwhat they are promising. The Senator just said that. We cannot possibly \nget the estimates right. The Senator just said that. We can't possibly \nget the estimates right.\n  Well, then, may I ask the Senator, are we not misleading the American \npeople with these elaborate claims that we are going to balance the \nbudget when what we are really going to balance is the estimates? Then \nthe Senator admits that we can't be accurate in these estimates. We \nnever have been, and we never will be. There won't be any computers \nmade that will come up with the correct estimates.\n  Mr. HATCH. This amendment does not mandate a balanced budget as the \nonly option. This amendment requires us to move toward a balanced \nbudgets, because it requires a balanced budget or supermajority votes \nif we are going to run deficits. So the pressures----\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could be allowed to finish. So the pressures will be \non us to try to have surpluses rather than continue to spend, because \nsooner or later we have to face the music. Let me make this point. The \naccuracy of estimates is self-correcting, because OMB and CBO must, by \nlaw, correct their estimates twice a year, under current practices. \nUsually, the original estimates are always off by OMB and CBO. Under \nthe current system, there is not nearly as much pressure to be accurate \nas there will be under the constitutional amendment system, if we pass \nthis by the requisite two-thirds vote of both Houses and it is ratified \nby three-quarters of the States. So what if CBO and OMB correct it? The \nbalanced budget amendment does nothing to correct that procedure. It \nputs pressure on them to, maybe, do more than twice a year corrections.\n  The balanced budget amendment actually will further budgetary \ndiscipline. Congress is the one that must always enforce the system. \nEvery one of us take an oath to uphold the Constitution. If this \nbecomes part of the Constitution, we will have to live up to that oath. \nWe will have to devise a system that really does it. We will still \noperate under a statutory system of implementing the constitutional \nrule. We can't order perfection; not even we can order perfection. But \nthe balanced budget amendment will put the appropriate amount of \npressure on Congress, which is not there now, as easily can be seen by \nthe Senator's very important chart. It will put the pressure on \nCongress to ensure truthfulness.\n  Public reactions will punish those who act cowardly. Everybody will \nknow because we will always have to vote. We can't do it on voice votes \nanymore, or hide it in the dead of the night, which I know Senator Byrd \nunderstands well and does not approve of, as I don't. We would all have \nto stand up and vote, and the public will know who has voted which way. \nThey are going to expect us to do a far better job than that which has \ndone and than these 28 years of unbalanced budgets.\n\n  Let us be honest. There is no way anybody can absolutely, accurately \ntell what the outlays and receipts are going to be in advance. When we \nsay ``total outlays of any fiscal year shall not exceed,'' it has to be \nwritten that way because that is the force that says, Congress, your \nestimates better be good, a lot better than these statutory estimates \nwe have had in the past, because then we will be under a constraint to \nbalance the budget, or vote by a supermajority vote not to balance it. \nThat is the difference.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, permit me to say \nthat I have the utmost admiration for the distinguished Senator from \nUtah.\n  Mr. HATCH. And vice versa.\n  Mr. BYRD. I marvel at his equanimity, his characteristic, and his \nnever-failing courtesy. This is the way he has always been with me. But \nI must say that, notwithstanding that, I am amazed to hear the \ndistinguished Senator stand on the floor this afternoon and admit that \nthis amendment doesn't require a balanced budget.\n  Mr. HATCH. It doesn't--it's not the only option.\n  Mr. BYRD. What about that, he said it again. It doesn't.\n  Mr. HATCH. It doesn't. We can do whatever we want to. We just have to \nvote to have an unbalanced budget by the required supermajority or \nmargin.\n  Mr. BYRD. What about all the Senators coming to the floor and saying \nthe sky is falling, debt is bad, interest on the debt is bad, deficits \nare bad, and we have to do something about it and take the burden off \nour children, and vote for a balanced budget amendment?\n  The Senator has been perfectly honest. He says this amendment doesn't \nrequire a balanced budget. Well, let's quit saying, then, that it \nrequires a balanced budget. He is saying that the estimates here are \nwrong. He may be implying that the people who make the estimates, once \nthe constitutional amendment is adopted, will have greater expertise \nthan those, who are the best in the world right now, who made these \nestimates.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has the floor, so I am glad to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate that, to make a comment. I believe there is \nno question that they would do a better job, because there won't be the \nsame number of games played on budget matters if everybody knows that \nwe have the constraint of either balancing the budget, or voting on a \nsupermajority not to balance it. We all have to face our electorate. \nRight now, we do a lot of these things for by voice votes and other \nshenanigans that help to cause these things. When I say ``we,'' I would \nrather say ``they,'' because I try not to, and I know the Senator tries \nnot to. But it's apparent in that our current system isn't working. I \nthink your chart makes one of the best arguments for the balanced \nbudget amendment of any chart we have had up here in this whole debate, \nbecause it shows that what we are doing right now, and what we have \ndone for 28 solid years, doesn't work.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well then, why are we going to wait 5 years to do something \nbetter if the Senator has something better?\n  Mr. HATCH. We are not. If we pass this through the Senate--hopefully, \nwithin the next week or so--by the requisite two-thirds vote, and it \npasses through the House by the requisite two-thirds vote, that is a \nnotice to everybody in these two bodies that we better start hustling \nto get a real balanced budget by 2002, where all of us know that the \nonly part of the President's budget that really counts is next year's \nbudget.\n  It is not the budget as extrapolated out to 2002, especially since 75 \npercent of it is balanced in the last 2 years after he leaves office. \nNo, it is this next year, and each year thereafter. If we passed this \nand it is submitted to the States, I can't predict what the States \nwould do. I believe they would ratify this amendment if we have the \nguts to pass it through both Houses of Congress. And if they ratify \nthis amendment, then, by gosh, I have to tell you that I think the game \nwill be over. We will not be able to do this anymore. There will have \nto be rollcall votes under the same terms.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Certainly.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator speaks of guts. It doesn't take \nguts to vote for this thing. It takes guts to vote against it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it takes guts both ways.\n  Mr. BYRD. It takes guts to vote against it because the great majority \nof the American people have been bamboozled about this amendment. They \nsupport this, and they are very much in favor of it. So it takes guts \nto vote against it.\n  Why does the distinguished Senator think, No. 1, that we are going to \nbe any better at our estimates once this amendment is adopted than we \nhave been in the past? That is No. 1.\n  Then he talks about--he said something to the effect that once we get \nthis amendment in place, as I understood he was saying to the effect \nthat we will not be able to find ways around it, or some such.\n  Mr. HATCH. We will not be able to get around these things with voice \nvotes. We will have to stand up and vote by rollcall.\n\n[[Page S1290]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. We can vote now by rollcall vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. But we don't, and there is nothing that requires us to do \nso, necessarily.\n  Mr. BYRD. Except the Constitution, if one-fifth indicate that they \nwant to vote. That doesn't happen often. That is very seldom on raising \nthe debt limit. That is very seldom on passing the final budget here.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me answer the distinguished Senator's question. It is \na good question.\n  The reason that I think we will be more accurate afterwards is \nbecause the incentives will switch. The incentives will switch because \nunless we balance the budget year after year and start working toward \nsurpluses and not working on deficits, we are going to be in real \ntrouble constitutionally, and we all know that. There will no longer be \nthe game that occurred during the 1980 and 1996 years, as shown by the \nSenator's very interesting chart. I think that makes one of the best \ncases I have ever seen for the balanced budget amendment, because the \ncurrent system is not working.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Always.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think the committee report language that was prepared by \nthe committee, of which the distinguished Senator from Utah is \nchairman, makes one of the best cases against this amendment. He says \nthere won't be any more games played. Take a look at this report. It \ntells you what games to play.\n  Let me read it. Talking about the estimates of outlays and receipts, \nit says, ``Estimates means good faith, responsible, and reasonable \nestimates made with honest intent to implement section 1, and not evade \nit. This provision gives Congress an appropriate degree of \nflexibility.''\n  We have got more and more ways to play games.\n  It ``gives Congress an appropriate degree of flexibility in \nfashioning necessary implementing legislation. For example, Congress \ncould use estimates of receipts or outlays at the beginning of the \nfiscal year to determine what the balanced budget requirement of \nsection 1 would be so long as the estimates are reasonable and made in \ngood faith.''\n  Now we are going to play games about who is reasonable, what is \nreasonable, and what isn't.\n  ``In addition, Congress could decide that a deficit caused by a \ntemporary self-correcting drop in receipts or increase in outlays \nduring the fiscal year would not violate the article. Similarly, \nCongress could state that very small or negligible deviations from a \nbalanced budget would not represent a violation of section 1.''\n  Will the distinguished Senator indicate to me what would be \nconsidered ``negligible,'' what would be considered ``small,'' and what \nwould be considered ``not small,'' and ``not negligible''? We have a \nbudget now of $1.7 trillion. Let us say it is off by $50 billion. Would \nthat be ``negligible''? Would that be ``small,'' $50 billion?\n  Mr. HATCH. I think the Senator is very logical. But he also has to \nallow the logic to take into account that Congress may, as I said \nbefore, and should shoot for a small surplus--the incentives will be to \nhave surpluses to avoid a last-minute unforeseen deficit. And if the \nestimates near the end of the year suggest that we are going to run a \ndeficit, then it would be a simple matter for us to approve a deficit \nat the high end of the estimates. If we approve an estimated deficit \nthat is slightly larger than we need, it is not like we actually spent \nthe money.\n  Again, I will say some may say that relying on estimates creates a \nloophole. But there is no other workable way to do it. I submit that \nthe risks that might arise from those provisions in the constitutional \namendment are substantially less than our current process, which is \nclearly not working, of simply spending and borrowing with no \nrestraints whatsoever.\n  I go back to my point. The distinguished Senator may be right in this \nregard. Perhaps Senators should not come out here and say, ``This is \ngoing to always make us balance the budget.'' I think, more accurately, \nit should be said that the incentives will be toward balancing the \nbudget, because you will have supermajority votes of three-fifths in \norder to run deficits, or you will have to have constitutional \nmajorities to increase taxes, which means at least 51 Senators would \nhave to vote for it, and at least 218 Members of the House. That puts \npressure on Members of both parties to be accurate, and it puts \npressure on them to try to get surpluses rather than deficits. It puts \npressure on them in writing implementing legislation to make sure you \nhave legislation that really does work rather than the five failed \nplans that we have had since 1978, none of which have worked. My friend \nand colleague knows that. I don't know of anybody more intelligent and \nmore concerned about these matters than the distinguished Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could just finish this one sentence, but I have to \nsay that his chart makes my case better than I have made it. I \ncongratulate him for it, and I am grateful that he has put the chart \nup, because I don't know how anybody can argue for the current system \nwhen you look at that chart.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let's take a look at this chart. The green line, the \nhorizontal line, means that the estimated revenues were right on \ntarget. They were not overestimated. They were not underestimated. The \nrevenues were exactly estimated to be exactly on target.\n  Note the chart which the Senator says makes his case. The chart says \nthat in only one year, 1987, did the estimates even come close to being \non target. They were off just $2 billion. So the chart makes my case.\n  The committee says you can do it by estimates. ``Estimates of outlays \nshall not exceed estimates of receipts in any given fiscal year.'' The \nchart shows that you cannot depend upon the estimates, that the people \nwho have the most expertise of any in the world cannot be accurate in \ntheir estimates. Why? Because we cannot foresee what the unemployment \nrate is going to be, we cannot foresee what the rate of national \neconomic growth is going to be, and we cannot see what interest rates \nare going to be in a year or more down the road. That is why people \ncannot be accurate in their estimates.\n  So this committee language makes my case--makes my case when it turns \nto the use of words like ``estimates,'' and then defines the word \n``estimates'' as meaning ``good faith, responsible, and reasonable \nestimates made with honest intent to implement section 1.''\n  Let me ask the question of my dear friend, who will be making up \nthese estimates?\n  The Congress will make the estimates. The Congress will enforce the \namendment. So what assurance is there that the Congress is going to \nmake estimates that are correct?\n  What encouragement does that give to the American people to believe \nthat this amendment, which the distinguished Senator from Utah says \ndoes not say we are going to balance the budget, what assurance can the \nAmerican people have when it is even worse than that by saying that the \nestimates of outlays will not exceed the estimate of receipts?\n  Mr. HATCH. Frankly, I think if you have the incentives to produce \nmore accurate estimates of receipts and outlays, there will be an \nincentive to have the top line have the bars going up every time, where \nright now we do not have that incentive. We have every incentive to \njust spend today. There is no restraint on spending whatsoever. The \nbalanced budget amendment would not mandate that you balance the budget \nif a supermajority is willing to vote not to, but it does change the \nincentive so that literally you will not want to go into deficit \nbecause sooner or later you are going to have to pay the piper under \nthat amendment. Again, I think the Senator's chart makes my case.\n  Mr. BYRD. What makes the Senator----\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think I need the Senator's chart to make the case \nthat our country is in trouble, that we are not doing what is right, \nthat we are continuing to spend us into bankruptcy. And even though \nthere are arguments made that we are only going to have a $107 billion \ndeficit in 1997, that is still a deficit of over $100 billion.\n\n[[Page S1291]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, what makes the \ndistinguished Senator believe, when we have a constitutional amendment, \nSenators are going to have any more backbone than they have now?\n  Mr. HATCH. Because I believe Senators will live up to the \nconstitutional mandate and the oath of office that they take to do what \nis right, where at this particular point there is no constitutional \nmandate to live within budgetary constraints, and it is apparent.\n  Mr. BYRD. They did not live up to it last year.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, there was not----\n  Mr. BYRD. When they voted for the conference report on the line-item \nveto. They voted to shift the power of the purse away from the \nlegislative branch to the executive. What makes the Senator believe \nthat they will live up to the Constitution anymore nearly and dearly \nonce this language is in it?\n  Mr. HATCH. Although I tend to share the Senator's view on the line-\nitem veto, I think the Senator would have to admit there is a question \nwhether that is going to be judged constitutional or not. If we pass a \nbalanced budget amendment, it will become an official part of the \nConstitution, which is a considerably different situation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will Senators be more inclined to vote to increase taxes \nonce this is part of the Constitution than they are now?\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Simon thinks so. One reason why he----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. Simon isn't a Senator anymore.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand. What Senator Simon argued last year as the \nleading proponent of this amendment was that he felt there would be a \ngreater propensity to increase taxes to solve these problems. I have to \nsay that I do not believe that is so, but that is what he felt. I do \nnot think that is so. I think it would be very difficult to get \nconstitutional majorities to increase taxes except where they are \nclearly needed to be increased, and that is why we put in a \nconstitutional majority. Now, it is no secret, and my friend knows \nthis, that there are those on my side who do not think that is \nadequate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Do not think what?\n  Mr. HATCH. Do not think that is adequate. They want a three-fifths \nmajority before you can increase taxes. But the reason we have a \nconstitutional majority is because my friends on the Democratic side \nwould not agree with the three-fifths majority.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would not what?\n  Mr. HATCH. Would not agree that it should be a three-fifths majority \nto increase taxes. I happen to believe that this has to be a bipartisan \namendment. It is even though there are, as a percentage, less Democrats \nsupporting it than Republicans. But Democrats have helped to formulate \nthis amendment, and I have to give credit to those who are standing \nhere with us. I think they have guts to stand up under the \ncircumstances and vote for this amendment, as they should.\n\n  Now, that does not mean that those who vote against it do not have \nguts, too, because there is a price that will be paid for voting \nagainst this amendment. We all understand that. And let me just say \nthis. I happen to believe that the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has never lacked intestinal fortitude. In fact, I have been \nthrough a lot of experiences here that prove that as a matter of fact \nto me. I could not have more respect for anybody than I do for him as a \nU.S. Senator.\n  But again, I think he makes our case. I think these 28 unbalanced \nbudget volumes make our case. I think it is apparent our system is not \nworking. I think if we keep going this way, our children and \ngrandchildren's futures are gone. I know the distinguished Senator is a \ngreat family man. I know that he loves his children and grandchildren, \nas I do mine. We are expecting our 16th and 17th grandchildren within 2 \nweeks, Elaine and I. I want them to have a future as we have had. But \nright now with what is happening in accordance with the chart of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, it is pretty apparent their \nfuture is being bartered away because we are unwilling to make the \ntough choices. I would lots rather have the balanced budget amendment \nhelping us to estimate receipts and outlays than to have this system \nestimate them, I will tell you that right now. And it is a better \nsystem to have a balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, the Senator is very disarming when he talks about how \nI love my family and my children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. HATCH. You do.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is correct about it. But he still has not answered my \nquestion as to why the committee and the proponents of the amendment \nfelt after saying in section 1 that total outlays shall not exceed \ntotal receipts in any fiscal year, which is pretty straightforward \nlanguage, which says that the budget has to be balanced every year, it \nsays that the budget has to be balanced every year, why do we take an \napproach which says, on the one hand, the budget must be balanced--and \nthat is what I have been hearing from the speakers who are proponents \nof this legislation--why did they say in the first section that the \nbudget will have to be balanced every year and then in section 6 say, \nas it were, ``Well, you do not really have to believe that first \nsection? We are not going to hold you to it. We know it will be \ndifficult, if not impossible some years, to hold you to that. So we are \nnot going to require you to equal the outlays with the receipts. But \nwhat we are going to do is this. We are going to let you get by by just \nbalancing the estimates.''\n  Who makes the estimates? Cannot the estimates be cooked? The \nadministration cooked the numbers when they were sending up budgets in \nthe early part of the Reagan administration. They cooked the numbers. \nThese numbers can be cooked once this constitutional amendment becomes \na part of the Constitution. They can be cooked. The estimates can be \ncooked. When can the American people believe us and believe that we \nmean what we say?\n  That is all I have been saying here. I have been saying that we do \nnot mean what we say in this amendment. We do not mean what we say in \nsection 1. So what are the American people to believe?\n  I compliment the distinguished Senator for coming to the floor. He is \na man after my own kidney, as Shakespeare would say. He is a man after \nmy kidney. He came to the floor. And I had suggested that someone \nshould come and give us an analysis of these sections and explain how \nthey are going to work and what are we expected to do to make them \nwork.\n  Well, he came to the floor, and he has been reading the sections of \nthe amendment one by one, which was not exactly what I asked for. I do \nnot have any more faith in the amendment now than I had to begin with. \nI can read the sections.\n  I read the sections a number of times. And the distinguished Senator \nhas prepared a chart here so that we can read them over and over again. \nI want somebody to explain to me how they will work and what is there \nabout that amendment that can assure those people who are looking \nthrough the electronic eye that this budget is going to be balanced if \nthis amendment is adopted--the budget is going to be balanced.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I have to ask the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, if this balanced budget amendment passes, as much as he \nwishes that it would not, and it is ratified by the States, would the \nSenator from West Virginia, once it is placed in the Constitution, not \ndo his level best to comply with the constitutional requirement, if the \namendment is adopted, to meet these estimates that are in there, as he \nsuggested that I would do my duty under the Constitution? I think what \nI am saying is this: Both charts that the Senator has put up, show that \nthe current system is not working.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator--\n  Mr. HATCH. The reason I point out the current system is not working \nis because there are not the same pressures to make it work that there \nwould be under a balanced budget amendment.\n  Second, if we have these wild fluctuations under the balanced budget \namendment, there is going to be an awful lot of heck to pay to our \nvoting populace, because they are going to hold us responsible for \nthese wild fluctuations.\n  Mr. BYRD. You bet they are. They are going to hold you responsible.\n  Mr. HATCH. They are not doing it now because they do not know who is\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\nresponsible for them. If we have to stand up and vote and make \nsupermajority votes to spend and borrow more, then they will know who \nis doing it to them. If we have to make a constitutional majority to \nincrease taxes, they will know who is doing it to them.\n  I have to say, if we do not, as a congressional body, have our CBO do \nbetter numbers, and the OMB as the executive body do better numbers, \nthen there are going to be changes that will get them to where they \nhave to do better numbers.\n  Will they always be accurate? There is no way we will always be \ncompletely and absolutely accurate.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have a couple of things to say to what the Senator has \nsaid, Mr. President, if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure, under the same circumstances.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is he asking me whether or not I will do everything I can, \neverything in my power, to help to balance the budget? Was that the \nforce of his question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am sorry, I missed the question. Excuse me.\n  Mr. BYRD. Was he asking me that, if this amendment becomes a part of \nthe Constitution, will the Senator from West Virginia do everything he \ncan do to help to balance the budget and get the deficit down? Is that \nwhat he was asking me?\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, let me put it this way. I don't have to ask that \nquestion. I know the distinguished Senator from West Virginia would. \nBut I asked it rhetorically because I know that the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia would do all in his power to live up to the \nConstitution, even though he disagreed with the provision of it, once \nit is part of the Constitution. As would I.\n  And, frankly, I think that he is not alone. I think there are as many \nas 535 others in Congress who would, likewise, try to live up to the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield and let me answer his \nquestion?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have proved that I will do everything I can to balance \nthe budget. But not only this Senator. They are standing in rows on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  In 1993, they voted to lower the deficits by almost $500 billion. \nWorking with the President, we had a package to reduce the deficits. I \nvoted for that package. The Senator from Connecticut voted for that \npackage. Many other Senators on this side of the aisle voted for that \npackage. Not one--not one--Senator on the other side voted for that \npackage, to bring down the deficits.\n  So we do not need a constitutional amendment. We just need the \ncourage to vote for it. I do not know what there is in this \nconstitutional amendment that will give us any more courage and \nbackbone than we already have. I do not know how many will figure that \nout.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just respond to that. Even, in spite of the \nreductions in deficit that have occurred over the last 4 years after \nthe enactment of one of the largest tax increases in history--some on \nour side say the largest tax increase in history; it is debatable, but \nit is one of the two largest tax increases in history, both of which, I \nthink, were motivated by Members on the other side of the aisle--we are \nstill in hundred-plus billion dollar deficits, going up to $188 billion \nand on up beyond that by the year 2002.\n  The fact of the matter is, if it was up to the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia and the Senator from Utah, we would have the will.\n  Mr. BYRD. If it were up to the Senator from West Virginia, we would \nnot have any tax cuts this year.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was saying, if it was up to the Senator from West \nVirginia and the Senator from Utah, I believe we would have the will to \ndo what is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator vote with me to increase taxes?\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just finish. But the problem is, it is not up to \njust the two of us. It has been up to everybody in Congress for 28 \nyears of unbalanced budgets. I know that people do not like these two \nstacks because they are embarrassing. It is embarrassing to me to have \nto point to these and say for the 21 years I have been here, these have \nbeen unbalanced. For all of those 21 years I fought for a balanced \nbudget amendment. But I have to say, we do not have the will. It is \napparent and we are not going to have the will unless we do something \nabout it constitutionally, where everybody will have to face the music.\n  Right now they do not. And where some on our side love more defense \nspending and some of the Democrat side love more social spending in \nways that may be irresponsible, under the balanced budget amendment I \nthink we are going to all have to be more responsible.\n  I just wish--this is an erstwhile wish, I understand--but I wish my \ncolleague from West Virginia were on our side on this, because I think \nit would be a much easier amendment to pass.\n  But I understand why he is not, and I know how sincere he is. But, \nlike Paul of old--\n  Mr. BYRD. Like who?\n  Mr. HATCH. Like Paul of old, who held the coats--\n  Mr. BYRD. A great Apostle.\n  Mr. HATCH. The man who held the coats of the men who stoned the first \nChristian martyr, he is sincerely wrong.\n  Mr. BYRD. Paul was?\n  Mr. HATCH. Paul was, yes, for holding the coats of those who stoned \nthe first Christian martyr, Stephen. Paul was sincere. He meant what he \nsaid. He really was sincere. But he was wrong.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are getting off the track.\n  Mr. HATCH. I don't think so. Sometimes going back in history is a \nvery good thing to do.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senator from Utah wishes I were on his \nside?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do. I would feel much better.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am on the Constitution's side.\n  Mr. HATCH. So am I.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am on the Constitution's side. And I do not want to see \nthat Constitution prostituted by an amendment that is nothing more than \na bookkeeping manual on accounting principles. It has no place in the \nConstitution. It is not going to give this Senator or any other Senator \nany more backbone than the good Lord gave to me in the beginning to \nstand up and vote the tough votes.\n  I do not want to see the faith of the American people in this book--\nforget the stack of books there, ever so high. This is the book. I do \nnot want to see the faith of the American people in this Constitution \nundermined. And it is going to be undermined when we write that \nlanguage into it and the budgets do not balance.\n  Let me at least thank the Senator for being honest to the point that \nhe says that this amendment is not going to balance the budget.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I didn't say that. I said the amendment does not \nmandate a balanced budget. I think this amendment will lead us to a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. BYRD. It does not mandate it.\n  Mr. HATCH. But let me say this. I happen to believe that this little \nbooklet that contains the Constitution of the United States, without \nthe balanced budget amendment, will hopefully have a balanced budget \namendment in it. Because, if we do--and I know that sincerely dedicated \npeople like my friend from West Virginia will be voting for more fiscal \nresponsibility and restraint than we do now. And he will have more \nleverage on not only his side, but our side, to get people to stand up \nand do what is right.\n  I do not think that these comments, ``Let's just do it''--I have \nheard that now for 21 years. ``Let's just do it. Let's just have the \nwill to do it.''\n  Here is the will of the Congress of the United States. Mr. President, \n28 years of unbalanced budgets. I think these volumes speak worlds of \ninformation for us, of how ineffective we have been in doing what is \nright. The Constitution provides, in article V, for ways of amending it \nwhen it becomes necessary in the public interest to do so. I cannot \nimagine anything more necessary in the public interest than a balanced \nbudget amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, if you will, a bipartisan \namendment, bicameral bipartisan amendment, that literally, literally \nputs some screws to Congress and some restraints on Congress and makes \nCongress have to face the music.\n  Right now, we don't face any music. Let's have the will? Give me a \nbreak,\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\nwe haven't had the will in almost 66 years, but certainly not in the \nlast 28 years, as represented by these huge stacks of unbalanced \nbudgets of the United States of America.\n  I have to pay respect to my colleague, because I care for him so \nmuch. He is sincere, he is eloquent, and he is a great advocate, and I \nrespect him. In fact, it could be said I love him. The fact of the \nmatter is, I think he is wrong. He thinks I am wrong. But I think his \ncharts are very, very good reasons why, and these books are very good \nreasons why something has to be done. We cannot just keep frittering \naway our children's future and the future of our grandchildren. I know \nhe shares that view with me, and I just wish we could do more together \nto protect their future. I am doing everything I can with this \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. You are being honest about it, too----\n  Mr. HATCH. I am being honest.\n  Mr. BYRD. Saying it doesn't promise a balanced budget.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think it promises a balanced budget, I don't think it \nmandates one. It gives us the flexibility to do whatever we want to do, \nas long as we comply its requirements.\n  Mr. BYRD. To cook the estimates.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, no, it gives us the flexibility to do whatever we want \nto do, but we have to stand up and vote to do it by supermajority \nvotes. If you want to increase the deficits, you have to stand up and \nvote by a supermajority to do it. If you want to increase taxes, you \ncan do it, but you have to vote on a constitutional majority of both \nHouses, to do it. That is a considerably different situation from what \nwe have today where there are no constraints and, in many cases, or \nsome cases that are very important, at least over the last 21 years, no \nvotes. It has been done in the dead of the night, to use a metaphor, a \nmetaphor that is all too real. These budget volumes are real. These are \nnot mirages. These volumes are actually real. They represent 28 years \nof unbalanced budgets, 8 years longer than I have been here, and I see \nmany, many more in the future if we don't pass this balanced budget \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, here is the mirage, right here. This is the \nmirage, this amendment to the Constitution. The Senator says that we \nshould write two or three more supermajority requirements into the \nConstitution. It already requires eight, including the three \namendments--five in the original Constitution and three amendments, 12, \n14 and 25. Now we are going to write some more in. This is going to \nhead us more and more in the direction of minority control--minority \ncontrol. This is a republic, which uses democratic processes. This is a \nrepresentative democracy, a republic for which it stands. A republic.\n  I just close by saying this amendment is a real gimmick--a real \ngimmick. It is not going to cause us to balance this budget any more \nthan if we didn't have it; may even make it more difficult to balance \nthe budget.\n  Moses struck the rock at Kadesh with his rod. He smote the rock twice \nand water gushed forth and the people's thirst and the thirst of the \nbeasts of the people were quenched. This amendment is not the rock of \nKadesh. You won't be able to smite that amendment. The waters of a \nbalanced budget are not going to flow from that piece of junk. I say \nthat with all due respect to my friend. But that will not work. That's \nthe long and the short of it, and it is misleading the people. It is \nmisleading the people. The amendment doesn't require us to balance the \nbudget, it only requires us to balance the estimates. So there we go \nagain. There is a wheel, and we seem to be on it, around and around. \nBalance the estimates. We have seen the estimates.\n  So we can see by looking at this chart where the estimates have been \nwrong--always wrong--in the past, and we should know by that lamp that \nthey are going to be wrong in the future.\n  So what faith can we have in this kind of an amendment? The Senator \nsays we would be under greater pressure to balance the budget. Why not \nstart now? Why wait 5 years, at least 5 years, perhaps even longer \nunder that amendment? Why wait for pressure? The pressure is just as \ngreat today and we will be even deeper into the hole by 2002 than we \nare now.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say this, Moses also struck the rock at \nMeribah and gave water and was forbidden from entering the promised \nland after 40 years of traveling in the wilderness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Struck the rock at Horeb.\n  Mr. HATCH. That's right, Horeb. The fact of the matter is that he was \nfollowing, in a sense, the same pattern, but without God's will. And I \nam tired of following the same pattern which I cannot believe is God's \nwill. I am sorry that we have 28 years of unbalanced budgets in a row, \nand we are looking at 28 more because we are unwilling to do what is \nright.\n  Now, look, the balanced budget amendment moves us toward a balanced \nbudget by requiring supermajority votes if we want to unbalance the \nbudget or increase the taxes to balance it. It requires a balanced \nbudget unless there are emergencies in which we need a three-fifths \nmajority to waive balanced budget requirements.\n  In all due respect, my friend from West Virginia is actually arguing \nthat one should oppose the balanced budget amendment because it doesn't \nrequire utopia, because we can rely on estimates. Well, utopia, means \n``nowhere.'' But relying on good faith estimates, as the report does \nsay, is ``somewhere,'' rather than ``nowhere.'' And it will lead us to \nbalanced budgets.\n  The first Congress and the States ratified the Bill of Rights. If we \ntook the Senator's line, one should have opposed them, let's say, the \nfirst amendment, for instance, free speech, because it did not define \nfree speech or show how free speech was going to be enforced. But we \nall know that's ridiculous, and I believe it's ridiculous, but I \nbelieve we should be better equipped to deal with estimates of outlays \nand receipts with a balanced budget amendment in the Constitution that \nall of us are sworn to uphold.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator Dodd needs to speak on his amendment a bit more, so \nI am going to leave the floor for now.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I will miss my colleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. I beg your pardon.\n  Mr. HATCH. This has been a good colloquy. I will miss my colleague, \nand he teaches me a lot every time he comes to the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would like to hear the distinguished Senator explain how \nthe States balance their budgets and how they operate, not only on a \nbudget that provides for the operating expenses of Government from day-\nto-day, but also on the capital budget, and why under this amendment \nthe Federal Government will not be able to have a capital budget.\n  Why does not someone explain that the States operate on two budgets? \nNot only an operating budget, but also a capital budget. And then why \ndo we continue to say that the Federal Government should balance its \nbudget like the States do, without the explanation that there are \ncapital budgets in States?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will not go into that very much right now, but I think \nthe Senator makes a very good point.\n  One reason is the States do not print the money. No. 2 is some States \ncannot do much in the capital way because they do not have the money \nand they do not balance their budgets the way they should. No. 3 is \nthat there are rating systems that make it possible for States to \nborrow on bonds, and they discipline the use of bonds by the States. \nThere would be no similar system for the Federal Government. No. 4 is \nthat, frankly, the Federal Government can create surpluses that should \nwork. No. 5 is that the States, at least 44 of them, have balanced \nbudget amendments. If they did not have their balanced budget \namendments, many of them would not be balancing their budgets either, \neven with the capital budget. And they have done better than the \nFederal Government at restraining their borrowing.\n  So there is no real comparison between the Federal Government and the \nStates. There is nobody to keep the Federal Government in line without \na balanced budget amendment. I think that is what this balanced budget \namendment is all about. I appreciate my colleague. We have had a good \ndebate. He certainly always raises very interesting issues and very \npertinent issues and I think adds to the quality of the debate around \nhere every time\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\nhe comes on the floor. So I personally appreciate it.\n  With regard to capital budgets, let me say OMB, CBO and GAO, among \nothers, have opined that debt-financed capital budgets are not a good \nidea for the Federal Government. All of them have said that. See, for \nexample, President Clinton's fiscal 1998 proposed budget. The \nAnalytical Perspectives volume, I think on page 136, there are some \nremarks on this.\n  The Clinton administration said, ``The rationale for borrowing to \nfinance investment is not persuasive'' and that a ``capital budget is \nnot a justification to relax current and proposed budget constraints.'' \nI agree.\n  Besides the fact that the U.S. Government does not need to borrow to \nfinance its investment, it is not subject to the constraints that \nfamilies, business and States face.\n  Families and businesses are disciplined by markets. States are \ndisciplined by bond ratings. A Federal capital budget is bound to be \nabused. Future Congresses could redefine many kinds of spending as \ncapital. It would be a monstrous loophole in the balanced budget \namendment.\n  Let me just say that I do agree with OMB, CBO, the Office of \nManagement and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, the General \nAccounting Office, that a Federal capital budget is not a good idea. \nEspecially, I think, in the context of a constitutional amendment. So \nthat is all I will say about it today. But I hope that is enough \nbecause a capital budget is really not the way to go constitutionally. \nBut this amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, is the right way to go. \nIt will help us to make some dents in what has been going on for the \nlast 28 years at least, or should I say 58 of the last 66 years where \nwe have had unbalanced budgets.\n  Could I ask the Chair, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Utah has 14 \nminutes, 25 seconds, the Senator from Connecticut has 1 minute, 32 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Can I get 6 or 7 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. Go ahead.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield some time? Two minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I yield to the budget----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Go to him first.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to make some concluding remarks on my pending \namendment. So if the Senator from New Mexico wants to take a couple \nminutes to do that, and then I would like to wrap up on my amendment \nbefore the vote at 5:30.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as he needs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Two minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might say to the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, Senator Byrd, I did not hear your entire argument with \nreference to estimates, but I would suggest that in due course--I have \ndifficulty getting time on this floor because when there is time I \ncannot be here and then when I get here, eminent Senators are using all \nthe time. I am not complaining.\n  But I would like tomorrow to explain a bit about estimating. I would \njust suggest that we need not use the estimating that has taken place \nto produce that chart. There is another way to estimate it. You can \nestimate right up close to the end of the period of time, and you get \nestimates that are pretty close.\n  I would also suggest that whether it is red or whether it is black--\n--\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield? But there, they are still \nestimates.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  I will talk about it tomorrow. And everything about us, the \nGovernment, is built on estimates. We rely on it very, very much.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. We rely on it and the charts show how much we fall short.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Half that red and half that black is not estimates at \nall. Half or more is based upon programs that cost more than you \nestimate. Frankly, that has nothing to do with economic estimates. It \nhas to do with us not doing a good enough job figuring what programs \nare going to cost. That could be fixed. In fact, we are doing much \nbetter at it already in terms of that.\n  But my last observation has to do with a thought you had as you \ncaptured the notion that this would make this budget so unreliable that \nyou called it all a gimmick.\n  Frankly, I want to make sure that everybody knows that the best use \nof the word gimmick for anything going on on this floor has to do with \nthe gimmick that some on that side of the aisle are using when they \nspeak of taking Social Security off budget so you will assure Social \nSecurity's solvency and the checks. That is a gimmick of the highest \norder. For you do that, and there is no assurance that Congress will \nnot spend the trust fund surpluses for anything they want. It is no \nlonger subject to any budget discipline. It is out there all by itself.\n  Second, there is no assurance that programs for senior citizens that \nare not Social Security would not be moved there, and that that trust \nfund becomes more vulnerable then when it is subject to the discipline \nof the give-and-take of a budget. And on that I am certain.\n  And last, some Senators today got up and said that the Congressional \nResearch Service had given them all they needed because it had \napparently said that you risked Social Security in the outyears. Well, \nthat did not sound right to any of us. We called them up and they have \nissued a correction. It could not conceivably be what they said and \nwhat was implied from it. They are now saying--and I quote:\n\n       We are not concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses could \n     not be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The [balanced budget \n     amendment] would not require that result.\n\n  So it does not stand for the proposition that was used. They made a \nmistake in the translation, in the way they interpreted and we can \ndebate that a little tomorrow. But I just thought we ought to make sure \nthat we understood that.\n  Now, I know that my friend from West Virginia is a proponent of the \nConstitution. And when you speak of amending it, he stands on it. But \nlet us face it, you cannot stand on it when you are talking about \namending it. Because that would have meant none of the amendments that \nwere added to it would be there. You would have held up the old \nConstitution when it was first drawn with no amendments and said, I \nstand on it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, no, no, no, no.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You could.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, no, no. The Senator was quite right he was not here to \nhear my statement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not have any additional time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the memorandum from the \nCongressional Research Service be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 1997.\n\n     To: Hon. Pete V. Domenici; Attention: Jim Capretta.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Treatment of Outlays from Social Security Surpluses \n       under BBA.\n\n       This memorandum is in response to your inquiry with respect \n     to the effect on the Social Security Trust Funds of the \n     pending Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA). Under S.J. Res. 1 as \n     it is now before the Senate Sec. 1 would mandate that \n     ``[t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for the fiscal year. . . .'' Outlays and receipts \n     are defined in Sec. 7 as practically all inclusive, with two \n     exceptions that are irrelevant here.\n       At some point, the receipts into the Social Security Trust \n     Funds will not balance the outlays from those Funds. Under \n     present law, then, the surpluses being built up in the Funds, \n     at least as an accounting practice, will be utilized to pay \n     benefits to the extent receipts for each year do not equal \n     the outlays in that year. Simply stated, the federal \n     securities held by the Trust Funds will be drawn down to \n     cover the Social Security deficit in that year, and the \n     Treasury will have to make good on those securities with \n     whatever moneys it has available.\n       However, Sec. 1 of the pending BBA requires that total \n     outlays for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts for \n     that fiscal year. Thus, the amount drawn from the Social \n     Security Trust Funds could not be counted in the calculation \n     of the balance between total federal outlays and receipts. We \n     are not concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses could not \n     be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The BBA would not require \n     that result. What it would mandate is that, inasmuch as the \n     United States has a unified budget, other receipts into the \n     Treasury would have to be counted to balance the outlays from \n     the Trust Funds and those receipts would not be otherwise\n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\n     available to the Government for that year. Only if no other \n     receipts in any particular year could be found would the \n     possibility of a limitation on drawing down the Trust Funds \n     arise. Even in this eventuality, however, Congress would \n     retain authority under the BBA to raise revenues or to reduce \n     expenditures to obtain the necessary moneys to make good on \n     the liquidation of securities from the Social Security Trust \n     Funds.\n\n                                            Johnny H. Killian,\n\n                                       Senior Specialist, American\n                                               Constitutional Law.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back to the chairman. I will be glad to come \ndown and discuss this in more detail.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be happy to join the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I wanted to yield to my colleague from West Virginia, who \nwanted to make a comment on the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 9 minutes and 21 \nseconds remaining, and the Senator from Connecticut has 1 minute and 32 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. BYRD. Three minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of my time to the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, and then I have the Senator \nfrom Nebraska waiting to speak.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah \nfor his courtesy in yielding time.\n  Mr. President, I commend the distinguished senior Senator from \nConnecticut for his amendment, and for his very thorough explanation of \nit. There is, as he has said, no higher duty than this body has than to \nsafeguard the security and liberties of the American people. This is \nthe height of pernicious legislative mischief to provide the ready and \nrobust forces when the Nation faces a serious threat to our national \nsecurity. Can we define the specific nature of such threats that might \nface us? Of course not. Do we need the flexibility to react in time, in \nadvance, and with sufficient credibility so as to show down all such \nconceivable threats to our security? Of course, we should.\n  The Constitution should not be used as a straitjacket which has the \neffect of throwing into doubt our ability to perform this most basic of \nour duties. Thus, the Dodd amendment is a very useful one, as essential \nimprovement to the constitutional proposal which is before the body. \nThe definition of ``imminent and serious military threat to national \nsecurity,'' as a test for waiving the requirements of the balanced \nbudget, as proposed by the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is a \nvaluable improvement to the amendment offered by the Senator from Utah, \nand I strongly encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I again thank my friend from Utah, who is my friend, who is a fine \nChristian gentleman, who is always fair and courteous. I salute him for \nthat, and I thank my colleague from Connecticut.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 6 minutes and 42 \nseconds\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 4, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Pursuant to a discussion earlier, I ask unanimous consent \nto send to the desk a modification of my amendment along the lines we \ndiscussed earlier. I ask unanimous consent my amendment be allowed to \nbe modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 3, line 7, strike beginning with ``is'' through \n     line 11 and insert ``faces an imminent and serious military \n     threat to national security as declared by a joint \n     resolution,''. which becomes law.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me briefly sum up, if I can, this \namendment. I think the handwriting is on the wall. It is one of those \nmoments, the wave is moving here, and I deeply regret it.\n  I have the feeling my colleagues have just not read section 5 as \ncarefully as we should. I emphasize again and draw their attention to \nthis not based on the argument that I asked them to not support the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget, but merely that we \nimprove this section to reflect, I think, what ought to be the \npriorities of a nation; that is, to be able to respond to an imminent \nthreat to our national security and be allowed to do that in a way that \nwould permit us to waive the restrictions of this amendment. The \npriority of responding, I think, is a higher one than the issue of the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  I draw the attention of my colleagues to some pivotal words in this \nsection, ``a declaration of war,'' or the United States must be \n``engaged in military conflict,'' particularly that latter one, Mr. \nPresident. It does not talk about imminent danger. We must actually be \nengaged.\n  It is ironic in many ways that we can have a declaration of war which \ncan be reached by a simple majority here. A simple majority of Senators \npresent and voting can declare war. You do not require that all Members \nbe here to declare war. No vote we ever cast could ever be more \nprofound than to commit our Nation to war. Yet, to waive the budget \nrequirement of this amendment requires a special parliamentary \nproceeding which excludes the vote of the Vice President, and requires \na majority of all Members regardless of who is present in order to \nwaive the restrictions of this so we can respond to a conflict. How \nironic that in the very same section you have a declaration of war that \ncan be reached by a simple majority of Members present and voting, and \nyet to waive the restrictions of this amendment requires a ``super'' \nnumber, if you will, beyond that which is necessary to commit this \nNation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to look at this amendment that will be at the \ndesk when you come to vote in a few minutes. We replace this language \nby saying that the Nation faces an imminent and serious military threat \nto national security as declared by a joint resolution that is passed \ninto law. We must vote that we are facing that imminent threat. If we \nvote accordingly, that we are facing an imminent threat, then it seems \nto me that to waive the restrictions here is the only sensible thing to \ndo. To require today that we have a declaration of war, the perverse \nidea that a President and Congress, in a future time may declare war \njust to avoid the restrictions of this amendment, or to actually be \nengaged in a conflict and not allow our Nation to prepare for a likely \nconflict, concerns me deeply.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, and I thank my colleague from \nWest Virginia for his support of this amendment, but I urge my \ncolleagues to please read this amendment and read this section and \nrealize what great harm and danger we could be creating for our Nation \nif we adopt this amendment with this section as written, which I think \nplaces this Nation in an unrealistic and dangerous straitjacket.\n  I thank my colleague from Utah for yielding the time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me take 1 minute of my remaining time, and that is to \nsay that this amendment will have a loophole in the balanced budget \namendment second to none, and a loophole for any kind of spending--not \nmilitary spending, any kind of spending. It means more of the 28 years \nof unbalanced budgets. I hope my colleagues will vote down this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment, as modified, of the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday the Senate voted on the first of \nseveral potential amendments to exempt certain programs from the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment. I greatly appreciate the \ncomments made on the amendment by the Senator from Minnesota regarding \nthe importance of programs that benefit our children. Senator Wellstone \nspoke passionately and I could not agree more that we must protect our \nchildren.\n  However, I disagree with the notion that we should exempt certain \ncategories of programs from the strictures of the balanced budget \namendment. I don't see balancing the budget and helping our children as \ntwo mutually exclusive goals. In fact, these are two of my highest \npriorities and they are critically linked.\n  I heard the compelling arguments about the difficult spending cuts \nthat occurred during the last Congress. I agree that more should be \ndone to balance the burden of spending reductions in the future. As a \nsociety and as a government, we must maximize our commitment to the \nwell-being of our children or suffer the consequences in the world \neconomy. But what's more important, if we fail our children, we fail as \na people.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to the concept of the balanced budget \namendment. I am committed to the idea that the financial security of \nthis Nation rests on the ability of the Federal Government to curb the \npractice of spending beyond its means. And I am deeply committed to the \nbelief that our Nation's future depends on the investment we place in \nour children. In reviewing the fiscal history of this Nation over the \npast 25 years, it has become clear to me that the will to exercise the \nnecessary spending restraint does not exist within this body without a \nstrict requirement. I believe that the balanced budget amendment \nprovides such a framework, and that is why I support it.\n  The Wellstone amendment was certainly difficult to vote against. But \nI strongly believe that the very arguments made by the proponents of \nthe amendment are exactly those that will help preserve critical \nchildren's programs from future budget cuts. Our children are already \nsaddled with a tremendous debt burden created by past federal budget \nexcess. It makes no fiscal sense to further hinder their ability to pay \noff that debt by short-changing their education or health. The very \nviability of our economy depends upon the opportunity of our children \nto flourish.\n  We clearly can not afford to ignore the needs of our children. But if \nwe are serious about passing a meaningful balanced budget amendment, \nthen we must reject efforts to dismantle that effort through piecemeal \nexclusions of programs, however worthy the particular program. I fear \nthat such exemptions will lead to a cascade of further exemptions and \nultimately leave little room to create a truly fair and balanced \nbudget. That is exactly the scenario that has caused us to get to a 4 \ntrillion dollar Federal debt.\n  I have sought to protect funding for child care resources, public \nhealth and education and will continue to do so in the context of a \nbalanced budget. When it comes to the annual appropriations process, of \nwhich I am an active participant as a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I will remain front and center fighting to \nprotect children's programs. But as a supporter of the balanced budget \namendment, I must object to blanket exclusions.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators here and \nback now at their offices, there will be no further votes this evening. \nI understand there are----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky makes an excellent \npoint. The Senate will come to order.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. There will be no further votes this evening, but I do \nunderstand there are several requests for morning business in the \nmorning. In light of those requests and the memorial service for \nAmbassador Pamela Harriman, I expect the Senate will be conducting \nmorning business only until around 2 p.m. on Thursday.\n  Following morning business, there is a possibility for consideration \nof a resolution regarding milk prices, and there is the possibility of \nanother resolution but we are trying to see if that resolution has been \nfiled and, of course, we will need to clear it with the Democratic \nleader.\n  There are rollcall votes possible during tomorrow's session but we do \nnot have an agreement on that yet.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget \namendment, on Monday, February 24, the Senate resume consideration of \nSenator Byrd's amendment No. 6 beginning at 3:30 p.m.\n  I further ask that there be 2 additional hours of debate equally \ndivided in the usual form prior to the vote on or in relation to the \nByrd amendment and finally no amendments be in order to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, so that Senators will have this information, the \nagreement allows for a rollcall vote then on Senator Byrd's amendment \nat approximately 5:30 on Monday, February 24.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I know the majority leader loves to hear \nhimself talk. The rest of us would like to hear him, too.\n  Will you have order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am highly complimented and appreciative of the Senator's \ncomments.\n  Mr. FORD. The reason I did that, Mr. President, is because the \nmajority whip does not want to do that. He likes to hear me do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, there will be a vote then on Senator Byrd's \namendment at approximately 5:30 on Monday, February 24, which is the \ndate the Senate returns from the Presidents Day recess.\n  I have discussed these Monday afternoon votes with the Democratic \nleader. We are agreed we will have votes quite often on Monday \nafternoons. We will try to tell you as far in advance as we can. It \ndoes seem to get the Members back and ready for work. It allows us to \nget committee work done on Monday afternoons or certainly on Tuesday \nmornings. And also I should remind Senators that that week after we \ncome back after the Presidents Day recess, in order to complete our \nwork on the balanced budget amendment there is a good possibility we \nwill have to stay in late on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. That is \nnot definite yet. It will depend on how many amendments and time \nagreements. We will work with the leader on that. But we have been very \naggressive in trying to keep our schedule reasonable. If we need to do \nsome late nights that week to finish our work so that we can do other \nthings that are pending, including nominations, then we would be \nprepared to do that. But we will advise you in advance when we are \ngoing to have to be in session at night.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1296-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

JOHN K. WILSON III\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Col. John K. \nWilson III as he retires after 26 years of distinguished service in the \nU.S. Air Force.\n  Colonel Wilson is retiring from his position as the executive \ndirector of operations, Secretary of the Air Force, Office of \nLegislative Liaison at the Pentagon. In addition to this position, he \nalso served as Chief, Congressional Inquiries Division. In a previous \nlegislative liaison tour, Colonel Wilson served as a Congressional \nInquiries Officer as well as a Senate Liaison Officer. In these \ncritical positions, Colonel Wilson not only served the Air Force well, \nbut he also assisted the U.S. Congress.\n  During his tenure, he worked with hundreds of Members of Congress, \nresponding to their constituent inquiries, lending his expertise in Air \nForce matters and handling a myriad of unique situations. Colonel \nWilson's professionalism, diplomacy, and insight were essential to the \nflawless planning and execution of well over 100 Congressional \nworldwide fact-finding travels. His comprehensive knowledge of the \nlegislative process and thorough understanding of Air Force issues made \nhim the perfect liaison between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill.\n  Mr. President, I join with my colleagues who have directly benefited \nfrom the superb support Colonel Wilson has provided the Congress and \nexecutive branch, in congratulating him for a job extremely well done \nand wishing he and his lovely wife Andrea, the very best in the future. \nHe will be a success in any pursuit he may endeavor to undertake. \nColonel Wilson is a professional among professionals and has brought \ngreat credit upon himself and the U.S. Air Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1297-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PAMELA HARRIMAN\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was shocked and deeply saddened by \nPamela Harriman's death last week in Paris. All of us in the Kennedy \nfamily cherished her friendship, and we will always have many warm \nmemories of her close ties to our family.\n  In a very real sense, throughout the Reagan and Bush years, she was \nthe First Lady of the Democratic Party. I especially admired her \nleadership, her extraordinary ability, and her abiding commitment to \nthe best ideals of public service.\n  Pamela's friendship with the Kennedy family goes back more than half \na century. It began in the difficult days of World War II in England \nduring my father's service as Ambassador in London. Pamela became an \nespecially close friend of my older sister Kathleen, and her friendship \nwith our family continued ever since.\n  Her marriage to Averell Harriman in 1971 brought us even closer. \nAverell had been a great friend and key adviser to President Kennedy on \nforeign policy, and his wise counsel had been instrumental in the \npassage of the Limited Test Ban Treaty between the United States and \nthe Soviet Union.\n  In one of her most extraordinary accomplishments, Pamela became one \nof the pillars of the Democratic Party during the 1980's. She never \nlost faith in the enduring principles of our party. She held those \nideals high, and she inspired legions of others to do so as well. Her \nleadership was especially effective in revitalizing our party in all \nparts of the country during the Reagan and Bush years, and President \nClinton's dramatic victory in 1992 was her victory too.\n  Pamela's unique qualities of leadership and ability earned her great \nadditional renown during her recent service as Ambassador to France. On \na host of challenging issues ranging from the war in Bosnia to \ndisagreements over NATO and international trade, she served with her \ntrademark combination of skill, grace, and sensitivity that made her so \nrespected and beloved by all who knew her and by the entire diplomatic \ncommunity.\n  All of us in the Kennedy family admired her leadership and her \nstatesmanship, but most of all, we were grateful for her friendship. \nThe Nation has lost a truly remarkable public servant, and we will miss \nher very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1297-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today the U.S. General Accounting Office \n[GAO] issues its high risk series which identifies those federal \nprograms that are especially vulnerable to waste and mismanagement. The \nprograms identified in these reports have cost taxpayers billions of \ndollars in unnecessary expenditures. Without adequate oversight from \nthe Congress many more billions will be wasted before we are through. \nWhile the magnitude of the problems GAO has identified is shocking, I \nam optimistic that we have in place the tools to change Government for \nthe better--but we must be willing to use them.\n  There is a tendency when we are debating how to balance the budget or \nwhen the crisis de jour erupts, for Government to ignore management \nissues--those which to some are tedious, time-consuming and best left \nto the bean-counters. While management issues sometimes tend to get \nswept under the carpet during high-minded policy debates, we ignore \nthem at our peril. We cannot implement any of our policy solutions \nwithout effective public administration. In an era of static resources, \nif we are to balance the budget, replace aging weapon systems at the \nDepartment of Defense [DOD], or attack drug abuse, we must achieve \nsignificant savings. To find the money, we have to make Government \nbetter while cheaper and, to do that, we have to do things smarter.\n  GAO identifies 25 areas that we must focus on to avoid squandering \nbillions of taxpayer dollars. For example, GAO reports that DOD wastes \nbillions of dollars each year on unneeded and inefficient activities, \nis vulnerable to additional billions of dollars in waste by buying \nunnecessary supplies and risks overpaying contractors millions of \ndollars for services not rendered. It reports that the Internal Revenue \nService's accounting is so poor that it cannot effectively manage the \ncollection of the over $113 billion owed the U.S. Government in \ndelinquent taxes. In addition, GAO again criticizes the management of \nthe IRS' computer modernization effort. Just last week, certain IRS \nofficials conceded that this ``modernization'' has already cost the \ntaxpayers $4 billion and ``does not work in the real world''.\n  IRS is not the only Federal agency having a problem coming to grips \nwith the electronic age. Over the last 6 years, the Federal Government \nhas spent $145 billion on computers but continues to have, according to \nGAO, ``chronic problems harnessing the full potential of information \ntechnology to improve performance, cut costs, and/or enhance \nresponsiveness to the public.'' The security of sensitive data on \nGovernment computers and how well the Government converts its old \ncomputers to run in the 2000 were also identified by GAO as areas that \nposed a risk to the Treasury.\n  Billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse occur in Federal \nbenefit programs. GAO reports, in the supplemental security income \nprogram alone, taxpayers are losing over $1 billion a year in \noverpayments. The $197 billion Medicare Program, according to GAO\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\n``loses significant amounts due to persistent fraudulent and wasteful \nclaims and abusive billings.''\n  The risk of losses from the $941 billion Federal loan portfolio is \nanother source of taxpayer vulnerability. Currently, the Government has \n$44 billion of defaulted guaranteed loans on its books and has written \noff many billions more over the last few years. According to GAO, three \nloan programs (student, farm, and housing) are especially vulnerable \ndue to poor agency management. GAO also calls for improving Federal \ncontract management at several agencies that spend tens of billions of \ndollars each year on contractor support. Finally, the 2000 census was \nplaced on the high risk list. The census has tremendous implications in \nthe allocation of billions of dollars in Federal funding and for the \napportionment of seats in the House of Representatives.\n  However, GAO was not all doom and gloom acknowledging that, ``after \ndecades of seeing high risk problems and management weaknesses recur in \nagency after agency,'' Congress has moved to enact several Government-\nwide reforms to address the situation. GAO mentions five such laws as \nkey to improving operations in the Federal Government: The Chief \nFinancial Officers Act of 1990, the Government Performance and Results \nAct of 1993, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994, the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act information \nmanagement and procurement reforms of 1996. These laws are designed to \nget the Federal Government to operate in a sound, businesslike manner. \nIt is up to Congress and the administration to ensure that these \nmanagement reforms are implemented to improve Government performance \nand results.\n  I want to work with the administration and my colleagues in Congress \nto improve the Government's operations. As part of this process, I plan \nto invite before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee the Director \nof OMB to address the problems identified by GAO. We have the \nlegislative framework in place to eradicate these programs from GAO's \nhigh risk list. What we need is the vision and fortitude to implement \nthese bipartisan management reforms and achieve a lasting solution to \nthe management problems that torment the pocketbook of our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1297-5", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1298-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1298-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nappoints the following Members to the Board of Trustees of the Harry S. \nTruman Scholarship Foundation: Mr. Emerson of Missouri and Mr. Skelton \nof Missouri.\n  The message also announced that the Speaker appoints the following \nMember to the Board of Trustees of Gallaudet University: Mr. LaHood of \nIllinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1298-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1298-S1299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1054.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of New Hampshire; ordered to lie on \n     the table.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Paul E. Tsongas, former United States Senator, on \n     January 18, 1997, succumbed to pneumonia after a courageous \n     battle with health problems that had plagued him since he was \n     diagnosed with cancer in 1983; and\n       Whereas, born on February 14, 1941 and brought up in \n     Lowell, Massachusetts, he was viewed as one of Lowell's \n     finest sons who used the values he learned on the streets of \n     Lowell to eventually lead a bipartisan effort to encourage \n     Congress to balance the federal budget; and\n       Whereas, his Lowell high school years, while working at the \n     family dry-cleaning shop, were followed by graduation from \n     Dartmouth College, Peace Corps in Ethiopia and the West \n     Indies, Yale Law School, and a congressional internship; and\n       Whereas, he began his political career in 1968 when he was \n     elected to the city council in Lowell, then ran for Middlesex \n     County commissioner and won in 1972, and in 1974 at the age \n     of 33, continued on to the United States Congress; and\n       Whereas, throughout his life, he practiced law and remained \n     active in public affairs, speaking out on both local and \n     national issues; and\n       Whereas, he shattered ideological stereotypes, favoring \n     ``liberalism that works,'' as symbolized by the federally \n     financed urban park that drew high-tech companies to the \n     empty mills along the Merrimack River in his native city; and\n       Whereas, he won the 1992 New Hampshire primary and, \n     although they frequently disagreed early in 1992, President \n     Clinton eventually agreed with the former senator on many \n     issues and adopted much of the Tsongas platform a year later \n     in his State of the Union address; and\n       Whereas, in 1992, he joined former United States Senator \n     Warren Rudman as a founding member of the Concord Coalition, \n     a public interest group focusing attention on the nation's \n     economic problems and pushing the need for balancing the \n     nation's books to the forefront of public awareness; and\n       Whereas, although he was viewed as ``an outspoken man and a \n     determined and successful politician who never shied away \n     from tough political realities,'' he was also ``a good \n     listener, a good coalition builder, and you knew he was \n     always working for the public good'', now, therefore, be it\n\n     Resolved by the Senate:\n\n       That the members of the New Hampshire senate recognize the \n     many accomplishments and contributions of former Senator Paul \n     E.

A bill to clarify Federal law with respect to assisted \nsuicide, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              THE ASSISTED SUICIDE FUNDING RESTRICTION ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with Senator Ashcroft and 28 of our colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle, that will prohibit Federal funds from being used to pay for \nthe costs associated with assisted suicide.\n  I want to say right off that the Dorgan-Ashcroft bill does not \nattempt to address the broad and complex issue of whether there is a \nconstitutional right to die. That job belongs to the Supreme Court, and \nas you all know, the High Court is expected to issue a decision later \nthis year to answer this fundamental question.\n  It is the job of Congress, however, to determine how our Federal \nresources will be allocated. I do not believe Congress ever intended \nfor Federal funding to be used for assisted suicide, and my bill will \nensure that such funding does not occur.\n  I understand that the decisions that confront individuals and their \nfamilies when a terminal illness strikes are among the most difficult a \nfamily will ever have to make. At times like this, each of us must rely \non our own religious beliefs and conscience to guide us.\n  But regardless of one's personal views about assisted suicide, I feel \nstrongly that Federal tax dollars should not be used for this \ncontroversial practice, and the vast majority of Americans agree with \nme. In fact, when asked in a poll in November of last year whether tax \ndollars should be spent for assisting suicide, 87 percent of Americans \nfeel tax money should not be spent for this purpose.\n  The Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act prevents any Federal \nfunding from being used for any item or service which is intended to \ncause, or assist in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing \nof any individual.\n  This bill does make some important exceptions. First, this bill \nexplicitly provides that it does not limit the withholding or \nwithdrawal of medical treatment or of nutrition or hydration from \nterminally ill patients who have decided that they do not want their \nlives sustained by medical technology. Most people and States recognize \nthat there are ethical, moral, and legal distinctions between actively \ntaking steps to end a patient's life and withholding or withdrawing \ntreatment in order to allow a patient to die naturally. Every State now \nhas a law in place governing a patient's right to lay out in advance, \nthrough an advanced directive, living will, or some other means, his or \nher\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\nwishes related to medical care at the end of life. Again, this \nlegislation would not interfere with the ability of patients and their \nfamilies to make clear and carry out their wishes regarding the \nwithholding or withdrawal of medical care that is prolonging the \npatient's life.\n  This bill also makes clear that it does not prevent Federal funding \nfor any care or service that is intended to alleviate a patient's pain \nor discomfort, even if the use of this pain control ultimately hastens \nthe patient's death. Large doses of medication are often needed to \neffectively reduce a terminally ill patient's pain, and this medication \nmay increase the patient's risk of death. I think we all would agree \nthat the utmost effort should be made to ensure that terminally ill \npatients do not spend their final days in pain and suffering.\n  Finally, while I think Federal dollars ought not be used to assist a \nsuicide, this bill does not prohibit a State from using its own dollars \nfor this purpose. However, I do not think taxpayers from other States, \nwho have determined that physician-assisted suicide should be illegal, \nshould be forced to pay for this practice through the use of Federal \ntax dollars.\n  I realize that the legality of assisted suicide has historically been \na State issue. There are 35 States, including my State of North Dakota, \nwhich have laws prohibiting assisted suicide and at least 8 other \nStates consider this practice to be illegal under common law. Only one \nState, Oregon, has a law legalizing assisted suicide.\n  However, two circumstances have changed that now make this an issue \nof Federal concern. First, the Supreme Court's decisions in Washington \nversus Glucksberg and Quill versus Vacco could have enormous \nconsequences on our public policy regarding assisted suicide. In these \ntwo cases, the Federal Ninth Second Circuit Courts of Appeal have \nstruck down Washington and New York State statutes outlawing assisted \nsuicide. Although the circuit courts varied in their legal reasoning, \nboth recognized a constitutional right to die.\n  Second, we are on the brink of a situation where Federal Medicaid \ndollars may soon be used to reimburse physicians who help their \npatients die. In another case, Lee versus Oregon, a Federal district \ncourt judge has ruled that Oregon's 1994 law allowing assisted suicide \nis unconstitutional and he has blocked its implementation. However, his \ndecision has been appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which \nhas already recognized a constitutional right to die.\n  Once the legal challenges to Oregon's law have been resolved, the \nState's Medicaid director has already stated that Oregon will begin \nusing its Federal Medicaid dollars to reimburse physicians for their \ncosts associated with assisting in suicide. Should this occur, Congress \nwill not have considered this issue. I do not think it was Congress' \nintention for Medicaid or other Federal dollars to be used to assist in \nsuicide, and I hope we will take action soon to stop this practice \nbefore it starts.\n  It is important to point out that the Supreme Court decisions will \nnot resolve the important issue of funding for assisted suicides. Even \nif the Supreme Court finds that there is not a constitutional right to \nassisted suicide, the ruling likely will not negate Oregon's statute \npermitting assisted suicide. As a result, the Ninth Circuit Court could \nwell uphold the Oregon statute and Oregon could, in turn, bill Medicaid \nfor the costs associated with assisted suicide. If Congress does not \nact to disallow Federal funding, a few States, or a few judges, may \nvery well take this decision out of our hands.\n  The National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Right to \nLife Committee have endorsed this legislation. The American Medical \nAssociation and the American Nurses Association have issued position \nstatements opposing assisted suicide, and President Clinton has also \nindicated his opposition to assisted suicide.\n  I hope you agree with me and the vast majority of Americans who \noppose using scarce Federal dollars to pay for assisted suicide. I \ninvite you to join me, Senator Ashcroft and 28 of our colleagues in \nthis effort by cosponsoring the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction \nAct.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 304\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am grateful for this opportunity to \nspeak to my colleagues and to the American public about an item which \nis important and which demands our attention. It is an item of urgency. \nAnd because it is, I think it is important that we develop a sense of \ncooperation and that we act expeditiously.\n  A lot of comment is being heard these days about bipartisanship, the \nneed to cooperate and to be partners and participants rather than being \nopponents and partisans. The measure about which I will speak today is \none that has broad bipartisan support, and I think is something upon \nwhich cooperation is not only taking place, but one which will provide \nthe basis for the ultimate passage of the legislation.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle agree that Federal health programs \nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid should provide a means to care for and to \nprotect our citizens--not become vehicles for the destruction or \nimpairment of our citizens.\n  The Declaration of Independence reads: ``We hold these truths to be \nself-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by \ntheir Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are \nLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.'' It is Congress' \nresponsibility to defend the foremost of our inalienable rights--that \nof life.\n  In this spirit and understanding, I rise today to introduce with \nSenators Dorgan, Nickles, Ford, and others, the Assisted Suicide \nFunding Restriction Act of 1997, a modest and a timely response to the \nthreat that taxes paid by American citizens would be used to finance \nassisted suicide. What this bill simply says is that Federal tax \ndollars shall not be used to pay for and promote assisted suicide or \neuthanasia. We introduced such a bill in the 104th Congress, and have \nwide bipartisan support for this legislation, with 30 Members of the \nU.S. Senate as original cosponsors on the bill.\n  This bill is urgently needed to preserve the intent of our Founding \nFathers and the integrity of Federal programs that serve the elderly \nand the seriously ill, programs which were intended to support and \nenhance human health and life, not to promote the destruction of human \nlife.\n  Government's role in our culture should be to call us to our highest \nand best, to expand our capacity to take advantage of the opportunities \nof life, and to build our capacity for achievement. I do not believe \nthat Government has a place in hastening Americans to their graves.\n  Our court system is, however, on the brink of allowing Federal-\ntaxpayer-assisted suicide funding. This bill is intended to preempt and \nto prevent proactively such a morally contemptible practice as taking \ntax money from one American and using it to assist in the suicide of \nanother American.\n  Let me be clear that this bill only affects Federal funding for \nactions whose direct purpose is to cause or to assist in causing \nsuicide--actions that are clearly condemned as unethical by the \nAmerican Medical Association and illegal in the vast majority of \nStates. Again, this bill simply prohibits any Federal funding for \nmedical actions that assist suicide.\n  Some might ask why we need such a law. It is because two Federal \ncourts of appeals recently contradicted the positions of 49 States when \nthey found that there is a Federal constitutional ``right'' to \nphysician-assisted suicide. These cases involved New York and \nWashington State laws which prohibit physician-assisted suicide.\n  The State of Oregon recently passed Measure No. 16. That was the \nfirst law in the country that authorized the dispensing of lethal drugs \nto terminally ill patients to assist in suicide. Although a Federal \ncourt in Oregon struck down that law, the case has been to the ninth \ncircuit, one of the appeals courts that has already signaled a strong \nindication that there is a constitutional right to assisted suicide.\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\n  Oregon's Medicaid director and the chairman of the Oregon Health \nServices Commission have both said that in the event that the ninth \ncircuit would clear the way for Oregon's law to take effect, the \nfederally funded Medicaid Program in Oregon would begin to pay for \nassisted suicide with public funds in that State. According to the \nOregon authorities, the procedure would be listed on Medicaid \nreimbursement forms under the grotesque euphemism of ``comfort care.''\n  Unless we pass the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act, Oregon \ncould soon be drawing down Federal funds through its Medicaid Program \nto help pay for assisted suicides. Neither Medicaid, nor Medicare, nor \nany other Federal health program has explicit statutory language to \nprohibit the use of Federal funds to dispense lethal drugs for suicide \nprimarily because no one in the history of these programs ever thought \nthat they would be used to end the lives of individuals. We have always \nfocused in these programs on seeking to extend rather than end the \nlives of Americans.\n  In fact, the Clinton administration's brief filed in the Supreme \nCourt of the United States opposing physician-assisted suicide pointed \nout that:\n\n       The Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates 173 \n     medical centers, 126 nursing homes, and 55 inpatient \n     hospices, has a policy manual that . . . forbids ``the active \n     hastening of the moment of death.''\n\n  ``The active hastening of the moment of death'' sounds a lot like \nassisted suicide to me.\n  Such guidelines also apply to the VA's hospice program, the military \nservices, the Indian Health Service, and the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  Nonetheless, if the ninth circuit reinstates Oregon's Measure 16, \nFederal funds will be used for the so-called comfort care, also known \nas assisted suicide.\n  I believe we would be derelict in our duty if we were to ignore this \nproblem and allow a few officials in one State to decide that the \ntaxpayers of the other 49 States must help subsidize a practice that \nthey have never authorized and that millions of Americans find to be \nmorally abhorrent.\n  It is crystal clear that the American people do not want their tax \ndollars spent on assisting the suicide of individuals. Recently, a \nnational Wirthlin poll showed that 87 percent of Americans oppose the \nuse of public funds for this purpose. Even the voters of Oregon, who \nnarrowly approved Measure 16 by a 51- to 49-percent margin, did not \nconsider the question of public funding. The voters of two other west \ncoast States, California and Washington, soundly defeated similar \nmeasures to authorize assisted suicide. Since November 1994, when \nOregon passed its law, 15 other States have considered and rejected \nbills to legalize the practice. However, this bill does not talk about \nauthorizing or prohibiting assisted suicide. It merely states that no \nFederal funds could be used to promote or assist suicide.\n  Let me just say a few words about the way the legislation is crafted. \nIt is very limited. It is very modest, and I think that provides the \nbasis for its bipartisan support.\n  It does not forbid a State to legalize assisted suicide, and it does \nnot forbid using State funds for the practice. It merely prevents \nFederal funds and Federal programs from being drawn into promoting it.\n  The bill also does not attempt to resolve the constitutional issue \nthat the Supreme Court considered last month when it heard the cases of \nWashington versus Glucksberg and Vacco versus Quill. These are right-\nto-suicide cases, and the bill does not attempt to answer this complex \nquestion. Nor would this legislation be affected by what the Supreme \nCourt decides on the issue. Congress would still have the right to \nprevent Federal funding of such a practice even if the practice itself \nhad the status of a constitutional ``right.''\n  As the bill's rule of construction clearly provides, this legislation \ndoes not affect any other life issue that some might have strong \nfeelings about. The bill does not affect abortion, or complex issues \nsuch as the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, \neven of nutrition or hydration. Nor does it affect the dispersing of \nlarge doses of morphine or other drugs to ease the pain of terminal \nillness, even when this may carry the risk of hastening death as a \nside-effect--a practice that is legally accepted in all 50 States, and \nethically accepted by the medical profession and even by pro-life and \nreligious organizations. This bill is focused exclusively on \nprohibiting Federal funding for assisting suicide.\n  Finally, I am pleased to mention those organizations that have joined \nwith us in endorsing this legislation. These include the American \nMedical Association, the Christian Coalition, the Family Research \nCouncil, Free Congress, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, \nNational Right to Life, and the Traditional Values Coalition. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of support \nfrom the American Medical Association.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                   Chicago, IL, February 12, 1997.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft: The American Medical Association \n     (AMA) is pleased to support the ``Assisted Suicide Funding \n     Restriction Act of 1997'' which you are introducing in \n     collaboration with Senator Dorgan. We believe that the \n     prohibition of federal funding for any act that supports \n     ``assisted suicide'' sends a strong message from our elected \n     officials that such acts are not to be encouraged or \n     condoned. The power to assist in intentionally taking the \n     life of a patient is antithetical to the central mission of \n     healing that guides physicians. While some patients today \n     regrettably do not receive adequate treatment for pain or \n     depression, the proper response is an increased effort to \n     educate both physicians and their patients as to available \n     palliative measures and multidisciplinary interventions. The \n     AMA is currently designing just such a far-reaching, \n     comprehensive effort in conjunction with the Robert Wood \n     Johnson Foundation.\n       The AMA is particularly pleased to note that your bill \n     acknowledges--in its ``Rules of Construction'' section--the \n     appropriate role for physicians and other caregivers in end-\n     of-life patient care. The Rules properly distinguish the \n     passive intervention of withholding or withdrawing medical \n     treatment or care (including nutrition and hydration) from \n     the active role of providing the direct means to kill \n     someone. Most important to the educational challenge cited \n     above is the Rule of Construction which recognizes the \n     medical principle of ``secondary effect,'' that is, the \n     provision of adequate palliative treatment, even though the \n     palliative agent may also foreseeably hasten death. This \n     provision assures patients and physicians alike that \n     legislation opposing assisted suicide will not chill \n     appropriate palliative and end-of-life care. Such a chilling \n     effect would, in fact, have the perverse result of increasing \n     patients' perceived desire for a ``quick way out.''\n       The AMA continues to stand by its ethical principle that \n     physician-assisted suicide is fundamentally incompatible with \n     the physician's role as healer, and that physicians must, \n     instead, aggressively respond to the needs of patients at the \n     end of life. We are pleased to support this carefully crafted \n     legislative effort, and offer our continuing assistance in \n     educating patients, physicians and elected officials alike as \n     to the alternatives available at the end of life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               P. John Seward, MD.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. President Jefferson wrote in words that are now \ninscribed in the Jefferson Memorial here in Washington that the ``care \nand protection of human life, and not its destruction,'' are the only \nlegitimate objectives of good government. Thomas Jefferson believed \nthat our rights are God given and that life is an inalienable right. \nWith this understanding and belief, I urge the Congress and the \nPresident to support this bill. It is a modest but necessary effort to \nuphold our basic principles by forbidding the Federal funding of \nassisted suicide.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota for his \nexcellent work, his cooperation in this respect, and his emphasis on \nwhat this bill does and what it does not do. There is a narrow focus in \nthis measure. We do not seek to preempt the ability of States to make \ndecisions regarding their own laws, or individuals to make their own \ndecisions. We are merely making reference to the fact that the Federal \nGovernment should not be financing assisted suicides.\n  I thank him for his outstanding work and for his excellent effort in \ndeveloping this legislation, to narrowly focus it and target it in such \na way that makes it possible for us to work together. I commend him.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act. In so doing I side with \nthe 87 percent of Americans who oppose the use\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\nof tax dollars to pay for the cost of assisting suicide or euthanasia.\n  I find it deeply distressing, Mr. President, that we are in the \nthroes of a legal and public policy debate over whether physicians \nshould be given the power to end the lives of their patients. This \ncontroversy raises many troublesome questions concerning the duties of \na physician, the nature of the doctor-patient relationship, the \npossibility of coerced suicide, and the very sanctity of life.\n  Some may find these questions difficult or even impossible to answer. \nBut of one thing I am certain: the government has no right to use \npublic moneys, the tax dollars paid by the American people, to support \nphysician assisted suicide. Whatever their views on the rectitude of \nallowing doctors to assist their patients in ending their lives, I hope \nmy colleagues will join with me in saying that such a controversial \npractice, which so many Americans find morally troubling, should not be \nthe object of Federal largesse.\n  I congratulate my friends the Senator from North Dakota and the \nSenator from Missouri on their courage and conviction in submitting \nthis bill, and urge my colleagues to join them in its support.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the Assisted \nSuicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997, I rise in strong support of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, this bill simply prohibits Federal tax funds from \nbeing used to pay for or promote assisted suicide or euthanasia. \nSpecifically, the bill will prevent Federal funding for items or \nservices ``the purpose of which is to cause, or assist in causing, the \nsuicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual.'' The \nprohibition will encompass Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees \nHealth Program, medical services for prisoners, and the military health \ncare system.\n  This bill does not create any limitation with regard to the \nwithholding or withdrawing of medical treatment or of nutrition or \nhydration, or affect funding for abortion or for alleviating pain or \ndiscomfort for patients.\n  The American people oppose taxpayer funding of assisted suicide by an \noverwhelming margin. In addition, the American Medical Association has \nendorsed this bill. Yet States are free to legalize assisted suicide, \nas Oregon has by referendum, and this raises the prospect of Federal \nMedicaid dollars being used to facilitate suicide. The Federal \nGovernment must not be in the business of promoting death. Let's listen \nto the American people and settle the question of publicly funding \nassisted suicide once and for all. I urge my colleague to join us in \nsupporting the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997.\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to express my \nsupport of the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of which I am a \ncosponsor. This bill would ensure that no Federal tax dollars are used \nto pay for or promote assisted suicide or euthanasia. In addition, it \nidentifies those Federal programs which may not be sued to pay for \nassisted suicide. These programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits plans, medical services for Federal \nprisoners, and the military health care system.\n  This bill also makes clear that Federal law will not require health \ncare facilities, in States where assisted suicide has been legalized, \nto advise patients at the time of admission about their ``right'' to \nget lethal drugs for suicide.\n  This legislation is needed due to recent Federal court rulings which \nhave declared a constitutional right to assisted suicide. The U.S. \nSupreme Court heard oral arguments in two cases on January 8 of this \nyear to determine the constitutionality of those rulings. In addition, \nsome States, such as Oregon, have legalized assisted suicide by \nreferendum. These States may be tempted to consider using Federal funds \nand facilities to pay for these procedures. For this reason, we must \nsend a clear message. The American people do not want their tax dollars \nused to pay for assisted suicides. In fact, a majority of Americans are \nstrongly opposed to the very notion of assisted suicide. Counted among \nthose in opposition are the American Medical Association whose \nphysician members would be asked to play the role of moral arbitrator \nin the decision to end one's life.\n  The purpose of this bill and its guidelines are concise and clear. No \nlimitations will be placed on the withholding or withdrawing of medical \ntreatment. In addition, it does not affect funding for alleviating \npatient pain or discomfort.\n  An overwhelming majority of the American people believe their taxes \nshould not be used to pay for assisted suicide or euthanasia. A \nnational Wirthlin poll taken in November 1996 found that 87 percent of \nAmericans did not believe their tax dollars should be used to pay for \nthese procedures.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill which \nguarantees every American that their tax dollars will not be used to \npay for or promote assisted suicide or euthanasia.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today, and begin with these words: \n``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of \nHappiness.''\n  These profound words are possibly the most known words from our \nDeclaration of Independence. They state a principle that is fundamental \nto who we are as a nation; life itself is a gift from our Creator, and \nit is a right that can not be taken away. We are a nation whose core \nphilosophy is to care for its people.\n  As public servants, we deal with issues that affect the lives of \npeople every day. Caring for people is the underlying aspect of almost \nevery piece of legislation dealt with in the Senate, and nearly every \nissue we confront as a country.\n  But while we work to build up America, something is at work in the \ncountry, eating away at fundamentals we used to take for granted: in \nthis case, the sanctity of life. It is no secret that I place a high \nvalue on life at its conception. But a disturbing trend has developed \nover the past few years, a devaluation of life as it nears its end.\n  Two years ago, I offered legislation banning the use of Medicaid and \nMedicare funds for assisted suicide in the 1995 balanced budget act. \nUnfortunately the President vetoed this legislation.\n  Today, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the legislation offered by \nSenators Ashcroft and Dorgan, which prohibits any Federal funds from \nbeing used for assisted suicide, euthanasia or mercy killing. This \nmeans that hospitals, medical institutions, or health care providers \nare not required to participate in procedures they morally or ethically \noppose.\n  The large majority of people oppose assisted suicide. In a Wirthlin \npoll taken November 5, 1996, 87 percent of the people asked said tax \ndollars should not be spent to pay for the cost of assisting suicide or \neuthanasia. A recent study by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in \nBoston, found that seriously ill cancer patients in severe pain are \nunlikely to ``approve of, or desire'' euthanasia or physician-assisted \nsuicide, instead they desire ``only relief from their pain''.\n  Even the medical profession is opposed to assisted suicide. An amicus \nbrief filed by the American Medical Association to the Supreme Court on \nNovember 12, 1996, contends assisted suicide ``will create profound \ndanger for many ill persons with undiagnosed depression and \ninadequately treat pain, for whom assisted suicide rather than good \npalliative care could become the norm. At greatest risk would be those \nwith the least access to palliative care--the poor, the elderly and \nmembers of minority groups.'' The brief concludes, ``Although, for some \npatients it might appear compassionate to hasten death, \ninstitutionalizing physician-assisted suicide as a medical treatment \nwould put many more patients at serious risk for unwanted and \nunnecessary death.''\n  Dr. Joanne Lynn, board member of the American Geriatrics Society and \ndirector of the Center to Improve Care of the Dying at George \nWashington University said--Health Line, Jan. 8, 1997--``No one needs \nto be alone or in pain or beg a doctor to put an end to misery. Good \ncare is possible.''\n  As Tracy Miller, former head of the New York Task Force on Life and \nLaw said, ``It is far easier to assist patients in killing themselves \nthan it is to care for them at life's end.''\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\n  The bill before us today is a major step in continuing to provide the \ncare our elderly, poor, and seriously ill need and deserve. The bill \nwould assure that the programs designed to support human life and \nhealth would not be transformed into implements of death. I commend the \nwork of Senator Ashcroft and Senator Dorgan in writing this \nlegislation, compliment them upon its introduction today, and pledge to \nwork with them to see it to passage in the 105th Congress. Our country \ndeserves no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Robb, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n        Dodd, Mr. Biden, Mr. Craig, Mr. Allard, Mr. Mack, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Bond, Mr. Burns, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Specter, Mr. Reed, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Moynihan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Lott, Mr. Gorton, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Grams, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Shelby, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 305. A bill to authorize the President to award a gold medal on \nbehalf of the Congress to Francis Albert ``Frank'' Sinatra in \nrecognition of his outstanding and enduring contributions through his \nentertainment career and humanitarian activities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                         gold medal legislation\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce \nlegislation on behalf of 48 Senators. I know and feel very strongly \nthat when all of my colleagues are informed of the legislation that it \nwill be unanimous and that all will join to authorize a congressional \ngold medal for Frank Sinatra. The time has come for Congress to \nacknowledge this great American and his contributions to the world of \nentertainment and society as a whole.\n  It is fitting that we honor this man in the autumn of his years, as \nwe have honored Bob Hope, John Wayne, Marian Anderson and other great \nperformers, not only for the fact of their entertainment and the \nwonderful gift that God bestowed upon them, but for so many other \naspects in terms of their bond with America, its people, and their \ncontributions.\n  Mr. President, this bill would authorize the U.S. Mint to commemorate \nthe humanitarian and professional accomplishments of Frank Sinatra with \na gold medal to be presented by the President on behalf of the \nCongress. In addition, bronze replicas of the original gold medal will \nbe available to the general public for their private collection.\n  It is estimated that not only will we be doing great honor to Frank \nSinatra, but, in addition, it will result in a very substantial profit \nto the Treasury because many will buy these replicas, and indeed \nmillions of dollars can and will be raised by our Government.\n  Mr. President, Frank Sinatra has become one of the most, if not the \nmost, recognizable vocalists in America and in the world. This talented \nman has singularly defined America's love affair with popular music for \nover five generations and has remained to this day a man of the people, \na man who has brought pleasure to countless persons.\n  The tremendous, positive impact Frank Sinatra has on people \nthroughout the world is truly phenomenal. His songs have become a \nstandard for young and old alike. Indeed, this impact goes beyond song \nand it goes beyond adversity. Frank Sinatra knew adversity and he \novercame it in his own career rising to great heights. He overcame the \ntrials and tribulations during his life and became a great \nhumanitarian.\n  Many people who adore Frank Sinatra and his music are not aware of \nthat other side of the man--his generosity. Truly he could be called \nMr. Anonymous because, Mr. President, unlike many who trumpet their \ngenerosity, who trumpet their gift giving, Mr. Sinatra did not do this. \nIndeed, he has raised literally hundreds of millions of dollars--not \ntens of millions--hundreds of millions of dollars for children, in \nparticular, throughout the world, for those who were in need of help, \nwhether it be for cancer, for AIDS, for retinitis pigmentosa--just name \nthe charity and you will see that Francis Albert Sinatra most likely \nhas been there, quietly giving of his time and his energy in caring for \nhis fellow human being, giving back to the people of this country, \nthroughout the length and breadth, establishing scholarships for young \npeople, going back to his hometown and to his old high school to give \nof his time and his money. He took his wonderful gift of song and used \nit as a vehicle of benevolence.\n  Let me just touch on one of these as an example. Mr. Sinatra has \nraised $9 million for just one institution, a great cancer center, \nSloan-Kettering, by holding five concerts. I do not know how many know \nthat. He did not ask his publicist to go out and speak to that. The \nmoney raised by Frank Sinatra began programs whereby those who are in \nneed of treatment and do not have the financial wherewithal will not be \nturned away. This is because of the generosity of Frank Sinatra.\n  Indeed, New Jersey can be rightfully proud of him, born in Hoboken in \n1915 to parents of modest means. I am pleased that both of the Senators \nfrom New Jersey have joined in cosponsoring this legislation. Those of \nus in New York are so proud, and we also claim him as a son of New \nYork. He has given us the gift of his great performances, and we \nparticularly love his rendition of ``New York, New York.'' But look \nthroughout the country, the great Windy City of Chicago, and how \nfitting that the senior Senator from Illinois has also joined in this \ntribute which is long overdue.\n\n  Mr. President, it cannot be denied that Frank Sinatra has had a \nremarkable career. Not long after reaching adolescence, he developed a \nkeen love of music and the desire to perform. In high school he was \nresponsible for screening and scheduling dance bands for Demarest High \nSchool's Wednesday night dances. In exchange for hiring musicians, he \nwas permitted to sing a few songs with the different bands.\n  A dream was growing in the young Frank Sinatra--his dream of becoming \na successful entertainer. By the age of 21, Frank Sinatra was a \nprofessional singer. His first group was the Three Flashes, a singing \nand dancing trio which later became the Hoboken Four. A few years \nlater, Frank Sinatra's investment in vocal lessons would prove to be \ninvaluable as his singing career propelled him into stardom.\n  In 1939, Frank Sinatra was hired by Harry James who had recently \nformed an orchestra of his own. The earliest performance reviews were \nnot favorable, but Frank Sinatra persevered. Seven months later, he was \nhired away to join Tommy Dorsey's orchestra where he would formulate \nthe essence of his signature singing style.\n  After a successful, 2-year tour with Tommy Dorsey, Frank Sinatra made \nthe move to go out on his own in 1942. He recorded the first of \nnumerous hit singles titled ``Night and Day.'' A year later he made his \nmotion picture debut and had appeared in several movies by 1950. But, \nas quickly as Frank Sinatra found himself ``king of the hill, at the \ntop of the heap,'' he found the constant demand on his time and talent \ncontributing to a decline in his vocal quality.\n  By the end of 1952, he had lost his agent and his film and recording \ncontracts. The ``voice'' was nearly lost as well. Frank Sinatra was \nonce eloquently quoted saying: ``You have to scrape bottom to \nappreciate life and start living again.''\n  This personally and professionally trying time ended in 1953 with \nFrank Sinatra's award winning performance playing the role of Maggio in \nthe production ``From Here to Eternity.'' The rebirth of his career was \nfinally at hand. Frank Sinatra's new stardom quickly surpassed that \nwhich he had realized in the 1940's.\n  Beginning in the 1960's, Frank Sinatra's flourishing acclaim as a \npreeminent performer earned him the title ``Chairman of the Board.'' He \nestablished his own recording company, Reprise, and began recording \nagain, this time with more conviction than ever before. Frank Sinatra \norchestrated television specials which featured little-known musical \ntalents, performed live for huge, adoring audiences and began\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\nto evolve as a legend. By 1984, his singing repertoire included well \nover 50 albums and record sales in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  Throughout his entertainment career and rise to fame, Frank Sinatra \nworked tirelessly and steadfastly to cure some of the ills of society. \nIn one of the most outstanding examples of his generosity, Frank \nSinatra personally, and entirely, I might add, financed and donated his \ntalent and superstardom along with other renowned performers for a \nworld tour benefitting children's hospitals, orphanages, and schools in \nsix countries. This whirlwind jaunt included 30 concerts in 10 weeks. \nAnd never once did Frank Sinatra seek glory from this feat through \npublicity or any other means.\n  Frank Sinatra's generosity has touched the lives of the \nunderprivileged, the terminally and chronically ill, children, \nminorities and students not only in this country, but in Latin America, \nIsrael, Europe, and Mexico. His works of goodwill have financed entire \nwings in hospitals, numerous scholarships, educational programs, and \nstudent centers. He has selflessly served as chairman on numerous \nboards for charities and councils borne out of sincerity, humility, and \nthe goal of equality. If I could stand here and recite all of the \nthings Frank Sinatra has done from his heart for his fellow man and \nwoman, poor, old, young, sick and the like, and recited all of the \nawards this giant among us has received, I would be here all day.\n\n  Mr. President, since 1945 Frank Sinatra's national and international \nhumanitarian activities have been recognized. Just as a small sampling, \nhe has been awarded with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the NAACP, \nthe Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild, the New York City \nColumbus Citizens Committee Humanitarian Award, the Kennedy Center \nHonors, the Scopus Award from the American Friends of Hebrew \nUniversity, the Philadelphia Freedom Medal and the highest civilian \nhonor in out country, the Medal of Freedom given to him by another \nAmerican hero, President Ronald Reagan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na selection of charities Mr. Sinatra graciously donated to and honors \nhe received be printed in the record.\n  Mr. President, I must say to you that the idea and the driving force \nbehind Congressional recognition of Francis Albert Sinatra in the \nautumn of his life came from a Congressman born in Puerto Rico. This \nCongressman recently told me the touching and true story of how he \nlearned English at the age of five from Frank Sinatra. That Congressman \nis Congressman Jose Serrano. His father, a World War II veteran, came \nhome from the war with a group of 78 RPM records. On those records was \nthe melodic voice of Frank Sinatra. Congressman Serrano said to me, \n``Senator, I learned to speak English. I didn't know any English. When \nmy father came home, as a youngster, I would play these records. Frank \nSinatra has been my idol.'' Mr. Sinatra's voice filled the Serrano \nhousehold then as it does today. I thank my colleague for his diligence \nin working to have Frank Sinatra placed in a league with other \ndeserving performers and philanthropists.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks by citing a great song that \nFrank Sinatra popularized, ``My Way.'' I am not going to attempt the \nlyrics. I have sung on the Senate floor before and I promised Senator \nFord I would not do so again, after his admonition. He was about to \nrise up and object. My mother cautioned me against attempting to sing \nagain. But let me say when Frank Sinatra sings ``My Way,'' those words \nembody the spirit of this country, the spirit of giving people having \nthe opportunity to do it their way, to rise, to climb to the heights \nthat only America ensures.\n  My true hope is that before this legislation is enacted, we will have \n100 cosponsors honoring a talented American, a gifted American, who has \ngiven so generously of himself not only in his performances but in \nterms of making this a better country and a better world for so many \nwho are less fortunate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague and friend, \nSenator D'Amato, as a cosponsor of his bill to award a Congressional \nGold Medal to Francis Albert Sinatra. Frank Sinatra is one of the most \nfamous singers in the history of popular music. He is known as ``The \nVoice,'' ``Old Blue Eyes,'' and ``The Chairman of the Board.'' These \nnicknames attest as clearly as anything to his talent, his popular \nappeal, and his impact on American music.\n  Mr. Sinatra began his career with local bands in New Jersey. He \njoined Harry James' band in 1939, but began to achieve his great \npopularity touring with Tommy Dorsey from 1940 to 1942. His solo career \nbegan in 1943 and never ceased.\n  After conquering the musical world Mr. Sinatra began a film career \nthat quickly earned him an academy award, in 1953, for his supporting \nrole in ``From Here to Eternity.'' He went on to appear in some 50 \nmovies.\n  Mr. President, New York has no official State song. For six decades \nnow Frank Sinatra has entertained New Yorkers in music and film. His \nimpact has been tremendous. But more than anything else his version of \n``New York, New York'' has given us cheer, enjoyment, and pride. It is \ncertainly the unofficial song for millions. Therefore, I am delighted \nto cosponsor this bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Frank \nSinatra. I encourage my colleagues to join us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 306. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na decrease in the maximum rate of tax on capital gains which is based \non the length of time the taxpayer held the capital asset; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       CAPITAL GAINS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing capital gains \nlegislation which I believe has the possibility of breaking through the \nimpasse we have had on this issue for the last several years. My \nproposal is based not on political rhetoric, but on conversations I \nhave had with constituents who support a commonsense approach on this \nissue.\n  My legislation would provide a sliding scale for capital gains \nrelief, lowering the rate at which capital gains are taxed, based on \nhow long the assets have been held. For every year an asset has been \nheld, the applicable rate would be reduced by 2 percentage points. \nAssets held for more than 1 year would be taxed at no higher than the \ncurrent 28 percent. Assets held for 2 years would be taxed at no higher \nthan 26 percent. And so on, down to a rate of 14 percent. Assets held \nfor more than 8 years would be taxed at a maximum rate of 14 percent.\n  I am introducing the legislation with three objectives in mind. \nFirst, I believe our efforts should be directed toward helping family \nfarms and small family businesses. We do not need additional proposals \nto assist real estate speculators or those who specialize in putting \nWall Street deals together. Most capital gains proposals we have \nconsidered in recent years provide a disproportionate benefit to those \nmaking six-figure salaries and above. It should be clear by now that we \ncannot pass a capital gains proposal that primarily benefits the \nwealthy. In my experience, those middle-class families that should be \nthe focus of the debate get lost in the shuffle.\n  Second, using this proposal, I intend to work with others interested \nin the issue to attempt to develop a bipartisan coalition with middle \nclass families in mind. There are few lasting legislative changes that \nhave not been developed in a bipartisan way. This is particularly true \nin the area of tax policy. Capital gains reform has been a hot button \ncampaign issue for several years, often being used in an attempt to \nsecure partisan advantage. I think it is time to move beyond this \nstage. There are plenty of Members on both sides of the aisle \ninterested in providing capital gains relief. I think we should attempt \nto find middle ground that takes into account the views of both \nDemocrats and Republicans interested in this issue.\n  Third, we must face budget realities. It appears likely that any \ncapital gains proposal which can pass this Congress must be included in \nan overall balanced budget package as part of a reasonable level of tax \nrelief. Some of the capital gains proposals considered during the last \nCongress were estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to result in \nmore than $40 billion being added to the Federal deficit over 7 years, \nrequiring enormous offsets. Even the modified proposal included in the \nreconciliation package vetoed by the President was scored by CBO at \nmore than $35 billion. I believe this is more than we can afford in the \ncontext of balancing the budget. It also seems to be far more than what \nis needed to target relief to middle-class families, and especially \nfarmers and small businesses.\n  I am also aware of the criticism by some on the other side of the \naisle that certain Democratic capital gains proposals are picking and \nchoosing among certain types of assets, and therefore picking and \nchoosing winners and losers. My proposal avoids that criticism. It \nwould apply to all types of assets that are covered under current law. \nIt is nondiscriminatory. However, because of the sliding-scale benefit \nbased on the holding period, I believe the impact will be to provide \nthe greatest benefit to middle-class families like those farm families \nand small businesses I have in mind.\n  So, Mr. President, it is my hope that this concept will be taken \nseriously in the spirit of reaching a bipartisan compromise on this \nissue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a chart which demonstrates the operation of this capital gains \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 306\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DECREASE IN MAXIMUM CAPITAL GAINS RATE BASED ON \n                   TAXPAYER'S HOLDING PERIOD.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1(h) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to maximum

Mr. McConnell, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n\n  S. 307. A bill to amend the Federal Property and Administrative \nServices Act of 1949 to authorize the transfer to States of surplus \npersonal property for donation to nonprofit providers of assistance to \nimpoverished families and individuals, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               The Federal Surplus Property Donation Act\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I use today to introduce the Federal \nSurplus Property Donations Act. This bill corrects an oversight by \nallowing nonprofit charitable organizations that primarily serve low-\nincome people, to be eligible to receive Federal surplus personal \nproperty.\n  Under current law, Federal surplus property can be donated to State \nand local governments, schools, hospitals, and nonprofit organizations \nthat serve the homeless. My bill would expand the eligibility to food \nbanks, construction oriented charities, building material recycling \nwarehouses, and similar nonprofit tax-exempt organizations that serve \nthe poor. The bill does not give preference to these organizations, but \nsimply adds them to the list of eligible recipients.\n  Charities that provide food and shelter assistance are major \ncontributors to the safety net for the poor. As we look to charities to \nprovide these important services to our Nation's low-income population, \nit is reasonable that we include them as eligible to receive surplus \nproperty. Excess property can be used creatively by these groups to \nlower expenses, thereby allowing charities to become more efficient. \nThese nonprofit charitable organizations serving the poor are in great \nneed of materials and equipment to build and repair homes, store food \nitems, and deliver goods and services to those in need. We have already \nacknowledged that nonprofit charities serving the homeless should be \neligible to receive these goods. This bill would recognize those \ncharitable institutions which are providing shelter, food, and services \nto low-income Americans who may not be homeless.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would provide donated equipment and \ngoods at lower costs than alternative approaches such as grants to \ncharities. Furthermore, it is a wise use of moneys either paid in taxes \nor donated by generous citizens. Domestic charities will make good use \nof Federal surplus and invest moneys saved in expanded efforts to \nfurther help those in need.\n  The bill has bipartisan support. Cosponsoring the bill with me today \nare the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry Committee, Senator Tom Harkin, as well as the chairman and \nranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, Senator McConnell and \nSenator Leahy. In addition, I am pleased to say that my Indiana \ncolleague in the House, Congressman Lee Hamilton, is introducing the \nsame bill today.\n  Mr. President, I have personally supported various food banks in \nIndiana over the years. I am now proud to introduce a bill that will \nassist them in their continued efforts of serving the poor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 307\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a \nstudy concerning grazing use of certain land within and adjacent to \nGrand Teton National Park, WY, and to extend temporarily certain \ngrazing privileges; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               THE GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \ndesigned to protect open space near and around Grand Teton National \nPark. Currently, open space near the park, with its majestic, signature \nvistas and abundant wildlife, continues to decline. As the population \ngrows in Teton County, WY, undeveloped land near the park becomes more \nscarce. This loss of open space negatively impacts wildlife migration \nroutes in the area and diminishes the experience of visitors to the \nregion. The repercussions due to the loss of open space can be felt \nthroughout the entire area. As stewards, we must act now to preserve \nthe view and make such a value a component of our environmental agenda.\n  A few working ranches make up Teton Valley's remaining open space. \nThese ranches depend on grazing in Grand Teton National Park for summer \nrange to maintain their operations. The original act creating the park \nallowed several permittees to continue grazing in the area for the life \nof a designated heir in the family. Unfortunately, the last remaining \nheirs have died and their family's grazing privileges are going to be \nterminated. As a result, the open space around the park, which remains \navailable due to the viability of these ranch operations, will most \nlikely be subdivided and developed.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is designed to help continue \nto protect open space in Teton Valley. In order to develop the best \nsolution to protect open space near Teton Park, my legislation directs \nthe National Park Service to conduct a 3-year study of grazing in the \narea and its impact on open space in the region. This report should \ndevelop workable solutions that are fiscally responsible and conscious \nof the preservation of open space. The study will be conducted by the \nNational Park Service with input from citizens, local government \nofficials, and the landowners in the area.\n  With the approach of the spring and summer grazing season, it is \nvital for the Congress to act on this legislation as quickly as \npossible. I look forward to working with the National Park Service on \nthis important matter to preserve and protect open space in Teton \nValley. Grand Teton National Park is truly one of the treasures of our \nNation and this legislation will help preserve this wonderful area for \nmany years to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 309. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to prohibit the \nestablishment or collection of parking fees by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs at any parking facility connected with a Department of \nVeterans Affairs medical facility operated under a health-\n\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\ncare resources sharing agreement with the Department of Defense; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n               DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I offer a bill to allow the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs [VA] to waive fees at joint parking \nfacilities with the Department of Defense [DOD].\n  Currently, the VA is required to charge its users and employees to \npark at facilities built with special revolving funds. There is no \nexemption to this fee requirement for joint VA/DOD facilities, which \nresults in an administrative nightmare for a parking facility in \nHawaii.\n  The VA parking structure at Tripler Army Medical Hospital will be \nshared by VA and DOD. While the law currently requires VA visitors and \nmedical staff to pay for parking, DOD visitors and personnel are exempt \nfrom such a charge.\n  Determining who is a VA or DOD visitor to the facility will be \ndifficult to administer without creating a bureaucratic ordeal. Under \nthe current situation, only VA medical employees at Tripler will be \nrequired to pay for parking. Visitors, DOD personnel, and VA regional \nemployees would not be charged for parking.\n  In addition, any VA medical employee who is also a DOD retiree would \nbe exempt from the parking charge, because DOD retirees receive free \nparking at DOD facilities.\n  Thus, only VA medical personnel who are not DOD retirees will be \nrequired to pay for parking. The cost to administer this parking fee \nwill far outweigh the revenues received. Since parking fees are \ndetermined by surrounding area facilities and since Tripler is located \nin a residential area, parking fees for the Tripler facility would be \nnominal. Therefore, I am submitting legislation which will allow joint \nVA/DOD parking facilities to be exempt from the current \nstatute.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n\n  S. 312. A bill to revise the boundary of the Abraham Lincoln \nBirthplace National Historic Site in Larue County, KY, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      KNOB CREEK FARM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on this the 188th anniversary of the birth \nof Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States of America and \none of Kentucky's greatest native sons, I am introducing legislation to \nexpand the boundaries of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National \nHistoric Site to include Knob Creek Farm, Lincoln's boyhood home from \nthe ages of 2 to nearly 8. Located in Larue County near Hodgenville, \nKY, Knob Creek Farm is where President Lincoln learned some of his \nearliest lessons of life; lessons which helped mold the man who would \ngo on to lead our Nation through one of the most important and trying \nperiods in American history. I feel it is appropriate to honor the \nlegacy of this great leader by including Knob Creek Farm in the \nNational Historic Site.\n  Under this legislation, the cost of acquiring Knob Creek Farm would \nnot fall to the American taxpayer, but would instead be borne by the \nprivate sector. The National Park Trust, a private land conservancy \ndedicated to protecting America's natural and historical treasures, has \nbeen raising private funds and is currently negotiating to purchase the \n228-acre family-owned farm, located approximately 10 miles from the \nexisting Historic Site. After acquiring the farm, which is listed on \nthe National Register of Historic Places, the trust would donate the \nland to the Park Service.\n  Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ``A morsel of genuine history is a thing \nso rare as to be always valuable.'' Well, Mr. President, I think Knob \nCreek Farm represents just such a morsel, and including it in the \nAbraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site will allow current \nand future generations of Americans to share in the rare educational \nvalue of this historical property.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 312\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STUDY OF SURROUNDING RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall study the area \n     between and surrounding the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace \n     National Historic Site and the Knob Creek Farm in Larue \n     County, Kentucky.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the study shall be to--\n       (1) protect the resources of the Knob Creek Farm from \n     incompatible adjacent land uses; and\n       (2) identify significant resources associated with the \n     early boyhood of Abraham Lincoln.\n       (c) Considerations of Area Studied.--In examining the area \n     under study, the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) whether the area--\n       (A) possesses nationally significant natural, cultural, or \n     recreational resources;\n       (B) represents an important example of a particular \n     resource type in the country;\n       (C) is a suitable and feasible addition to the National \n     Park System; and\n       (D) is appropriate to ensure long-term resource protection \n     and visitor use;\n       (2) the public use potential of the area;\n       (3) the potential outdoor recreational opportunity provided \n     by the area;\n       (4) the interpretive and educational potential of the area;\n       (5) costs associated with the acquisition, development, and \n     operation of the area;\n       (6) the socioeconomic impacts of a designation of the area \n     as part of the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic \n     Site; and\n       (7) the level of local and general public support for \n     designating the area as part of the Abraham Lincoln \n     Birthplace National Historic Site.\n       (d) Resources of Area Studied.--In examining a resource of \n     the area under study, the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) the rarity and integrity of the resource;\n       (2) the threats to the resource, and\n       (3) whether similar resources are already protected in the \n     National Park System or in other Federal, State, or private \n     ownership.\n       (e) Management.--\n       (1) In general.--The study shall consider whether direct \n     National Park Service management or alternative protection by \n     other agencies or the private sector is appropriate for the \n     area under study.\n       (2) Identification of alternatives.--The study shall \n     identify which alternative or combination of alternatives \n     would be most effective and efficient in protecting \n     significant resources and providing for public enjoyment.\n       (f) Submission.--The Secretary shall submit the study to \n     the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the \n     State.\n\n     SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 313. A bill to repeal a provision of the International Air \nTransportation Competition Act of 1979 relating to air transportation \nfrom Love Field, TX; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                THE WRIGHT AMENDMENT REPEAL ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Kansas \n[Mr. Roberts] joins with me today in offering this bill to address an \ninjustice that has developed out of current law.\n  Under current law, commercial air carriers are prohibited from \nproviding service between Dallas' Love Field and points located outside \nof Texas or its four surrounding States. This effectively limits travel \ninto and out of this airport to destinations only in Texas, Louisiana, \nOklahoma, Arkansas, and New Mexico. Flights originating from any other \nState must fly into the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in order to have \naccess to the highly traveled Dallas area.\n  The original intent of the Wright amendment was to protect the then \nrelatively new Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. It is now the third busiest \nairport in the country and no longer needs to be protected from \ncompetition. The amendment distorts the free market and condones \nanticompetitive law; it also limits travel and forces passengers to pay \nartificially and unreasonably high airfare. Furthermore, it causes \nunnecessary delay and inconvenience\n\n[[Page S1310]]\n\nfor passengers, especially the disabled, elderly, and those traveling \nwith small children. Finally, Dallas is the top destination for \npassengers flying from Wichita and this restriction denies Kansas lower \nfares.\n  This restriction not based on any standards appropriate for the \nairline industry. It is not based on mileage flown, size of the city \nserviced, or noise generated by the aircraft. Instead, it is an \noutdated restriction based on political boundaries which were in place \nbefore the advent of airplanes.\n  As a law that is based on political concerns rather than practical \nrealities, this is a prime example of unwarranted and unnecessary \ngovernment regulation. It is a prime example of a lack of common sense \nand it is a prime example of why so many Americans have lost confidence \nin their Government.\n  The Wright amendment is wrong for America, and I urge my colleagues \nto join me in correcting this biased situation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 313\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF PROVISION RELATING TO LOVE FIELD, TEXAS.\n\n       Section 29 of the International Air Transportation \n     Competition Act of 1979 (94 Stat. 48) is repealed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Brownback, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 314. A bill to require that the Federal Government procure from \nthe private sector the goods and services necessary for the operations \nand management of certain Government agencies, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n          THE FREEDOM FROM GOVERNMENT COMPETITION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that is one of \nmy top priorities for this Congress. It is called the Freedom from \nGovernment Competition Act. It is I think a common sense, good \nGovernment reform bill. I am joined in the effort by Senators Hagel, \nKyl, Enzi, Brownback, and Craig.\n  This legislation has the potential to open up a $30 billion market \nfor the Nation's small and large businesses. It is designed to level \nthe playing field for thousands of businesses that span the economic \nspectrum of this country from the mundane to the high tech. It will \nalso provide a more efficient Government, one that works better and \ncosts less.\n  Government competition with the private sector is a growing problem. \nOver the last 40 years, it has been the Federal policy of saying let us \ndo those things that are commercial in the private sector, but it has \nnot worked. We have not moved toward that goal. The bureaucracy has not \nfound ways and means to procure goods and services from the private \nsector. For example, CBO has estimated that 1.4 million employees work \nin areas that are commercial in nature. We need a statutory provision \nto correct this problem.\n  In order to reach the goal of a balanced budget, we need to rely, I \nbelieve, on the private sector for many of the Federal Government's \nneeds. Various studies indicate that we can save up to $30 billion \nannually doing this. This competition, of course, not only wastes \ntaxpayers' money but it stunts job growth in the private sector, \nstifles economic growth, erodes the tax base and hurts small \nbusinesses. And it has been one of the top priorities in the three \nmeetings of the White House Conference on Small Business.\n  The bill basically codifies the 40-year-old Federal policy and that \nis to use the private sector. There are exceptions to this policy laid \nout in the bill: those functions that are inherently governmental, \nthose goods and services that are in the interest of national security, \ngoods or services that the Federal Government can provide better at a \nbetter value than the private sector, and goods and services, of \ncourse, that the private sector cannot provide.\n  This bill establishes a system where OMB can identify those functions \nto properly stay within the Federal establishment and those that can \nbetter be done by the private sector. This legislation establishes an \noffice of commercial activities within OMB to do that. No longer is the \nagency that is charged with doing the contracting the one that makes \ndecisions of whether it will be contracted or not.\n  Certainly we are all sensitive to Federal employees' concerns should \nthey be impacted. For those who are displaced, we have included \nprovisions that facilitate transition to the private sector if they \nchoose to follow that path.\n  The intention of the legislation is to get agencies to focus on their \ncore missions. This focus will ensure a better value to American \ntaxpayers. I do not wish to abolish all Government functions. But I am \nsaying that there is private sector expertise waiting to be utilized.\n  Congressman Duncan in the House has introduced a companion bill. It \nalso was introduced today.\n  The U.S. Senate is already on record as supporting this concept. Last \nyear you may recall the Senate voted 59 to 39 in favor of an amendment \nI offered on the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill that would have \nprevented unfair Government competition with the private sector. \nHowever, it was dropped from the omnibus spending package. This \ncomprehensive legislation builds on that success.\n  Also, last year the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nhearing on this bill. We received some good input and have made some \nchanges in the bill based on it. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle on this legislation. I think the \npolitical climate is right for enacting this concept.\n  Finally, it is a fairly simple bill. It says that we still believe in \nthe philosophy of having the private sector do those things that are \ncommercial in nature. This legislation lays out a system for doing \nthat, identifying those things that are inherently governmental and \nthose goods and services that can be done in the private sector. It's \nan idea this Congress really ought to consider. It would be a money \nsaver. It is philosophically right, it will help the private sector a \ngreat deal and give taxpayers a bigger bang for their buck.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following materials be printed in \nthe Record: A copy of the bill, a section-by-section analysis, a list \nof groups endorsing the bill, a letter of endorsement from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce, and a letter of endorsement from the Business \nCoalition for Fair Competition.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 314\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom From Government \n     Competition Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) private sector business concerns, which are free to \n     respond to the private or public demands of the marketplace, \n     constitute the strength of the American economic system;\n       (2) competitive private sector enterprises are the most \n     productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods and \n     services;\n       (3) government competition with the private sector of the \n     economy is detrimental to all businesses and the American \n     economic system;\n       (4) government competition with the private sector of the \n     economy is at an unacceptably high level, both in scope and \n     in dollar volume;\n       (5) when a government engages in entrepreneurial activities \n     that are beyond its core mission and compete with the private \n     sector--\n       (A) the focus and attention of the government are diverted \n     from executing the basic mission and work of that government; \n     and\n       (B) those activities constitute unfair government \n     competition with the private sector;\n       (6) current laws and policies have failed to address \n     adequately the problem of government competition with the \n     private sector of the economy;\n       (7) the level of government competition with the private \n     sector, especially with small businesses, has been a priority \n     issue of each White House Conference on Small Business;\n       (8) reliance on the private sector is consistent with the \n     goals of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 \n     (Public Law 103-62);\n       (9) reliance on the private sector is necessary and \n     desirable for proper implementation of the Federal Workforce \n     Restructuring Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-226);\n\n[[Page S1311]]\n\n       (10) it is in the public interest that the Federal \n     Government establish a consistent policy to rely on the \n     private sector of the economy to provide goods and services \n     that are necessary for or beneficial to the operation and \n     management of Federal Government agencies and to avoid \n     Federal Government competition with the private sector of the \n     economy; and\n       (11) it is in the public interest for the private sector to \n     utilize employees who are adversely affected by conversions \n     to use of private sector entities for providing goods and \n     services on behalf of the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Such functions include activities that \n     require either the exercise of discretion in applying Federal \n     Government authority or the making of value judgments in \n     making decisions for the Federal Government, including \n     judgments relating to monetary transactions and entitlements. \n     An inherently governmental function involves, among other \n     things, the interpretation and execution of the laws of the \n     United States so as to--\n       (i) bind the United States to take or not to take some \n     action by contract, policy, regulation, authorization, order, \n     or otherwise;\n       (ii) determine, protect, and advance its economic, \n     political, territorial, property, or other interests by \n     military or diplomatic action, civil or criminal judicial \n     proceedings, contract management, or otherwise;\n       (iii) significantly affect the life, liberty, or property \n     of private persons;\n       (iv) commission, appoint, direct, or control officers or \n     employees of the United States; or\n       (v) exert ultimate control over the acquisition, use, or \n     disposition of the property, real or personal, tangible or \n     intangible, of the United States, including the control or \n     disbursement of appropriated and other Federal funds.\n       (B) Functions excluded.--For the purposes of paragraph (1), \n     inherently governmental functions do not normally include--\n       (i) gathering information for or providing advice, \n     opinions, recommendations, or ideas to Federal Government \n     officials;\n       (ii) any function that is primarily ministerial or internal \n     in nature (such as building security, mail operations, \n     operation of cafeterias, laundry and housekeeping, facilities \n     operations and maintenance, warehouse operations, motor \n     vehicle fleet management and operations, or other routine \n     electrical or mechanical services); or\n       (iii) any good or service which is currently or could \n     reasonably be produced or performed, respectively, by an \n     entity in the private sector.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Freedom From Government Competition Act--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Sec. 1.

Establishes a general policy of reliance on the \n     private sector.\n       Provides that the government should rely on the private \n     sector for goods and services except under certain conditions \n     (listed below). The government may not obtain goods and \n     services from or provide goods and services to any other \n     governmental entity.\n       Provide exceptions to this general policy for--Goods or \n     services that are ``inherently governmental'' in nature as \n     defined in the bill or as determined by OMB; Goods or \n     services that must be provided by the government for reasons \n     of national security; Goods or services for which the Federal \n     government is the ``best value'' source; and Goods or \n     services for which private sector capabilities or practices \n     are not adequate to satisfy the government's requirements.\n       Sec. 4.

Requires studies and reports on implementation of \n     the Act.--Rather than creating new reporting requirements, \n     the bill amends the Government Performance and Results Act to \n     include annual reports on agency activities converted to \n     contract and those maintained in-house by the agency. Also \n     requires establishment of a schedule for converting to the \n     private sector those activities that can be performed by the \n     private sector.\n       Sec. 6. Provides definitions of terms used in the Act.--\n     Defines ``agency'' consistent with existing law; and Defines \n     ``inherently governmental'' consistent with the existing \n     Office of Federal Procurement Policy definition.

The bill precludes federal offices from starting or \n     carrying on any activity if that product or service can be \n     provided by a commercial source. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n     strongly urges you to co-sponsor this legislation.\n       A balanced federal budget is a bipartisan goal that is the \n     Chamber's top priority. Reducing government infrastructure \n     and overhead is a necessary step in reaching a balanced \n     budget, yet federal agencies and departments continue to \n     perform countless services and functions that could be \n     performed more efficiently and cost effectively by \n     competitive private sector enterprises, saving billions of \n     dollars annually. Additionally, government competition with \n     the private sector is at an unacceptably high level, both in \n     scope and in dollar volume.\n       The Freedom from Government Competition Act establishes a \n     consistent government policy that relies upon the private \n     sector to provide goods and services necessary for the \n     operation and management of federal agencies and departments. \n     This policy will serve as an important tool to ensure the \n     reduction of unnecessary infrastructure and overhead that is \n     critical to balanced budget initiatives.\n       The FFGCA provides exceptions to the bill, however, for \n     goods or services that are inherently governmental, necessary \n     for national security, or are so unique or of such a nature \n     that they must be performed by the government. The bill \n     requires equal cost comparison of public and private \n     functions and exempts goods and services performed by the \n     government if the production or manufacture by a government \n     source represents the best overall value.\n       The U.S. Chamber believes broad Congressional support for \n     legislation such as the Freedom from Government Competition \n     Act is vital to achieving a balanced budget and urges your \n     co-sponsorship of this bill as an important indication of \n     your support of small business.

Craig Thomas,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Thomas: We write to support the Freedom From \n     Government Competition Act of 1997.\n       When the delegates to the White House Conference on Small \n     Business (June 1995) made unfair competition by governments \n     and nonprofits one of their top issues they had in mind the \n     dramatic way in which the U.S. government competes unfairly \n     with small businesses.\n       Of 434 issues, the following recommendation by 1,800 \n     elected and appointed delegates was one of their top fifteen:\n       Government and Nonprofit Competition.-- Support fair \n     competition: Congress should enact legislation that would \n     prohibit agencies, tax-exempt and antitrust-exempt \n     organizations from engaging in commercial activities in \n     direct competition with small businesses. (Foundation for a \n     New Century: A Report to the President and Congress, by the \n     White House Conference on Small Business, September 1995.)\n       This recommendation originated at the state level where \n     delegates complained that a major competitor for many small \n     businesses is the Federal government.\n\n\n                freedom from government competition act\n\n       Currently, hundreds of thousands of Federal employees are \n     producing billions of dollars worth of products and services.\n       This bill establishes as new national policy full and \n     uncompromised reliance on the private sector for goods and \n     services.\n       This historic and precedent-setting legislation would for \n     the first time eliminate government competition as a matter \n     of national policy.\n       The Business Coalition for Fair Competition, a coalition of \n     national associations, supports the Freedom From Government \n     Competition Act which states that government may conduct only \n     operations that are so ``inherently governmental'' that the \n     public interest requires production or performance by a \n     Government employee. For example, the definition of \n     ``inherently'' would only apply to such narrowly defined \n     areas as specific parts of law enforcement and armed forces \n     missions. The bill allows the government to do the work if \n     ``there is no private source capable of providing the good or \n     service.'' In the case of commercial activities, private \n     industry can do almost everything any government needs done.\n\n\n                       executive branch proposals\n\n       In 1993, Vice President Gore stated: ``Every federal agency \n     needs support services--accounting, property management, \n     payroll processing, legal advice, and so on. Currently, most \n     managers have little choice about where to get them; they \n     must use what's available in house. But no manager should be \n     confined to an agency monopoly.''\n       The Administration then created new authorities and \n     opportunities for the Executive Branch to do commercial work \n     by issuing a ``Revised Supplemental Handbook on Performance \n     of Commercial Activities, Circular No. A-76.'' We warned the \n     Administration December 15, 1995 that their revisions would \n     not meet with support from the delegates to the White House \n     Conference on Small Business.\n       The OMB revisions do not provide any encouragement to small \n     businesses. For example, the revisions:\n       1. Allow any work that can be done by ten or fewer Federal \n     employees to be kept in-house.\n       2. Encourage agencies to keep ``core'' teams intact so the \n     agency always has the capability of doing bigger things when \n     more funding is available.\n       3. Discourage any small business from proposing to do a \n     government job.\n       4. Discourage agencies from giving serious consideration to \n     any proposal from a small business.\n       5. Allow government agencies to spend up to 10 percent more \n     than the private sector for the same work.\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\n       6. Encourage government agencies to do more contracting \n     with each other.\n       Many agencies complained to OMB in December 1995 that the \n     A-76 system is awkward and cumbersome, inhibiting rather than \n     empowering.\n       In fact, the whole A-76 system is built around ``cost \n     comparisons'' which exceed the depth and length of a Ph.D \n     dissertation. The system advocated by the Executive Branch is \n     fatally flawed.\n       On the one hand the Supplemental Handbook attempts to make \n     the cost comparison system more rigorous. But, on the other \n     hand, the Supplemental Handbook implements a recommendation \n     of the National Performance Review helping agencies market \n     themselves to other agencies, thus by-passing the need to \n     rely on the private sector.\n       Supporting an amendment you offered in the 104th Congress, \n     the Senate voted 59-39 to request restrictions on the \n     unchecked proliferation of ``Interservice Support \n     Agreements.'' Despite the Senate vote, the Administration has \n     done nothing to restrain the growth of such agreements.\n       Today some Federal agencies provide business services to \n     state and local governments and to private entities. This \n     activity has neither been authorized by Congress nor is it \n     regulated by A-76.\n\n\n                     private sector reliance works\n\n       Can Federal managers be more effective outsourcing \n     contracts than supervising thousands of Federal employees \n     doing commercial work? Outsourcing works for private industry \n     where managers are doing more outsourcing than ever. DOD says \n     it works for them. NASA outsources almost the entire space \n     program using thousands of private sector contracts.\n       By getting the government out of business, as proposed by \n     the Freedom From Government Competition Act, Congress can \n     return agencies to their core functions such as establishing \n     safety rules. To achieve this change, public administrators \n     will need more training and supervision in the management of \n     outsourcing. Passage of this bill will result in a dramatic \n     and long-overdue change in the way the government operates.\n\n\n     Freedom from Government competition act: saves money and time\n\n       We need a fresh start on this problem. This bill is that \n     fresh start. Whereas DOD did many cost comparisons in the \n     1980s, they do few today. If the A-76 system has failed at \n     DOD, why does the Administration continue to impose the \n     system on the whole government? The Freedom From Government \n     Competition Act is a far better approach.\n       In comparison to the OMB's expensive 36-month cost-study \n     approach, the bill's approach is far preferable; the costs \n     and time wasted in thousands of studies need not occur. Under \n     this legislation, the Federal policy would be to rely on the \n     private sector. The government would get out of certain \n     businesses. Federal employees would manage but not perform \n     various contracts awarded to the private sector.\n       Agency employees would shift from being direct service \n     providers to managers of service contracts. Federal personnel \n     management training would shift from supervision of extensive \n     commercial activities to management of contracts. These \n     changes have already begun to work for the DOD and NASA. It \n     can work for the whole Executive Branch.\n\n\n                         department of defense\n\n       During the U.S. military operations in Bosnia, the \n     Department used private firms to provide health care, \n     payroll, accounting, data management, supply management, \n     logistics, transportation, security, maintenance and \n     modernization of weapons, and management of military bases.\n       The Washington Post reported ``The Defense Department has \n     said it can save billions of dollars by contracting out, or \n     `outsourcing' a wide range of military functions. . . . That \n     way, the Pentagon reasons, it will have more money for its \n     combat and humanitarian duties.''\n       On the other hand the Army Corps of Engineers is \n     extensively in the campground business. The Army plans a \n     hotel on Ft. Myer to complete with the 9,110 hotel rooms \n     already available from commercial companies in Arlington, \n     Virginia. And the Air Force proposes to repair the jet \n     engines of commercial airlines.\n       On the one hand, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \n     General John M. Shalikashivili told the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee: ``We must continue to push with all energy \n     acquisition reforms, commercial off-the-shelf opportunities, \n     privatization, outsourcing of non-core activities, and \n     further reductions of our infrastructure.''\n       On the other hand, a war could have come and gone by the \n     time DOD does a cost comparison. In its recommendations to \n     the Office of Management and Budget, the Department reported \n     it needs not 36 months but 48 months to conduct cost studies \n     before contracting out. Studies of this length are excessive \n     and underscore the impracticability of the Administration's \n     position.\n\n\n           the u.s. forest service: head-to-head competition\n\n       A small campground business was forced out of business by \n     the Federal government in 1996. When the U.S. Forest Service \n     began a new campground in Payson, Arizona, at the Tonto \n     National Forest, they went into business right across the \n     highway from a for-profit small campground business. Using $3 \n     million of taxpayers money, they went directly ``in your \n     face,'' despite admonishment from the Forest Service Policy \n     Manual which discourages competition with the private sector. \n     While the Business Coalition for Fair Competition and the \n     National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds (ARVC) have \n     opposed this new campground. The Forest Service plunged \n     ahead. The private campground was forced to close.\n       This is an example of why A-76 does not work: the Forest \n     Service argues that they don't have to adhere to OMB Circular \n     A-76 except in the selection of vendors. The build-or-not-\n     build decision is unaffected by the Circular. Establishing a \n     government-owned campground is a policy matter not a \n     procurement or acquisition matter, in the eye of the Federal \n     government. There is no Federal policy or regulation forcing \n     the Forest Service to study the impact of their construction \n     on small business. Nor is there any Federal rule that \n     requires the Forest Service to listen to the appeal of any \n     small businessperson who appeals or makes a counter proposal.\n\n\n           surveying and mapping: $1 billion federal business\n\n       The Federal Government spends $1 billion annually on \n     surveying and mapping in some 39 agencies, employing nearly \n     7,000 Federal workers. Less than 10% of the $1 billion of \n     Federal expenditure is contracted to the private sector for \n     these services. A private sector comprised of more than 6,000 \n     surveying and 250 mapping firms have capabilities to meet and \n     exceed those of the government agencies.\n\n\n             Military Exchanges: Taking Over Retail Markets\n\n       Members of the North American Retail Dealers Association \n     document direct competition from military exchanges in the \n     sale of consumer electronics products and other items. \n     Military exchanges are among top 10 retailers in the US \n     measured by sales volume. They compete unfairly because they \n     do not collect sales taxes, do not pay for land and are not \n     subject to federal antitrust laws.\n\n\n        Contract Services: Private Sector Offers the Best Value\n\n       Members of the Contract Services Association of America who \n     provide services of every conceivable type, from low to high \n     technologies, point to studies and analyses which show that \n     outsourcing of commercial activities will result in \n     substantially reduced costs to the government with at least \n     equal quality, but more often, improve quality of service. \n     The outsourcing of commercial activities must be seen not \n     only as a matter of logic and fairness to the private sector, \n     but also as a guarantor of the American taxpayer obtaining \n     the best value for his or her tax dollar.\n\n\n           Laundry Services: VA Bids For Private Sector Work\n\n       A laundry in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, found that the \n     Department of Veteran Affairs bid against him on a contract \n     to provide laundry services to a children's home. When he \n     questioned the VA about competing directly with the private \n     sector, he was told that VA needed to increase its revenues.\n\n\n                  Hearing Aids: Government Competition\n\n       The International Hearing Society, whose members dispense \n     the majority of hearing aids in the United States, report \n     that government competition erodes the client base of \n     taxpaying hearing aid specialists. Unfettered government \n     competition with hearing aid specialists and other taxpaying \n     small business men and women undermines the free market. IHS \n     urges swift enactment of this legislation, which will help to \n     level the competitive playing field and generate increased \n     opportunity for private sector business concerns, including \n     hearing aid specialists.\n\n\n          Executive Order Inspiring the Entrepreneurial Drive\n\n       When we investigated why so many Federal agencies are \n     increasing their competition with the private sector, it \n     became clear that Executive Orders from the White House and \n     directions from the National Performance Review are inspiring \n     Federal workers toward being more entrepreneurial. Agencies \n     are justifying their new commercial drive by referring to the \n     new Administration policy.\n       In contrast to the work of the Congress in downsizing \n     government, this new entrepreneurial spirit is a loophole \n     giving Federal employees an alternative for saving their job: \n     if their agency can win a contract for providing a service to \n     another agency or with someone in the private sector, work \n     will continue. In this way, the will of the Congress to \n     reduce government will be thwarted.\n       In a meeting with the White House, we were told the \n     Administration urges agencies such as all the Federal labs to \n     (1) save themselves despite Congressional budget reductions \n     (2) seek business from agencies and the private sector and \n     (3) do as much work as possible in-house (vs. outsourcing).\n       The Administration's position drives us to conclude that \n     only the Freedom From Government Competition Act will work.\n\n\n                 Defense Reliance on the Private Sector\n\n       Thanks to the 104th Congress and an initiative by \n     Congressman John Duncan of Tennessee the Defense \n     Authorization bill called on the Defense Department to \n     promptly provide information on the government's commercial \n     activities: a solid step in the right\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\n     direction. Section 357 of Public Law 104-106 stated: ``The \n     Secretary shall identify activities of the Department . . . \n     that are carried out by employees of the Department to \n     provide commercial-type products or services for the \n     Department. . . .''\n       The passage of this measure caused the Department of \n     Defense to issue a report titled ``Improving the Combat Edge \n     Through Outsourcing'' (March 1996) which shows that leaders \n     in DOD want the extensive savings they can achieve through \n     outsourcing.\n\n\n                        Privatization Task Force\n\n       Narrowed from a list of a dozen recommendations submitted \n     by President Clinton, the 104th Congress passed legislation \n     to privatize the U.S. Enrichment Corporation, the Naval \n     Petroleum Reserve, the Alaska Power Marketing Administration \n     and the National Helium Reserve. The sale of these Federal \n     assets will (1) generate to the US Treasury several billion \n     dollars and (2) save annual costs of staffing, maintenance \n     and operations.\n       Congress has also authorized the outsourcing of forecasting \n     functions of the National Weather Service, commercial real \n     estate brokerage at the General Services Administration, debt \n     collection at the Internal Revenue Service, and experimental \n     privatization of several airports.\n\n\n     Defense Sciences Board and the Heritage Foundation Recommend \n                   Contracting OUt and Privatization\n\n       At the beginning of the 104th Congress, the Heritage \n     Foundation issued two reports: Showing that Congress could \n     cut Federal spending by $9 billion per year by contracting \n     out routine support services to the private sector. Showing \n     that Congress could save $11 billion in a single year by \n     privatizing nine Federal activities and by eliminating \n     various barriers to privatization established by Congress.\n       In late 1996, the Defense Science Board Task Force released \n     its report ``Outsourcing and Privatization'' to the Office of \n     the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and \n     Technology.\n       The Task Force included military, private sector and \n     academic participants and was chaired by Philip A. Odeen, \n     President and CEO, BDM International, Inc.\n       The Task Force predicts that the Department of Defense can \n     save 30-40% of costs ``by outsourcing services for their own \n     use. Local commanders that achieve an aggressive DoD \n     outsourcing initiative could generate annual savings of $7 to \n     $12 billion by FY 02. . . . Local commanders that achieve \n     outsourcing objectives should be rewarded with promotions and \n     desirable assignments.''\n       The report concludes by stating ``DoD is left with only one \n     practical alternative to meet its future modernization \n     requirements: sharply reduce DoD support costs, and apply the \n     savings to the procurement account. The Task Force firmly \n     believes that extensive savings can be achieved--if DoD is \n     willing to abandon its traditional reliance on in-house \n     support organizations in favor of a new support paradigm that \n     capitalizes upon the efficiency and creativity of the private \n     sector.''\n       The report estimates ``the number of DoD personnel actually \n     engaged in commercial-type activities greatly exceeds the \n     640,000 total . . . contractors could perform most of the \n     work currently executed by these civilian employees.''\n       The Task Force was opposed to the current system of \n     reliance on OMB Circular A-76. ``A-76 public/private \n     competitions are extremely time-consuming, biased in favor of \n     the government entity, and concentrated in narrow, labor-\n     intensive support functions involving relatively small \n     numbers of government employees.''\n       The Task Force said A-76 competitions ``fail to fully \n     consider other important factors such as the bidder's \n     capability to improve the quality and responsiveness of \n     service delivery. . . . By outsourcing broad business areas, \n     DoD can provide vendors with greater opportunity to \n     reengineer processes--and greater potential to achieve major \n     improvements in service quality and cost.''\n       Despite its shortcomings, the A-76 system has saved DoD \n     $1.5 billion per year. ``A more aggressive DoD initiative \n     will yield proportionally greater benefits,'' the report \n     states.\n       The Task Force summarized data from private enterprise \n     indicating that companies save 10-15 percent when outsourcing \n     $100 billion worth of functions. Ninety percent of company \n     executives report that outsourcing is successful, according \n     the Outsourcing Institute's ``Purchasing Dynamics, \n     Expectations, and Outcomes, 1995.''\n\n\ngeneral accounting office supported congressional action as long ago as \n                                  1981\n\n       ``Although it has been the executive branch's general \n     policy since 1955 to rely on contractors for these commercial \n     goods and services, agency compliance with this policy has \n     been inconsistent and relatively ineffective,'' the GAO \n     reported to Congress June 19, 1981.\n       Little has changed. Agency compliance with this policy \n     continues to be lax. Much of what GAO wrote about this \n     subject in the last two decades still applies.\n       Here is what GAO said in 1981: ``Circular A-76 provides \n     that it is the executive branch's general policy to rely on \n     the private sector for goods and services unless it is more \n     economical to provide them in-house. Federal purchases of \n     goods and services from the private sector cost about $117 \n     billion in fiscal year 1980. Although this policy to rely on \n     the private sector has existed for over 25 years, OMB \n     information shows that as many as 400,000 Federal employees \n     are currently operating more than 11,000 commercial or \n     industrial activities at almost $19 billion annually. These \n     employees represent almost one-fourth of the total executive \n     branch civilian work force.''\n       In 1981, GAO advised Congress as follows: ``We believe the \n     Congress should act on our earlier recommendation to \n     legislate a national policy of reliance on the private sector \n     for goods and services.''\n       GAO's advice in 1981 is still appropriate today. Therefore, \n     the only recourse is for adoption by Congress of a new \n     national policy of reliance on the private sector as proposed \n     by the Freedom From Government Competition Act.\n                                                    Kenton Pattie,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              Business Coalition for Fair Competition 1997\n\n     ACIL (Formerly the American Council of Independent \n         Laboratories)\n     American Bus Association\n     American Society of Travel Agents\n     Colorado Coalition for Fair Competition\n     Helicopter Association International\n     IHRSA (The International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub \n         Association)\n     International Association of Environmental Testing \n         Laboratories\n     International Hearing Society\n     Management Association for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors\n     National Association of RV Parks and Campgrounds\n     National Association of Women Business Owners\n     National Burglar and Fire Alarm Association\n     National Child Care Association\n     National Community Pharmacists Association\n     National Tour Association\n     Professional Services Council\n     Small Business Legislative Council\n     Society of Travel Agents in Government\n     Textile Rental Services Association\n     United Motorcoach Association\n       By Mr. HARKIN:\n\n  S. 315. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \ntax benefits for foreign corporations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE CORPORATE WELFARE REDUCTION ACT\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, there's a story that's told about \nthe film actor and comedian W.C. Fields. He was hardly religious, but \non his deathbed a friend discovered him reading the Bible. So he asked \nFields what we he was doing--and the actor responded with \ncharacteristic dry wit, ``I'm looking for loopholes.''\n  For too long, many multinational firms and foreign corporations \noperating in this country have done the same thing with the United \nStates Tax Code. They have searched our tax laws for loopholes--and \ncarved out special-interest breaks to avoid paying their fair share. \nAnd they've done it with great success. Today, for example, over \nseventy percent of foreign-based corporations in the United States pay \nno Federal income tax. Meanwhile working families who play by the rules \nstruggle just to make ends meet. This is simply wrong and as a matter \nof basic fairness, it must end.\n  So today, Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Corporate Welfare \nReduction Act of 1997 which will save taxpayers over $20 billion over \nthe next 6 years. Companion legislation has been introduced in the \nother body by my friend and colleague Representative Lane Evans. Now is \nthe time to act on this measure.\n  In the coming days, we will take up a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the Government's budget. I will vote for it. I believe we must \nget our financial house in order if we are to pass on to future \ngenerations a legacy of hope, and not a legacy of debt.\n  But if we are going to balance our Government's budget--and keep it \nbalanced in the years to come--every taxpayer will have to do their \npart. There's no doubt that working families and small businesses on \nMain Street already are contributing significantly. But foreign-based \nand multinational corporations simply have not paid their fair share.\n  One of the central goals of Government policy--particularly tax \npolicy--ought to be promoting investment in our people and in our \nbusinesses here at home. For too long, though, our tax policies have \nhad it backwards--rewarding U.S. companies that move overseas and \ngranting unfair tax giveaways to foreign subsidiaries in this country.\n  American businesses shouldn't be forced to compete against foreign \nsubsidiaries here that don't pay their fair\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\nshare of taxes. And American workers shouldn't be left out in the cold \nbecause our tax laws encouraged companies to ship jobs away and ship \nproducts back.\n  That is why I am introducing the Corporate Welfare Reduction Act. \nThis legislation contains six main provisions.\n  First, it ends the use of transfer pricing rules by multinational \ncorporations to lower their U.S. tax liability. Multinational companies \noften sell a product to their subsidiaries at a discounted price--\neffectively increasing a company's income while decreasing its U.S. tax \nliability. This bill would restrict a company's interagency pricing \npolicies and, instead, tax the sale of products at their fair market \nvalue.\n  Second, the bill disallows the practice of ``sourcing'' income from \nthe sale of inventory property. In many cases, multinational \ncorporations pass the title of sale to a foreign-owned subsidiary in \norder to avoid paying U.S. taxes even though the sale is completed in \nthe United States.\n  Third, it limits the excessive use of tax credits taken by \nmultinational corporations on foreign oil and gas extraction income \n[FOGEI] and foreign oil related income [FORI]. U.S. tax credits should \nonly be applied against foreign taxes, not the fees and royalties \nassessed by foreign nations.\n  Fourth, it narrows section 911 of the tax code that exempts the first \n$70,000 of earned income from U.S. taxes for American citizens living \nand working abroad. However, this bill would allow those persons who \nwork for non-profit organizations to still claim this exemption and \nwould allow all U.S. citizens working abroad to deduct their children's \neducation expenses up through high school.\n  Fifth, it ends the tax-exempt status of foreign investors who buy \nprivate-issued debt by requiring these persons to pay a 30-percent \nwithholding tax on the interest they earned on the bonds.\n  Finally, this legislation would end the exemption of foreign \nindividuals from capital gains taxes on the sale of stock in a U.S. \ncorporation--unless they spend more than half the year in the United \nStates.\n  The revenue raised in this legislation from closing these loopholes \nwill go solely to deficit reduction. As I said, in a time when we are \ntrying to reach a balanced budget, everyone must pay their fair share.\n  Mr. President, this is a common sense bill that will provide some \nfairness to working families and integrity to our Tax Code. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this common sense measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \n        Bennett):\n  S. 317. A bill to reauthorize and amend the National Geologic Mapping \nAct of 1992; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the national geologic mapping reauthorization act of 1997\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing on behalf of \nmyself and my cosponsors Senators Bryan, Cochran, and Bennett, a bill \nto reauthorize the highly successful National Geologic Mapping Act of \n1992. The act established a cooperative geologic mapping program among \nthe U.S. Geological Survey, State geological surveys, and geological \nprograms at institutions of higher education in the United States. The \ngoal of this program is to accelerate and improve the efficiency of \ndetailed geologic mapping of critical areas in the Nation by \ncoordinating and using the combined talents of the three participating \ngroups.\n  Detailed geologic mapping is an indispensable source of information \nfor a broad range of societal activities and benefits, including the \ndelineation and protection of sources of safe drinking water; \nassessments of coal, petroleum, natural gas, construction materials, \nmetals, and other natural resources; understanding the physical and \nbiological interactions that define ecosystems, and that control, and \nare a measure of environmental health; identification and mitigation of \nnatural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, \nsubsidence, and other ground failures; and many other resource and \nland-use planning requirements.\n  Only about 20 percent of the Nation is mapped at a scale adequate to \nmeet these critical needs. Additional high-priority areas for detailed \ngeologic mapping have been identified at State level by State-map \nadvisory committees, and include Federal, State, and local needs and \npriorities.\n  Funding for the program has been incorporated in the budget of the \nU.S. Geological Survey. State geological surveys and university \nparticipants receive funding from the program through a competitive \nproposal process that requires 1:1 matching funds from the applicant.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me to ensure the continued \nefficient collection and availability of this fundamental earth-science \ninformation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 318. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to require automatic \ncancellation and notice of cancellation rights with respect to private \nmortgage insurance which is required by a creditor as a condition for \nentering into a residential mortgage transaction, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 the homeowners' protection act of 1997\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that seeks \nto protect our Nation's homeowners, particularly low-income and first-\ntime home buyers, from having to pay for unnecessary and costly private \nmortgage insurance. Thousands of hard working Americans who strive \nevery day to afford a house of their own are unfairly paying for \nprivate mortgage insurance which is not required and is no longer \nnecessary. We must not have current and future homeowners paying up to \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year for insurance that serves no \nuseful purpose. This is a practice which must be stopped. Today, it is \nunethical. Tomorrow, after this bill becomes law, it will be illegal. \nThis legislation is intended to stop this injustice, while still \nproviding lenders with fair protection against default.\n  In 1995, almost 6 million Americans bought homes. Approximately 2 \nmillion of those homeowners also purchased private mortgage insurance. \nToday, over 40 percent of new homeowners purchase private mortgage \ninsurance. Thousands of American homeowners--perhaps as many as 20 \npercent of homeowners who have private mortgage insurance--are \noverinsuring their homes simply because they are not informed of \nwhether they have the right to cancel private mortgage insurance.\n  Many homeowners are being forced to make payments for private \nmortgage insurance even after they have accumulated substantial equity \nin their homes; they continue to pay for private mortgage insurance \nlong after the loan-to-value ratio is sufficient to protect lenders \nagainst default. Private mortgage insurance rates average between $20 \nand $100 per month, depending on the home purchase price, the amount of \ndownpayment and other factors. These consumers are unknowingly paying \nfrom $240 a year to $1,200 a year for absolutely no reason--no \npotential benefit can accrue to the homeowner who is unnecessarily \npaying for this insurance. When the legitimate need for private \nmortgage insurance ends, the payments should stop immediately.\n  My legislation, the Homeowners' Protection Act, would ensure that \nthis unfair practice is discontinued by giving future homeowners the \nright to cancel private mortgage insurance when it is no longer needed \nto protect the homeowner--in most cases, when they accumulate equity \nequal to 20 percent of their original loan value. With respect to \nexisting mortgages, the Homeowners' Protection Act would mandate \ndisclosure of cancellation rights to the homeowner on an annual basis. \nThis important legislation potentially could save current and future \nhomeowners millions of dollars.\n  Now let me make one thing clear--private mortgage insurance does \nserve a purpose. Typically, lenders require home buyers to purchase \nprivate mortgage insurance if the borrower makes a downpayment of less \nthan 20 percent of the purchase price. The purpose of the insurance is \nto provide lenders, and subsequent purchasers of the mortgage, with \nprotection in the event of default on the mortgage. It is in the best \ninterest of all Americans that lenders have fair protection against \ndefault, so as to\n\n[[Page S1316]]\n\nensure their continued safety and soundness. Together, we can encourage \nthe pursuit of the American dream of home ownership without allowing \nthe fleecing of homeowners in the process.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me in support in this \nlegislation which will help to make sure that money for unnecessary \ninsurance premiums stays where it belongs--in homeowners' pockets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 318\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the national cemetery established at the \nformer site of the Joliet Arsenal, IL, as the ``Abraham Lincoln \nNational Cemetery''; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n               the abraham lincoln national cemetery act\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 188th \nanniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, our Nation's 16th and 1st \nRepublican President, to introduce the Abraham Lincoln National \nCemetery bill. Congressman Jerry Weller, in whose district the newest \nnational veterans cemetery is located, will introduce an identical bill \nin the House of Representatives today.\n  The National Cemetery System was established by President Lincoln in \n1862 to provide for the proper burial and registration of graves of \nsoldiers who died in the Civil War. Since its inception, the National \nCemetery System has grown to include 130 military burial grounds and \nprovides places of private meditation and reflection for all who visit \nits hallowed grounds. None of these cemeteries, however, including the \nsix in Illinois, are named after President Lincoln.\n  As you know, President Lincoln had great affection for ``him who \n[had] borne the battle''. Perhaps Lincoln's admiration for our Nation's \nveterans is rooted in the fact that Lincoln--a man of peace--had his \nPresidency marked by the scourge of war. He knew all too well the \nsacrifices and hardships that the defenders of our Nation's freedom had \nto bear and the ``cause for which they [may be called to give their] \nlast full measure of devotion.'' President Lincoln demonstrated his \ndeep affection for our Nation's veterans in many ways. During the Civil \nWar, he often visited the sick and wounded stationed in and around \nWashington, DC. His administration created what is now the Department \nof Veterans Affairs and the VA hospital system. Perhaps the greatest \ndemonstration of his love for our Nation's veterans was his strong \nleadership and unwavering support for the creation of the National \nCemetery System, which not only provides dignified final resting places \nfor our Nation's soldiers but also ensures that\n\n[[Page S1317]]\n\nneither the Nation nor its citizens will forget those who served in our \nArmed Forces.\n  Last year, Congress approved of the transfer of 982 acres of the \nformer Joliet Army Ammunition Plant from the Department of the Army to \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs for the development of a new \nnational veterans cemetery. The President's budget included $19.9 \nmillion for the construction of the first phase of the cemetery, which \nis scheduled to open in late 1998 or early 1999.\n  Mr. President, this legislation to name our Nation's newest national \ncemetery after President Lincoln deserves strong bipartisan support. By \nnaming the new veterans national cemetery in honor of President \nLincoln, we not only acknowledge the pivotal role he played in the \ndevelopment of one of our national treasures--the national veterans \ncemetery system--we also honor the memory of the millions of courageous \nmen and women who served in war and peacetime to preserve our Nation's \ndemocracy, freedom, and national values. Men and women, who like my \ngrandfather, father, and uncle, who fought in World War I and World War \nII, notwithstanding the fact that the full promise of America was \ndenied them because of the color of their skin. Their patriotism grew \nout of an abiding respect for American values, and out of the hope for \nour country. We can do no less in peacetime than to honor not only \ntheir sacrifice, but the reasons for it. Naming a national cemetery \nafter President Lincoln is in recognition that that faith and hope \nabide with us still.\n  Illinois is now--and will always be the Land of Lincoln. His legacy \nis a living testament to the values--honesty, hard work and \nperseverance in the face of adversity--that characterize residents of \nAmerica's heartland. No place has a greater claim to the Lincoln \nheritage than his beloved Springfield, IL, but his memory and what he \nstood for belong to all of us in the Land of Lincoln and across these \nUnited States. As Secretary of War Edward M. Stanton prophetically put \nit while keeping vigil at Lincoln's deathbed, ``Now he belongs to the \nages.''\n  As such, I can think of no more fitting gift or more appropriate way \nto celebrate the birthday of our Nation's greatest President, than to \nsupport and pass this legislation to name our newest and second-largest \nnational veterans cemetery, in the State he so dearly loved, after him. \nIn Lincoln's immortal words, ``it is altogether fitting and proper that \nwe do this.''\n  His guidance that a house divided cannot stand is as valid today as \nit was when given. We leave partisan differences aside when we are \ncalled upon to respond to today's challenges as Americans. This \nlegislation is a bipartisan effort to bring all of us together in honor \nof one of the greatest Americans ever to have lived. As we honor him, \nand his leadership, we honor the true legacy of his service to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 319\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL CEMETERY.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The national cemetery established at the \n     former site of the Joliet Arsenal, Illinois, shall be known \n     and designated as the ``Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     paper, or other record of the United States to the national \n     cemetery referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Abraham Lincoln National Cemetery''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Ashcroft (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Allard, Mr. Bond, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Burns, Mr. Campbell, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Frist, \n        Mr. Gramm, Mr. Hutchinson, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, \n        Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Thomas):\n\n  S.J. Res. 16. A joint resolution proposing a constitutional amendment \nto limit congressional terms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  TERM LIMITS CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the document that emerged from the \nPhiladelphia convention has become the longest lived national \nconstitution in the world. It was the product of a sense of urgency, of \nmission, of common purpose. And years from now, after we have long \nsince passed, it will endure, standing unchallenged by the varied \ncrises of human affairs.\n  The Philadelphia delegates crafted this document on what they \nbelieved to be fundamental principles: Majority rule, dual sovereignty, \none man, one vote. The Framers also recognized, however, that a lasting \ngovernment would have to be not only durable and stable, but flexible \nenough to evolve with the emerging Nation. For this reason, they \nincluded an article for amendment that would allow the document to be \nchanged over time.\n  Since 1787, more than 10,600 constitutional amendments have been \nintroduced. Only 27 have been adopted. Many of the proposed amendments \nhave bordered on the ridiculous. One called for the creation of four \nregional Presidents. Others have called for the legalization of \ndueling, or changing the Nation's name to the United States of the \nWorld.\n  The amendment I introduce today, however, is neither ridiculous nor \nunimportant. In fact, I would suggest that is one of the defining \nissues which this Congress will face. For it cuts to the very heart of \nwho we are as a party, as a polity, as a people. It is a term-limits \nconstitutional amendment. If enacted, the resolution would limit \nMembers of Congress to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives \nand two terms in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, term limits are a tried and tested reform that the \nAmerican people have seen operate firsthand: For the President since \n1951, for 41 Governors, for 20 State legislatures, and for hundreds of \nlocal officials nationwide. Indeed, this is at least one reason why \ncongressional term limits enjoy such widespread support: Voters have \nwitnessed their ameliorative effects and want them extended to the \nnational legislature.\n  Some will undoubtedly argue that the 1996 election and the notable \nincrease in new Members weakens the case for term limits. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. Ninety-four percent of all the Members who \nsought reelection last year were returned to Washington. The turnover \nthat did occur was largely the result of voluntary departures, not \ncompetitive elections.\n  Why do reelection rates continue at all-time highs? Because \nincumbency is, and always has been, the single greatest perk in \npolitics. Committee assignments translate into campaign contributions. \nBills mean bucks. The simple fact remains, the average incumbent spends \nmore of the taxpayers' money on franked mail than the average \nchallenger spends on his entire campaign.\n  Reapportionment's role in ensuring long-term incumbency must also be \nconsidered. Many State officials are acutely aware of the benefits \nderived from high reelection rates. Consequently, they manipulate \ndistricts in a way which maximizes the potential for incumbents to \nreturn to Washington. This is not only an argument for limited tenure, \nit is an argument for adopting House limits of less than 10 years.\n  As with all good ideas, this reform has occasioned some controversy. \nPrimarily, opposition has come from careerists in the Congress whose \nlivelihood is at stake. These self-proclaimed keepers of the public \nfaith worry aloud about the impact of lost legislative wisdom. And, in \nthe cloakrooms and Capitol corridors, they whisper about ``protecting \nthe people from themselves.''\n  Opponents seem to believe that only seasoned legislators in a \nprofessional Congress can effectively deal with the issues of the day. \nMr. President, it is the height of arrogance and elitism to suggest \nthat any one Senator is essential to our Government. The strength of \nAmerican democracy is that the people are the source of Government's \nlegitimacy. Because, as Alexander Hamilton aptly noted more than two \ncenturies ago, ``Here, Sir, the people govern.''\n  These assertions also stand at odds with the great triumph of \nindividualism that is America. For they are based on the flawed \nsupposition that only a limited number of citizens are\n\n[[Page S1318]]\n\nqualified to serve. Richard Henry Lee put it best. ``I would not urge \nthe principle of rotation,'' said Lee, ``if I believed the consequence \nwould be a uniformed Federal legislature; but I have no apprehension of \nthis in this enlightened country.'' Indeed, no more than a cursory look \nat the writings of Adams, Jefferson, Mason, and Paine reveals the \nhealthy respect they had for the average citizen.\n  Mr. President, I share the Founders' belief that there is wisdom in \nthe people. The resolution I bring before the body today is a \ncommonsense reform that the citizenry undeniably wants, a remedy our \nRepublic desperately needs, a reform whose time has come.\n  Rotation in office has worked for the President, scores of Governors, \nand countless others across this great land. Let us extend its \ntherapeutic effects to the Halls of the U.S. Congress. I beg this \nproposal's adoption.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a constitutional \namendment to limit congressional service to 6 years in the House and 12 \nyears in the Senate. This proposal is identical to the one introduced \nin the 104th Congress. On May 22, 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court \ninvalidated the term limits that 23 different States had imposed on \ncongressional service. The Court further declared that Congress lacks \nthe constitutional authority to enact term limits by statute. \nTherefore, enacting this reform, which polls consistently show that \nmore than 70 percent of the American people support, will require \npassing a constitutional amendment.\n  Although this proposal is not about denigrating the institution of \nCongress or those who have ably served lengthy tenures, public \nconfidence in elected officials does remain abysmally low. Given the \nmany scandals involving public officials, the myriad of negative \ncampaign commercials, and the inability of Congress to solve major \nnational problems like the budget deficit, I can hardly blame the \nAmerican people for being cynical. Nothing could be farther from the \nbasic tenets of democracy than a professional ruling class, yet despite \nthe supposedly high turnover in the last three congressional elections, \nthat is essentially what Congress has become.\n  Each of the last three Congresses has had unusually large freshman \nclasses, but the percentage of those returned to Congress still exceeds \nthe typical return rate prior to 1941. I acknowledge that altering the \nway we elect Members of Congress is a task not to be undertaken \nlightly, and people are justified in asking, what has changed since the \nratification of the Constitution that necessitates this proposal? To \nthem, I answer simply: The trend toward careerism in Congress. Although \nthe system has worked relatively well for 200 years, the Founding \nFathers viewed service in Congress not as a permanent career but as an \ninterruption to a career. For the first 150 years of the Republic, in \nkeeping with this notion, those who served in public office typically \nstepped down after only a few years. While incumbents were still almost \nalways re-elected when they chose to run, a turnover rate of 50 percent \nevery 2 years in the House was common throughout the 19th century. In \nfact, only 24 percent of the Members of the House in 1841 were sworn in \nagain 2 years later. George Washington voluntarily stepped down after \ntwo terms as President because he understood the value of returning to \nprivate life and giving someone else the chance to serve. Over the last \nfew decades, however, Members of Congress have become much less likely \nto step down voluntarily, so the average length of service in Congress \nhas steadily increased. Because of this trend toward careerism, \nCongress now more closely resembles a professional ruling class than \nthe citizen legislature our Founding Fathers envisioned.\n  This is significant because a Congress full of career legislators \nbehaves differently than a citizen legislature. Over time, after years \nof inside-the-beltway thinking, elected officials tend to lose touch \nwith the long-term best interests of the Nation. Instead, they become \nslaves to short-term public opinion in their never-ending quest for re-\nelection. Last year's Medicare debate is a good example of how constant \nelections, and the lure of short-term political advantage, make it \nharder to make the tough decisions. The constant flow of pork-barrel \nprojects back home, the practice of effectively buying our \nconstituents' votes with funds from the U.S. Treasury, is another \nexample of how what may be beneficial to politicians at the next \nelection is not necessarily in the best interests of the Nation. When \nCongress is not a career for its Members, their career will not be on \nthe line every time they cast a vote, so I believe that term limits \nwould more likely produce individuals who would take on the tough \nchallenges that lie ahead.\n  To act in the long-term national interest, elected officials also \nneed to live under the laws they pass, which is why we enacted the \nCongressional Accountability Act in the last Congress. Similarly, it is \nimportant that elected officials return home after their term expires \nand live with the consequences of the decisions they made while in \nCongress. Just as the Congressional Accountability Act makes elected \nofficials more cognizant of how laws affect average Americans in the \nlong run, term limits, by requiring Members of Congress to return to \nprivate life, would encourage Members to consider the long-term effects \nof their decisions instead of just the short-term political \nconsequences.\n  Moreover, little doubt exists that power exercises a gradual, \ncorruptive influence over those who have it. The Founding Fathers \nrecognized this and used a system of checks and balances to limit the \npower of any one individual. When elected officials are up here for \ndecades at a time, their accumulating power and growing disregard for \nthe national interest often cause them to become arrogant in office. \nTerm limits, by further dispersing power among more individuals, I \nbelieve, would lead to a more honest breed of politicians.\n  Term limits will also make elections more competitive which will, in \nturn, lead to better representation. One only needs to look at the 1996 \nelections to see that most competitive elections are for open seats. \nTwelve-year limits on Senate service would guarantee every State an \nopen-seat election at least once every 12 years unless a challenger \ndislodges an incumbent. Furthermore, term-limited officeholders will be \nmore likely to seek a higher office. A Member of the House who is term \nlimited will be more likely to run for the Senate than a Congressman \nwho is not term limited and can easily win re-election to the House for \nmany years to come. A term-limited Senator will be more likely to run \nfor Governor or another office instead of seeking easy re-election to \nthe Senate.\n  Opponents of term limits make many arguments against the proposal, \nconfident that they know better than more than 70 percent of the \nAmerican people. Perhaps the most prevalent argument against term \nlimits is that Congress will lose many good people. While this is true, \nas I have already pointed out, we will be gaining many good people as \nwell. More to the point though, we should not be so arrogant as to \nthink that we are the only ones who can do this job. I do not believe \nthat the 535 people who currently serve in Congress are the only 535 \npeople out there who can do the job. Two hundred years ago, people \nwondered how the Nation could ever survive without the leadership of \nGeorge Washington, but President Washington knew that the system was \nstronger than any one man, and that many people were fit to be \nPresident. Not only do I think that many people besides us can do the \njob, but the argument that only the 535 currently serving in Congress \npossess the ability to solve the Nation's problems assumes that we are \ndoing a good job now. A $5 trillion debt, Medicare and Social Security \non unsustainable courses, an out-of-control campaign finance system, \nand unacceptably high levels of crime make this assumption dubious. A \ncorollary of this argument is that term limits will result in Congress \nhaving little institutional memory. However, if the legislative process \nand the bills that come out of this place are so complicated as to \nrequire more than 12 years of experience to understand, then Congress \nis doing too much. The average citizen, with the additional focus of \nfull-time attention to the issues with which Congress concerns itself, \nshould be more than capable of doing the job.\n  The other main argument against term limits is that we already have\n\n[[Page S1319]]\n\nterm limits in the form of elections. However, this reasoning has two \nproblems. First, incumbents enjoy a tremendous advantage in elections. \nThe ability to raise money, greater name recognition, a staff already \nin place, constituent service, and simple voter inertia help incumbents \nwin their races more than 90 percent of the time. Second, the American \npeople, just as they have a right to elect their representatives in \nCongress, have every right to place qualifications on whom they may \nelect. Opponents of term limits say that the voters ought to be able to \nelect whomever they want, but when the American people ratified the \nConstitution, they agreed not to elect anyone to the Senate who is \nyounger than 30 years of age or not a resident of the State he or she \nseeks to represent. If the voters choose, and more than 70 percent of \nthem do, they can also declare that people who have already served 12 \nyears in the Senate may not be elected to the Senate again.\n  It is my hope that we will move quickly to debate this measure. \nPerhaps no other proposal as popular with the American people has \nreceived so little attention from Congress. In fact, Congress has been \nso reticent with respect to this issue that some term-limits advocates \nare now asking the States to call a constitutional convention. The \ndebate in the last Congress was the first serious discussion of this \nissue in Congress in the history of the Nation. Speaker Gingrich has \nalready said that term limits will be the first item of business this \nyear in the other body. Finally, other tough decisions are imminent \nincluding balancing the budget, saving Medicare, and putting Social \nSecurity on a permanently sustainable course. The single most important \nthing we can do to cultivate an environment where Congress can \neffectively address these long-term problems is to enact term limits \nimmediately. Therefore, I urge my colleagues' support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngreat American, Father Jaroslaw Kupczak. Father Jaroslaw is a Dominican \npriest from Bilgoraj, Poland who, for the past 4 years, has been a \ndoctoral student at the John Paul II Institute in the District of \nColumbia.\n  During his tenure in the United States, Father Jaroslaw did much more \nthan study at one of the most respected institutes of higher learning. \nHe became part of the community.\n  Father Jaroslaw unselfishly dedicated his time and energy to needy \ncitizens in a number of area communities. Every 2 weeks, he celebrated \nMass at the Missionaries of Charities in Anacostia. The mission is run \nby a group of sisters who take in single, pregnant women and house them \nduring their pregnancy and after. His compassion and counsel brought \nthe spirit of God into the lives of these women in need.\n  As would be expected, Father Jaroslaw was a pillar in the Polish \ncommunity. He was a frequent celebrant, confessor, and counselor to the \nparishioners of Our Lady Queen of Poland parish in Silver Spring, MD. \nHe often celebrated Sunday Mass, as well as masses on holy days and \nPolish holidays. He even traveled as far as Norfolk, VA to celebrate \nMass and provide spiritual guidance to a Polish community that was \nwithout a parish.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has been blessed with Father Jaroslaw's \ntenure in the United States for the past 4 years. Many Catholics and \nPolish Americans have been touched by his generosity and time and his \ndevotion to area residents has been an inspiration to all of us.\n  I would further like to congratulate him on his graduation from the \nJohn Paul II Institute and on receiving his degree doctor sacrae \nthelolgiae summa cum laude. We wish him continued health and happiness \nas he returns to his assignment in Krakow, Poland, to touch the lives \nof the citizens there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1325-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1325-S1326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EUROPEAN COMMITTEE FOR THE PREVENTION OF TORTURE PUBLIC STATEMENT ON \n                                 TURKEY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently learned about a public \nstatement by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture \n[CPT], concerning the problem of torture in Turkey. The CPT is a \nrespected international organization established in\n\n[[Page S1326]]\n\n1989, which visits prisons in countries that have ratified the European \nConvention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading \nTreatment or Punishment. All countries that have ratified the \nConvention agree to permit these visits, and presumably to pay \nattention to the Committee's recommendations.\n  The CPT publishes public statements only when states party to the \nConvention refuse to follow its recommendations. The group has only \nissued public statements on two occasions in its 8 years of existence. \nBoth of these statements, the most recent of which was issued in \nDecember, discuss the ongoing problem of torture in Turkey.\n  The CPT acknowledges the serious threat of terrorism that Turkey \nfaces and the security and humanitarian crises that have resulted, \nespecially in the southeastern part of the country. The CPT also \nrecognizes that the Government of Turkey has expressed concern about \nthe use of torture and has responded by circulating memoranda and \ndesigning human rights programs for its law enforcement officials. \nHowever, the CPT concludes that in practice these measures, along with \nthe legal framework to protect detainees from torture and ill-treatment \nand to discipline those who have used torture, are inadequate and \nignored by Turkish authorities. A recent example is the decision by the \nTurkish Government to reduce to 4 days the length of time a suspect can \nbe held incommunicado, without access to a lawyer. There is ample \nevidence that torture routinely occurs immediately following arrest. \nAny period of incommunicado detention is an invitation for these kinds \nof abuses to continue.\n  The facts contained in the CPT's December public statement are very \ntroubling. In a September 1996 visit to prisons in Turkey, the CPT \nreported:\n\n       A considerable number of persons examined by the \n     delegation's three forensic doctors displayed marks or \n     conditions consistent with their allegations of recent ill-\n     treatment by the police, and in particular of beating of the \n     soles of the feet, blows to the palms of the hands and \n     suspension by the arms. The cases of seven persons . . . must \n     rank among the most flagrant examples of torture encountered \n     by CPT delegations in Turkey.\n\n  As in October 1994, the CPT again found ``material evidence of resort \nto ill-treatment, in particular, an instrument adapted in a way which \nwould facilitate the infliction of electric shocks and equipment which \ncould be used to suspend a person by the arms.''\n  Mr. President, this report shows that despite the Turkish \nGovernment's efforts in recent years, the practice of torture continues \nunabated. The latest State Department Country Reports on Human Rights, \nwhich was released on January 30, confirms this. It illustrates, once \nagain, that good intentions and training programs, while important, are \nno substitute for holding people accountable. Only when people who \nengage in this abhorrent conduct believe they will be punished, will it \nstop.\n  This should concern us all, because Turkey is a valued NATO ally with \nwhich we have many shared interests. Turkey is going through a \ndifficult period in its history, and I for one want to see our \nrelationship strengthen. I raise these concerns because I believe that \nTurkey, and relations between our two countries, would benefit greatly \nif it were clear that vigorous, effective action were being taken to \neradicate this curse.\n  I urge the administration and Members of Congress to raise the issue \nof torture at the highest levels of the Turkish Government, and to work \nwith Turkish officials to pursue aggressively the necessary measures to \nend the practice of torture and the impunity that persist in Turkey \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1325-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BERLIN MYERS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Berlin George Myers is dedicated \nto his hometown of Summerville, SC. His life has revolved around an \neight-square block area in the heart of this town also known as \nFlowertown in the Pines. In this small area, he grew up and raised his \nown children and today, continues to run his business and govern the \ntown.\n  Mayor Myers' first public office was membership on town council in \n1965. His vote returns were the highest ever achieved by a town \nofficial and as a result, he became Mayor pro tem. History repeated \nitself in the following elections and Mayor Myers is further \ndistinguished by having served on every town committee.\n  Under Councilman Myers, many civic improvements were made: a new town \nhall and a new fire station were built, an extensive paving program \nenacted, town clean-up was given a high priority and annexation began \nin earnest.\n  In June 1972, the incumbent Mayor Luke died and Berlin Myers stepped \nin to fill the remainder of his term. Four months later, he won his own \nelection and every one since with a large majority of the vote. During \nMayor Myers' tenure, Summerville's population has grown from 3,700 to \napproximately 25,000.\n  Under Mayor Myers, Summerville's Public Safety Department has \ncombined police and fire departments, telecommunications--including an \nenhanced 911 system--and municipal court in a single headquarters \nbuilding complex. He helped plan and proudly presided over the ribbon \ncutting for a perimeter road around Summerville--named the Berlin G. \nMyers Parkway by an act of the South Carolina legislature. In 1994, \nunder his direction, the 27-year-old townhall was renovated and \nexpanded. His tireless, around-the-clock leadership during 1989's \nHurricane Hugo put Summerville back in operation quickly and smoothly.\n  The order and organization for which Summerville is renowned founded \nhis business, the Berlin G. Myers Lumber Co., which in 1989 celebrated \nits 50th year. There's neither a piece of lumber nor a piece of \npaperwork out of place in this operation. He began working in his Uncle \nAllen's sawmill and small retail outlet after school and weekends when \nhe was 10 years old. After graduating from high school in 1939, he took \nover the latter. Mayor Myers is past president of the Carolinas \nTennessee Building Materials Association and has served on committees \non both the regional and national chapters.\n  In 1989, Mayor Myers was awarded the Order of the Palmetto, the \nhighest civilian accolade the State of South Carolina can bestow. He \nkeeps the same rigorous schedule he has all of his adult life, arriving \nfirst at the lumber yard every morning, holding regular townhall work \nhours, talking with school children about the town's history, and \nactively participating in Summerville Baptist Church. Mayor Berlin \nMyers is a devoted husband and is the father of four children and three \ngrandchildren.\n  In this, his 80th year, his mayoral tenure has reached a quarter of a \ncentury, the longest in Summerville's history. His postion is unpaid \nand he says that he sees politics as service to his town, ``It's a way \nto give back to my community which has given me so much.'' \nSummerville's sesquicentennial takes place this year, 1997, and you can \nbelieve that Mayor Berlin Myers will be leading the parade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1326-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1326-S1327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF CARLTON GOODLETT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life \nof Dr. Carlton Goodlett. Dr. Goodlett recently passed from this life, \nleaving it richer and more decent for his presence. The challenge of \nhis voice, conscience, and healing hand is the legacy of a singular \nman.\n  To say that Carlton Goodlett was multitalented is to understate his \ngenuinely remarkable energy and versatility. He was a medical doctor, \nheld a doctorate in psychology and published a newspaper for nearly 50 \nyears. He was local president of the NAACP and worked side by side with \nmany of the giants of the civil rights era. Born in a time and place \nwhere discrimination and violence were commonplace, he remained \npassionately concerned about peace and equality throughout his entire \nlife.\n  Although his contributions reasonate most clearly in San Francisco's \nAfrican-American neighborhoods, Dr. Goodlett's example and spirit were \nin inspiration to many young Americans, irrespective of race. When he \nacted or spoke, his message was meant for anyone with an open heart and \nmind. He embraced people with great warmth and ideas with great \nfacility. He was a leader in the truest sense.\n  At the Sun-Reporter, he nurtured numerous fledgling writers, giving \nthem\n\n[[Page S1327]]\n\nthe opportunity to develop their professional talents while \nsimultaneously providing readers with invaluable insight into a vibrant \ncommunity at play, at work, in worship, and in struggle. As a \nphysician, he helped guide young men and women into medicine. As a \ncivil rights leader and advocate for peace, he appealed to conscience \nof leaders and citizens alike.\n  Dr. Goodlett considered life and community to be sacred. Though his \ntime has come and gone, his message of hope and fairness endures. For \nall he did for others, he will forever be treasured and missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1326-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO KENT DAVIS ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE MANCHESTER, NH, \n                    VETERAN AFFAIRS REGIONAL OFFICE\n\n   Mr. BOB SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Kent \nDavis for his diligent work over the years on behalf of New Hampshire's \nveterans. My staff and I have worked with Kent on important veterans \nissues and we have always admired his hard work and dedication to his \njob. He will be sorely missed by many. As a fellow veteran, I \ncongratulate him on his service to the Manchester Veteran Affairs \nregional office.\n  Kent has been the head of the adjudication office at the Manchester \nVeteran Affairs regional office for the past 12 years, and has served \nas our congressional liaison. We have come to rely on him for \ninformation and guidance on matters of concern to New Hampshire \nveterans. He has provided outstanding service, and we were always \nconfident that Kent provided the veterans of New Hampshire every \nconsideration for benefits and services.\n  In 1989, Kent was given an award for the outstanding adjudication \ndivision, and he received numerous commendations and excellent \nevaluations.\n  Kent was always willing to go the extra mile to help a veteran. When \nany problem arose, he was quick to find a resolution or provide an \nanswer.

GRESSETTE, JR.: EXCELLENCE IN PUBLIC SERVICE\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Lawrence Gressette, Jr., is well \nknown to all of us in South Carolina and we salute him as he retires on \nFebruary 28 as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of \nSCANA Corp., in Columbia, SC.\n  Excellence is a Gressette family tradition. Lawrence Gressette \nlearned much at the knee of his father, Marion, the esteemed attorney \nand South Carolina State senator. He once told Lawrence, ``Things must \nnot only be right but should also look right.'' Lawrence Gressette has \nlong adhered to his father's sage advice. In college, he not only \nplayed football for Clemson University, he earned a football \nscholarship. He was so liked and respected by his classmates that they \nelected him student body president. At the University of South Carolina \nLaw School, he finished first in his class. Upon graduation, he joined \nin his father's practice and earned a reputation as a solid litigator.\n  It was in working alongside his father that Lawrence Gressette became \ninvolved with utility regulatory work. The powers that were at South \nCarolina Electric and Gas were so impressed with his talents that they \npersuaded him to become a senior vice president in 1983 and executive \nvice president the following year. In 1990, John Warren retired as CEO \nof SCE's parent company, SCANA, and the board of directors tapped \nLawrence to fill the top spot. Through vision and consistent \nleadership, he has guided SCANA into a successful, cohesive commercial \nforce --a goliath of energy-related and communications businesses. \nFortunately for all of us, he has shared his talents with his community \nas well. Some of his achievements include: chairman of the board of \ntrustees for Clemson University, trustee of the Educational Television \nEndowment of South Carolina, member of the steering committee of the \nSouth Carolina Governor's School of the Arts, and chairman of the \nUnited Way of the Midlands. Through it all, he has been blessed with \nthe love and support of his wife, Felicia, and their three children. \nAlthough Lawrence will be sorely missed at SCANA, I am confident that \nhe will continue in his role of excellent public service and will hand \ndown this Gressette legacy to his four grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1327-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1327-S1328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PROHIBITION OF INCENTIVES FOR RELOCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few moments to \ncomment on the Prohibition of Incentives for Relocation Act, introduced \nyesterday by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold. I strongly \nsupport and am an original cosponsor of this legislation, the passage \nof which is of great importance to workers in Wisconsin and all across \nthe country.\n  For the third consecutive Congress, we have introduced this \nlegislation to amend the Housing and Community Development Act to \nprohibit the use of Federal funds, directly or indirectly, for business \nrelocation activities that encourage States and communities to steal \njobs from one another.\n  My background is in business. I know well that in today's tough \neconomic environment, it is commonplace for businesses to relocate or \ndownsize their operations in order to maintain a competitive edge. In \nso doing, some choose to leave one location in favor of another \nlocation in a different State. However painful, mobility and \nadaptability have become important business survival tactics. But \nthere's a catch: in some instances, relocation activities have been \npartially subsidized or underwritten by Federal funds. In other words, \nwhile it appeared that Federal moneys were fueling job creation in one \ncommunity, the flip side of the coin revealed that those moneys were \nfueling job losses elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, that is just plain wrong; wrong in terms of fairness; \nwrong because it violates the spirit of the law. And it's public policy \nwithout vision: if States start fighting each other for jobs, instead \nof creating employment opportunities from the ground up, any regional \nor national economic cooperation will be lost.\n  This issue was first brought to our attention in 1994 when Briggs & \nStratton Corporation announced plans to relocate 2,000 jobs from \nMilwaukee to other locations, including two that had used Federal \ncommunity development funds to expand their operations. We introduced \nthis legislation then, and in 1995 a version of the bill was adopted as \nan amendment to an appropriations bill. Although our amendment was \ndropped in conference, the final bill did include language requesting \nthat the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] report to \nCongress on the costs and benefits of maintaining an information \ndatabase on this issue.\n  We are still waiting for HUD's report, but the need to act is no less \nsignificant today than it was in 1994. In fact, in December 1996, the \nWisconsin State Journal reported that the communications director for \nthe Michigan Jobs Commission had stated, and I quote, ``we will \naggressively pursue Wisconsin companies for relocation into Michigan.''\n  Mr. President, we were disheartened by Michigan's attitude to say the \nleast, and we contacted then-HUD Secretary Cisneros, Assistant \nSecretary Singerman at the Economic Development Administration [EDA] \nand Administrator Lader at the Small Business Administration [SBA] to \nurge all three to be vigilant when distributing Federal funds. We \nwanted to be sure that their agencies were not inadvertently \nencouraging Michigan to steal jobs from Wisconsin. I am pleased to \nreport that Assistant Secretary Singerman responded by affirming EDA's \nsensitivity to the issue and want to add that both EDA and SBA are \nalready governed by antijob piracy provisions. We are simply proposing \nthat these types of provisions govern HUD programs as well.\n\n[[Page S1328]]\n\n  Our attention to this matter is imperative. Community development for \nall Americans is best achieved by promoting new growth, rather than \npromoting job raids between hard-pressed communities. I urge my \ncolleagues to take this issue seriously by acting upon this legislation \nas soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1327-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1328-S1329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RULES FOR SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON AGING\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Chairman shall circulate polling sheets \n     to each Member specifying the matter being poled and the time \n     limit for completion of the poll. If any Member so requests \n     in advance of the meeting, the matter shall be held for \n     meeting rather than being polled. The clerk shall keep a \n     record of polls, if the Chairman determines that the polled \n     matter is one of the areas enumerated in Rule II.3, the \n     record of the poll shall be confidential. Any Member may move \n     at the Committee meeting following a poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision.\n     IV. Investigations\n       1. Authorization for Investigations.

Oath. All witnesses who testify to matters of fact shall \n     be sworn unless the Committee waives the oath. The Chairman, \n     or any member, may request and administer the oath.\n       3. Statement. Any witness desiring to make an introductory \n     statement shall file 50 copies of such statement with the \n     Chairman or clerk of the Committee 24 hours in advance of his \n     appearance, unless the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     determine that there is good cause for a witness's failure to \n     do so. A witness shall be allowed no more than ten minutes to \n     orally summarize his prepared statement.\n       4. Counsel:\n       (a) A witness's counsel shall be permitted to be present \n     during his testimony at any public or closed hearing or \n     depositions or staff interview to advise such witness of his \n     rights, provided, however, that in the case of any witness \n     who is an officer or employee of the government, or of a \n     corporation or association, the Chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness shall be represented by personal counsel not from the \n     government, corporation, or association.\n       (b) A witness is unable for economic reasons to obtain \n     counsel may inform the Committee at least 48 hours prior to \n     the witness's appearance, and it will endeavor to obtain \n     volunteer counsel for the witness. Such counsel shall be \n     subject solely to the control of the witness and not the \n     Committee. Failure to obtain counsel will not excuse the \n     witness from appearing and testifying.\n       5. Transcript. An accurate electronic or stenographic \n     record shall be kept of the testimony of all witnesses in \n     executive and public hearings. Any witness shall be afforded, \n     upon request, the right to review that portion of such \n     record, and for this purpose, a copy of a witness's testimony \n     in public or closed session shall be provided to the witness. \n     Upon inspecting his transcript, within a time limit set by \n     the committee clerk, a witness may request changes in \n     testimony to correct errors of transcription, grammatical \n     errors, and obvious errors of fact, the Chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such request.\n       6. Impugned Persons. Any person who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a Member or staff, at a public \n     hearing or at a closed hearing concerning which there have \n     been public reports, tends to impugn his character or \n     adversely affect his reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which shall be placed in the hearing \n     record;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his own behalf; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he requests be used \n     for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by the \n     Committee. The Chairman shall inform the Committee of such \n     requests for appearance or cross-examination. If the \n     Committee so decides; the requested questions, or paraphrased \n     versions or portions of them, shall be put to the other \n     witness by a Member or by staff.\n       7. Minority Witnesses. Whenever any hearing is conducted by \n     the Committee, the minority on the Committee shall be \n     entitled, upon request made by a majority of the minority \n     Members to the Chairman, to call witnesses selected by the \n     minority to testify or produce documents with respect to the \n     measure or matter under consideration during at least one day \n     of the hearing. Such request must be made before the \n     completion of the hearing or, if subpoenas are required to \n     call the minority witnesses, no later than three days before \n     the completion of the hearing.\n       8. Conduct of Witnesses, Counsel and Members of the \n     Audience. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, \n     his counsel, or any spectator conducts himself in such a \n     manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere \n     with the orderly administration of such hearing the Chairman \n     or presiding Member of the Committee present during such \n     hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, his \n     representative or any law enforcement official to eject said \n     person from the hearing room.\n     VI. Depositions and commissions\n       1. Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Committee shall be authorized \n     and issued by the Chairman or by a staff officer designated \n     by him. Such notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination, and the name of the staff officer or officers \n     who will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil \n     enforcement proceedings for a witness's failure to appear \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a \n     Committee subpoena.\n       2. Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by \n     counsel to advise them of their rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule V.4.\n       3. Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Committee staff. Objections by the witnesses as to the form \n     of questions shall be noted by the record. If a witness \n     objects to a question and refuses to testify on the basis of \n     relevance or privilege, the Committee staff may proceed with \n     the deposition, or may at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     a Member of the Committee. If the Member overrules the \n     objection, he may refer the matter to the Committee or he may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Committee shall not initiate the procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he has been ordered and directed to answer by a Member \n     of the Committee.\n       4. Filing. The Committee staff shall see that the testimony \n     is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review. No later than five days thereafter, the witness shall \n     return a signed copy, and the staff shall enter the changes, \n     if any, requested by the witness in accordance with Rule V.6. \n     If the witness fails to return a signed copy, the staff shall \n     note on the transcript the date a copy was provided and the \n     failure to return it. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record to the testimony, and the \n     transcript shall then be filed with the Committee clerk. \n     Committee staff may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure; deviations from the procedure which do not \n     substantially impair the reliability of the record shall not \n     relieve the witness from his obligation to testify \n     truthfully.\n       5. Commissions. The Committee may authorize the staff by \n     issuance of commissions, to fill in prepared subpoenas, \n     conduct field hearings, inspect locations, facilities, or \n     systems of records, or otherwise act on behalf of the \n     Committee. Commissions shall be accompanied by instructions \n     from the Committee regulating their use.\n     VII. Subcommittees\n       1. Establishment. The Committee will operate as a Committee \n     of the Whole, reserving to itself the right to establish \n     temporary subcommittees at any time by majority vote. The \n     Chairman of the full Committee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member shall be ex officio Members of all subcommittees.\n       2. Jurisdiction. Within its jurisdiction as described in \n     the Standing Rules of the Senate, each subcommittee is \n     authorized to conduct investigations, including use of \n     subpoenas, depositions, and commissions.\n       3. Rules.

Mr. President, hopefully the week we get back, we will be \nable to start a serious debate on the most important issue relating to \nthe balanced budget amendment, namely whether or not Social Security \ntrust fund moneys should be counted in the constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget.\n  There will be an amendment offered, of course, that the Social \nSecurity trust fund moneys should be excluded from that. It seems each \nday that goes by we get added support for our amendment. We have \nreceived support over the months from various individuals, and just \nyesterday we received an opinion from the Congressional Research \nService of the Library of Congress that was very important.\n  There has been some talk in the Chamber today that they have changed \ntheir opinion. Nothing could be further from the truth. And that \ncertainly can come from reading the transmission from the American Law \nDivision of the Congressional Research Service today. My friend, the \nSenator from North Dakota, will discuss this when I complete my \nremarks. But, Mr. President, all you need to do is read this new \ndocument that they put out where it says:\n\n       Only if no other receipts in any particular year could be \n     found would the possibility of a limitation on drawing down \n     the Trust Funds arise. Even in this eventuality, however, \n     Congress would retain the authority, under the [balanced \n     budget amendment] to raise revenues--\n\n  Of course, if you can get a supermajority.\n\n     or to reduce expenditures--\n\n  That's very true, you could continue to cut.\n\n     to obtain the necessary moneys to make good on the \n     liquidation of securities from the Social Security Trust \n     Funds.\n\n  Mr. President, this is certainly the same opinion that they rendered \nyesterday. The Social Security Trust Fund is the largest money out \nthere, this year, $80 billion. This is being applied toward the deficit \nto make it look smaller. And that is all they are saying, that is, in \neffect, when it comes time to balance the budget, they will look to \nSocial Security. The way the balanced budget amendment is written, if \nthere are not surpluses over and above the Social Security Trust Fund \nmoneys, people simply would not be able to draw their checks.\n  I will yield the floor----\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to make an observation and make a \npoint. The Congressional Research Service has sent a second letter. I \nwanted to make the point the Senator from Nevada made. The second \nletter says the same as the first letter on the question of whether \nsurpluses in the Social Security Trust Fund can be used in the outyears \nto be spent for Social Security needs. The answer is, in the first \nletter from CRS and in the second, the answer is no, unless there is a \ncorresponding tax increase in the same fiscal year, or corresponding \nspending cuts, equal to those surpluses. And that is the very point we \nwere making.\n  The second letter from the Congressional Research Service simply says \nthe same thing that they said earlier with slightly different wording. \nWe\n\n[[Page S1332]]\n\nwant to make that point, that this is not a change in position for them \nat all.\n  In the outyears, the way the constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget is worded, the Government would be prevented from using the \nsurpluses accrued in the Social Security Trust Fund that were saved for \nthe specific purpose of being used later when they were needed. It \nwould be prevented from using those unless in those years it also \nincreased taxes sufficient to cover them or cut spending sufficient to \ncover them. This, despite the fact that they were accrued as surpluses, \nabove other needs in the Social Security system now, in order to meet \nthe needs in the future.\n  I know this is confusing. We just wanted to leave the message that \nthe Congressional Research Service is saying the same thing. This is \nnot a change in message from them at all, and this is about a $3 \ntrillion issue. It is of great significance, and I hope Members will \ntake account of it as we consider these issues.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, also, we will discuss \nthis at great length right after the break. But it is interesting that \nwe are talking about trust fund moneys like it is some fungible \ncommodity that can be used for any purpose. The fact of the matter is, \nSocial Security Trust Fund moneys are put, supposedly, into a trust \nfund to be used for people's retirement, not to make the deficit look \nsmaller.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for 1 additional minute, that \nis exactly the point of this debate. It is not an attempt in any way to \ncreate more diversion, or any diversion, on the issue of a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget.\n  The question is, Shall the Constitution be altered? But we are \nraising the question of, if an alteration of the Constitution is made, \nhow will that affect, in the outyears, the opportunity to spend the \nsurpluses that we are accruing each year now because we need it when \nthe baby boomers retire?\n  And the answer is, according to the Congressional Research Service, \nit will have a profound and enormous effect on the Government's ability \nto do that. That is what we want our colleagues to understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senators, under the \nprevious order we were in morning business for up to 5 minutes each, \nand I must notify the Senators that time has elapsed.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take this time to briefly \nrespond to my friend from North Dakota and others. In their press \nconference that was held this morning, as I understand it--I was not \nthere, but Senators Conrad, Dorgan and Reid were--at that event a one-\npage memorandum from the Congressional Research Service, which was \ninaccurately termed a ``study,'' was characterized as proof that \npassage and ratification of the balanced budget amendment will harm \nSocial Security.\n  The problem is that the CRS memorandum did not conclude that at all. \nAll the CRS memorandum concluded was that the Social Security existing \nsurpluses after 2019--the year the program no longer produces surpluses \nbecause of the retirement of the baby boomers--cannot be used to fund \nthe program unless such expenditures were offset by revenue or budget \ncuts.\n  Of course, this is technically true. That is what a balanced budget \ndoes. It balances outlays and receipts, and expenditure of any part of \nthe budget is an outlay.\n  But these critics of the balanced budget fail to mention a few \nthings. They fail to mention that CRS, in the memorandum, also \nconcluded that the present day surpluses are ``an accounting \npractice.'' Past CRS studies clearly demonstrate that the Social \nSecurity trust funds are, indeed, an accounting measure. There is no \nseparate Federal vault where Social Security receipts are stored. \nSocial Security taxes--called FICA taxes--are simply deposited with all \nother Federal revenues. The moneys attributed to Social Security are \ntracked as bookkeeping entries so that we can determine how well the \nprogram operates. As soon as the amounts attributed to FICA taxes are \nentered on the books, Federal interest-bearing bonds are electronically \nentered as being purchased. That is the safest investment that exists \nin the world today.\n  This country has a unified budget. This means that the proceeds from \nSocial Security taxes are part of the Treasury--of general revenue. CRS \nhas recognized this.\n  Moreover, I might add, without including the present day surpluses, \nthe budget cannot be balanced. That is why President Clinton has \nincluded Social Security funds in every one of his budgets.\n  Do Senators Dorgan, Conrad, and Reid oppose that? If they do, they \nhave a right to, but the President includes them because he has to.\n  I recognize that Social Security is in danger. But the problem is not \nthe inclusion of Social Security funds in the budget. The problem is \nthat, with the retirement of the baby boomers and that generation, \nthere will not be enough FICA taxes to fund their retirement. CRS, in a \nstudy, concluded that the present day surpluses would not be sufficient \nto resolve this problem. CRS concluded that the Social Security program \nneeds to be fixed.\n  Finally, not including Social Security in the budget would harm the \nprogram. Congress could rename social programs--as they have done \nbefore--as Social Security and use the FICA taxes to fund those \nprograms to the detriment of senior citizens; that is, if we do not \nhandle this matter the way the balanced budget amendment requires us to \ndo.\n  My colleagues' problem, in reality, is not with the balanced budget \namendment but with the problems the Social Security program faces and \nwill face in the future. We need to fix that. Adopting the balanced \nbudget amendment is a good start. If we do not do that and if they take \nthese matters so they are not part of the unified budget, then I submit \nevery senior in this country is going to be hurt some time in the \nfuture because there will not be the will to get matters under control \nand spending under control.\n  We saw the charts of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia all \nafternoon, which I think make my case, and so do these 28 years of \nunbalanced budgets. The only way we are going to face up to the needs \nof Social Security and the needs of our seniors is if it is part of the \nunified budget.\n  Frankly, the CRS is right, this is an accounting process. The way to \ndo it right is to have a balanced budget amendment passed that works.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional \nResearch Service, Library of Congress, February 12, 1997, letter to the \nHonorable Pete V. Domenici, attention Jim Capretta, from the American \nLaw Division, on the subject of ``Treatment of Outlays from Social \nSecurity Surpluses under BBA,'' signed by Johnny H. Killian, Senior \nSpecialist, American Constitutional Law, be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                      The Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 1997.\n     To: Honorable Pete V. Domenici, Attention: Jim Capretta.\n     From: American Law Division.\n     Subject: Treatment of Outlays from Social Security Surpluses \n         under BBA.\n\n       This memorandum is in response to your inquiry with respect \n     to the effect on the Social Security Trust Funds of the \n     pending Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA). Under S.J. Res. 1 as \n     it is now before the Senate, Sec. 1 would mandate that \n     ``[t]otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total \n     receipts for that fiscal year. . . .'' Outlays and receipts \n     are defined in Sec. 7 as practically all inclusive, with two \n     exceptions that are irrelevant here.\n       At some point, the receipts into the Social Security Trust \n     Funds will not balance the outlays from those Funds. Under \n     present law, then, the surpluses being built up in the Funds, \n     at least as an accounting practice, will be utilized to pay \n     benefits to the extent receipts for each year do not equal \n     the outlays in that year. Simply stated, the federal \n     securities held by the Trust Funds will be drawn down to \n     cover the Social Security deficit in that year, and the \n     Treasury will have to make good on those securities with \n     whatever moneys it has available.\n       However, Sec. 1 of the pending BBA requires that total \n     outlays for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts for \n     that fiscal year. Thus, the amount drawn from the Social \n     Security Trust Funds could not be counted in the calculation \n     of the balance between total federal outlays and receipts. We \n     are not concluding that the Trust Funds surpluses could not \n     be drawn down to pay beneficiaries. The BBA would not require \n     that result. What it would\n\n[[Page S1333]]\n\n     mandate is that, inasmuch as the United States has a unified \n     budget, other receipts into the Treasury would have to be \n     counted to balance the outlays from the Trust Funds and those \n     receipts would not be otherwise available to the Government \n     for that year. Only if no other receipts in any particular \n     year could be found would the possibility of a limitation on \n     drawing down the Trust Funds arise. Even in this eventuality, \n     however, Congress would retain authority under the BBA to \n     raise revenues or to reduce expenditures to obtain the \n     necessary moneys to make good on the liquidation of \n     securities from the Social Security Trust Funds.\n\n                                            Johnny H. Killian,\n\n                                                Senior Specialist,\n                                      American Constitutional Law.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will likely have a longer debate about \nthis, and I shall not lengthen it today, but the Senator from Utah \nalways makes a strong case for his position.\n  In the circumstances this evening, he, once again, has made a strong \ncase, but on a couple of points, in my judgment, he is factually in \nerror, and I want to point that out.\n  In one respect he is not in error, he is absolutely correct. \nPresident Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton have all sent \nbudgets since 1983 to this Congress--1983 is the period in which we \nbegan to decide we were going to accumulate substantial surpluses in \nSocial Security to save for a later time when they are needed--all \nPresidents have sent budgets to this Congress that use the Social \nSecurity trust funds as part of the unified budget. I think 2 days ago \non the floor of this Senate, I pointed out the President did that in \nhis budget, and his budget that he says is in balance is not in \nbalance. I pointed that out about this President. I made the same point \nabout President Bush and President Reagan when they did it as well.\n  But, having said that, the Senator from Utah says the Social Security \ntrust funds that are derived from Social Security taxes taken from \npaychecks of workers all across this country and from the employers, is \na technical issue, and they simply go into all other funds and they are \ncommingled. This technical resolution of all these moneys means that \nthere really is not a dedicated Social Security fund, and so on and so \nforth.\n  I would be happy to go for a drive with the Senator from Utah to \nParkersburg, WV, where the Social Security trust fund securities are \nheld under armed guard. I might even be able to bring him a copy of one \nof those securities so we could show him that those securities exist. \nThey are held under armed guard. I can tell him where they are held, \nand it is not merely technical. It is much, much more important than \nthat.\n  If it is purely technical, then I say to the tens of millions of \nworkers out there, ``The next time you get your paycheck stub and you \nsee that little portion where they take some tax away from you and they \nsay, `We're doing this to put it in the Social Security account and \nit's a dedicated tax to go into a dedicated trust fund to be used for \nonly one purpose,' you deserve a tax break; you ought not be paying \nthat if it is not going to where it is indicated it is going, to a \ntrust fund to save for the future.'' If this is just like other money, \ncommingled with other funds, let's stop calling it a trust fund, let's \nstop calling it a dedicated tax and call it an income tax, and a \nregressive one because everybody pays the same amount.\n  In fact, it is the case that most Americans pay more in this payroll \ntax than they do in taxes, regrettably, but they do so because they \nbelieve it goes into a trust fund. I reject the notion somehow that \nthere is no difference between all this money. I think the trust funds \nare dedicated funds that we promised workers would be saved for their \nfuture.\n  The Congressional Research Service says nothing in the second letter \nthey did not say in the first. They say--and you can say it two ways--\nthe Government with this constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, the way it is worded, would be prevented from using the Social \nSecurity trust funds in the outyears, when we are going to use that \nsurplus because it is needed, unless a corresponding tax increase or \ncorresponding spending cut equal to those trust funds is enacted by \nCongress. That is one way of saying it.\n  The other way of saying it, which they now have in this paper, says \nthe Congress, in the outyears, can use the Social Security trust funds, \nbut only if there is a corresponding tax increase or spending cut. It \nis another way of saying exactly the same thing. Why use two pieces of \npaper when you can use one? It doesn't matter much to me. It is \nprobably a waste of paper, but it says exactly the same thing.\n  I want to make one final point. The reason I have taken issue with \nPresident Bush, President Reagan, and, yes, President Clinton on this \nissue, and taken issue with the Senator from Utah, is embodied in the \ndebt clock that the Senator brought to his hearing. I hope we will have \nthis discussion at some point soon. The Senator will I think agree that \nthe clock showing the amount of public debt that is owed in this \ncountry will not stop with the passage of this balanced budget \namendment and the passage of a budget that complies with this \namendment.\n\n  I ask the Senator from Utah, is it not true that if the Congress \npasses this constitutional amendment to balance the budget and then \npasses a budget in compliance with that, in the very year in which that \nbudget is so-called balanced, is it not true that the Federal debt will \nincrease $130 billion in that year? And if it is, and I believe the \nSenator from Utah would admit that it is, if it is true that in the \nyear in which it is represented to the American people that the budget \nis balanced, then why does the Federal debt rise by another $130 \nbillion? Somehow that doesn't pass any standard of common sense in my \nhometown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. It is interesting to see what has \ntranspired in this past year. It seems there is a new tact now to get \nthe constitutional balanced budget amendment passed, and that is to \ntrash Social Security--``it is going broke; its program is bad; the \nbaby boomers aren't going to get any money''--to do what we can to make \nSocial Security look bad.\n  Mr. President, Social Security is the most successful social program \nin the history of the world. It is a good program, and people who want \nto say Social Security is in deep trouble, it is going out of business \nsoon, simply are wrong. Even the 13-member bipartisan commission which \nreported back on Social Security acknowledged that until the year 2029, \nSocial Security is going to pay out all the benefits as it now pays \nout. In fact, in the year 2029, if we did nothing else, benefits would \nstill be paid out at about 80 percent. We have to do some adjustment to \nSocial Security in the outyears. There are many ways we can do that.\n  Social Security is not in trouble of going broke unless this balanced \nbudget amendment passes, and then there is going to be some real \ntrouble. The trouble is that the surpluses have been and will continue \nto be used to balance the budget. The fact that there has been a \nprocedure used in years gone by that is wrong does not mean we should \nenshrine that in the Constitution.\n  So I suggest that the argument that Social Security is going broke is \nabout as valid as the argument that is used on a continual basis that \nStates balance their budget. The State of Nevada balances its budget, \nbut capital improvements are off budget.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe we should have a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. I am willing to go for that. I voted \nfor all the motions to table. But I believe we should exclude Social \nSecurity trust fund moneys from the numbers that allow the false way of \nobtaining a balanced budget.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I say to my dear friend and colleague, that \nwould be one of the most tragic errors we could make. To me, that would \nbe almost fiscal insanity.\n  I am not saying anything is purely technical. What I am saying is \nthat the money, not the securities, the money from FICA is commingled \nwith all Treasury funds. Everybody knows that. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, as to the outyear issue, CRS says in various studies that the \npresent surplus is not enough to fund the needs of the system when the \nbaby boomers retire. That is a reality.\n\n[[Page S1334]]\n\n  No. 3, not including Social Security within the purview of the \nbalanced budget amendment will ultimately hurt that program, because \nthere will not be the same force to reform the program and make sure it \nworks when the baby boomers come on that there may be now, that is \nincluded in the unified budget.\n  I might also add, Mr. President, this is very important. This is the \nhighest item in the Federal budget. How can we take it out of the \nunified Federal budget and not consider it? Yes, we have surpluses for \na few years, but then all of a sudden, it goes into deep deficit. Both \nsides need to be in the full balanced budget if we are going to meet \nour realities and meet our necessities.\n  The question of the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, ``If \nthe balanced budget amendment would truly require a balanced budget, \nthen why will the debt increase,'' is, with all due respect, a bit of \nsophistry. The balanced budget amendment will require a balanced \nbudget. Outlays must not exceed receipts under section 1 of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1.\n  It is true that gross debt may still increase even if the budget is \nbalanced. That is because the Government's exchange of interest-bearing \nsecurities for the present Social Security surplus is counted in the \ngross debt. It is merely an accounting or bookkeeping notation of what \none agency of Government owes another agency. It is analogous to a \ncorporation buying back its stock or debentures. Such stocks and bonds \nare considered retired obligations that, once retired, have no economic \nor fiscal significance.\n  Moreover, the Defense and Energy Departments list billions of dollars \nof environmental and nuclear cleanups as liabilities. All in all, gross \ndebt, which includes all debt, is simply an overall indicator of \nFederal Government obligations. This sets the floor on increasing debt \nthat has a direct, current effect on the overall economy, as the \nadministration agrees. This is very different from obligations owed by \nthe Federal Government to the public. This type of debt termed ``net \ndebt'' or debt held by the public is legally enforceable and is what is \neconomically significant.\n  If net debt zooms because of interest payments of debt, which last \nyear amounted to $250 billion, budget deficits balloon with all the \ndire economic consequences. To assure that budgets will be balanced \nunless extraordinary situations arise, debt held by the public cannot \nbe increased unless three-fifths of the whole number of each House \nconcur.\n  It is true that a balanced budget amendment does not by itself reduce \nthe $5.3 going to $5.4 trillion national debt. But what it does do is \nstraighten out our national fiscal house. Passage of Senate Joint \nResolution 1 will increase economic growth. Almost everybody agrees to \nthat on Wall Street. It will increase economic growth. It will allow us \nto run surpluses. With this, our national debt may be decreased if \nCongress desires to do so in the interest of national security, \nstability, and prosperity.\n  Without Senate Joint Resolution 1, as we saw from the charts of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia all afternoon long today, \nwithout Senate Joint Resolution 1, this will be an impossibility. We \nwill just continue the same darn programs producing deficits producing \nthe 28 years of unbalanced budgets, unbalanced budgets that will just \ncontinue on ad infinitum. Ultimately our kids are going to have pay \nthese debts, and it will be a doggone big debt for them. We just cannot \ndo it to them.\n  I just suggest to my colleagues, as sincere as they are, the worst \nthing they can do for our senior citizens is to try to exclude Social \nSecurity from the budget because then all these big spenders around \nCongress are going to find everything to be a Social Security \nexpenditure. Ultimately, it will impinge on the Social Security program \nand ruin the program, which Senator Reid this evening has rightly \ncalled one of the greatest programs in the history of the world. He \ncalled it the greatest. I will certainly say it is one of the greatest \nin the history of the world.\n  If we want it to continue, it seems to me we have to treat it, since \nit is a high item in our budget, as a budgetary item. These accounting \napproaches are going to go on no matter what happens. So I think if we \npass the balanced budget amendment, a balanced budget will ultimately \nbecome a reality. We are going to have to face reform of Social \nSecurity in the best interests of our senior citizens.\n  If we keep going where we are going, there will not be any moneys for \nSocial Security and a lot of people are going to get hurt. To exclude \nSocial Security from the budget is penny wise and pound foolish and it \nis a fiscal gimmick to try to take the largest item in the Federal \nbudget out of the Federal budget without reforming the program to keep \nit solvent. Passage of the balanced budget amendment will pressure \nCongress to fix Social Security. Passage of the balanced budget \namendment will help increase revenues and economic growth that will aid \nSocial Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might--I will not belabor \nthis because there will be another time when we can have a lengthier \ndiscussion. I hope we can have some questions back and forth.\n\n  The Senator used the word ``sophistry.'' I was recalling when in high \nschool I worked at a service station and learned how to juggle three \nballs. I remember how difficult it was when I started trying to learn \nto juggle three balls at once, but how easy it became once I learned \nhow. And I marvel sometimes at how those who really know how to juggle \ndo it with total ease. It seems effortless.\n  The juggling that I just saw was interesting. The Senator said there \nmay be an increase in gross debt even when the budget is in balance. It \nis not ``may.'' The Congressional Budget Office says there ``will'' be \nan increase in gross debt by $130 billion the very year in which people \nclaim there is a balanced budget. So it is not ``may''; it is ``will.''\n  The question I was asking was, does that matter? Is it not a paradox \nor contradiction that when we say we have balanced the budget, my young \ndaughter will inherit a higher national debt? And the Senator from \nUtah, I think, said, yeah, but that is just technical. He said the \ngross debt is different than the net debt.\n  In fact, the only reason we keep track of the gross debt, as I heard \nhim say it, is because it has an impact on the economy. But if it has \nan impact on the economy, I did not understand the second position of \nwhy it does not count. It seems to me that the circumstances of the \ngross debt are that if you increase the indebtedness of the Federal \nGovernment, this cannot simply be on cellophane paper someplace. It \nrepresents securities that my daughter and sons and all others in the \ncountry will have to repay. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just say I never did learn how to juggle things. I \nthink that is one reason why I strongly believe in balanced budgeting, \nis because I am tired of all the juggling that has gone on around here. \nBut under the exemption proposal of the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota, the debt will increase much faster because there is \nnothing being done about it. His proposal does not change that one bit.\n  Our proposal says we are tired of this. We are tired of 28 straight \nyears of unbalanced budgets, and we want to face the music of budget \ndeficits and do it within the realm of fiscal restraint. And, if we do \nnot keep all items together, then there are going to be loopholes that \nliterally will blow this country apart. We will have the regular budget \nand a separate Social Security budget. One will be required to be \nbalanced under the constitutional amendment and the other will be an \nexempted Social Security budget that can run deficits because under the \nproposal it will be excluded from the constitutional amendment. \nCongress will transfer costly programs to the exempted budget. These \ncostly programs will be funded out of Social Security revenues. This \nwill ruin and hurt every senior citizen in this country. Exempting \nSocial Security is just a fiscal gimmick.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. We also know it is accounting.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reclaiming my time, I was yielding for a question. I \nguess the question that often comes up for us is: Isn't our balanced \nbudget amendment a\n\n[[Page S1335]]\n\ngimmick? Isn't yours real, the one offered by the Senator from Utah? \nThe answer, I would say to the Senator from Utah, is, it is now 6:27. \nIf at 6:28 we pass and all the States ratify your proposal, at 6:29 \nwill there have been one penny difference in the Federal debt or the \nFederal deficit? The answer is ``No.''\n  Mr. HATCH. Of course not. Of course not. But passage of the balanced \nbudget amendment is the first and only real step toward a balanced \nbudget and fiscal sanity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say this. My proposal is a proposal to similarly \nrequire a balanced budget. I think there is merit in that discipline. \nBut I would say this. When we alter the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget, I want to do it in a way that really requires that \nthis debt clock that you brought to your hearing that day stop, dead \nstop; not a slow creep, but a dead stop. No more debt for your kids, my \nkids, no more debts for this country, so we can start paying down the \ndebt rather than continue to increase the debt.\n\n  I do not want to create a shell game here where we say, let us have a \ngiant feast because we have balanced the budget, and then have someone, \nsome little kid point up to that debt clock and say, ``Gee, Daddy, why \nis the debt clock still increasing, because Senator Hatch or Senator so \nand so said we balanced the budget?''\n  I say you and I do not have a disagreement about what we ought to be \ndoing. We ought to balance the budget. Nor do we have a disagreement \nabout whether there is merit to have put it in the Constitution.\n  We have a very big disagreement about the $3 trillion in the next 20 \nyears or so in Social Security surpluses, deciding that we ought to \ntake those out of reach and save them for the purpose we said we are \ngoing to save them for. We have great disagreement about whether or not \nthat is a gimmick or whether that is important for the future of this \ncountry. That is where we disagree.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think that is true. Let me just say, so I clarify, I did \nnot say that the distinguished Senator from North Dakota is a sophist, \nthough I think he would make a good one. I did say that I think his \narguments are--\n  Mr. DORGAN. I did not say the Senator from Utah could juggle, \nalthough I think it looks to me like he has that talent.\n  Mr. HATCH. I admitted I could not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I think he has the talent, the potential.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me say this. I think there is a good argument the \ngross debt increase does not matter in this context. Why? Because it is \njust evidence of what one agency in the Government owes another agency. \nWhat is of economic consequence is net debt--net debt; that is debt \nheld by the public which is legally enforceable.\n  Now, I have to say that the Senator's proposal does not stop the debt \nfrom growing, and under his proposal, if this balanced budget amendment \ngoes down, if his amendment was added--and it will go down and \neverybody knows that--the gross debt will grow at least as fast. So his \nsolution is not a solution.\n  We all know that the only balanced budget amendment we have a chance \nof passing is the underlying amendment that includes everything on the \nbudget. We also all know, in all fairness, that Social Security should \nbe included because it is more than capable of competing with other \nprograms, and it ought to have to compete. Let me tell you this, if it \nis not on there, I think it is a risky gimmick to take it out.\n  When somebody says our balanced budget amendment is a gimmick, I \nagree with the Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe, who said today, if it \nwas a gimmick, we would have passed it long ago. The fact is that it is \nwhy it is being fought so hard against. It will put fiscal restraints \nand discipline on all items of the budget that has been long overdue. I \nthink that has to be done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate with \na great deal of interest. I was especially interested that the Senator \nfrom Utah described as a fiscal gimmick separating out the Social \nSecurity trust fund from the rest of the Federal budget, because, if I \nam not mistaken, the Senator from Utah himself voted for that very \nproposition in 1990. In fact, we had a vote right on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate on the specific question of whether or not we were going to \ncount the Social Security trust fund as part of the overall budget or \nnot.\n  I believe separating out the Social Security trust fund received 97 \nor 98 votes. I believe the Senator from Utah was recorded in favor of \nthe proposition that he now describes as a gimmick. I do not believe \nthat he felt it was a gimmick then, and I do not believe that anybody \nwho voted for it believed it was a gimmick then. It was a move to try \nto stop the nefarious practice of using Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses to mask the true size of the operating deficit in this \ncountry.\n  Now what they are seeking to do is put that flawed principle in the \nConstitution of the United States. I just note that back in 1990 when \nwe had that vote, passed by a vote, as I recall, of 20 to 1 in the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is quite a bit different from what I am saying. We \ndid not include Social Security in the budget in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nsolely so as to not give the President the right to sequester Social \nSecurity funds. But this exclusion was not from the budget itself. But \nwe should not lock the exemption into the Constitution. We can always \nchange statutes. It is much harder to amend the Constitution. We should \nnot lock into the Constitution the largest item in the Federal budget, \nwhich is outside the purview of the constitutional amendment. If you \nstart doing that, that is risky.\n  You do not know how that will affect senior citizens. It is likely to \nhurt the senior citizens, and it is better to keep things on budget. I \nsuspect that there is no question in anybody's mind that Social \nSecurity is more than capable of fending for itself and of getting \nanother 98-to-2 vote in the Senate and an equivalent vote in the House \nthat you cannot tamper with it.\n  Frankly, I am one of those that would make sure to vote that you do \nnot tamper with Social Security, to lock the exemption in the \nConstitution forever. Such a budgetary practice, is risky. That could \nhave a terribly bad effect on senior citizens. I think senior citizens \nare starting to wake up to that. They know this issue has been used \nblatantly and politically and demogogically for years now. I think they \nare getting tired of it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me say I find this argument very \ninteresting because the principle is identical.\n  In 1990, we had a vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate to separate \nout the Social Security trust fund from the rest of the Federal budget. \nThe Senator from Utah voted in favor of separating out the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Today, he says we ought to enshrine in the Constitution the reverse \nprinciple, that we ought to put them together, that the Social Security \ntrust fund ought to be married to the rest of the Federal budget.\n  What is wrong with that principle is what was wrong with it in 1990, \nand what I believe 98 Senators said, that we are not going to merge the \ntwo, we will not count the Social Security trust fund with the rest of \nthe budget, because it is a risky financial move to put the two \ntogether. It masks the size of the deficits in the early years, and in \nthe later years creates a whole series of other problems.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I could finish the thought, we are in a circumstance \nnow where the Senator from Utah is advocating when he says locking into \nthe Constitution is a risky matter, that is precisely what he is \nadvocating.\n  In 1990, he voted to keep Social Security separate from the rest of \nthe budget. Now he is advocating a constitutional amendment that would \nforce the two together.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senator from Utah was right in 1990 when \nhe cast that vote. I think he is simply mistaken in offering this \nconstitutional amendment that puts the two together.\n  What is the difference between the Social Security trust fund and \nother parts of the Federal budget? Mr. President, the primary \ndifference is a dedicated revenue source. We withhold in\n\n[[Page S1336]]\n\nthe payroll of employees and employers specific amounts every month to \ngo into a fund on the predicate they will then receive, when they \nretire, their Social Security benefit. Frankly, this proposal puts all \nof that at risk.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will end with this. The 1990 Budget Act basically stated \nin one section to take Social Security out of budget. It said in \nanother section to leave it in. This is confusing. But both Congress \nand the President have construed the Budget Act of 1990 to allow Social \nSecurity to be included within the unitary budget.\n  Second, Social Security is not a pay-go system under the 1990 act. I \nwant to add that once you make that decision to take the largest item \nout of the budget, you have provided a loophole where people can \nimpinge on Social Security and hurt senior citizens. Anybody who does \nnot believe in those loopholes better look at these stacks. They are \nfilled with loopholes like that. We are trying to stop those loopholes.\n  I might also mention this, because I think it is pretty important. \nAll constitutional scholars who testified before our committee, those \nfor the balanced budget amendment and those against the balanced budget \namendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, testified that exempting Social \nSecurity in the Constitution was constitutionally risky. It is a risky \ngimmick to do that. No one knows how that will hurt the seniors, but we \nknow it will. It would subject Social Security and the Constitution to \na gaming approach. They could game the process. They could game Social \nSecurity. They could game the Constitution. That would be a disaster \nfor our country.\n  Alan Morrison, one of the leading constitutional lawyers in this \ncountry, who disagreed about the wisdom of the balanced budget \namendment, said: ``Given the size of Social Security, to allow it to \nrun at a deficit would undermine the whole concept of a balanced \nbudget. Moreover, there is no definition of Social Security in the \nConstitution and it would be extremely unwise and productive of \nlitigation and political maneuvering to try to write one. If there is \nto be a balanced budget constitutional amendment, there should be no \nexceptions.''\n  In conclusion, the biggest threat to Social Security is our growing \ndebt and the concomitant interest payments. That related inflation hits \nhardest on those on fixed incomes, and the Government's use of capital \nto fund debt slows productivity and income growth and siphons off \nneeded money for worthwhile programs. The way to protect Social \nSecurity benefits is to pass Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment.\n  The proposal to exempt Social Security would not only destroy the \nbalanced budget amendment--the only one that can pass, a bipartisan \namendment, a bicameral amendment, bipartisan in both parties--but, in \nall probability, would very badly hurt Social Security and every \nrecipient of Social Security, and would definitely guarantee that the \nbaby boomers would not have any Social Security in the future. They \nwill come to the realization that it is going to hurt Social Security, \ntoo. The best thing we can do is keep everything in the budget and \nstart being budget people who work, and who do what's right, and get \nrid of these 28 years of unbalanced budgets that have just about \nwrecked the country. And it could very well wreck Social Security.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/12/senate-section/article/S1331-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENTS BY THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the \nhour of 11 a.m. on Thursday, February 13. I further ask that \nimmediately following the prayer, the routine requests for the morning \nhour be granted and the Senate then proceed to a period of morning \nbusiness until the hour of 3 p.m., with Senators to speak during the \ndesignated times:\n  Senator Thomas, or his designee, in control of the time from 11 to 12 \nnoon; Senator Reed of Rhode Island and Senator Kennedy for up to 30 \nminutes each, between 12 and 1 o'clock; the time from 1 o'clock until 2 \no'clock divided among the following Senators: Senator Grams for 20 \nminutes, Senator Domenici for 10 minutes, Senator Murkowski for 10 \nminutes, Senator Coats for 10 minutes, Senator Faircloth for 5 minutes; \nthe time between 2 o'clock to 3 o'clock divided in the following \nfashion: Senator Graham of Florida, 10 minutes; Senator Kohl, 10 \nminutes; and Senator Hollings, 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nprobably will not. I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, the acting floor leader, this. We have more Senators that would \nlike to have an opportunity to speak tomorrow as it relates to morning \nbusiness. I see that you are cutting it off. And you have done a pretty \ngood job there. You have 65 minutes assigned to an hour.\n  Mr. HATCH. Hopefully, by 2 o'clock tomorrow, the majority leader \nshould be able to let us know what will be done thereafter. We can't \nextend morning business past 3 o'clock tomorrow.\n  Mr. FORD. Well, maybe we want to object to all of it, then, if we \ncan't----\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we just have to work it out.\n  Mr. FORD. I understand you will work it out if you work it out your \nway. I just want us to have an opportunity to get involved in this. How \ndo you intend to work it out?\n  Mr. HATCH. These are the only requests I have.\n  Mr. FORD. We have a list, a bushel basketful, just like you have, and \nthese Senators want time. They have been told they could get time, and \nwe expect to get them time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am informed by the leadership office that we will be \nable to update the Senate about 2 o'clock tomorrow. Hopefully, these \nmatters can be resolved. The majority leader may want to proceed to \nother business. I don't know. But my understanding is that there is \ngoing to be an effort to try to accommodate people. I think the two \nleaders will have to work that out. But we can't do it until 2 o'clock \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. FORD. Why can't the leader be asked tonight? We can suggest the \nabsence of a quorum and see if we can get an answer tonight.\n  Mr. HATCH. Well, I think the Senator knows the problems of \nleadership. The things we are trying to do tomorrow can't be cleared \ntonight. So until we get to 2 o'clock, we can't resolve this.\n  Mr. FORD. Do I have the Senator's word that, at 2 o'clock tomorrow, \nthis side will be notified as to the time available for us to allow our \ncolleagues to have time in morning business--and it won't be 5 minutes; \nsome will want more than 5 minutes. Some will want 15. I see on here \nthat of the 1 hour you have, you have 65 minutes assigned. So you \nstretched it a little bit here. If you could do that on all the hours, \nmaybe we can get more business done.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will certainly take the Senator's request to the \nmajority leader and ask him to consider it.\n  Mr. FORD. I expect, at 2 o'clock, for us to be informed tomorrow as \nto how much time will be available to us and how many of my colleagues \nwill be able to speak.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will take that request to the majority leader. I will \ncertainly do that.\n  Mr. FORD. As long as it is a matter of record and you understand \nwhere I am coming from.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do.
