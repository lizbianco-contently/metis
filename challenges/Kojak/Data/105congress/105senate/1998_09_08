Mr. President, last week, the Senate made good progress, \nand I want to express my appreciation for the cooperation. We did pass \nthe military construction appropriations conference report, the first \nappropriations conference report of the year. We also completed action \non two other appropriations bills, the foreign operations \nappropriations bill and the Treasury-Postal Service. In addition to \nthat, we completed action on the Texas Compact legislation and got \nstarted on debate on bankruptcy reform. So I think we made good use of \nour time. There were also some very interesting hearings that occurred \nlast week. I hope we can continue that pace this week.\n  We will have a period of morning business until 12:30 today. \nFollowing morning business, the Senate will recess until 2:15 to allow \nfor the weekly party caucuses to meet. When we reconvene after the \nparty caucuses, it is my intention for the Senate to begin \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill. That will be the \n11th appropriations bill to be considered for the year, leaving only \nD.C. appropriations and the Labor, HHS and Education appropriations \nbill. We have not quite a month, but we only have the three remaining \nbills to get done. With a little cooperation, we can complete them. \nHopefully, we will begin to see two or three conference reports cleared \neach week for the balance of this month.\n  Members are encouraged to come to the floor and offer amendments if \nthey have amendments on the Interior appropriations bill so that we can \nhave debate and votes and make substantial progress on it. We would \nexpect to have rollcall votes this afternoon and into the evening, \nperhaps, on the Interior bill amendments or any legislative or \nexecutive items that may be cleared.\n  Also, as a reminder to all Members, there will be two cloture votes \non Wednesday. The first will be on national missile defense. We voted \non this a few months ago. Cloture failed by just one vote. I believe, \nin view of what has been happening around the world--the uncertainty in \nRussia, the actions by North Korea, and the problem in Iraq--for us not \nto have a national missile defense, to not have a plan, to not have \ncommitment, is indefensible. I would not want to be on record as not \nsupporting this. The American people expect it of us. If we don't act \nnow, the year 2010 will come and we still will not have a missile \ndefense. With a lot of dangerous people, chances of rogue or accidental \nlaunch is there. We should not take it for granted.\n  After we vote on cloture and hopefully complete action on the \nnational missile defense bill, we will then turn\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\nto the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act. We hope we will get cloture \non that. Because of objections from Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts, \nwe had to file cloture on a motion to proceed. If we get cloture on \nthat, then we would move immediately to cloture on the bill itself, if \nnecessary. But I hope we get cloture on the motion to proceed. Then we \ncan work out a way to consider this legislation and Senators would have \na chance or chances to offer amendments, if they would like to.\n  This could be a busy week. It could be a productive week. We also \nwill probably file cloture sometime this week, perhaps Wednesday, on \nthe child custody bill, but we will make that decision as we see how \nthe week is proceeding and progressing. We will make that call probably \nWednesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9949-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire).

Mr. President, last Thursday the Armed Services and \nforeign Relations Committees held a joint hearing to hear testimony \nfrom a courageous and dedicated American--Major Scott Ritter. Major \nRitter began his opening statement by saying,\n\n       Last week I resigned my position with UNSCOM out of \n     frustration because the U.N. Security Council, and the United \n     States, as its most significant supporter, were failing to \n     enforce the post-Gulf War resolutions designed to disarm \n     Iraq. I sincerely hope that my actions might help to change \n     things . . .\n\n  For nearly three hours, Major Ritter responded to Senators' \nquestions, describing how U.S. policies in support of United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions were not being honestly implemented. He \nalso expressed his views regarding the dangers associated with Iraq's \ncontinuing pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and how this Nation's \nvictory in the Persian Gulf war was being squandered.\n  Major Ritter served as an intelligence officer in the Marine Corps \nduring the Persian Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from Iraq. He became a \nUnited Nations inspector in 1991 and acted under international law \ncreated by the United States and the United Nations. His job as an \ninspector was to plan and conduct inspections to eliminate illegal \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Major Ritter was deeply dedicated \nto his duties. He explained that his duty as a weapons inspector \nrepresented a vital continuation of what many Americans had fought and \ndied for during the Gulf War. Finding and destroying these dangerous \nweapons is critically important to the United States and our allies. \nThese weapons of mass destruction could one day be used again by Saddam \nHussein to attack his neighbors, dominate the region and threaten vital \ninterests of the United States. Major Ritter was dedicated to reducing \nthe threat from such weapons. He earned a reputation as a tough, \ndemanding inspector. Saddam Hussein feared his perseverance and tried \nto get him removed from UNSCOM and Iraq. I regret that he has resigned. \nI felt better knowing Major Ritter was on the job. However, Major \nRitter found that he was repeatedly and systematically hindered from \nperforming his duties. The very laws he was asked to enforce were not \nnow being supported by the U.N. Security Council nor his own \ngovernment.\n  Major Ritter's resignation from his position as an UNSCOM inspector \nwas a selfless and patriotic act. However, his resignation and the \nreason for his resignation deserve our immediate attention and action. \nI hope that his personal sacrifice will spur the Congress and the \nAdministration to act with the same courage and urgency as Major \nRitter.\n  During the hearing, Major Ritter was asked all the most difficult \nquestions to challenge his judgment and veracity. His challengers were \nunsuccessful. He simply told the truth, and the truth is a National \nembarrassment. Although Major Ritter had the courtesy not to say it, \nhis message was clear. ``Congress, I have done my job. It is now time \nto do yours.'' Our job in Congress requires the same courage Major \nRitter displayed last week and for the past nine years as a weapons \ninspector for the United Nations. I am deeply disappointed that such a \nbrave and bright young American was forced into choosing to resign from \nhis duties because of his principles. His actions clearly send us a \nmessage. ``This Nation's actions must be consistent with its \npolicies.''\n  I believe that our Nation and the world are far less safe as a result \nof Saddam Hussein's programs of weapons of mass destruction. We must \ninsist that UNSCOM be allowed to do its job. We in government must say \nwhat we mean, and do as we say. We have not been doing this recently in \nour foreign and national defense policies.\n  Mr. President, it is now Congress' responsibility to ensure that this \nhappens.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I hope all my colleagues had a good Labor \nDay at home with their constituents. I want to say that I had the real \npleasure of being with hundreds of people all over the great State of \nCalifornia with the Lieutenant Governor this Labor Day. And it was very \nuplifting to be with the people who are moving our country forward, \nbecause every day they get up and put one foot in front of the other, \nand they work, they take care of their families, and they build this \ncountry.\n  So it was, indeed, a very good day, and I think a day that gave a lot \nof us perspective as to why we are here and what our real interests \nshould be in terms of making sure that this economic expansion \ncontinues, and that every child, regardless of station, has a chance at \nthe American dream.\n  Mr. President, last week, Senator Lieberman made a very thoughtful \nspeech on the Senate floor in which he expressed his ``deep \ndisappointment and personal anger'' concerning the President's improper \nbehavior.\n  Senator Lieberman then laid out the process by which the Senate can \ngo on record in an official expression of disapproval.\n  When I was asked how I felt about that, I expressed agreement with \nSenator Lieberman and with his understanding of the options that are \nbefore this body.\n  I would like to reiterate today what I have said about this matter \nsince January. At that time I put my faith in the process, which I said \nwould lead to the truth. The process is in fact leading to the truth, \nand the process is continuing.\n  In 1983, when I served in the House of Representatives, we had such a \nprocess in place when I voted to censure two colleagues--one a Democrat \nand one a Republican--for relationships that involved interns; we had a \nprocess in place in 1990, again, when a House colleague was reprimanded \nfor his conduct.\n  Unfortunately, we did not have such a process in place in 1991, when \na Supreme Court nominee was about to be confirmed with not so much as a \nlook at allegations of sexual harassment. And in 1995, the integrity of \nthe Senate process was being compromised to keep such charges by 18 \nwomen secret, rather than following the normal course of open public \nhearings. We also learned that the military routinely ignored similar \ncomplaints.\n  So despite the difficulty of all of those incidents--and they were \nall very difficult--I am proud that many women in Congress have worked \nto make sure that improper relationships in the\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\nworkplace are no longer swept under the rug. We certainly know about \nthe President's relationship. It was wrong. It was indefensible, and as \nSenator Lieberman has said, the relationship was immoral. The President \nhas now agreed with that assessment. I fervently wish he had seen it \nthat way before the relationship started. And in any case, he should \nhave taken responsibility much earlier.\n  This President has led us out of the worst recession since the Great \nDepression. He has led us to a balanced budget--the first one in 30 \nyears. And in my home State we have seen 1.4 million new jobs, 100,000 \nnew businesses, and a decline in crime of 28 percent.\n  I will always be grateful to the President for his visionary public \npolicy in so many areas, and so will the people of California. I \nfervently hope that while the process moves forward we can continue to \nwork with President Clinton to keep the country moving in the right \ndirection. The people want us to do that, and I think we should do \nthat.\n  I don't believe there are differences in this body about the \nimmorality of the President's relationship with an intern.\n  As I said, the President himself agreed with Senator Lieberman's \ncomments.\n  We have a process in place to deal with the President's morality as \nit relates to an improper relationship. I would like to ask us today to \nalso set our agenda to deal with public policy morality.\n  I want to explain what I mean by that.\n  Is it moral for an HMO to deny a child desperately needing care?\n  I spoke at a press conference the other day about one of my \nconstituents, a little girl, who is undergoing chemotherapy treatment. \nShe is very sick and she has severe nausea and vomiting from the \nprocedure. The HMO denied the parents $54 for a prescription to take \naway her nausea and vomiting while the CEO of that company was drawing \ndown tens of millions of dollars in salary. I don't think that is \nmoral.\n  I want to see us pass a Patients' Bill of Rights with teeth in it to \ndeal with that.\n  Is it moral that 14 children every day die from gunshot wounds in \nAmerica? Fourteen children every day. Let's pass sensible gun laws that \ndo not infringe on people's rights but make our country safer.\n  Is it moral not to fund three out of four approved NIH grants? That \nis what happens today. The NIH budget is squeezed. We need to do more. \nOur people are sick. They worry about cancer, Alzheimer's--all the \ndiseases that plague us today. Let's double the Federal commitment to \nhelp research within the context of a balanced budget, and then tell \nour people we are doing all we can. That would be the moral thing to \ndo.\n  Is it moral for special interests to give unlimited funds of money to \na political campaign? We could stop that. Let's pass the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance reform laws. That would help solve the \nproblem.\n  Is it moral to have children attending schools where ceiling tiles \nfall on their heads?\n  I just visited such a school in Sacramento--an old school. I had to \nrun out of there literally choking on the must and the mildew in the \nroom. We need an education plan to help all of our children learn.\n  Is it moral to leave our kids at home in empty houses or to join \ngangs because they are so lonely after school? We know the juvenile \ncrime rate goes just straight up like this after school, and we know \nthat afterschool programs work. Let's pass a program at least to fund \n500 of those afterschool programs.\n  So my point today is this: In the Senate and in our own way we must \nstrive for private morality, and we also should strive for public \nmorality.\n  Mr. President, we have so much work to do. But I know we can do good \nthings for the people of this country if we have the will to move \nforward to address the many moral questions facing us--the moral \nquestions on the private side, and the moral questions on the public \nside.\n  So, again, as we reflect on the situation as it confronts us, let's \nremember to do our best on both sides of the equation--private \nmorality, absolutely; and public morality, absolutely.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROBERTS). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \no'clock will be under the control of the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, Mr. Hatch, and the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9950-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I rise today to again express my \ndisappointment in the refusal of Members on the other side of the aisle \nto allow the Senate to proceed to S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy \nReform Act of 1998.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation, and it will be an \nenormous disservice to the American people if we fail to act on it this \nyear. We all know the time is short and the schedule is very crowded in \nthese last few weeks of the session. I just hope that, when the time \ncomes, my colleagues on the other side will vote for cloture on the \nmotion to proceed tomorrow and provide the Senate a fair chance to \ndebate this much-needed legislation. In fact, I hope that they will \nwaive their filibuster on the motion to proceed and will invoke cloture \non the bill itself, if that is needed.\n  In recent years, personal bankruptcy filings have reached epidemic \nproportions in the United States. We simply cannot afford to continue \ndown this path because excessive bankruptcy filings harm every one of \nus in America. Consumer bankruptcy ends up costing Americans almost $40 \nbillion a year, or roughly $400 per household in this country. The \nnegative repercussions associated with consumer bankruptcy go far \nbeyond the debts owed to credit card companies and big businesses.\n  The reality is, contrary to what the critics of reform would lead us \nto believe, this issue profoundly impacts the average American. \nBankruptcies end up harming small business owners, senior citizens who \nrely on rental income to supplement their retirements, and of course \nmembers of credit unions. Even the person who files for bankruptcy can \nend up being hurt. Some filers, victims of so-called ``bankruptcy \nmills,'' are neither apprised of their options nor informed of the \nconsequences of a bankruptcy filing. Ultimately, they suffer the \nconsequences of having filed, when a better alternative may have been \navailable to them.\n  This legislation is guided by two main principles: No. 1, restoring \npersonal responsibility in the bankruptcy system; and, No. 2, ensuring \nadequate and effective protection for consumers.\n  There are individuals who can repay some of what they owe but, \ninstead, choose to use--rather, ``abuse''--the current bankruptcy \nsystem or laws to avoid doing so. The bankruptcy laws need to be \nreformed to prevent this from occurring. S. 1301 does this, while \ndelicately safeguarding the bankruptcy system so that it can provide a \n``fresh start'' to those who truly need it.\n  I note that according to statistics from the American Bankruptcy \nInstitute, most States in this Union have seen a troubling rise in \nbankruptcy filings. This is at a time when our economy has been doing \nextremely well. While we must preserve bankruptcy for those who need \nit, as legislators we must recognize that there are some unscrupulous \nindividuals who are able to repay some of what they owe but still use \nthe current bankruptcy laws to avoid doing so. In fact, to go one step \nfurther, there are some people who can pay all of what they owe but opt \nout through the bankruptcy system because of current loopholes in the \nlaw itself.\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\n  This balanced legislation deserves to be considered. It is time for \nthe Senate to act on this legislation. We should not derail the fair \nand balanced reforms proposed by this bill due to petty, partisan \npolitics. I hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nvote to allow the Senate to proceed to S. 1301 tomorrow. Furthermore, I \nhope once we proceed to the bankruptcy legislation, they will not \nprevent its passage by attempts to offer extraneous, politically \nmotivated amendments, all of which we are used to at this time of the \nyear but which I hope will not be the case on this particular bill, as \nimportant as it is. There will be no greater failure to discharge our \nduty as Senators if this legislation is held hostage for petty \npolitical purposes or the petty political politics of the few.\n  It is time to debate this bill, debate any relevant amendments, and \nit is time to vote on it. In the interests of all Americans and the \nfuture of our economy, we need to end these partisan efforts to delay \nconsideration of this bankruptcy reform legislation. It is time to \nfulfill our commitment to the American people and end the abuse of the \nbankruptcy system and its attendant $400 tax on every American family.\n  Finally, I want to pay particular tribute to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa who has handled this matter through the Subcommittee \non the Courts and Administrative Oversight. He has brought it through \nthe full committee and on to the floor of the Senate, with the help of \nsome of the rest of us, but he has done a particularly good job on this \nbill.\n  Yes, there are things that perhaps need to be corrected and might \nneed to be changed. Both Senator Grassley and I have been open to \nchanges and good ideas to improve this bill. And when and if we finally \nget to debate this bill, we will remain open to new ideas. But the fact \nof the matter is, it is very difficult to get a bill of this magnitude \nthrough without listening to everybody and paying attention to \neverybody's ideas. I think the distinguished Senator from Iowa has done \nan excellent job in doing exactly that. I am very proud of the work he \nhas done. It is just typical of his service here in the Senate that he \nnot only grabs the bull by the horns, but he gets it done and he does \nthe things that really have to be done. He is a very valued member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and is certainly valued by me, personally. I \njust want him to know how much I appreciate the work he has done on \nthis legislation.\n  There are others, as well, including the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, on other side of the floor. I hope he will counsel the people \non his side of the floor to quit playing games with this important \nbill. He has worked very hard on this bill as well and deserves a lot \nof credit for how far we have come on this. I hope that with the \nleadership of these two fine Senators, Members on both sides of the \naisle will realize how important this legislation truly is. If we can \nget this up through cloture, I have no doubt this will pass \noverwhelmingly on the floor because it is that important. It is that \nwell done. It has the kind of backing that really it needs from the \npeople at large in the country, on all sides of the spectrum. It is the \ntype of legislation where literally all of us can go home and say we \ndid the right thing.\n  There is no question that we have to go to conference should we pass \nthis bill. Hopefully, through that process, we can perfect both the \nHouse bill and this bill even more than we have right now. But the fact \nis, these leaders on the committee have done a very, very good job in \ngetting it to this point, and I compliment them for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. I thank the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, not only for the kind remarks he made about my \nparticipation in this process on the bankruptcy law, but also to say \nthat it would not have been possible to get it out of the Judiciary \nCommittee without some compromises, which he helped shape in the \nprocess, and also in making it a better bill as well. So this is a \ncooperative effort not only in the subcommittee, but also at the full \ncommittee level. The 16-2 vote by which the bill was voted out of \ncommittee, I think, speaks better than anything I can say or even that \nthe Senator from Utah can say about how badly needed this legislation \nis and what a significant compromise it is in order to get that type of \na margin out of the Judiciary Committee, which the chairman has already \nreferred to as a committee that can be very controversially oriented \nfrom time to time. This is a piece of legislation that speaks to how \ncooperative that committee can be when the need calls for it to be.\n  Mr. President, as I recall, we are in a situation on this floor where \nthere was an objection to the bill coming up. So the distinguished \nSenate majority leader had to move that this bill be brought up. So we \nhave a debate going on now on a motion to proceed that is fairly \nuncharacteristic of most processes of moving legislation on the floor \nof the Senate. So I want to use this opportunity that we have of the \nSenate deciding whether or not we should even debate the merits of this \nbill to once again give reasons to my colleagues why we should move \nbeyond the motion to proceed to actual consideration of this \nlegislation. We will have that vote, as I am going to refer to in a \nminute, hopefully tomorrow.\n  So I rise today to speak again on the importance and the need--the \nvery justified need--for fundamental bankruptcy reform. Last week, as I \nstated, a member of the minority party objected to allowing the Senate \nto consider this bill that was voted out of committee 16-2--even to \ndebate it. Tomorrow, we are set to vote on whether to proceed to the \nbankruptcy bill. If we don't have a positive vote on this, then \nbankruptcy will not be on the agenda this session. It is badly needed \nlegislation. It would be a sad consequence of that vote to not be able \nto move forward.\n  In my view, the fact that there is an objection to even considering \nbankruptcy reform shows just how scared and how reactionary the \nopponents of bankruptcy reform are. The opponents of reform know that \nthe Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act will pass overwhelmingly if allowed \nto come to a straight vote. I think hearing the distinguished chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch, say that just a few minutes \nago fortifies what I have just said.\n  The opponents of reform know that the polls are absolutely clear on a \nbroad public support for bankruptcy reform. There is no way that a \nminority of the Senate can fool 68 percent of the people nationally who \nsay that we need bankruptcy reform. And there is no way that a minority \nof the Senate can fool 78 percent of the people of my State of Iowa who \nwere surveyed in a poll on the need and their support for bankruptcy \nreform. So the American people know that our bankruptcy system is, in \nfact, out of control. Obviously, the people know that it is out of \ncontrol much more than even a small minority of the minority in this \nbody know it is out of control. If they know it is out of control and \nbadly in need of reform, they would let us proceed to this bill. So I \nhope that Congress will respond to what the people want and move \nforward to consider and pass--pass overwhelmingly, as it did out of \ncommittee--the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act. That is what \nrepresentative democracy is all about.\n\n  As I said on Thursday of last week when we were set to take up the \nbankruptcy reform bill, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform bill is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation which passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by an overwhelming vote of 16-2. The goal of the bill is \nsimple and it is important: to restore personal responsibility to our \nbankruptcy law, and to put an end to the many bankruptcies of \nconvenience which are filed every year in the United States.\n  In recent years, the number of bankruptcies has, in fact, very much \nskyrocketed. Every year since 1994, records have been broken in terms \nof the number of bankruptcies filed. Now we are at the point that we \nhad 1.4 million personal bankruptcies in 1997. So if this trend \ncontinues, Mr. President, we must all shudder to think about the harm \nto our economy and to the moral fabric of our Nation--to the economy, \nwith $40 billion of costs. There is no free lunch when it comes to \nbankruptcy. There might be for the person\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\nthat declares bankruptcy, but as we know, in our society, somebody \npays; $40 billion is being paid by somebody in America and that figures \nout to about $400 per family of four in America per year. Just think of \nthat. You, Mr. President, could be spending $400 less for your goods \nand services if we did not have this high number of bankruptcies that \nwe have.\n  But more important, what does it do to the moral fabric of our great \ncountry when, somehow, you can live high on the hog and not worry about \nwho is going to pay for it. You don't have to; you go into bankruptcy \nand somebody else pays for it. There ought to be, and is, a rule for \nAmerica which is that we all ought to be personally responsible for the \nactions we take. That is applicable not just to moral issues of family \nand marriage, but it also involves the economic world we are in as \nwell, and that is, in fact, if you enjoy something, you want to pay for \nit.\n  The interesting and alarming thing is that this unprecedented \nincrease in bankruptcy filings comes at a time when our economy has \nbeen generally healthy. Disposable income is up, unemployment is low, \nand interest rates are low. There is something that just doesn't make \nsense about this situation. Common sense and basic economics say that \nwhen the economy flourishes, bankruptcies should not be so high.\n  I had an opportunity over the weekend to look at an old U.S. News and \nWorld Report from 1991 with the predictions of the decade of the 1990s \ncoming up. At the time that magazine came out, we were in the middle of \nthe recession of 1990. That recession was caused by one of the big tax \nincreases that President Bush proposed. It wasn't quite as big as the \ntax increase that President Clinton got through in 1993, which was the \nbiggest tax increase in the history of the world, but that tax increase \nhad a detrimental impact on the economy and we were in a recession--\nrecession that, thank God, we have had years of recovery since without \ngoing into another recession.\n\n  But in that magazine it made light of the fact that there was a \n135,000 increase in personal bankruptcies that year because of the \nrecession. That is when we had the number of personal bankruptcies well \nbelow 800,000 at that particular time.\n  Let's just think. There is going to be a recession around the corner \nsomeday, hopefully not for 3 or 4 years down the road, as the economy \nis going fairly strong. But it could be happening within a year from \nnow if things in Southeast Asia and Russia don't turn around, maybe, \nand as the stock market is also indicating. We would be thinking in \nterms of half a million to 1 million bankruptcies just because of the \neconomy turning south, if we are concerned about 135,000 increases in \nbankruptcies in the year 1990 as an example.\n  It is an unprecedented time in our economy. Why is it an \nunprecedented time, then, for the number of personal bankruptcy \nfilings? I don't know. I have said how it could be related to the \nbank's sending out so many credit cards for people to be invited into \nmore debt. It could be because the Federal Government had 30 years of \ndeficit spending. Hopefully, we have that behind us now with this year \npaying down $63 billion on the national debt for the first time in 30 \nyears. It could be because the bankruptcy bar is very loose in their \nadvice, or the lack of advice, on whether people ought to go into \nbankruptcy or not. There doesn't seem to be the shame that is connected \nwith bankruptcy as there used to be. There is probably a lot of other \nreasons. At least we have those reasons to consider and those reasons \nto deal with. Another reason is the 1978 bankruptcy law that made it \npossible to get into bankruptcy. Hopefully, we have that turned around \nwith the passage of this legislation as well.\n  In the opinion of this Senator, of course, one of the main bankruptcy \ncrises is, as I just stated, the overly liberal bankruptcy law of 1978. \nRemember, since 1978 I have had hundreds of people tell me it is too \neasy to get into bankruptcy. And it shouldn't be that easy. I have not \nhad one person tell me that it ought to be easier to get into \nbankruptcy. And I even have had some people tell me who have been \nthrough bankruptcy that it is too easy to get into bankruptcy. That \nsort of attitude of the public is what is behind the 68 percent \nnationally and the 78 percent of the people in my State in polls who \nsay the bankruptcy laws should be reformed.\n  Quite simply, current law discourages personal responsibility. I want \nto say that again. Current law actually discourages personal \nresponsibility. As a result, bankruptcy has become a first option, not \nas a last resort for many with financial difficulties.\n  Bankruptcy is seen as a quick and easy way of avoiding debt. \nBankruptcy is now a matter of convenience rather than a matter of \nnecessity. The moral stigma that used to be associated with not being \nable to pay your debt is now almost completely gone. I am not saying \nthat bankruptcy law serves no purpose. On the contrary, the ability to \nhave a fresh start--or you might say it is a principle of our \nbankruptcy law that there are some people who are entitled to a fresh \nstart--it is a vital part of this American system. It is the right \nthing to do in some instances. But what is important is that \nwe structure our laws so that bankruptcy is available to those who \ntruly need protection--people who maybe because of natural disaster, \nmaybe because of a catastrophic illness in their family, maybe because \nof even divorce--there are several reasons that have been considered \nlegitimate. But we want to make sure that this process is not available \nto those who want to abuse the system and find an easy irresponsible \nway out.\n\n  The bill that we will hopefully get to consider after our cloture \nvote tomorrow strikes a balance between personal responsibility on the \none hand and giving people an opportunity to get a fresh start who \nlegitimately deserve it on the other hand. That is why the Judiciary \nCommittee, which can be very partisan at times, approved this bill by a \nvote of 16 to 2. Mr. President, I will have more to say on the problems \nwith our bankruptcy system if and when we get to consider the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  I want to inform my colleagues about the deceptive practices of \nbankruptcy lawyers who dupe unwary consumers into declaring \nbankruptcies. The practices of bankruptcy lawyers have become \nunderhanded so much that the Federal Trade Commission has issued an \nalert on that process. And in the process of issuing that order, they \ncriticized the bankruptcy bar.\n  If and when we get to consider the bill, I want to talk more about \nhow my bill enhances collection of child support. The National District \nAttorneys Association, as well as numerous other organizations which \ncollect child support, have written to me to praise this bill--S. \n1301--and the innovations in the bill for protecting child support.\n  Mr. President, supporting this bill is the right thing to do. \nApproving a vote tomorrow to move to this bill so it can actually be \nconsidered is the right thing to do, because the American people are \nsick and tired of the avoidance of personal responsibility--not only in \nthe case of bankruptcy but so many other areas. It is one we can do \nsomething about right now through the passage of this legislation.\n  The other body across the Hill has already passed an even more \nsweeping version of bankruptcy reform, and they have done it by a veto-\nproof margin. But here we are right now on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nfending off a filibuster against bankruptcy reform. After the vote \ntomorrow, if we win and can actually go to the debate of S. 1301, I \nexpect maybe even a second filibuster. I don't think these desperation \ntactics work, and particularly in the case of something that is so \nbadly needed as bankruptcy reform.\n  It is interesting how the same people who criticize this Congress for \ndoing anything are the same ones who are blocking positive bankruptcy \nreform. I have talked with many of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. I know there is a real desire to see bankruptcy reform \nhappen this year. That is why the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act \nreceived such broad bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. \nQuite simply, it is time to restore the sense of personal \nresponsibility that we Americans are famous for to our bankruptcy law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed on S. 1301, and \nthen to support S. 1301 and move to a bill that is going to bring new \npenalties for abusive bill collectors; it is going to\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\nbring new penalties for illegal repossessions; it is going to bring \nfines for inflated creditor claims; and it is going to bring penalties \nfor deceptive credit practices.\n  It seems to me that is a bill that not only will bring about \nbankruptcy reform so that bankruptcy will be used only when people are \nreally entitled to a fresh start, fitting into a pattern that we have \nhad in our bankruptcy laws between 1998 and 1978--it has only been in \nthe last 20 years that this has turned bad--but to discourage \nbankruptcy, to reimpose personal responsibility on debt, and that we \nalso do some things that even give some consumer protection in the \nprocess. I only stress the new consumer protections to make the point \nthat we are going to have a very balanced piece of legislation pass \nthis Senate, if we get a chance to vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). The distinguished Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to join Senator Hatch in \nexpressing my admiration and respect for Senator Grassley and the \nmembers of his committee who have worked hard on this bankruptcy reform \nlegislation. It has obtained almost universal support. It passed the \ncommittee 16 to 2, and it reflects a good step in our public policy.\n  As Senator Grassley says, the current liberalized bankruptcy law \ndiscourages personal responsibility, that is, it makes it easy and even \nencourages persons to avoid their responsibility. That is not good. A \nHarvard professor has written a book which talked about how during the \nfirst 150 years of this Nation's existence every law that came up for \nconsideration was judged on the basis of whether it made our people \nmore responsible and better citizens. I think that is a goal we have \nlost sight of in recent years. What we need to do is make sure our \nlegislation sets standards that call people to their highest and best \nideals and not dumbing them down and encouraging them to cop out, to \ntake the easy way out, to avoid their debts when there is no real \njustification for it.\n  Most people may not understand, but a person making $70,000 with \n$30,000 in debts can walk into a bankruptcy court in America, at any \nplace, at any time, and file for bankruptcy. Even though he would be \nperfectly able to pay off those debts, he can wipe them all out. This \nis true even if, just a few months before, he or she had signed a \npromissory note to pay those debts. This behavior vitiates contracts, \nand it vitiates responsibility.\n  So I think, based on the fact that we have had a doubling of \nbankruptcy filings in the last decade and we have seen a 60 percent \nincrease in bankruptcy filings since 1995, we do have a problem in this \ncountry. This is not driven by the economy, because we are in good \neconomic times. In 1997, however, we now know that $40 billion in \nconsumer debt was erased by bankruptcy filings in this country.\n  Where does that debt go? Who pays that debt? What happens to it? It \nis passed on to the other American citizens who are in debt but who pay \ntheir debts, who pay their credit card bills, who pay their bank notes. \nThey have to pay higher interest rates, to the tune of $400 per family \nper year, to balance out some of these people who are filing for \nbankruptcy but do not deserve it. Many people, a majority of those \nfiling, do not abuse bankruptcy. But a significant number are abusing \nthe bankruptcy laws, and we ought to do something about it.\n  There was a recent article written by former Secretary of the \nTreasury Lloyd Bentsen, former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate, \nand former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       With growing frequency, bankruptcy is being treated as a \n     first choice rather than a last resort, as a matter of \n     convenience rather than necessity.\n\n  He goes on to note:\n\n       A rising tide of bankruptcies will sink all ships and hurt \n     those who need credit the most, those who have to borrow \n     money.\n\n  People do not understand--and many in this body do not recognize--\nthat many who have done well, such as a family making $30-$40-$50,000 a \nyear, will have debts. When they have a car payment that comes up, if \nthey have an $800 balance on their credit card, those interest points \nmake a difference to them--whether they pay 15 percent or 18 percent or \n19 percent interest.\n  As former Secretary of the Treasury under President Clinton, Senator \nBentsen, said:\n\n       In the United States, we believe that through hard work \n     anyone can become a success. America's bankruptcy laws \n     reflect a fundamental element of our Nation's entrepreneurial \n     spirit. Their intent is to ensure a fresh start for those who \n     try and fail, and they form an important thread in our social \n     safety net. But when some people systematically abuse the \n     system at great expense to the rest of the population, \n     twisting the fresh start into a free ride, Congress must step \n     in and tighten up the law to protect those who unfairly bear \n     the cost. When it comes to bankruptcies of convenience, this \n     time has come.\n\n  So I agree; it is a bipartisan issue. Senator Grassley has worked \ndiligently to gain the broadest possible support. This bill came out of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee 16 to 2. A virtually unanimous vote on a \nbill of this kind is unusual and should be noted.\n  Why is it necessary? I want to mention a few things that are in the \nbill, and then I want to comment on the unusual and unfortunate \ncircumstance we are in now in which the minority party is attempting to \nblock even consideration of the bill that so many of their own members \nhave already supported in committee. They in fact filibustered the bill \nbefore it could even come to the floor. People say this is a do-nothing \nCongress. Maybe they are trying to make it so. This is a good bill. It \nhas been worked on for several years. It has been improved and refined. \nIt has very broad support, and we ought to pass it.\n  These are some of the things it does: It allows creditors, those who \nare owed money, and panel trustees to participate in the review of the \ndebtor's decision to file a chapter 7 instead of a chapter 13.\n  Most people do not realize that when you go to file bankruptcy, you \nhave two choices, if you are a normal consumer who is in debt. You can \nfile under chapter 7--wipe out all your debts and not have to pay \nanything. Your money goes into a pot and is divided up on a \nproportional basis to creditors, and you walk away free and clear. This \npermits a fresh start, which is a great American tradition. We are not \ntrying to eliminate that at all.\n  But there is another tradition, too. That is the tradition of chapter \n13, which in fact was first created in my home State of Alabama, in \nBirmingham, and it is still a very popular alternative there. It \nprovides the option for a debtor who wants to try to pay back his debt \nto do so. The Court approves his plan, and he pays a certain amount of \nmoney into the chapter 13 fund, and it is distributed to his debtors. \nThey give up the interest rates that they have been charging on it, and \nat least they get something back out of it. And this person is able to \nbe discharged without having filed for bankruptcy because the debts \nhave, in fact, been honored.\n  This is a procedure that I think ought to be encouraged. What we are \nfinding is that in some areas of the country almost nobody files \nchapter 13. But it is a high filing issue in Alabama. People want to \npay their debts, and they are taking this option.\n  So what this bill says is that if a person has $100,000 per year \nincome and he only owes $30,000 and he wants to file chapter 7, this \nwill give the creditors a chance to object and say, ``Judge, we think \nyou ought to review this. He doesn't need this bankruptcy. Why should \nhe be able to walk away from his debts when people who are making \n$30,000, have three kids, and are trying to get by by the skin of their \nteeth are paying their debts? Why doesn't he pay his?''\n  I think that is fundamental, and we need to get away from this \nautomatic deal in which the filer has total power to choose whether or \nnot he files under 7 or 13.\n  The bill also requires consumers to receive information concerning \ncredit counseling before filing. Many people do not know that there are \ntremendous credit counseling centers in almost every community in \nAmerica. These persons help the families. This differs from when a \ndebtor goes in to see a bankruptcy lawyer who simply has his secretary \nasks the person to fill out a form. The debtor may not even see the \nlawyer; the lawyer has probably hundreds of these cases. The secretary \nhas\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\nyou fill out a form, and he files a bankruptcy, and he hardly even \ntalks to the client. That too often happens.\n  In credit counseling, the person sits down with the credit counselor. \nThey go over their income. They talk about how they can pay that off. \nMaybe the banks or the credit card companies would reduce their \ninterest rates if the person could make regular payments and not go \ninto bankruptcy. They help them deal with problems in families such as \ngambling addiction. I have been talked to credit counseling people \nacross this country. They are telling me that gambling is a big factor \ndriving bankruptcy filings. Maybe Gamblers Anonymous would be the right \nthing for them.\n  Maybe there is a mental health problem, depression in the family or \nother things that these people who are not sophisticated in finance did \nnot know would be available to them to help them overcome their debt \nproblem. So I think that would be a great thing. It is not going to \neliminate huge numbers of filings, but I assure you, I believe we will \nhave a number of families helped by this personally, maybe marriages \nsaved. And it will help them develop a plan to pay off this debt and \navoid the stigma of bankruptcy. It would be a good thing and is an \nimportant part of this bill. I am confident of this because on my study \nof this issue. I offered an amendment to this bill which was adopted.\n  The bill also requires, during bankruptcy, that people who do declare \nbankruptcy participate in a debt management class. We found in some \ndistricts as much as 40 percent of the bankruptcy filings are by people \nwho filed bankruptcy before. We need to educate them on some basic \nprinciples of how to manage their money and hopefully they will not \ncome back again and other debts will not be abrogated.\n  This legislation would require debtors to provide more financial \ninformation, including tax returns. It provides for random audits \nrequiring referrals for possible criminal prosecution. I was a Federal \nprosecutor for 15 years and we formed a bankruptcy fraud task force to \ndeal with this problem. The truth is that there are very, very few \nbankruptcy fraud prosecutions in America. This is Federal court. We \nexpect people to be truthful in what they submit, and those who are not \nhonest must suffer criminal sanctions, or the word will get out among \nthe bankruptcy lawyers that it doesn't make any difference and that \nnothing will ever happen to you if you are not candid and truthful in \nfilling out your statements.\n  It also allows creditors to represent themselves; that is, people to \nwhom money is owed can go down to bankruptcy court to represent \nthemselves without a lawyer. The Presiding Officer here today, Senator \nGrassley, felt very strongly about that provision. And the truth is, it \nis a key issue. If you have a $500 debt owed to the garage, the \nfurniture store, the jewelry store, or whatever, you may spend that \nmuch on a lawyer to go down there and represent you. What kind of \nrelief is that, if you cannot go yourself, if you have to spend more on \ncollection than what you collect? Senator Grassley has been very \nsteadfast in believing that we need to change that situation. It is a \ngood step in this bill, because most of these matters are not that \ncomplicated. All you really need is a verified claim from the person \nwho is owed the debt.\n  So I believe this bill represents a major step forward. It is a bill \nthat seeks to lift our standards as Americans to encourage people to \npay their debts if they are able to, to train and educate them so they \nwill not get in financial trouble in the future. That is something we \nought to do, to perhaps reduce this ever-increasing spiral of \nbankruptcy filings.\n  It is a good bill. I am disappointed, shocked, and really stunned \nthat we are now at a point where we cannot even get the bill up for \ndebate and we have to deal with a filibuster and we are going to have \nto have a cloture vote on whether or not we even consider this \nlegislation. It is not controversial. It is good legislation. It is \ncarefully crafted. It is good for America. It is good public policy. It \ncalls people to a higher standard, eliminates abuse and fraud and \ncriminality, and ought to be something that will go through this \nCongress with the most minimal objections.\n  I do not know what politics are behind the objection here. Sometimes \nI think it is just a desire to keep this Congress from passing anything \nand utilizing every rule and technical objection that can be made to \nfrustrate the normal working through of good legislation. At any rate, \nI believe we will prevail on this motion, we will get the bill up, and \nI believe it will pass in this chamber as it did in the House, and then \nwe will have done something good in this Congress: We will have \nreformed a bankruptcy system that is out of control.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9951-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9955-S9956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE IRS AND BASEBALL FANS\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud St. Louis Cardinals \nbaseball fan. I have been a St. Louis Cardinals fan a lot longer than I \nhave been a U.S. Senator, and I have never been more proud of the team, \nnor of the city and the State which supports that team.\n  This weekend we saw the fabulous Mark McGwire hit home runs 60 and \n61. And it was truly electrifying, not only for the people who were in \nthe stands and watched the huge home runs--and when Mark McGwire hits a \nhome run generally it is huge. He bounced one off of the dining room of \nthe Stadium Club and it dropped back down beneath. There used to be a \ntime when people didn't even think somebody could hit the Stadium Club. \nHe has hit balls so far in Bush Stadium that they automatically start \nmeasuring them. The announcer of the Cardinal baseball games, the \nfabulous Jack Buck, talks about calling air traffic control to warn \nabout it.\n  There are a couple of things that I think need to be mentioned. No. \n1, Mark McGwire is the kind of fine human being whom we need as a role \nmodel for our young people today, when the national spirit is sagging \nand we are talking about scandals. Here is a man, the first thing he \ndid when he came to St. Louis was make a significant donation to the \nSt. Louis Children's Hospital. He is a man who worships his son. When \nhe crossed the plate after hitting his 61st home run, he picked up his \n10-year-old son. There were some who were worried that the son might be \nin danger because of his enthusiasm. But Mark McGwire is truly an \nAmerican hero.\n  I would say also the same thing for Sammy Sosa, who was in the \noutfield with the Cubs when that 61st went out. Sammy Sosa is a class \nballplayer, one we can be proud of.\n  I will tell you something else that Missouri and the Midwest and \nAmerica can be proud of, the young men who caught the home runs 60 and \n61. When they were asked, ``Are you going to sell it for a million \ndollars?'' They said, ``No, we are going to give it back to Mark \nMcGwire.'' And this selfless act, giving the ball back to the guy who \nhit it so he could give it to Cooperstown, epitomizes the spirit. The \nsigns in the stadium said ``Baseball City U.S.A.'' St. Louis is very \nproud of being Baseball City and everybody who comes in there is proud \nof it, and they are proud of the spirit of the fans who are there. But \nyou have to know, the Grinch appears.\n  Today's New York Times, classic spot for the Grinch to appear: ``Fan \nSnaring Number 62 Faces Big Tax Bite.''\n  Now, get a life. The IRS spokesman has confirmed that the person who \ngives the ball back to Mark McGwire might be facing a gift tax of \n$150,000. The young man who caught number 60 is just out of college and \nhe works in the promotion department of the Rams. The guy who caught \nnumber 61 is the catering manager who had to go to work at 4:30 this \nmorning. They are going to have to pay $150,000? Now, that is about as \nludicrous as anything I have seen. If the IRS wants to know why they \nare the most feared, disliked agency in town, this is the classic \nexample.\n  The New York Times interviewed a spokesman for the IRS who said: ``I \ncan confirm your understanding of how the gift tax works. The giver of \nthe gift is required to file a gift tax return. We'd have to take a \nlook at all the circumstances: the value of the gift and who owns the \nbaseball.''\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\n  I am asking my colleagues to join me in a letter to the Commissioner \nof the IRS. We come here as Democrats and Republicans, but I know there \nis a strong, bipartisan enthusiasm for the support of baseball. And for \nthe Commission to tolerate somebody saying that a fan who gives the \nball back to Mark McGwire could owe a $150,000 gift tax is outrageous.\n  The IRS needs to lighten up. The fact that the Tax Code could allow \nfor such a ridiculous thing is one thing. We are going to be tackling \nthe issue of tax reform in Congress. We have done much on the Taxpayer \nRelief Act. We have made strides. The new Commissioner has talked about \nmaking the IRS a consumer-friendly agency, but it is absolutely \nridiculous that the IRS would seriously consider imposing a tax on a \ngenerous fan who happens to catch the historic ball and return it. Get \na life. Surely there are baseball fans among the clever lawyers and \naccountants at the IRS who can devise reasons why this good deed should \ngo unpunished. My staff and I are available to work with them. I think \nwe can find a way to take care of it.\n  But if the IRS wants to know what their problems are, they have to \nlook no further than this threat. I have to tell you that if you do not \nthink people are paying attention, our e-mail has been running, our fax \nmachine; the calls are coming in.\n  Dean Pfeiffer of Lee's Summit said:\n\n       What a better issue to use to highlight the need for tax \n     reform. How can anyone defend a tax system that penalizes \n     such a selfless act?\n\n  Scot George said:\n\n       This tax on this person is as unAmerican as Saddam Hussein. \n     I urge you to act swiftly against the IRS on this matter.\n\n  Mr. President, I warn you, there is a revolution brewing. There may \nnot be enough agents to collect a gift tax from somebody who returns \nthe 62nd baseball back to Mark McGwire.\n  I do have a letter here to Commissioner Rossotti asking him to review \nthis situation and clarify it so that when the fan catches the ball--we \nknow he is going to be surrounded by security. The security is very \ntight to make sure he is not physically abused. And it is a jungle out \nthere when people are going for the ball. We have security to protect \nhim. We want to keep the IRS agents off of him.\n  I say to my colleagues, if they wish to join me in signing this \nletter to the Commissioner to call this serious matter to his \nattention, I will have it today and it will be available for them to do \nso. I think that the time has come to say that a fan who catches a \nhistoric home run ball and gives it back to the guy who hit it should \nnot be stuck by the IRS.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, I want to compliment the Senator from \nMissouri for his comments. He, along with me and Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska, was very much in the middle of the work of the IRS commission \nas representatives of the Senate on that commission, and also working \nwith the legislation as members of the Finance Committee to bring about \nthe consumer-friendly IRS that the legislation is supposed to do.\n  Obviously, I am chagrined that there is still an attitude within the \nIRS that would be interpreting tax law the way that the Senator from \nMissouri has described it. I think he has accurately described it, \nbecause this morning when I was preparing to come to work I heard on \nWTOP the very news story to which the Senator from Missouri refers. I \ncould only think in terms of, well, maybe it is a joke. Obviously, it \nis not a joke.\n  But I also thought in terms of Mr. Rossotti, the Commissioner of \nInternal Revenue, had to be hearing that same report as we did. And \nbefore he got to the office, I hope that he had made some phone calls \nto make sure that this erroneous interpretation of law would be \ncorrected, because that is what I would expect from Mr. Rossotti.\n  To the Senator from Missouri, I will be glad to sign the letter that \nhe has. I would also hope that Mr. Rossotti has this situation taken \ncare of before the letter is received from the Senator from Missouri.\n  Also, I would expect that the Senator from Missouri expects Mr. \nRossotti, who is not a tax attorney and who was hired specifically by \nthe President of the United States because he came from the business \nworld, from an organization and a business that he formulated that was \nonly successful because he was able to satisfy his consumers--he built \nhis organization from a few employees to several thousand employees. He \nwas willing to give this up because he knew that the challenge of \nmaking the IRS a more consumer-friendly organization was a legitimate \nchallenge that had to be met, and he was willing to do that.\n  So I see in Mr. Rossotti a person who is going to get this taken care \nof very quickly so we do not have to worry that when that 62nd home run \nis hit by McGwire that there is going to be a tax consequence as a \nresult of hitting the 62nd home run.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I withhold that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator could yield me \nsome time. I do not know what the situation is on the floor right now.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we are to recess at \n12:30, and the Senator from Iowa has time on the bankruptcy bill.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I yield, I think the thing to do--how much time \nis left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have until 12:30.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will speak for 5 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9955-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9956-S9957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, farmers continue to suffer huge losses \nthrough absolutely no fault of their own. No other business has less \ncontrol of the price they can receive for what they produce, the cost \nof the inputs. Farmers cannot control the weather. They cannot control \nthe world economy. They cannot control what is happening in Asia. But \nthose factors do determine the price of corn, soybeans, wheat, and \nother commodities. The Freedom to Farm bill passed in 1996 sharply \nreduced the farmer's safety net to take care of those contingencies \nover which the farmer has no control.\n  Now farm prices are crashing to levels not seen in decades. Many \nfarmers are going to have a difficult time acquiring funds needed to \npay their bills this year and to get the necessary money to get the \nfields prepared and to get the seed and the fertilizer to get the crops \nin the ground for next year.\n  Many farmers could lose their farms that have been in their families \nfor generations. I recently talked with an older farmer who said, \n``That's my life's savings. I made it through the eighties. I'm a good \nmanager. I weathered that terrible storm in the eighties. And now this \nmay wipe me out after a lifetime of work.''\n  I am sure the Senator from Alabama knows. He has a lot of farmers in \nhis State. There is the old adage that farmers live poor and die rich. \nThey have all that money in that land. That is their retirement system. \nThey work hard all of their lives. They do not live high on the hog. \nThen it comes time to retire. That is their equity. And now that is \nbeing severely eroded, not to mention the young farmers who have gotten \nstarted, carrying a debtload who will be really forced out of \nagriculture, never to return.\n  Well, it is already having a terrible ripple effect, not only on \nfarms but in small towns and communities all over America. Layoffs are \nstarting to occur at agricultural equipment manufacturing companies and \nin stores. I think we are just beginning to see the stages of what \ncould become a very severe downturn in rural America.\n  Last week, a number of Senators and I proposed a series of \nmodifications in ag programs to help alleviate the problem. But I take \nthe floor this morning to say that I believe Congress should also pass \na provision broadening existing tax law that will allow farmers to \nrecover taxes paid in the past to cover their net operating losses \nright now.\n  Mr. President, under existing law, businesses, including farmers, can \nbe\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\nreimbursed for their business losses by receiving a rebate for taxes \npaid in the prior 2 years--or 3 years in cases in which there is a \nnatural disaster. Well, we are facing a large economic disaster that \ncan really sink us in rural America.\n  What I am proposing--and I will be shortly introducing a bill to do \nso--I propose that family farmers be allowed the option to get a rebate \nfrom the taxes that they paid over the past 10 years, covering up to \n$200,000 in operating losses rather than the 2 years that is allowed \nunder current law.\n  Many farmers cannot receive a rebate for their operating losses \nbecause they were not able to make any taxable profits in the last \ncouple of years. By being able to go back 10 years, we will allow these \nfarmers to be able to get a rebate next year and then limit it to \n$200,000 so it would be available to all family farms, up to a limit of \n$200,000 in net operating losses.\n  The benefit would only go to farmers whose families are actively \nengaged in farming and whose business activity is mostly farming. The \namount of the rebate would be dependent on the amount of the loss and \nthe tax rate paid by farmers for the paid taxes that are being \nrestored.\n  The provision I am proposing would cover losses occurring in both \n1998 or 1999.\n  If passed this year, farmers would be able to calculate their losses \nearly next year and receive a rebate from the IRS for the taxes paid in \nearlier years very soon thereafter. This proposal would provide a \nsignificant amount of relief when it is needed early next year. It \nwould help many farmers acquire the funds they need, as I said, to get \nthe fields prepared and get the feed and fertilizer and bills paid so \nthey can continue on next year.\n  I might add that there is some precedent for this. There was a case \nin 1997 where Amtrak was allowed to use net operating losses of their \npredecessor railroads going back over 20 years in the past. So there is \nprecedent for this. If we can do it for Amtrak, I think certainly we \nought to be able to do it for our family farmers. I am hopeful at some \npoint this fall either under a tax bill, if we are going to have one, \nor under some other vehicle, that we can at least put this provision \nin.\n  I know my colleague from Iowa has another provision that would allow \nfarmers to invest some of their profits for up to 5 years without being \ntaxed until the money is used in poorer years, which is a great \nprovision, one I also hope gets through.\n  Right now, the farmers are facing the fact that they don't have any \nmoney. I think maybe the two coupled together will get them some funds. \nIf they went ahead and invested and used a provision of my colleague \nfrom Iowa, we might have a situation to help get some of the farmers \nthrough the next couple of years.\n  I just wanted to bring that to the attention of Senators. I hope to \nbe introducing that very shortly. Again, I don't mean to belabor it, \nbut we are seeing really bad times out there. I used these charts last \nweek. I will use them again in case other Senators may be watching that \ndidn't watch last week. Since July 16, wheat, corn, and soybeans are \nall down--I used central Illinois only as a measuring point--21 percent \ndecline in the past 6 weeks in corn, 21 percent decline in soybeans in \nthe last 6 weeks, and a 13 percent decline in the past 6 weeks in hard \nred winter wheat in Kansas City. We see no signs this will be \nalleviated any time soon. It looks like we will have a record crop of \nsoybeans this year, a record crop, and probably the second or third \nlargest corn crop we have ever had. So this will be hanging over the \nmarketplace. We need to do everything we can.\n  Again, I hope that we will have some provisions very soon that will \nremove the caps on the loan rates and even provide emergency provisions \nfor the Secretary to be able to pay storage payments to farmers, to \nstore some of that grain so that they don't have to dump it this fall. \nThey can keep it until next year. Maybe the Asian economy will come \nback; maybe there won't be very good weather next year, whatever; maybe \nthe prices will come back next year. Let the farmer have the freedom to \nmarket that grain at some point down the line rather than just dumping \nit on the market this year.\n  There are other provisions that we will be talking about, but I think \nthose are the major ones that will help get us through a very, very \ndifficult year in agriculture and all over the world.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding me the time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9956-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RECESS UNTIL 2:15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Domenici, and the people of New Mexico;\n       Whereas Angela combined exceptional professional and \n     organizational skills, untiring initiative, and unlimited \n     compassion to accomplish both major, and simply thoughtful, \n     tasks for the Senator and his constituents;\n       Whereas Angela has always generously given of herself out \n     of a genuine love and concern for others, without hesitation \n     or expectation of reward;\n       Whereas Angela has had an impressive career beginning \n     during World War II in the Navy Department, office of Admiral \n     S.C.

Mr. President, we have just adopted a resolution paying \nour respects, without any doubt in my mind, to one of the most \nwonderful women who has worked in the Senate, Angela Raish. She has \nworked in my office for 21 years. Many hundreds of people in the Senate \nand many thousands out in my State and around the Nation know her as \none of the best women who has ever served in this institution. She \nserved this Senator well, but in doing that, she also has helped \nliterally hundreds of people who none of us are even aware of. We are \ngoing to pay tribute to her later in the week with an event here in the \nSenate, and there will be a lot of people who will come to say thank \nyou to Angela.\n  I wanted to take with us to that event this resolution where the \nSenate recognized her 21-year effort. The resolution accurately depicts \nmuch about her life and what she has accomplished, the many outstanding \njobs she has held, and obviously the longest tenure in my office \nworking for the Senate.

Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nthe Chair to lay before the Senate Calendar No. 440, S. 2237, the \nfiscal year 1999 Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2237) making appropriations for the Department \n     of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to bring before the \nSenate the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal \nYear 1999. The bill provides $13.4 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for agencies and programs under the subcommittee's \njurisdiction, an increase of $265 million above the FY 98 freeze level, \nbut $660 million less than the President's budget request.\n  As always, putting this bill together has been a great challenge. The \nsubcommittee received more than 2,000 individual requests from Senators \nregarding particular projects or programs, the majority of which were \nrequests for additions to the President's budget request, which I have \nalready mentioned is well in excess of the amounts available to the \nSubcommittee. While Senator Stevens has been as generous with the \nInterior Subcommittee as I could reasonably expect him to be given the \nconstraints of the discretionary spending caps, the subcommittee's \nallocation is such that the FY 1999 bill in large part continues \nprograms at or near the current year level. There are significant, but \nmodest, increases for a handful of high priority programs, but for the \nmost part there are few surprises or dramatic new funding initiatives.\n  As Members consider whether particular programs in this bill have \nbeen treated fairly within the constraints of the subcommittee's \nallocation, I hope they will consider two factors. First, for the first \ntime since Fiscal Year 1995, this bill does not mandate a sale of oil \nfrom the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay for the costs of operating \nthe reserve. An oil sale at current price levels would be unwise to say \nthe least. But the fact that this bill does not include an oil sale \nmeans that the Subcommittee had to find $155 million for operation of \nthe Reserve that was not included in last year's base. As a \nconsequence, the increase in the Subcommittee's allocation is \neffectively only $110 million above the freeze level.\n  The second factor of which I want my colleagues to be aware when \nevaluating this bill is the impact of increases in Federal pay, \nbenefits and other fixed costs. The Interior bill as a whole is one of \nthe most personnel-intensive of the appropriations bills, supporting \ntens of thousands of park rangers, foresters, Indian health \nprofessionals and other Federal workers. Each year the agencies funded \nin this bill must accommodate increases in pay and benefits for these \nworkers, and similar cost increases over which the Subcommittee has no \ndirect control. In FY 1999, these ``uncontrollable costs'' will amount \nto more than $200 million.\n  Lest any of my colleagues feel these costs are attributable to a \nbloated bureaucracy, I note that Department of the Interior staffing in \nWashington, D.C. is 17% below its 1993 base--despite a significant \nexpansion since that time in the number of parks, refuges, and other \nInterior programs, most of which have been authorized by Congress. This \n17% reduction is the second greatest among all civilian cabinet \nagencies. While the Subcommittee continues to seek efficiencies and to \nterminate wasteful programs, yearly increases in pay and related costs \nfor core Federal employees continue to consume most or all of any \nincreases that the Subcommittee may receive in its allocation.\n  Having noted two of the major factors impacting funding levels in \nthis year's bill, I want to highlight some priority programs where we \nwere able to provide modest--but significant--increases. The bill \nincludes a $55 million increase for operation of the national park \nsystem, including increases over the current year level of $18 million \nfor park maintenance, $15 million for special need parks, and $10 \nmillion for an\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\nacross-the-board increase in park operations. These increases will \nbenefit all parks, but particularly those units with severe operational \nshortfalls and critical deficiencies in maintenance funding. The bill \nalso provides a $10.6 million increase in refuge operations and \nmaintenance, which follows a $41 million increase provided in last \nyear's bill.\n  For the Forest Service, this bill places a heavy emphasis on \nimproving accountability within the agency. A number of General \nAccounting Office reports and various Congressional hearings have \nclearly demonstrated that the Forest Service lacks the fundamental \nability to account for its expenditures, and has shown a growing level \nof overhead and indirect expenses that corresponds with a decline in \non-the-ground accomplishment. I am disturbed by these problems, but at \nthe same time am wary of overreacting by mandating controls that may be \ncounterproductive. I do see indications that the agency is determined \nto address its accountability problem.\n  With these considerations in mind, I have included language in the \nbill to require increased accountability by eliminating the general \nadministration line item, and requiring the Forest Service to display \nclearly the source of funds that go to overhead and other indirect \nexpenses. We have also consolidated three budget line items, where \nmaintenance functions are performed along with other work, into two \ndistinct line items where only maintenance, reconstruction and \nconstruction activities occur. I hope that actions such as this, along \nwith commitment from top Forest Service officials, will help the agency \nto institute proper management controls and clean up its accountability \nmess.\n  The other major Forest Service initiative in this bill deals with the \namount of timber the Forest Service will be expected to offer for sale. \nIn 1990, the Forest Service offered for sale approximately 11 billion \nboard feet of timber. In fiscal year 1999, the Administration proposes \nto offer only 3.4 billion board feet. That's a 69% reduction. Many of \nmy colleagues know first hand the devastating effect that this reduced \ntimber program has had on timber dependent communities. With timber \ngrowth rates far in excess of 10 billion board feet per year, it is \nunconscionable that the administration proposes a timber offer level of \nless than one-third of that amount. Accordingly, the Committee has \nprovided additional funding, and expects the Forest Service to sell \napproximately 3.6 billion board feet of timber in fiscal year 1999. \nThis amount is 200 million board feet more than proposed by the \nadministration, but about 200 million board feet less than the fiscal \nyear 1998 level. I also want to note that this 3.6 billion board feet \nfigure is a correction of the 3.784 billion board feet figure \nincorrectly included in the Committee report.\n  The bill also includes $10 million for the administration's \nMillennium initiative for historic preservation projects of national \nimportance. Due to the constraints of the Subcommittee's allocation and \na general aversion to beginning new programs, I had not intended to \nprovide funds for the Millennium program. But I found the Millennium \nprogram's primary advocate --the First Lady--to be very persuasive when \nshe called me at the urging of Senator Bumpers. I look forward to \nworking with her to define better how these funds might be used. To \nbalance the increase provided for historic preservation projects on a \nnational level, the bill also includes a 20 percent $6 million increase \nfor the existing grants-to-States program in the Historic Preservation \nFund account.\n  The bill also includes funds for a number of specific historic \npreservation projects, including $3 million for the Smithsonian \nInstitution for rehabilitation of the Star Spangled Banner. This \nappropriation will complement non-federal funds that have been pledged \nfor this project by the Pew Charitable Trusts, and most recently by \nRalph Lauren. The bill also provides funds to continue construction of \nthe National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall, and to continue \nrenovation of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n  For the agency that receives perhaps more attention than any other in \nthis bill--the National Endowment for the Arts--the bill provides just \nover $100 million. This is precisely the same funding level as was \napproved by the Senate last year, but a slight increase over the final \nappropriation. I also note that the bill continues the several reforms \nthat were agreed to during deliberations on the fiscal year 1998 bill, \nincluding restrictions on individual grants, subgrants, and seasonal \nsupport; limitations on total grants to any one State, and increased \nemphasis on arts education and programs for under served populations. \nWith the House having voted by a substantial margin to provide level \nfunding for the NEA, the gap to be bridged in conference will be far \nnarrower than it was last year. The National Endowment for the \nHumanities is funded at $110.7 million in the Senate bill, the same as \nthe fiscal year 1998 level.\n  For the Indian Programs that comprise approximately 30 percent of the \nInterior bill, the biggest challenge for the Committee was to attempt \nto fill the gaping hole left by the administration's budget request for \nthe Indian Health Service. Facing the challenges of a deteriorating \ninfrastructure, increasing service population growth, and a relatively \nhigh rate of inflation in the medical services sector, the Indian \nHealth Service was nevertheless the only major Interior bill agency \nthat did not share in the bounty of the administration's inflated \nbudget request.\n  The Committee has provided a $53 million increase for the Indian \nHealth Service, $34 million more than the budget request. This includes \nmore than $16 million to staff newly completed health facilities--an \nitem for which the administration inexplicably did not request funding. \nThe amount provided also includes funds to cover a modest portion of \nIHS's fixed cost increases, which the administration also did not \ninclude in its budget.\n  To some extent the increase provided for the Indian Health Service \ncomes at the expense of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Although the bill \ndoes provide a $15 million increase for the Operation of Indian \nPrograms account, the overall BIA budget is essentially flat. But even \nif the resources available to the Subcommittee were less constrained, I \nthink it would be imprudent to provide a significant increase for the \nlargest of BIA programs--Tribal Priority Allocations--until we develop \na more rational means of allocating TPA funds. As it stands, some $757 \nmillion in TPA funds are distributed in a manner that ignores the \nrelative financial health and needs of the recipient Tribes.\n  Though its history is difficult to trace, the current allocation \nsystem seems to have been developed piecemeal over a period of decades \nthrough a combination of departmental, tribal and congressional \nactions. Each of these individual actions may have made perfect sense \nat the time at which it was taken. But their cumulative effect has been \nto create a system in which a number of quite wealthy tribes receive \nfar greater per capita TPA allocations than some of the most destitute \ntribes. While I cannot imagine that such a system would ever be seen as \nappropriate, it is almost offensive in a time when Federal \nappropriations are severely constrained by balanced budget \nrequirements, and when a number of tribes are profiting quite \nhandsomely from business ventures such as gaming.\n  The bill before the Senate attempts to address this inequity by \nmandating that the BIA identify the top 10 percent of tribes in terms \nof per capita tribal revenue, and directing the BIA to distribute half \nof the TPA payments that would have gone to those tribes to the 20 \npercent of tribes with the lowest per capita tribal revenue. The bill \nalso directs BIA to develop possible formulas for the future \ndistribution of TPA funds, and gives the Bureau authority to collect \nthe information required to develop such formulas.\n  I recognize, that this is not a perfect solution. Many have expressed \nconcerns about the manner in which funds are proposed for distribution \nin FY 1999, the extent to which BIA should be authorized to collect \nfinancial information from the tribes, and the degree to which tribes \nthemselves should be involved in the reallocation process. But few, if \nany, have argued that the current distribution system is either just or \na wise use of taxpayer dollars. I have had extensive discussions about \nthis issue with the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Mr. Kevin \nGover, as\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\nwell as with Senator Campbell, Senator Inouye and other interested \ncolleagues. I am pleased that these discussions have resulted in \nalternative language that I believe will have widespread support and \ncan be adopted as an amendment to this bill. The new language permits \nthe wealthiest tribes to return voluntarily Tribal Priority Allocations \nto the BIA for redistribution to the neediest. However, the substitute \nlanguage does not diminish the Federal Government's trust \nresponsibilities or that tribe's ability to access future \nappropriations. In addition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs is directed \nto develop, within Congressionally mandated obligations, a new method \nfor distributing TPA funds by April 1, 1999. Finally, the substitute \nlanguage excludes from the redistribution plan payments made by the \nFederal Government in settlement of claims and judgments and income \nderived from lands, natural resources, or funds held in trust by the \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  Mr. President, in this bill there are a number of other legislative \nprovisions and limitations on the use of funds about which my \ncolleagues may have heard. The administration and its advisors in the \nenvironmental community have evidently decided to attack these \nprovisions en masse, arguing that they represent ``stealth'' or ``dark \nof night'' attacks on the environment by Republicans. This tells me \nthree things. First, the administration is reluctant to argue any one \nof these issues on its merits. Second, the administration has not been \npaying attention in any of the dozens of Congressional hearings that \nhave been held on these issues, the vast majority of which included \nadministration witnesses. And third, the administration is either \nunaware of, or is choosing to ignore, the historic oversight role of \nthe Appropriations Committee under the leadership of both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  There are indeed several legislative provisions and limitations on \nthe use of funds in this year's Interior bill. There are a few more \nsuch provisions than were in the Senate version of the bill last year, \nbut fewer than in the final FY 1997 Act. Some of the provisions have \nbeen inserted at the request of fellow Republicans. Some, such as the \nmining patent moratorium and the moratoria on offshore oil and gas \ndevelopment, are included at the request of the administration or my \nDemocratic colleagues. These provisions are inserted in appropriations \nbills for one of several reasons, Mr. President. Some are included to \naddress critical health and safety issues that require immediate \nattention. The King Cove road provision falls into this category. Other \nprovisions are included because they are an integral part of the \nCommittee's fiscal oversight role. The provision regarding distribution \nof TPA funds falls into this category, as does a provision in the bill \nthat provides for the orderly termination of the overpriced and out of \ncontrol Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project.\n  But perhaps the single most common reason that legislative provisions \nand limitations on the use of funds are included in this bill is the \noverzealous use of regulatory powers by the executive branch without \nthe adequate involvement of Congress or the public. This is the dynamic \nthat has prompted any number of such provisions, from the moratoria on \noffshore oil and gas development that are included in this bill year \nafter year, to the provision in this year's bill that requires a \ncomprehensive study of regulations governing mining on public lands. If \nit seems that there are more limitations on the use of funds in this \nbill than there have been in the past, it is very likely because this \nadministration has made a conscious decision not to engage Congress in \na constructive dialogue on a whole array of critically needed reforms \nto insensitive land management decisions, and has instead decided to \npress the top-down, Washington, D.C.-knows-best agenda of its extremist \nenvironmental allies through the use of Executive orders and over broad \nregulatory actions that in some cases are downright insulting to me as \na member of the legislative branch.\n  In about every case, these riders have the support of all--or a vast \nmajority of--the members of the House and Senate in the districts and \nStates to which they apply. Generally speaking, Members of both bodies \ndefer to judgment of the Members affected by regional policies and \nissues. This administration, however, constantly demands the right to \noverride the views of Members immediately affected, and their \nconstituents, with a constant and pervasive ``DC knows best'' attitude. \nIn any debate over these issues, I ask my colleagues to listen with \ncare and sympathy to the Members whose constituents lives are so often \narrogantly ignored by unelected bureaucrats.\n  If the administration or any Member of the Senate wishes to discuss \nor debate the merits of any individual provision in this bill, I am \nwilling to do so. But I find it ludicrous--if not offensive--for the \nAdministration simply to lump every provision it finds the least bit \ninconvenient onto one list of so-called ``objectionable riders,'' \ncondemn the use of such provisions as some new and nefarious practice, \nand to demand that all such provisions be removed under threat of a \nveto. I fully anticipate some give and take with the administration as \nthis bill moves through conference, but it is not the job of the Senate \nsimply to approve administration requests for funding and trust that it \nwill be spent wisely and in accordance with the intent of Congress. We \nhave plenty of experience to the contrary, both with the current and \nprevious administrations.\n  Finally, I want to address an issue about which I am asked \npersistently, and that is the disposition of the $699 million `special' \nappropriation for land acquisition included in the FY 1998 bill. My \ncolleagues may recall that $362 million of those funds remain to be \nallocated to specific projects. That allocation will be made by \nagreement of the House and Senate committees, and will be transmitted \nto the administration by letter. I have had several discussions with \nChairman Regula about this issue, and hope that we--together with \nSenator Byrd and Congressman Yates--can agree on an allocation of at \nleast half of these funds in the very near future. I unfortunately \ncannot now say exactly when this allocation will be finalized, but I am \nconfident that it will be soon, and that we will do our best to balance \nthe priorities of the Senate, the House and the administration.\n  On a personal level, I want to say one final thank you--for the \nrecord--to Sue Masica, who has for years been Senator Byrd's clerk for \nthe Interior Subcommittee. Sue has been a tremendous resource for me \nand my staff, and I can say with great confidence has also been of \nassistance at one time or another to just about every Member in this \nChamber, whether that Member knew it or not. Sue is now the Associate \nDirector of Administration for the National Park Service, a position in \nwhich I know she will excel. I wish her the very best. I also want to \nrecognize Sue's replacement--Kurt Dodd--and welcome him to the \nCommittee staff.\n  On my personal staff, I thank Chuck Berwick, Kari Vander Stoep, and \nTodd Young for their many contributions to this bill. I also thank \nBruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Hank Kashdan, Leif \nFonnesbeck, Kevin Johnson, and our detailee Mary Ellen Mueller for \ntheir hard work and long hours spent on this bill. I also thank Carole \nGeagley and Craig Leff of Senator Byrd's staff, and Steve Cortese, Jim \nEnglish and Jay Kimmitt of the full committee staff for their many \ncourtesies and willing assistance given to me and my staff.\n  With that, I look forward to hearing from my friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Department of \nInterior and Related Agencies. I speak in support of the fiscal year \n1999 interior appropriations bill. This is an important bill which \nprovides for the management of our Nation's natural resources and funds \nresearch critical to our energy future. It supports the well-being of \nour Indian populations and protects the historical and cultural \nheritage of our country. I hope the Senate will move swiftly through \nthe bill.\n  It has been my privilege, Mr. President, to serve as the Ranking \nMember for this bill at the side of our very able Chairman, the senior \nSenator from Washington. Senator Gorton has done\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\nan outstanding job in crafting the bill and balancing its many \ncompeting interests, and crafting the Interior bill is not an easy \ntask. The Interior bill remains one of the most popular appropriation \nbills, funding a diverse set of very worthy programs and projects. The \nbill is full of thousands of relatively small, yet very meaningful \ndetails. Our Chairman is a master of the complexities of the bill, and \nit is a pleasure to work on this appropriations bill with Senator \nGorton. He has treated Senators fairly and openly. This bill was put \ntogether in a bipartisan manner, and it reflects priorities identified \nby many Senators, by the public, and by the agencies that are charged \nwith carrying out the programs and projects funded in the bill.\n  The breadth of the activities covered by the Interior bill is vast--\nranging from museums to parks to hospitals to resources to research--\nwith most of the funds being spent far away from the Capitol and far \naway from Washington. This bill funds hundreds of national parks, \nwildlife refuges, national forests, and other land management units. \nThe bill supports more than 400 Indian hospitals and clinics and \nthousands of Indian students. A wide variety of natural science and \nenergy research and technology development is funded through this bill, \nproviding immediate and far-reaching benefits to all parts of our \ncountry and to our society as a whole.\n  This bill makes its presence known in every State--from the rocky \ncoasts of Maine to the mountains of California, from the coral reefs of \nFlorida to the farflung island territories of the Pacific, from the \nAleutian Islands in Alaska to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. And \nthe number of requests that Senator Gorton and I have received from \nSenators for project funding in the Interior bill numbers more than \n1,400--1,400 requests for specific items. This reflects its broad \nimpact. While it is impossible to include every request, Senator Gorton \nhas done an admirable job of accommodating high-priority items within \nthe allocation, an allocation that is $660 million below the \nPresident's budget request and $290 million below last year's enacted \nlevel in new spending authority. Since the bill is at its allocation, \nany additional funding sought by Senators will need to be offset.\n  Mr. President, highlights of this bill include:\n  A total of $233 million for land acquisition, which is $37 million \nbelow the President's request and $38 million below the level of \nfunding included in title I and title II of last year's bill for land \nacquisition.\n  A continuing emphasis on operating and protecting our national parks. \nPark operation funds are increased by $55 million, including $15 \nmillion targeted for the special operations initiative, $10 million for \nan across-the-board increase for all parks, and $14 million for \nmaintenance.\n  A total of $10 million for the President's Millennium initiative, \n``Save America's Treasures.'' In addition, specific funding for \ncritical historical and cultural resources is contained in the normal \nfunding categories--items such as restoration of the Star Spangled \nBanner at the Smithsonian Institution, presevation of Independence \nNational Historical Park in Philadelphia, protection of buildings at \nthe Edison National Historic Site, and stabilization and protection of \nthe Longfellow National Historic Site.\n  A continuing focus on the maintenance backlog needs of the land \nmanagement agencies. Specific increases include: +$6 million for BLM \nfacilities maintenance; +$10 million for FWS refuge operations and \nmaintenance; +$18 million for NPS maintenance; and +$13 million for \nForest Service road maintenance.\n  A total of $155 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing \noperation of the reserve without selling any of its oil.\n  An increase of $45 million above the President's request for the \nIndian Health Services program to help cover fixed costs. The \nadministration's budget gave no consideration to these needs for IHS.\n  A net increase of $35 million for energy conservation programs--\nincluding increases for weatherization assistance, the building \nequipment and materials program, the industry sector programs, and the \ntransportation programs.\n  Mr. President, while this bill provides needed resources for \nprotecting some of our Nation's most valuable treasures, we still have \na long way to go. The agencies funded through this bill are starting to \nmake progress towards addressing their backlog maintenance issues, \nthanks in great measure to the leadership of the Congress, the \nexpansion of private-public partnerships, and the development of \ninnovative user fees.\n  But we are by no means out of the woods. Many deplorable conditions \nremain; many important resource and research needs are unmet. We must \ncontinue our vigilance towards unnecessary new initiatives as well as \nunwise decreases, our support for the basic programs that provide the \nfoundation of the Interior bill, and our careful stewardship of the \nresources and assets placed in our trust.\n  Mr. President, the chairman and manager of the bill has already \nstated for the record many of the salient points that are covered in \nthe bill, many of the items, many of the programs and projects. There \nis no need for my repeating them here.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I extend a warm word of appreciation to the \nstaff that have assisted the chairman and myself in our work on this \nbill. They work as a team and serve both of us, as well as all \nSenators, in a very effective and dedicated manner. On the majority \nside, the staff members are Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, \nLeif Fonnesbeck, Mary Ellen Mueller, and Kevin Johnson. On my staff, \nSue Masica, Kurt Dodd, Craig Leff, and Carole Geagley have worked on \nthe Interior bill this year. This team works under the tutelage of the \nstaff directors of the full committee--Steve Cortese for the majority \nand Jim English for the minority.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to share my deep appreciation for \nthe wonderful words that members of the subcommittee and full committee \nhave spoken about Sue Masica, the minority clerk for the bill, who \nrecently accepted a position with the National Park Service. Sue was \nthe best of the best. She will be sorely missed by myself and by the \nother Senators. Her dedication, acumen, and team spirit epitomize the \nSenate and the appropriations process.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill, and I urge the Senate to complete \nits action promptly. And I urge all Senators to support the bill in its \nfinal passage.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3541\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Jeffords \n     and Mr. Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered 3541.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       ``Sec.  . Up to $10 million of funds available in fiscal \n     years 1998 and 1999 shall be available for matching grants, \n     not covering more than 50 percent of the total cost of any \n     acquisition to be made with such funds, to States and local \n     communities for purposes of acquiring lands or interests in \n     lands to preserve and protect Civil War battlefield sites \n     identified in the July 1993 Report on the Nation's Civil War \n     Battlefields prepared by the Civil War Sites Advisory \n     Commission. Lands or interests in lands acquired pursuant to \n     this section shall be subject to the requirements of \n     paragraph 6(f)(3) of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act \n     of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-8(f)(3)).''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, last year about this time during the \ndebate on this bill, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, and \nthe Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, proposed an amendment to \nearmark certain amounts of money for the preservation and protection of \nCivil War battlefield sites. At that point, while as a Civil War buff I \ngreatly sympathize with them, we didn't know where the earmark would \ncome from. It is now possible in this bill to meet the most worthy \ngoals of that pair of bipartisan Senators.\n  This amendment earmarks up to $10 million of both fiscal year 1998 \nand 1999 money--$10 million total--for matching grants for up to 50 \npercent of the total cost of any such acquisition with\n\n[[Page S9962]]\n\nStates and local communities and private entities based on a July 1993 \nreport of the Nation's Civil War battlefields prepared by the Civil War \nSites Advisory Commission. So it means that there will be more leverage \nfor the acquisition of various Civil War battle sites, mostly, I think, \non secondary battles.\n  It is a highly worthy proposal. I very much favor it. At the same \ntime, the majority leader, feeling that the Senate absolutely needs to \ndo its business, and because as is usual and customary, unfortunately, \nat the beginning of debate over appropriations bills, we don't get \npeople down here to offer their amendments, he has asked me to move to \ntable the amendment and to take a vote on that. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I move to table the amendment and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At the moment there is not a sufficient \nsecond.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the moment, one of the sponsors being \nhere, I withdraw the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Motion withdrawn.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and \nagainst the motion to table. This amendment was worked on by many of us \nwho sincerely believe that the future of this Nation must rely, to a \ncertain extent, on our good understanding of the past and of history \nand of the battles that this Nation fought in its infancy--basically, \nthe Civil War battlefields.\n  As we approach the next millennium, many of these battlefields are \nvery critical in understanding the history of the Civil War. And in \nunderstanding the sacrifices made by so many Americans, Senator \nTorricelli, myself and others, with the great cooperation of the \nSenator from Washington, worked out a plan where we could raise a \nsufficient amount of money to really work with States and local \ngovernments to be able to take care of and preserve those battlefields \nthat are so important in understanding the history of the Civil War.\n  So I have opposed the motion to table and support very strongly the \nunderlying amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 3541. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. \nChafee), the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Grams), the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Gregg), the Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), the \nSenator from Idaho (Mr. Kempthorne), and the Senator from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Santorum) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I have a series of amendments that we may \nbe able to deal with soon, none of which will be particularly \ncontroversial. The Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, does have a \ndifferent subject to which he would like to speak shortly. I intend to \ndefer to him on that.\n  But the important message to all of our colleagues, the message in \neffect given by this last vote, is this is an important appropriations \nbill. It is, in fact, controversial. We have a list of perhaps 60 \namendments that are likely to come up on it at one point or another. \nMembers should, I hope, be prepared to come to the floor of the Senate \nwith those amendments and have them considered in an orderly fashion \nunder which there is a reasonable amount of time for debate rather than \nto crowd them up against the end of the debate on this bill.\n  It may very well be that later on in the afternoon we will have an \namendment on this bill on an entirely different and very controversial \nsubject, which will then essentially take us off of the Interior bill. \nBefore that takes place, however, the managers of the bill would be \nvery pleased to deal with amendments that relate to the bill itself. I \nask Members to come to the floor with those amendments.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Thompson pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2445 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I hope within a few minutes to have a few \ncorrective amendments to offer to the bill, but seeing no one with an \namendment on the floor at the present time, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have spoken to the subcommittee Chair \nwho is managing the appropriations bill that is now on the floor and \nhave asked him if it is all right if I speak in morning business for a \nfew minutes. If someone comes to the floor with an amendment on this \nbill, if he will signal to\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\nme, I will certainly discontinue so he may continue making progress on \nthe bill.\n  I want to speak about the agriculture crisis briefly, and I ask \nunanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9958-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9963-S9964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AGRICULTURE CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have a number of things to complete and \nto discuss and debate in the coming 5 or 6 weeks before this Congress \nfinishes its work. Many of them are very important. The work of the \nAppropriations Committee in getting the appropriations bills done on a \ntimely basis is critically important. All of us understand that. I am \nhere today to talk about one specific issue that must be addressed. It \nis an issue that must be addressed on an urgent basis by this Congress \nbefore it completes its work in the 105th Congress. The issue is the \nfarm crisis that exists in rural America.\n\n  I come from a rural State, the State of North Dakota, which is the \nsize of 10 Massachusetts in landmass. It has 640,000 residents, and 40 \nto 50 percent of our State's economy comes from agriculture, and our \nsystem of family farming. I have spoken on the floor at some length \nabout the problems and challenges we face these days.\n  In the last year, family farmers in our State suffered a 98-percent \ndrop in net farm income. Yes, I said a 98-percent loss of their net \nincome. Now, these are families who have elected, for a variety of \nreasons, to populate rural America. They own a farm. They raise \nlivestock. They till the soil and produce grain. They produce America's \nfoodstuffs. They take enormous risks, often with very few rewards. They \nlive out in the country and they turn that yard light on at night, and \nthat illuminates a family out there somewhere living on the land trying \nto make a living.\n  What is happening these days in the Farm Belt is that grain prices \nhave collapsed, and livestock prices are way down. These family farmers \nwho have risked everything they have and invested it in their hopes and \ndreams in making this family farm work, are now all too often standing \nwith tears in their eyes as their farm is being sold at an auction \nsale.\n  This country will lose something important if it loses its family \nfarmers. I suppose we could farm America from California to Maine with \ngiant agrifactories. We could have big corporate farms and a farming \nsystem where nobody lives on the land and there are no yard lights \nbecause nobody is there at night. Do we want corporate agrifactories \nfarming America? This country will have lost something very important \nin its culture and in its economy if we lose our family farmers. And, \nwe will lose them if we don't decide as a Congress to take action soon.\n  Congress needs to tell farmers that this nation wants to help them \nthrough these troubled time. We need to build a bridge across these \nprice valleys, when grain prices, cattle prices and hog prices \ncollapse. We want to help. But, if we don't do that soon, we won't have \nmany farmers left.\n  This isn't about Democrats and Republicans, or conservatives and \nliberals; it is about values and whether we in this Congress believe \nthat family farming contributes to this country. I consider myself a \nJeffersonian kind of Democrat. A Jeffersonian Democrat is somebody who \nreally believes in broad-based economic ownership in this country, and \nwho believes that the political freedoms we enjoy in this country could \nnot exist without economic freedom. Such freedom comes only with broad-\nbased economic ownership. It does not come with concentration, nor with \nbig corporations, but with broad-based ownership in which the men and \nwomen of America are out there investing in farms and small businesses. \nNowhere is that broad-based economic ownership more important and more \napparent to the economic health of this country than on America's farms \nand ranches.\n  I was in a Quonset building a couple of days ago in North Dakota. It \nwas in the evening and there was a picnic out on the farmstead. Farmers \nfrom all around the county came. About 100 folks gathered there. This \nyoung fellow who owned this farm hadn't finished taking off his grain. \nHe had been trying hard, but he hadn't gotten it all off the field yet. \nAs we were in this Quonset hut at this picnic, the clouds began to form \nout in the west. First they were blue and then almost black. Those \nclouds came in as part of a vicious, vicious storm. It came with a \nvengeance with wind, hail, rain. Inside that Quonset, it sounded almost \nlike war as the huge hailstones were hitting that steel roof, making a \nloud, echoing sound together with the pelting rain.\n  I watched those farmers in that Quonset building look at those \nclouds. I started to understand what that storm meant when tears welled \nup in their eyes and they were shaking their heads. Some of these \nfarmers knew that storm was probably wiping them out, destroying their \ncrop, and probably destroying their hope to get something off of those \nfields and get it to the market and pay some bills.\n  Those are the risks our farmers face. Two years ago, the Congress \npassed the farm bill. I didn't vote for it. I didn't think it was a \ngood farm bill. In the last 2 years, wheat prices have dropped 57 \npercent, right off the table. This is critical to us because wheat is \nthe largest cash crop in North Dakota that the family farmers raise. In \naddition to wheat prices collapsing on us, we have also had the worst \ncrop disease in the century. The most damaging is known as fusarium \nhead blight or scab. So we have had crop diseases, together with the \nwet cycle that has fostered these diseases, a collapse in prices, and \nwe have had auction sales all across the State. Family farmers are \nwondering whether they can continue. Their lenders are saying, ``I \ndon't think you can continue because the farm bill Congress passed has \ndecreasing support prices in the out years, and it doesn't look good. \nMaybe you ought to get out now and save whatever little equity you \ncan.'' That is the position farmers now find themselves in too often in \nrural America.\n  So the question for us is what should we do about it? In July this \nSenate passed a bill that included $500 million in what is called an \nindemnification program. Senator Conrad and I authored that, along with \nSenator Craig and others. That bill is now going into conference \ncommittee with the House. We need to get that bill through to try to \nget some short-term help to family farmers. The indemnification program \nwill have to be increased because of other disaster situations. The \nTexas cotton crop was devastated. Louisiana, Oklahoma, and other States \nnow face an increasing crisis in family farming and in agriculture.\n  In addition to that bill, it seems to me the Congress has a \nresponsibility now to reach out to family farmers and say: ``We made a \nmistake a couple years ago. We need to build back some sort of price \nsupport program for you. We don't want to tell you when to plant, or \nhow to plant, or what to plant. We don't want to do that. But we want \nto say that you matter and we care about family farmers, and we want to \nprovide some basic kind of price bridge to get you over these price \nvalleys.''\n  We only have a couple of weeks to do that. I find it disturbing that \nin our economic system that almost everyone who touches something that \na farmer grows or produces is making money with it. Farmers buy the \nseed and they buy the equipment to plant the seed. They put the \nfertilizer in the ground. They hope it doesn't hail, and that the \ninsects don't come. They hope it doesn't rain too much. And, they hope \nit rains enough. Then maybe they get a crop. When they harvest the \ncrop, they hope when they put it in the truck and drive it to the \nelevator, they will get a decent price for it. Any problem along the \nway may mean they are gone, broke, and out of business.\n  Let's assume that farmer gets through the year and harvests the grain \nand gets a dismal price for it. That is what is happening right now. \nWhat happens to this harvest? Somebody puts it on a train and they put \nit on those tracks and down the tracks it goes. And guess what? The \nrailroads are making money. Do you think they aren't making money off \nthat wheat? The farmer who planted and harvested it didn't, but the \nrailroads are making money, I suspect record profits. Then it goes to a \nmiller. The millers are doing fine. They are making money. Then it goes \nto some plant someplace where\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\nthey are going to make breakfast food out of it. They take that kernel \nof wheat and put it into a plant and they puff it up. They make puffed \nwheat. They put it in a box and send it to a store and somebody buys \nthe puffed wheat. They are making money off it. The people who move it, \nthe people who puff it and crisp it, and the people who sell it in a \nstore make money. Everyone makes money except the people who produced \nit. The family farmers don't make money from their harvests. They are \ngoing broke. What kind of a system is that?\n  Speaking of disconnections in the system, let's look further at our \nfood system. We have a system that doesn't make sense. As farmers go \nbroke we have circumstances where halfway around the world today, we \nhear that old women are climbing trees in Sudan trying to find leaves \nto eat because they are on the abyss of starvation. Millions are \nstarving.\n  At the very same time an old woman is climbing a tree to get leaves \nto eat in Sudan, a farmer is loading a 2-ton truck to take to the \ncountry elevator, and when they get there, the elevator operator says, \n``We're sorry, this wheat isn't worth anything; the market has \ncollapsed. This wheat doesn't have value.'' What kind of a \ndisconnection is that? In the same world, halfway around the globe, \npeople are starving and those who produce the best foodstuffs in the \nworld are told it doesn't have value. There is something wrong with \nthat picture as well.\n  My hope is that in the coming 4 or 5 weeks, Republicans and Democrats \nwill understand that it is our responsibility as a country to say to \nthat this most important sector, the agriculture sector, matters. We \nneed to especially tell our family farmers that they matter and that we \nare going to make a difference by passing a price support mechanism of \nsome type that gives them a chance to survive.\n  Let me add one final piece to this.\n  In addition to saying that price supports will be available when \nprices collapse and we want family farmers to survive, this Congress \nalso ought to do something to help family farmers survive by saying we \nwill correct the problems in the trade agreements that we have \nnegotiated over recent years that have been to the detriment of family \nfarmers.\n  Almost no one wants to hear my recitation of the trade problems \nbecause they have heard it so often.\n  We send negotiators to go to negotiate with Canada, and we have an \n$11 billion trade deficit with Canada. They finish the negotiations, \nbring the treaty back to Congress, Congress passes the treaty, and the \ntrade deficit doubles. They send negotiators to go negotiate with \nMexico. That is done. They send it to Congress, and Congress approves \nit--not with my vote--and a surplus turns into a big deficit. They send \nnegotiators to go out and negotiate a GATT agreement. The same thing: \nRecord trade deficits.\n  Mr. President, there is something wrong.\n  Mr. President, there is something dreadfully wrong when our family \nfarmers and other producers in this country--but especially family \nfarmers--are told: ``You compete in the open market. It is a global \neconomy. You go compete.'' And our negotiators somehow fail to suit up. \nI don't think it should be necessary for our negotiators to wear a \njersey reminding them for whom they are negotiating. But, somehow they \nshould be reminded. Maybe we ought to have our negotiators wear a \njersey like they wear in the Olympics that says ``USA'' just so they \nunderstand whom they represent. Maybe the next time they bring a trade \ntreaty back to the U.S. Senate they can bring one back that serves our \neconomic interest. We need trade agreements that are not driven by \nforeign policy, but instead are guided by hard-nosed economic policy \nthat represents our economic interests.\n  Now we are told that in the next week or so we are going to have \nfast-track trade authority brought to the floor of the Senate. Good \nluck. This fast track is going to do more of the same trade stuff that \ngot us into this trouble. Not with my vote. I intend to stand here and \nobject to every single thing that is asked and every single thing that \nis requested to get fast track to the floor of the Senate. I am only \none person. I probably can't stop it. But I can sure slow it down some. \nI fully intend to do that.\n  I have something to say to those folks who are so all-fired anxious \nto bring fast-track trade authority back to the floor of the Senate \nbased on the package already reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. If you are so anxious to talk about trade, why don't you \nfigure out how to deal with the problems created in our previous trade \nagreements. Before you start trying to figure out how you send people \nover to do new trade treaties with other countries, fix a few of the \nproblems. Fix the problems with Canada. Tell our farmers why a flood of \nCanadian grain can come across in this direction, and a pickup truck \nwith a few kernels gets stopped at the Canadian border, and they have \nto sweep the few kernels off because you can't take a few kernels of \nwheat into Canada. Tell our farmers how that is free trade. It is not. \nFix those trade agreements before you come to us talking about more \nfast-track trade agreements.\n  I just want to say this to the majority leader and others. If you \nthink this place is going to move quickly, trying to bring fast track \nto the floor of the Senate is a sure fire way of slowing down the \nproceedings of the Senate. I guarantee it. Fast track will not solve \nthe farm crisis. It is the farm crisis that has to be our priority in \nthe remaining few weeks of this session.\n  I hope very much that we can agree on a bipartisan basis on the need \nand the urgency to address the farm crisis. I hope that we can do that \non a bipartisan basis. Farmers don't get up in the morning or go to bed \nat night as Republicans or Democrats. They don't care with respect to \ntheir long-term economic survival whether it is a Republican or a \nDemocratic plan. They care about whether it is a plan that works. They \nneed a plan that says to them that we care about them and their future.\n  I hope that all of us who come from farm country and who represent \nrural America can join together and decide to do something meaningful, \nsomething real, and something that really does help family farmers \nbefore we adjourn this 105th Congress.\n  I wanted to make those comments because in the next week or so I \nexpect there will be amendments offered once again on the floor of the \nSenate dealing with farm price supports that need to be passed. I will \nalso be involved in the Appropriations Committee in conference with the \nHouse to move forward with the $500 million indemnification program \nwhich Senator Conrad and I and others authored and that we have already \npassed through the Senate. And we may be working on other issues as \nwell, including the trade issue that I just described.\n  Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Washington for allowing \nme to make some interim comments. I noticed I wasn't interrupted. I \nguess that means no one showed up to offer an amendment on his Interior \nbill.\n  Let me also say that I am a member of the Appropriations Committee \nand a member of the subcommittee. I very much respect his leadership. I \nthink he does an excellent job with this piece of legislation. I say \nthat because tomorrow I intend to offer an amendment that I hope he \nwill perhaps accept. But I thank him again for allowing me the time to \ninterrupt the legislation on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order that a \nquorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to determine the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as and when \nthese amendments are adopted, they be considered as original text for \nthe purpose of further amendment, should a Senator desire to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, these are primarily a set of rather small \nand technical amendments. The first one, for Senator Craig, strikes \nsection 333 regarding recreation residence fees and modifies section \n343 of last year's bill on that subject. It is more modest than the \nsection 333 that it strikes.\n  The second amendment by the distinguished occupant of the Chair \nsubjects certain reserved mineral interests to the Mineral Leasing Act.\n  The next set of amendments, all of which carry my name, are a \ntechnical fix to section 332 on prescribed burning\n\n[[Page S9966]]\n\noperations; a technical amendment to section 328 on the authority given \nto the Forest Service to acquire independently a general ledger system; \na technical change to section 339 on the prohibition of the use of \ntimber purchaser road credits; a technical change to section 331 on \nForest Service regulations on the use of fixed climbing anchors; a \ntechnical change on the financial statements from the Office of Special \nTrustee, this at the administration's request; a technical correction \non reprogramming procedures; an amendment to the BIA language relating \nto other tribes taking land into trust from within the boundaries of \nthe original Cherokee territory; a proposal by Senator Reid on the BLM \nmodifying section 125 to correct and clarify the legal description of \nlands to be conveyed; and one of my own relating to the Forest Service, \na technical correction regarding accounting for indirect expenses.\n  As I said, Mr. President, these tend to perfect sections that are \nincluded in the bill and under my unanimous consent request will be \nsubject to further amendment if any Member desires to do so just as if \nthey were a part of the original bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3543 through 3553) were agreed to en bloc.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Walter Dunn, \na fellow working in Senator Bingaman's office, be accorded privilege of \nthe floor during the pendency of S. 2237.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendments were agreed to en bloc and move to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to determine the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue to \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Is there objection? \nHearing none, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have no intention of offering an \namendment at this time. As I understand it, we are waiting for Senator \nMcCain to come to the floor to offer an amendment on campaign finance \nreform. I hope we could have that debate sometime this afternoon.\n  I hate to see time pass without having the opportunity to talk about \nthe array of issues that are pending before this body. Obviously, \ncampaign finance reform is a matter of great concern to many Senators \non both sides of the aisle, and I know Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold have indicated their desire to offer an amendment, as I \nunderstand it, this afternoon. Senator Lott, now, has expressed a \ndesire to have a vote on campaign finance reform at some point this \nweek. Given Senator Lott's pessimism about its chances for passage, I \nassume that he believes that he has the necessary votes to defeat the \namendment, or to defeat a move to bring cloture on the amendment this \nweek.\n  I will tell you, it will not be the last vote we have on campaign \nfinance reform, because we will offer it again and again. Whether it is \nSenator Feingold and Senator McCain or others, I think it important \nthat we ultimately have a vote on the issue itself.\n  While we wait on that particular vote and that debate, which I hope \nwill take place sometime soon, I call attention also to the other \namendments we wish to offer.\n  We will be offering an amendment on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nbelieve it is essential that we have the opportunity to come to closure \non that important issue as well. It has passed in the House, as has \ncampaign finance reform. They are both now pending in the Senate. We \nhave indicated a willingness to take up the Shays-Meehan bill as it \nexists, pass it, and send it on for signature.\n  We are not quite prepared to do the same on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. We think we can improve on the House-passed bill, and having \nthat debate is very important.\n  In addition to that, we will be offering a series of amendments, as \nwe have noted in the past, on agriculture. I have just returned from \nSouth Dakota with a similar impression as others who have returned from \ntheir home States about how serious the situation is and how \nproblematic it is becoming for an increasing number of our producers. \nWe will offer an amendment to increase the loan rate. I hope on a \nbipartisan basis we can support that.\n  We will offer an amendment to provide storage payments to farmers so \nthey are not forced to sell their grain now.\n  We will be offering an amendment to provide for loan deficiency \npayments for corn silage, something farmers are so desirous of having \nsimply because they are forced to sell grain that is absolutely \nworthless right now. At least silage will give them an opportunity to \nfeed their livestock.\n  We will be offering other amendments, because we don't believe there \nis any other choice.\n  Mr. President, one could make the argument that with all of this work \nto be done, we simply can't consider running the Senate in a business-\nas-usual fashion. We have to take into account the end of the session, \nthe plethora of legislative needs that are out there, and the agenda \nthat places before us.\n  So we will be offering a proposal. Our proposal is really pretty \nsimple. Our proposal is that we approach the legislative schedule \nbetween now and the end of the session in two shifts; that we take the \nfirst shift to address the appropriations bills and some of the array \nof issues that the majority leader has considered scheduling. As I \nunderstand it, we will have a vote tomorrow on missile defense. We will \nhave the bankruptcy bill and other bills.\n  But then we propose a second shift. Beginning early in the evening \nand going until whatever time it takes each night, we would dedicate \nthe Senate to the needs that we haven't addressed and the array of \nissues that the majority leader says we don't have time for. We do have \ntime for them if we make time. We do have time for them if we actually \nengage in what businesses do all the time. If they want to increase \nproduction, they go to a second shift.\n  The time has come for us to increase production. The time has come \nfor us to recognize that we can't consider the Senate agenda in the \nremaining time that we have available in a business-as-usual fashion. \nWe have yet to pass a budget. Unbelievable as it may be, regardless of \nwhat the law requires, our Republican leadership has renounced the law, \nhas abdicated their responsibilities, and has concluded that they \nsomehow can violate the requirements of the law and not pass a budget \nresolution. I am not sure how you do that. I am not sure of the legal \nimplications of doing it. But if we are not going to address a budget \nresolution simply because, as the leadership has noted, we don't have \ntime, then, again, our solution, our suggestion, is that we make time.\n  Let's consider a second shift. Let's consider working overtime. Let's \nconsider doing what we must, as any business, as any manager, would do. \nWith all the work that is before us, let us consider doing what we must \nand putting in the hours to resolve these issues and complete our work \nbefore the end of the session.\n  Mr. President, it is really not very complicated. If we work until a \ncertain time as if we were going to adjourn, then move to the second \nshift and take up the second agenda, we can complete our work. As I \nunderstand it, things like this have been done before, and it is time \nwe do it now. We have very few days left. Less than 6 weeks from now, \nthe Senate is anticipating adjournment. We simply can't adjourn without \nhaving addressed and passed campaign finance reform. We can't adjourn \nwithout having addressed and passed a Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nsimply can't\n\n[[Page S9967]]\n\nadjourn without having addressed and passed an array of tools to \nprovide agriculture with the ability to survive.\n  All the issues I have mentioned, and many others, beg our \nconsideration and demand our attention. I hope we can address them in a \nway that will accommodate the needs of both parties and caucuses and \nthe expectations of the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (The text \nof the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the \nmajority leader in bringing this amendment up. I see my friend from \nKentucky on the floor. I look forward to vigorous debate in the next \ncouple of days. I know that the majority leader is going to file a \ncloture motion. I believe it is important that we bring this issue \nagain before the Senate since the House of Representatives obviously \nacted on this issue.\n  I do want to point out that the majority leader has assured me we \nwill have 2 full days of debate on this, which will mean a cloture vote \nsometime late Thursday afternoon. I appreciate that. I hope that we \nwill on this occasion prevail. I again look forward to a vigorous \ndebate on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, this amendment provides funding for a \nwide array of programs throughout the Interior bill, predominantly to \nmeet requirements such as fixed cost increases in maintenance, the $60 \nmillion offsets derived from excess funds held in escrow pursuant to \nthe Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act. These funds \nare in excess of the funds projected to be required to pay any \nrestitution pursuant to the act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed description of the \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Amendment provides for the following:\n       Additional $2.3 million for fixed costs increases in the \n     Bureau of Land Management. Funding at this level will provide \n     approximately 75% of the agency's requested uncontrollables. \n     The agency will continue to be expected to find efficiencies \n     to offset the remainder of the request.\n       Additional $1 million for wilderness management in the \n     Bureau of Land Management, which increases this activity to \n     the FY 98 level ($300,000 below Administration request). \n     Funds will address routine wilderness management \n     responsibilities.\n       Additional $5 million for fixed costs increases in the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service. Funding at this level will provide \n     approximately 50% of the agency's requested uncontrollables. \n     The agency will continue to be expected to find efficiencies \n     to offset the remainder of the request.\n       Additional $10 million for Park Service maintenance.\n       Additional $3 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs to \n     address the probate backlog for Individual Indian Money \n     accounts. Consistent with BIA's strategic goal to address the \n     title backlog, which is the subject of several lawsuits. The \n     cost of dealing with the total backlog is estimated at over \n     $12 million, according to most recent figures, available only \n     after President's budget was released. The additional funds \n     over FY98 funding of $573,000 will hire temporary staff, \n     provide overtime to existing staff and provide funds to self-\n     governance tribes to research about 300 backlogged estates of \n     about 1,300 total. This funding will fully meet \n     Administration request and is $2 million over the House mark.\n       Additional $2.2 million for support related to the Cobell \n     v. Lujan litigation. The elimination of backlogs is a \n     component of the Trust Management Improvement Project \n     overseen by the Office of the Special Trustee.\n       Additional $3.5 million for BIA law enforcement for Law \n     Enforcement in Indian Country initiative.\n       Additional $1.7 million for Bureau of Indian Affairs \n     environmental cleanup. The EPA is threatening BIA with fines \n     related to remediation of underground storage tanks. In \n     addition, BIA is trying to perform an environmental audit \n     related to tanks and open dumps.\n\n[[Page S9969]]\n\n       Additional $2 million for Stewardship Incentives Program in \n     the Forest Service to equal the Administration request. \n     Reflects strong interest in this program by numerous \n     senators. Will improve the overall survivability of the \n     program in light of the House action to provide no funding.\n       Additional $1 million for Forest Legacy program in the \n     Forest Service to equal Administration request. Reflects \n     strong interest in this program by numerous senators. The \n     additional funds will further support efforts to obtain \n     management easements for especially sensitive properties of \n     significant national interest.\n       Additional $4 million for Forest Service road maintenance, \n     reflecting Committee's commitment to address the severely \n     deteriorating Forest Service infrastructure by increasing the \n     amount of roads being maintained to planned standards. This \n     will be of significant value in reducing erosion and damage \n     which is harmful to watersheds within the national forests \n     and adjacent lands.\n       Additional $5 million for Indian Health Service contract \n     support. The Administration flat-lined Contract Support at \n     $168 million, and the House and Senate figures are already \n     above that level, with House at $195 million and Senate at \n     $170 million. However, reality is that shortfall is estimated \n     to be upwards of $90 million in total ($33 million for FY98 \n     alone). The additional funding would still be short of House \n     amount but is better than Administration request.\n       Additional $500,000 each for the Wheeling National Heritage \n     Area, the South Carolina National Heritage Corridor, and the \n     Augusta Canal National Heritage Area in the Park Service, \n     National Recreation and Preservation account.\n       Additional $1 million for the heating and cooling system at \n     the U.S. Geological Survey Leetown Science Center.\n       Additional $500,000 for land acquisition at the Ohio River \n     Islands National Wildlife Refuge.\n       Additional $1,000,000 for the Forest Service for a multi-\n     state cooperative noxious weeds research program.\n       Additional $1 million for BLM land acquisition at the Santa \n     Rosa Mountains National Scenic Area.\n       Additional $1 million for construction of a visitor center \n     at the White River National Wildlife Refuge.\n       Additional $1,975,000 for land acquisition at Cumberland \n     Island National Seashore.\n       Additional $200,000 for the Bureau of Indian Affairs for a \n     job placement assistance program operated by the United Sioux \n     Tribes Development Corporation.\n       Additional $1 million for the Forest Service construction \n     account for the Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry.\n       Additional $325,000 for reconstruction at the North \n     Attleboro National Fish Hatchery.\n       Additional $750,000 for land acquisition at the Tensas \n     River National Wildlife Refuge.\n       Additional $500,000 for the recently authorized National \n     Underground Railroad program in the Park Service.\n       Additional $1 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service for \n     the Clark County, NV Habitat Conservation Plan.\n       Additional $1 million for demonstration of modular fuel \n     cells at no more than ten Department of Energy facilities.\n       Additional $200,000 for Spartina grass research by the \n     Forest Service.\n       Additional $500,000 for the Park Service Hecksher museum \n     renovation.\n       Additional $2.25 million for the Park Service for the \n     construction of the Blue Ridge Parkway Visitors Center.\n       Additional $1 million for the Park Service for construction \n     at the Black Archives & Research Center at Florida A \n     University.\n       Additional $1 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service for \n     habitat restoration in the Black River, a tributary to the \n     Coosa River.\n       Additional $3.3 million for rehabilitation of the Acadia \n     National Park water and sewer system.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3557) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the managers of this bill for \ntheir hard work in putting forth annual legislation which provides \nfederal funding for all of the agencies within the Department of the \nInterior, the Indian Health Service and several forestry programs. Many \nof the programs funded within this bill are vital to the preservation \nof our National Parks and to protect our precious natural resources.\n  I regret that I must again come forward this year to object to the \n$351.8 in additional spending above the budget request included in this \nbill and its accompanying report. This is an improvement over last \nyear's FY 98 Interior appropriations bill, which contained $584.6 \nmillion in pork-barrel spending. However, $351.8 million is still an \nunacceptable amount of money to spend on low-priority, unrequested, \nwasteful projects. In short, Congress must curb its appetite for such \nunbridled spending. The multitude of unrequested earmarks buried in \nthis proposal will undoubtedly further burden the American taxpayers.

Many of the programs within this proposal are meritorious \nand do deserve funding. However, should American taxpayers foot the \nbill for rural and economic development programs solely benefitting the \nState of Alaska? My colleagues have generously included unrequested \nfunding for $1,000,000 to study mineral resources-at-risk in Alaska \nunder the Bureau of Land Management's budget, as well as including \n$2,000,000 for the same minerals-at-risk program in Alaska under the \nU.S. Geological Survey budget. The earmarks do not stop there as \n$3,000,000 is directed to build visitor use facilities in the Katami \nNational Park and Preserve. The panel has also afforded the borough of \nKetchikan $2,000,000 to participate in a cooperative study to determine \nthe feasibility of manufacturing veneer products from southeast Alaska.\n  Certainly the home state of the Committee's esteemed Chairman is not \nthe only beneficiary of pork-barrel spending. My colleagues have seen \nto it that the State of Utah will have the funds to build an access \nroad to venues for the winter Olympic Games in 2002. Calling it a \n``necessity'' in their report, the Committee funnels $15,000,000 toward \nthe completion of Trapper's Loop Road. In addition, Utah is also slated \nto receive $1,300,000 to build recreation facilities for the 2002 \nGames. What is even more egregious is that these funds are directed to \nbe transferred to Utah before the remaining funding can be dispersed to \nstates for other projects.\n  This bill is weighed down by dozens of other wasteful projects which \nclearly have skirted the public review process, and in many cases do \nnot serve the greater national interest. For example, why must we \nexpend $500,000 of taxpayer dollars on noxious weed issues for the \nOkanogan and Colville national forests? Or to replace toilet facilities \nat a price of $320,000 in the Ouachita National Forest? While the \nAmerican people are proud of their national heritage and history, is it \nfair to ask them to pay $10,000,000 for a new National Constitution \nCenter in Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. President, I do not enjoy coming forth each year for every \nappropriation bill to decry wasteful spending, but I believe the \nAmerican taxpayers deserve to know where their hard earned dollars will \nbe spent. Sadly, this bill continues the practice of loading up \nimportant spending measures with unnecessary and wasteful pork-barrel \nprojects. I hope that we can restore the faith of the American people \nin our federal government by honoring our responsibility to them by \napplying judicious deliberation to our budget process.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the efforts of the \nTake Back The Night Alliance, an organization in the metropolitan \nLouisville, Kentucky area that is working to end a problem that affects \nus all in one way or another: violence against women. On Thursday, \nSeptember 10, as part of Sexual Assault Awareness and Domestic Violence \nAwareness months, the Alliance will for the first time in its nine-year \nhistory kick off a month-long series of events that will create a \ngreater awareness of the attitudes, beliefs and behaviors that \nperpetuate these specific kinds of crimes.\n  The statistics of domestic violence are sobering, and I'll give you \njust a brief sampling here:\n  A woman is physically abused every nine seconds in the United States.\n  In Kentucky alone, 80,000 women were victims of domestic violence in \n1997.\n  One out of four females will be sexually assaulted before they reach \nthe age of 18.\n  For every rape, 10 others go unreported.\n  Husbands and boyfriends commit 13,000 acts of violence against women \nin the workplace every year.\n  The total healthcare costs of family violence are estimated at $44 \nmillion each year.\n  Take Back The Night rallies have been held throughout the United \nStates since 1978. In Louisville, the National Organization for Women \nhas been the organizing force for this event for the past nine years, \nbut over 200 civic organizations, government agencies and businesses \nhave joined this year to sponsor a wide range of activities drawing \nattention to the problems faced by women who are victims of domestic \nviolence, rape and sexual assault. One group will collect previously \nowned business clothing for abused women returning to the workforce. \nAnother will sponsor safety and prevention workshops in area hospitals \nand companies. And yet another will provide materials on date rape and \nsexual assault to be placed in bars and in women's restrooms.\n  Louisville and Jefferson County have been recognized as leaders in \nthe field of domestic violence, and I am heartened by the strong \noutpouring of support that the Take Back the Night Alliance has \nreceived from the community. We all know that such success does not \nhappen by accident, and I would like to commend the Alliance leaders \nfor their dedicated efforts to ease the plight of women who are victims \nof domestic violence, sexual assault and rape.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9972-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL JEWISH MEDICAL RESEARCH CENTER\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the National \nJewish Medical Research Center in Denver, Colorado, which has recently \nbeen recognized by U.S. News and World Report as the top-ranked \nRespiratory Hospital in the United States. The work of National Jewish \nis close to my heart because I watched my mother struggle with \ntuberculosis throughout her lifetime. She lived and worked in a \nsanatorium for many years, making it difficult for her to care for my \nsister and me.\n  In the late 1800s, Denver's elevation and abundant sunshine made it a \nmecca for people with tuberculosis. National Jewish treated only \npatients with tuberculosis until the 1950s, when antibiotics brought \nthe disease under control. The hospital then turned its attention to \nasthma. Allergies which can develop into asthma, bronchitis, and sinus \ninfections, now attack some 40 million people, double the number 25 \nyears ago. Twice as many people, 15 million, have asthma now, too, at a \ncost of $6.2 billion a year in missed work and school, in medications \nand hospital visits.\n  Today, National Jewish is a world-class institution, a global leader \nin the research and treatment of lung, allergic and immune diseases. It \nis ranked as the number one private institution for immunology research \nin the world and as one of the top 10 independent research institutions \nof any kind in the world. Tremendous breakthroughs in understanding \nrespiratory disease are taking place in Denver.\n  Not only is National Jewish recognized world-wide for its research, \nit is also known for its considerable philanthropic activities in the \nhealth care community. Until the mid-1960s, patient care was funded \nentirely through philanthropy. Today, the hospital continues to provide \na significant amount of free and subsidized care to those unable to \nafford total treatment costs.\n  Founded in 1899 as a nonsectarian, non-profit hospital for \ntuberculosis patients, National Jewish enters the 21st century as the \nonly facility in the world dedicated exclusively to pulmonary \ndisorders. It is one of Colorado's treasures. Next year it will \ncelebrate its 100th year of giving health and hope to people suffering \nfrom pulmonary diseases.\n  Today, I want to commend National Jewish on the rich history of \npatient care and research given to Colorado, to congratulate them on \nbeing recognized as the top-ranked Respiratory Hospital in America, and \nto wish them well as they celebrate the 100th anniversary in 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9972-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act to provide to nationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, \nHonduras, and Haiti an opportunity to apply for adjustment of status \nunder that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n   THE CENTRAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN REFUGEE ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Central \nAmerican and Caribbean Refugee Adjustment Act of 1998. This legislation \nwill provide deserved and needed relief to thousands of immigrants from \nCentral America and the Caribbean who came to the United States fleeing \npolitical persecution.\n  In the 1980's, thousands of Salvadorans and Guatemalans fled civil \nwars in their countries and sought asylum in the United States. The \nvast majority had been persecuted or feared persecution in their home \ncountries. The people of Honduras had a similar experience. While civil \nwar was not formally waged within Honduras, the geography of the region \nmade it impossible for Honduras to be unaffected by the violence and \nturmoil that surrounded it. The country of Haiti has also experienced \nextreme upheaval. Haitians for many years were forced to seek the \nprotection of the United States because of oppression, human rights \nabuses and civil unrest.\n  Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Haitians and Hondurans have now established\n\n[[Page S9974]]\n\nroots in the United States. Some have married here and many have \nchildren that were born in the United States. Yet many still live in \nfear. They cannot easily leave the United States and return to the \ngreat uncertainty in their countries of origin. If they are forced to \nreturn, they will face enormous hardship. Their former homes are either \noccupied by strangers or not there at all. The people they once knew \nare gone and so are the jobs they need to support their families. They \nalso cannot become permanent residents of the United States, which \nseverely limits their opportunities for work and education. This \nsituation is unacceptable and requires a more permanent solution.\n  Before outlining how this bill will provide a permanent solution, it \nis important to review the evolution of deportation remedies. Prior to \nthe passage of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in \n1996, aliens in the United States could apply for suspension of \ndeportation and adjustment of status in order to obtain lawful \npermanent residence. Suspension of deportation was used to ameliorate \nthe harsh consequences of deportation for aliens who had been present \nin the United States for long periods of time.\n  In September of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Responsibility Act. This law retroactively made thousands of \nimmigrants ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with \nno alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation \nand established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal \nthat required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence \nas of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being \nremovable.\n  In 1997, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could \nresult in grave injustices to certain groups of people. So in November \nof 1997, the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act (NACARA) \ngranted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and \nseveral Central American countries. This select group of immigrants \nwere allowed to apply for permanent residence under the old, pre-IIRRA \nstandards.\n  Such an alteration of IIRRA made sense. After all, the U.S. had \nallowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, \nduring which time many of them established families, careers and \ncommunity ties. The complex history of civil wars and political \npersecution in parts of Central America left thousands of people in \nlimbo without a place to call home. Many victims of severe persecution \ncame to the United States with very strong asylum cases, but \nunfortunately these individuals have waited so long for a hearing they \nwill have difficulty proving their cases because they involve incidents \nwhich occurred as early as 1980. In addition, many victims of \npersecution never filed for asylum out of fear of denial, and \nconsequently these people now face claims weakened by years of delay.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today is a necessary and fair \nexpansion of NACARA. It provides a permanent solution for thousands of \npeople who desperately need one. Specifically, the bill amends the \nNicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act and provides \nnationals of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti an opportunity \nto apply for adjustment of status under the same standards as \nNicaraguans and Cubans. While the restoration of democracy in Central \nAmerica and the Caribbean has been encouraging, the situation remains \ndelicate. Providing immigrants from these politically volatile areas an \nopportunity to apply for permanent resident status in the United States \ninstead of deporting them to politically and economically fragile \ncountries will provide more stability in the long run. Such an approach \nis the best solution not only for the United States but also for new \nand fragile democracies in Central America and the Caribbean. \nImmigrants have greatly contributed to the United States, both \neconomically and culturally and the people of Central America and the \nCaribbean are no exception. If we continue to deny them a chance to \nlive in the United States by deporting them, we not only hurt them, we \nhurt us too.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2441\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Import and Export \nAct to place limitations on controlled substances brought into the \nUnited States from Canada and Mexico; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n Repeal of Limitation on Foreign Tax Credit Under Alternative Minimum \n                                  Tax\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Moynihan, that would eliminate a \nfundamental unfairness in the application of the U.S. tax law to \ntaxpayers that have income from foreign sources.\n  A U.S. citizen or domestic corporation that earns income from sources \noutside the United States generally is subject to tax by a foreign \ngovernment on that income. The taxpayer also is subject to U.S. tax on \nthat same income, even though it is earned outside the United States. \nThus, the same income is subject to tax both in the country in which it \nis earned and in the United States.\n  However, the United States allows taxpayers to treat the foreign \ntaxes paid on their foreign-source income as an offset against the U.S. \ntax with respect to that same income. This offset is accomplished \nthrough the foreign tax credit. In other words, the foreign tax paid on \nforeign-source income is treated as a credit against the U.S. tax that \notherwise would be payable on that same income. Although the details of \nthe foreign tax credit rules are extraordinarily complex (as are the \ninternational provisions of the International Revenue Code generally), \nthe basic principle is simple: to provide relief from double taxation.\n\n[[Page S9975]]\n\n  When it comes to the alternative minimum tax (AMT), this basic \nprinciple of providing relief from double taxation falls by the \nwayside. The AMT was enacted to ensure that individuals and businesses \nthat qualify for various ``preferences'' in the tax rules nevertheless \nare subject to a minimum level of taxation. However, the foreign tax \ncredit provisions of the AMT operate to ensure double taxation. Under \nthese AMT rules, the allowable foreign tax credit is limited to 90 \npercent of the taxpayer's alternative minimum tax liability. Because of \nthis limitation, income that is subject to foreign tax is subject also \nto the U.S. AMT. The result is double (and even triple) taxation of \nincome that is used to support U.S. jobs, R and other activities.\n  Mr. President, there is no rational basis for denying relief from \ndouble taxation to that class of taxpayers that are subject to the AMT. \nAccordingly, the bill Senator Moynihan and I are introducing today will \neliminate the 90 percent limitation on foreign tax credits for AMT \npurposes. By repealing this limitation, relief from double taxation \nwill be provided to taxpayers that are subject to the AMT in the same \nmanner as it is provided to those taxpayers that are subject to the \nregular tax.\n  I would hope that our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join \nin cosponsoring this necessary legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and \nSafe Streets Act of 1968 to reauthorize the public safety and community \npolicy program and to encourage the use of school resource officers \nunder that program; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                safe communities and schools act of 1998\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to \nintroduce the Safe Communities and Schools Act of 1998. This \nlegislation, I believe, will help American communities continue to \nprevail in their fight against crime, and will arm local law \nenforcement agencies and schools with the tools they need to fight the \nrecent outbreak of school-yard violence.\n  The Community Oriented Policing Program, or the COPS program as it is \ncommonly called, has played a vital role in reducing our nation's crime \nrate. Since the inception of the program in 1994, the Department of \nJustice has authorized an additional 76,000 police officers to walk the \nbeat. These additional police officers have been instrumental in \nhelping reduce crime and making people feel safe in their communities.\n  It is not coincidental that, in my own home state of Illinois, where \nthe COPS program has put an additional 4,113 police officers on the \nstreet, we have experienced a substantial drop in crime in recent \nyears. For example, in 1996--the last year for which statistics are \navailable--crime in Illinois was down 11 percent.\n  I strongly believe that the key to the COPS program's success lies in \nthe community policing strategy that is its guiding philosophy. As the \ndaughter and sister of law enforcement officers and a former federal \nprosecutor, I can attest to the fact that community policing works. \nPutting beat cops back into communities allows them to have more \ncontact with the people they protect and gives them an opportunity to \nprevent crimes before they happen.\n  But despite the gains that have been made with the advent of the COPS \nprogram, the recent spate of violence in our nation's schools is \nevidence that our crime-prevention efforts are far from complete. \nAlthough we are seeing record reductions in youth-on-youth crime, the \nhorrifyingly violent nature of the crimes now being committed by \njuveniles demands government action.\n  For this reason, my legislation would use COPS program grants to \nestablish partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and local \nschool systems. Under my legislation, career law enforcement officers, \ntrained in community-oriented police activities, would be deployed to \nwork in collaboration with schools and community-based organizations \nto, among other things: Combat crime and disorder problems, as well as \ngang and drug activities occurring in or around elementary and \nsecondary schools; Educate likely school-age victims about crime \nprevention and safety; and Assist schools in developing policies to \nreduce crime.\n  Under my legislation, no new funding beyond that which has already \nbeen allocated to the COPS program would be required to finance these \nschool-police partnerships.\n  By the year 2000, the COPS program will have served to fulfill \nPresident Clinton's pledge to put 100,000 new police officers on the \nstreet. Currently, the program is only funded through that year, but I \nbelieve that it has clearly been successful enough to justify at least \na two-year extension. Accordingly, in addition to facilitating new \nschool-police partnership grants, my legislation would authorize that \nextension and provide the necessary funding to allow local police \ndepartments across America to put an additional 25,000 officers on the \nstreet.\n  Providing funds to communities to combat school violence will give \nlocal school systems and law enforcement agencies the opportunity to \ndevelop new and innovative approaches to reducing youth crime. It is \ntime to stop wringing our hands over the scourge of youth violence and \nbegin to take action. The American people are demanding leadership on \nthis issue and the time has come for those of us who serve in \nWashington to provide it.\n  If we are truly serious about preparing the next generation of \nAmericans for the challenges they will face in the 21st century's \nglobal economy, we must take action--right now--to guarantee that they \nare educated in a safe environment. That is why I have fought for a \npartnership between the federal government and state and local school \nsystems to address the disgrace of our nation's crumbling schools, and \nthat is why I am introducing the COPS legislation I have just outlined. \nWe owe the next generation of Americans at least as much as our \ngeneration was given--and the fact is that we were given schools that \nwere physically safe and violence-free.\n  The success of the COPS program to date demonstrates the wisdom of \nusing it as the vehicle for promoting school safety and for expanding \nit to put an additional 25,000 officers on community policing beats. \nThe data is in and the results are clear: Community policing works. \nThat is why I am confident that safer schools and safer communities \nwill be the result if the COPS legislation I am proposing today is \npassed by Congress and signed into law. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin sponsoring.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that the formulation and implementation of \npolicies by Federal departments and agencies shall follow the \nprinciples of federalism, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  THE FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nFederalism Enforcement Act, a bill to promote the principles of \nfederalism and to restore the proper respect for State and local \ngovernments and the communities they serve. I am pleased that Senators \nNickles, Craig, Thurmond, and Hutchinson have joined me as cosponsors \nof this legislation.\n  Federalism is the cornerstone of our Democracy. It is the principle \nthat the Federal Government has limited powers and that government \nclosest to the people--States and localities--play a critical role in \nour governmental system. Our Founding Fathers had grave concerns about \nthe tendency of a central government to aggrandize itself and thus \nencroach on State sovereignty, and ultimately, individual liberty. \nFederalism is our chief bulwark against Federal encroachment and \nindividual liberty. Our Founders also knew that keeping decision making \npowers closer to home led to more accountable and effective government. \nTheir federalist vision is clearly reflected in the 10th amendment, \nwhich states:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today requires agencies to respect \nthis vision of federalism when formulating policies and implementing \nthe laws passed by Congress. It will preserve the division of \nresponsibilities between the States and the Federal Government \nenvisioned by the Framers of the Constitution and established in \nExecutive order by President Ronald Reagan.\n  The Reagan order on federalism had it right. It directed Federal \ndepartments and agencies to refrain from imposing one-size-fits-all \nregulation on the States. It held that the laws passed by Congress were \nnot presumed to preempt State law unless done so explicitly. It \nrequired agencies to assess the impact of agency action on federalism. \nBut the people running the executive branch today, from the top on \ndown, do not seem to feel the Reagan order applies to them. They made \nthis abundantly clear when they tried to revoke it with Clinton \nExecutive Order 13083.\n  In May, President Clinton quietly signed Executive Order 13083, which \nby its terms claims to promote federalism. Ironically, this order that \nis supposed to promote better communication between Federal and local \ngovernment was issued in secret--without even talking to State and \nlocal officials at all. Worse still, the order would seriously \nundermine federalism and effectively turn the 10th amendment on its \nhead. The Reagan Executive Order 12612 promoted the 10th amendment and \nset a clear presumption against Federal meddling in local affairs. The \nnew Clinton order would create, but not be limited to, nine new policy \njustifications for Federal meddling. The list is so ambiguous that it \nwould give Federal bureaucrats free rein to trample on local matters. \nThe new Clinton order also would revoke President Clinton's own 1993 \nExecutive Order 12875 that directed Federal agencies not to impose \nunfunded mandates on the States.\n  Understandably, State and local officials were deeply offended by the \nClinton order and the White House snub in drafting it. On July 17, the \nmajor groups representing State and local officials sent a remarkable \nletter to the President, urging him to withdraw the order and to \nrestore the Reagan federalism order and the 1993 unfunded mandates \norder. On July 22, several of my colleagues and I supported State and \nlocal officials by sponsoring a resolution calling on President Clinton \nto repeal his new order. That resolution passed the Senate unanimously. \nThe House also has voiced opposition to the Clinton order. Congressman \nMcIntosh held a hearing, and joined with six of his colleagues to \nintroduce a bill nullifying Executive Order 13083.\n  The White House had a chance to extinguish the firestorm of protest \nfrom Governors, State legislators, mayors, county executives, and other \nlocal officials around the country by permanently revoking Executive \nOrder 13083. Instead, the White House chose to preserve some wiggle \nroom by ``suspending'' the order on August 5, leading some to ask if \nthat action is permanent or just an effort to delay the order until the \nopposition dies down. If the President can admit that he made a mistake \nin signing his federalism order, he should permanently revoke it, plain \nand simple.\n  Unfortunately, the White House has yet to correct its insult to State \nand local officials and the communities they serve. Instead of revoking \nthe Clinton order, the administration is preparing for belated \nconsultations with State and local government representatives. This \neffort at damage control does not hide the fact that the Clinton order \nis an open invitation for Federal interference in local affairs, and in \nthe administration's eyes, it is still on the table.\n\n  In light of this threat to the tenth amendment principle of a limited \nFederal Government, Congress must stand ready to act. The Federalism \nEnforcement Act is necessary to ensure that the current administration \nexercises some restraint when regulating in areas that affect our \nStates and communities, and respects the principles of State \nsovereignty and limited Federal Government on which our Nation was \nfounded.\n  First, the bill directs Federal agencies to adhere to constitutional \nprinciples and not to encroach on the constitutional authority of the \nStates. The Clinton federalism order would have shifted the presumption \nagainst Federal intervention to provide new policy justifications for \nFederal interference in State and local affairs. My bill returns us to \nthe language of the Reagan order.\n  Second, the bill would restore the preemption standards established \nin the Reagan order. The Clinton order would have encouraged Federal \nagencies to intrude into State affairs and deleted the Reagan \npreemption principle that, when in doubt, agencies should err on the \nside of State sovereignty.\n  Third, the bill would direct agencies to prepare a federalism \nassessment of certain agency actions, such as regulations that have \nsignificant federalism implications. The Clinton order would have \ndeleted this requirement.\n  Finally, the Federalism Enforcement Act would express the sense of \nthe Congress that Federal agencies should not propose legislation that \nwould regulate the States in ways that would interfere with their \nseparate and independent functions, attach conditions to Federal grants \nwhich are unrelated to the purposes of the grant, or preempt State law \nin ways inconsistent with the act. Because only the President can \nenforce\n\n[[Page S9977]]\n\nthis requirement using his article II constitutional powers, it is \nexpressed as a resolution urging him to do so.\n  The principles of federalism rightly are being reinvigorated. Much of \nthe innovation that has improved this country began at the State and \nlocal level. People want important decisions that affect their daily \nlives to be made in their community--not dictated on high from \nWashington. And federalism is blossoming in recent constitutional \ninterpretations of the Supreme Court. The Federalism Enforcement Act I \nam introducing today will continue this restoration of the balance \nbetween national and State power as conceived by the Framers of the \nConstitution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2447. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture, in \nconsultation with the heads of other agencies, to conduct a feasibility \nand cost-benefit study of options for the design, development, \nimplementation, and operation of a national database to track \nparticipation in Federal means-tested public assistance programs; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 FOOD STAMP INTERSTATE FRAUD PREVENTION\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ncombat fraud and waste in the food stamp program--overpayments \nresulting from individuals receiving benefits in two or more states at \nthe same time. This bill is the result of the last in a series of \nGeneral Accounting Office studies that I requested dealing with groups \nof ineligible people receiving food stamps. In the report being \nreleased today, GAO identifies over 20,000 individuals who received \nbenefits in at least two states at the same time during 1996. Using \nadministrative records from four states (California, Texas, New York \nand Florida), the GAO estimates overpayments of $3.9 million in those \nstates alone.\n  Last year the GAO reported to the Agriculture Committee that over $3 \nmillion in food stamp benefits were overpaid to prisoners' households. \nIn response we passed legislation to stop prisoners from receiving \nbenefits. Earlier this year, the GAO reported that 26,000 deceased \nindividuals in four states were counted as members of a food stamp \nhousehold. According to the GAO this resulted in overpayments of an \nestimated $8.6 million. The Agriculture Committee reported a bill to \nmatch food stamp files with Social Security Administration data.\n  My bill will require the United States Department of Agriculture to \nconduct a feasibility study to identify options for a national database \nto track food stamp participants and combat interstate fraud. The GAO's \nreport validates a Department of Health and Human Services computer \nmatch of 15 states which found 18,000 potential duplicated Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) cases. This suggests that the \nproblem is not confined to USDA. My bill would direct the USDA to work \nin consultation with other agencies to develop a systematic approach to \ndeveloping a national database.\n  At present there is no appropriate national database that tracks in \nmeans-tested benefit programs. States have been working individually on \nthe problem of benefits paid in multiple jurisdictions. For example, \nsome states have developed cooperative agreements with neighboring \nstates to share data. Current state efforts are effective, but anything \nshort of a national system is inefficient.\n  Mr. President, the welfare reform bill required states to guard \nagainst fraud and abuse, and specifically prohibited participants from \nreceiving benefits in two states. However, the bill did not give states \ntools to combat this type of fraud. The welfare bill also did not give \nstates the tools to implement other important provisions. To \neffectively implement the TANF and food stamp time limits, some type of \nnational tracking system is necessary.\n  Therefore, this bill directs the agencies involved to address a \nbroader range of issues than simply the receipt of benefits in \ndifferent states at the same time. HHS has already fulfilled a \ncongressional mandate to look into some of these issues, so I expect \nthe participants in this new study to use the completed project as a \nbase upon which to build.\n  Further, I believe that the study should explore the possibility of a \n``real time'' database, so that eligibility workers will instantly know \nif there are any problems with an application. This will avoid the \n``pay-and-chase'' problem that forces states to recoup overpayments \nfrom beneficiaries after the fact--sometimes years later. This method \nof fraud enforcement is inefficient, and often a burden on the \nrecipient as well. A national database should not be seen as purely an \nenforcement tool. There are many cross program benefits for the poor, \nbenefits which may not be apparent today. As with any large \ngovernmental database, the study should address how the system will \nsafeguard recipients' privacy and limit unauthorized use and disclosure \nof data.\n  Means-tested benefits, including food stamps, provide a safety net \nfor millions of people. We cannot allow fraud and abuse to undermine \nthe food stamp program and welfare reform. Integrity is essential to \nensure a program that can serve those in need. It is our responsibility \nto help end fraud and abuse in all federally funded programs. This \nlegislation is an important step in that direction and will help ensure \nthat welfare reform is a success.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) during 1997, the Federal Government spent over \n     $21,000,000,000 to deliver food stamp benefits under the Food \n     Stamp Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.) to over 23,000,000 \n     individuals;\n       (2) a portion of the funds spent on food stamp benefits \n     annually is misspent through overpayments and fraud, which \n     undermines the integrity and confidence in the food stamp \n     program;\n       (3) the Comptroller General of the United States has found \n     that--\n       (A) as many as 20,000 individuals were receiving food stamp \n     benefits in at least 2 to 4 States at the same time during \n     1996;\n       (B) due to this duplication, overpayments to the households \n     in those States during 1996 totaled approximately $3,900,000; \n     and\n       (C) there was a similar duplication of payments in other \n     Federal means-tested public assistance programs, such as the \n     temporary assistance to needy families (TANF) program funded \n     under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.);\n       (4) certain States currently have cooperative agreements \n     under which matches of recipients of means-tested public \n     assistance programs are tracked and coordinated with \n     neighboring States, but there is no comprehensive national \n     database or information system to track participation across \n     State lines;\n       (5) the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \n     Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-193) created a \n     number of requirements to track means-tested assistance \n     throughout the United States, including time-limited receipt \n     of assistance under the food stamp program and the temporary \n     assistance to needy families (TANF) program;\n       (6) a centralized database would be the most effective tool \n     to prevent receipt of means-tested assistance in multiple \n     jurisdictions and would avoid duplicated effort on the part \n     of States;\n       (7) according to the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget, improved mechanisms to provide accurate \n     information to employees who determine eligibility for means-\n     tested assistance would help prevent overpayments and improve \n     service to clients; and\n       (8) data sharing at the time of application for means-\n     tested assistance could change enforcement efforts from a \n     pay-and-chase method to a method that would be more proactive \n     and efficient.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title V of the Small Business Investment Act \nof 1958, relating to public policy goals and real estate appraisals, to \namend section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, relating to interest \nrates and real estate appraisals, and to amend section 7(m) of the \nSmall Business Act with respect to the loan loss reserve requirements \nfor intermediaries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness.\n\n\n                  SMALL BUSINESS LOAN ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators \nWellstone, Harkin, and Landrieu, to introduce the ``Small Business Loan \nEnhancement Act.'' To give small businesses more of an advantage, we \npropose small but significant changes to the Small Business \nAdministration's three primary lending programs: the 7(a) guaranteed \nbusiness loan program, the 504 Development Company program, and the \nMicroloan program. These changes would foster loans to growing women-\nowned businesses and enhance small business lending by saving costs for \nsmall business borrowers, reducing paperwork for lenders, and \nincreasing available capital for microloans and technical assistance. \nThis bill will also enable small businesses to use SBA's most popular \nloan guarantee program to fix year 2000 problems.\n  Women-owned businesses are increasing in number, range, diversity and \nearning power. They constitute one-third of the 23 million small \nbusinesses in the United States, contribute more than $2.38 trillion \nannually in revenues to the economy and range in industry from \nadvertising agencies to manufacturing. Addressing the special needs of \nwomen-owned businesses serves not only these entrepreneurs, but also \nthe economic strength of this nation as a whole. Since 1992, SBA has \nmanaged to increase access to capital for women and has worked in \nearnest to move women entrepreneurs away from expensive credit card \nfinancing to more affordable loans for financing their business \nventures. While the percentage of 504 loans to women-owned businesses \nhas increased from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 14.7 percent in 1998, we need \nto increase lending opportunities to better reflect that 40 percent of \nall businesses are owned by women. By expanding the public policy goals \nof the 504 loan program to include women-owned businesses, we are \nensuring that loans to eligible women business owners aren't capped at \n$750,000 but are now available for as much as $1 million. According to \nCertified Development Company professionals, loan underwriters are \nconservative when it comes to approving loans for more than $750,000 \nand that this directive would undoubtedly help eligible women business \nowners get the financing they need to expand their facilities and buy \nequipment as their businesses grow.\n  In addition to increasing access to capital, the SBA plays a critical \nrole in eliminating barriers that keep entrepreneurs from entering the \neconomy, reducing regulatory burdens and lowering transaction costs. \nThe Senate has an opportunity to reduce time and costs to both lenders \nand small business borrowers in real estate transactions by modernizing \nappraisal requirements for real estate transactions for 7(a) and 504 \nloans. Under current operating procedures, where more than $100,000 of \nthe authorized loan proceeds in a financing package includes real \nestate (acquisition, construction and improvement to land and \nbuildings), SBA requires a state-certified or state-licensed appraisal. \nOur bill would raise the requisite appraisal amount to $250,000, \nconsistent with other agencies, including, among others, the Federal \nReserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision. Raising the threshold does not increase \nthe government's risk in these loans because the bill specifies that \nlenders must require a state-certified or state-licensed appraisal on \nloans less than $250,000 if that is their standard for similar non-SBA \nloans. Depending on the area of the country, savings in the 7(a) and \n504 programs are estimated to be from $1,000 to $5,000 per loan by \nrequiring an evaluation instead of a state-certified or state-licensed \nappraisal. In the 504 program, this change is estimated to save money \nfor 2,000 out of the some 6,000 annual 504 borrowers, which are often \nminority and women-owned businesses.\n  To complement those regulatory improvements, this bill also \nencourages lenders to use the 7(a) program for their borrowers by \nstreamlining paperwork requirements those lenders must complete after a \n7(a) loan defaults. Two years ago, Congress enacted a requirement that \nreduced by one percent the interest rate paid on the guaranteed portion \nof defaulted 7(a) loans. Although the change was expected to \nsubstantially decrease the subsidy costs of the program, this has not \nproved to be the case. Instead, it has created a paperwork burden \ndisproportionately high compared to the savings realized.\n  To help small businesses meet the escalating challenges of the Year \n2000 computer problem, also called the Y2K problem, this bill clarifies \nCongressional intent that the 7(a) guaranteed loan program be used for \nthis purpose. As amended, the 7(a) loan program will specify that small \nbusinesses can use these loans to finance the cost of making their \nsystems and computers Y2K-compliant. In addition to legitimate concerns \nabout function and survival that make this provision important for \nsmall businesses, Y2K compliance will also be a regulatory concern for \nbankers and small business borrowers. We understand that bank \nregulators will be requiring lenders to survey their borrowers and to \ncertify that they are Y2K-compliant. Congress recognizes that small \nbusinesses may be harmed by the Y2K problem and that the 7(a) program \nis an appropriate means and established SBA program that can \nimmediately help them deal with it. In fiscal year 1997, the 7(a) loan \nprogram reached more than 40,000 businesses, making 45,288 loans and \napproving loans totalling $9.5 billion.\n  The last component of this bill amends SBA's Microloan program. This \nimportant economic development tool has, in six short years, provided \nclose to 7,000 microloans worth some $68 million. More than 40 percent \nof those loans went to women, 42 percent went to minorities, and 11 \npercent went to veterans. This program, which provides loans that \naverage $10,000 and can be for as little as a few hundred dollars, has \nimproved the landscape of some our country's poorest communities, \ncreating jobs, helping people move from public assistance to weekly \npaychecks, and contributing to the tax base. As stated in a July Boston \nBusiness Journal article, ``There are many people out there who can't \nget traditional bank loans because they have bad credit histories, or \nno credit histories or no assets.'' In spite of these realities that \nmake microentrepreneurs too risky for banks, the government has \nsuffered no losses in this program. It is successful because it helps \nentrepreneurs turn their talents into businesses, such as a furniture \nupholsterer or a pet shop, and then augments the capital infusion by \nproviding technical assistance to teach microentrepreneurs how to run a \nsuccessful business.\n  This amendment would authorize the SBA Administrator to reduce an \nmicrolender's loan loss reserve (a reserve of cash to guarantee that \nthe government is paid back if a loan defaults) from 15 percent to not \nless than ten percent after an intermediary has been participating in \nthe microloan program for at least five years and has demonstrated its \nability to maintain a healthy loan fund. Each microlender's loan loss \nreserve will be established based on its average loss rate for the \nprevious five-year period. Because of the program's success so far, 36 \nout of 42 microlenders would qualify under this bill's requirements to \nmaintain a loan loss reserve of ten percent rather than 15 percent. The \nproposed change would continue to protect the government's interest in \nthese loans and at the same time enhance the program because it frees \nup cash that microlenders can reprogram for more microloans or \ntechnical assistance.\n  In closing, I want to again thank my colleagues for supporting this \nbill. If enacted, they will have improved the business climate and \ntaken a few more steps to ensure that small businesses have access to \ncapital, are less burdened by regulations and paperwork, have the \nresources to meet Y2K problems and that women-owned businesses can get \nloans of sufficient size to expand their businesses.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support and ask \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S9979]]\n\nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2448\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Controlled Substance Act relating to the \nforfeiture of currency in connection with illegal drug offenses, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     DRUG CURRENCY FORFEITURES ACT\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there have been a series of recent \ncases in which courts have ruled against one of law enforcement's most \neffective anti-drug tools--asset forfeiture. Just consider:\n  Law enforcement agents at an airport found almost $50,000 wrapped \ninside a pair of jeans. A drug dog responded positively to the presence \nof narcotics on the money, and the traveler, when confronted by the \nagents, produced a fake driver's license and offered other false \nevidence. United States v. $49,576.00 in U.S. Currency, l16 F.3d 425 \n(9th Cir. 1997).\n  In another instance, narcotics agents found $30,000 wrapped in \nbundles and stashed under the seat of a car. Despite the courier's \ndemonstrably false explanation of the source of the money, the court \nnevertheless found insufficient evidence to establish probable cause \nfor forfeiture. United States v. U.S. Currency, $30,060.00, 39 F.3d \n1039 (9th Cir. 1994).\n  These are but two in a series of cases in which the courts found \ncircumstantial evidence sufficient to establish that the money was \nderived from some form of criminal activity, but insufficient to \nestablish that the illegal activity involved drug trafficking. The \ncourts therefore ruled that the money seized was not subject to \nforfeiture, and the proceeds were returned to the trafficker. See also \nUnited States v. $13,570.00 in U.S. Currency, 1997 WL 722947 (E.D. La. \n1997) (seizure of cash at airport lacked probable cause despite dog \nsniff, evasive answers, fake ID, courier profile, and prior drug \narrest); United States v. $14,876.00 in U.S. Currency, 1997 WL 722942 \n(E.D. La. 1997) (same); United States v. $40,000 in U.S. Currency, 999 \nF. Supp. 234 (D.P.R. 1998) (dog sniff, drug courier profile, quantity \nof currency and evasive answers are not sufficient to establish \nprobable cause where government fails to establish any connection \nbetween claimant and any drug trafficker).\n  Mr. President, these court decisions are coming at a time when drug \nsales in this country are generating $60 billion in illegal proceeds \nevery year. Most of this drug money finds its way to drug kingpins in \nMexico and Colombia. And the drugs find their way to Americans of all \nages and walks of life. The consequences are devastating. Substance \nabuse is now the single largest preventable cause of death in this \ncountry, with illegal drugs and alcohol killing 120,000 Americans each \nyear.\n  It's an enemy that respects neither class nor age group. High school \nathletes, runaways, soccer players, gang members, and class \nvaledictorians use and sell drugs. Nationwide, the percentage of teens \nreporting illegal drug use has doubled over the last 5 years. And now \nthe National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reports that teen drug use \nrose in 1997, led by increasing marijuana smoking among teenagers who \nview it as a low-risk ``soft drug.'' It is no wonder that in survey \nafter survey, Americans are reporting that illegal drugs top their list \nof national concerns.\n  In recent testimony before the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, a top official at the Drug Enforcement Administration \n(DEA) painted a chilling portrait of the powerful threat to the United \nStates posed by international drug organizations. He said, and I quote, \n``These individuals, from headquarters located outside the U.S., \ninfluence the choices that many Americans make about where to live, or \nwhere they send their children to school. The drugs, and the attendant \nviolence which accompanies the drug trade, have reached into every \nAmerican community and, in essence, have robbed many Americans of the \ndreams they once cherished.''\n  These organized crime leaders are sophisticated and possess the power \nthat comes with unlimited resources. Because they are worth billions of \ndollars, these drug lords have at their disposal some of the world's \nmost technically advanced airplanes, boats,\n\n[[Page S9980]]\n\nradar, and communications equipment. They possess weapons in quantities \nthat, DEA testified, ``rival the capabilities of some legitimate \ngovernments.'' These drug kingpins send thousands of couriers into the \nUnited States who answer to them on a daily basis via faxes, cellular \nphones, or pagers.\n  Since the disruption of the notorious Cali cartel leadership, we know \nthat traffickers from Mexico have joined together with Colombian \ntraffickers in an emerging alliance which has largely taken over U.S. \nheroin distribution from Asian organizations and is now producing some \nof the world's most potent heroin. The manufacture of the vast majority \nof cocaine in South America is still under the control of the Colombian \ncartels, which use commercial maritime vessels, containerized cargo and \nprivate aircraft to transport the cocaine from their laboratories in \nthe jungles of southeast Colombia through Mexico and the Caribbean into \nU.S. border points of entry. In fact, 50 to 60 percent of all the \ncocaine, as well as 25 percent of the heroin and 80 percent or more of \nthe meth coming into the United States, are transported into our \ncountry through the U.S.-Mexico border.\n  The DEA testified that the influence of Colombian trafficking \norganizations in the Caribbean is ``overwhelming.'' Several Colombian \ndrug syndicates have set up command and control bases in Puerto Rico \nand the Dominican Republic and use the Caribbean Basin to ferry tons of \ncocaine into the United States each year. According to the DEA, \nseizures of 500 to 2,000 kilos of cocaine in the Caribbean are now \ncommonplace. Unlike the monopoly-like rule of the Cali cartel, many of \nthe new Colombian cartels have chosen to franchise a large portion of \ntheir wholesale heroin and cocaine operations. As a result, criminals \nfrom the Dominican Republic have now become the dominant force in the \nwholesale cocaine and heroin trade on the East Coast of the United \nStates.\n  In addition to heroin and cocain, methamphetamine has become a \ngrowing threat within our borders. Methamphetamine trafficking, which \nuntil recently had been stopped west of the Mississippi River, is \naggressively moving eastward and is now rapidly challenging cocaine as \nthe primary focus of illegal drug trafficking in Georgia and other \neastern seaboard States. According to the DEA Atlanta Field Division, \nWashington may soon declare Atlanta the meth capital of the Southeast.\n  During February alone, DEA seized almost 90 pounds of methamphetamine \nin metropolitan Atlanta. Ten pounds of the drug was seized from \npassengers on buses originating in Texas and California. Acting on a \ntip, DEA agents found another 25 pounds stashed in hidden compartments \nin a vehicle. And law enforcement agents apprehended two Los Angeles \npassengers at Hartsfield Airport who had smuggled 20 pounds of meth \ninto the State. These drugs are being ferried into my State by couriers \nemployed by Mexican trafficking organizations operating out of Mexico \nand California. DEA has determined that a number of its recent meth \nseizures in Georgia are directly linked to the AMEZCUA drug trafficking \norganization--one of Mexico's principal drug cartels.\n  The amounts of money generated by these illegal drug transactions are \nstaggering. The DEA reported that one Mexican drug syndicate forwards \n$20 to $30 million to Colombia for each major drug operation, and makes \ntens of millions of dollars in profits each week. Moving this money \nfrom Mexico to Colombia, or from the U.S. to Mexico, is a relatively \nsimple matter. The most popular method is to ship the currency in bulk \nby courier or cargo, or transport it overland or by air. Oftentimes, \nthe same vehicle or even the same courier that originally transported \nthe drugs into the United States will carry the drug proceeds out.\n  It was not long ago that a Customs investigation made front page \nheadlines. Three of Mexico's largest banks were indicted by the U.S. \nfor laundering hundreds of millions of dollars in drug money from this \ncountry. The three-year sting was unprecedented on two counts. This was \nthe largest money laundering case in the history of U.S. law \nenforcement. And it was the first time ever that Mexican banks and bank \nofficials have been directly linked to laundering U.S. drug profits.\n  The sting resulted in the arrest of 70 people, including 14 Mexican \nbanking officials. Thirty-five million dollars in illegal drug proceeds \nwas seized immediately. One hundred and twenty-two million dollars more \nis expected to be recovered from over 100 bank accounts frozen in this \ncountry and in Europe. While unprecedented, this operation netted only \na drop in the bucket compared to the estimated $60 billion in illegal \nproceeds reaped from U.S. drug sales each year. Like most of the drug \nproceeds, this money was earmarked for drug lords in Mexico and \nColombia. In this case, Mexican bankers allegedly aided the Juarez \ncartel in Mexico and the Cali cocaine and heroin syndicate in Colombia.\n  If we ever expect to make in-roads in the so-called ``war on drugs,'' \nit is not enough just to apprehend the drug trafficker. We must seize \nhis assets as well. Let me give just one example. The Rodriguez-\nOrejuela brothers in Colombia once ran the most powerful international \norganized crime group in history. Based on evidence supplied by the \nU.S. Government, Miguel Rodriguez-Orejuela has been sentenced to 21 \nyears in prison, although it is expected that he will serve only 12. \nLast year his brother Gilberto was sentenced to 10\\1/2\\ years in prison \non drug trafficking charges. Even now, the Rodriguez-Orejuela brothers \nare able to run their drug trafficking business from prison through the \nuse of private quarters and telephones. They are by no means the \nexception. Last year the Colombia National Police took control of four \nmaximum security prisons from the Bureau of Prisons, in an effort to \nhalt jailed traffickers from continuing their illegal operations from \nbehind prison walls. In the final analysis, the only way to destroy the \ndrug cartels is to hit them where it hurts the most--their pocket \nbooks.\n  The transportation and transmission (by electronic means) of drug \nproceeds are enormous problems for law enforcement, but they also \npresent law enforcement with an enormous opportunity. Because drug \nproceeds in the form of cash occupy much more space than the drugs \nthemselves--often filling suitcases, vehicles, and even airplanes--the \nmovement of the cash is often the most vulnerable part of the drug \noperation. Indeed, law enforcement agents are frequently successful in \nintercepting such cash shipments by stopping couriers at airports, \nopening containers at Customs checkpoints, and encountering cars \nstuffed with cash during routine traffic stops.\n\n  However, the ability of law enforcement to confiscate the money--and \nthus break the drug trafficking cycle--hinges on the government's \nability to establish that the money is, in fact, drug proceeds, and not \nthe proceeds of some other form of unlawful activity. Therefore, today \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Caucus on International \nNarcotics Control, Senator Grassley, and I are introducing the Drug \nCurrency Forfeitures Act. Our bill enhances the ability of law \nenforcement agents to interdict and confiscate the huge quantities of \ndrug money that are being moved through our airports, up and down our \nmajor highways, through our ports, and in and out of financial \ninstitutions here and abroad--while at the same time it upholds Fourth \nAmendment constitutional protections against illegal searches and \nseizures. Specifically, our bill would create a ``rebuttable \npresumption'' that money is subject to forfeiture as drug proceeds in \ncases involving drug couriers carrying large amounts of cash through \ndrug transit areas, and in cases involving international money \nlaundering. The presumption would apply if any of the following factors \nis established by the government.\n  Factor one: There is more than $10,000 in currency being transported \nin one of the transit places commonly used by drug traffickers--for \nexample, an airport, an interstate highway, or port of entry--and any \nof the following circumstances commonly associated with the \ntransportation of drug proceeds exists: the money is packaged in a \nhighly unusual manner; or the courier makes a false statement to a law \nenforcement officer or inspector; or the money is found in close \nproximity to drugs; or a properly trained dog gives a positive alert.\n  I note here that there has been much criticism of the use of drug \ndogs to\n\n[[Page S9981]]\n\ninterdict drug money, on the ground that so much currency now in \ncirculation in the U.S. is tainted with drug residue that the drug \ndog's positive alert is meaningless. Let me say, however, that recent \nscientific research has refuted this notion and indeed supports the \nproposition that a drug dog's alert to currency is highly relevant in a \nforfeiture case. A study by Dr. Kenneth Furton, Director of the \nCriminalistics Program in the Chemistry Department at Florida \nInternational University, has established that a properly trained drug \ndog does not alert to the cocaine residue on currency, but alerts \ninstead to methyl benzoate--a highly volatile chemical by-product of \nthe cocaine manufacturing process that remains on the currency only for \na short period of time. Thus, even if it is true that a high percentage \nof our currency is contaminated with cocaine residue, the drug dogs are \nalerting only to money that has recently, or just before packaging, \nbeen in close proximity to a significant amount of cocaine. See K.G. \nFurton, Y.L. Hsu, N. Alvarez and P. Lagos, ``Novel Sample Preparation \nMethods and Field Testing Procedures Used to Determine the Chemical \nBasis of Cocaine Detection by Canines,'' Forensic Evidence and Crime \nScience Investigation, Proc. SPIE 2941, 56-62 (1997). I am attaching to \nmy remarks an article describing Dr. Furton's work.\n  Factor two: The property subject to forfeiture was acquired during a \nperiod of time when the person who acquired it was engaged in a drug \ntrafficking offense, and there is no other likely source for the money. \nI note that this presumption already exists in criminal forfeiture \ncases. See 21 U.S.C. Sec.  853(d).\n  Factor three: The property was involved in a transaction that \noccurred, in part, in a bank secrecy jurisdiction or was conducted by, \nto or through a shell corporation. These two factors appear repeatedly \nin cases involving international money laundering and therefore are \nhighly indicative of illegal money laundering activity. However, to \nensure that the presumption is focused narrowly on the problem this \nbill is designed to address, it would apply only where the money was \nbeing moved in or out of one of the countries the President has listed \nas a ``major drug-transit country,'' a ``major illicit drug producing \ncountry,'' or a ``major money laundering country,'' all of which are \ndefined terms in the Foreign Assistance Act.\n  Factor four: Any person involved in the transaction has been \nconvicted of a drug trafficking or money laundering offense, or is a \nfugitive from prosecution for such an offense. This factor reflects the \nobvious fact that the movement of money by a convicted drug trafficker, \nmoney launderer or fugitive is highly likely to involve drug proceeds.\n  The existence of any one of these four factors would be sufficient--\nby itself, or in some cases, in combination with the facts and \ncircumstances which led to the seizure of the money--to establish \nprobable cause to believe that the money represents drug proceeds, and \nif left unrebutted, would be sufficient to establish that the money is \nsubject to forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \nSec. 881(a)(6), or the Money Laundering Control Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  \n981(a)(1), by a preponderance of the evidence. The owner of the money, \nof course, would be free to rebut the presumption by submitting \nadmissible evidence that the money was derived from a legitimate \nsource, and the government would have to respond either by impeaching \nthe reliability of such evidence, or by offering admissible evidence of \nits own to support the forfeiture of the money. See United States v. \n$129,727.000 U.S. Currency, 129 F.3d 486 (9th Cir. 1997). In this way, \nlegitimate owners of untainted money will be protected. However, drug \ntraffickers and money launderers will no longer be able to rely on the \nambiguities inherent in the movement of cash and electronic funds--as \nwell as the ambiguities inherent in the standard of proof in civil \nforfeiture law--to win the release of their ill-gotten gains without \nhaving to come forward with any evidence whatsoever.\n  On June 22, the Supreme Court handed down a highly controversial \ndecision which is certain to have far-reaching ramifications on U.S. \ndrug interdiction policy. That sharply divided ruling involved the case \nof Hosep Bajakajian, who had attempted to take $357,000 in undeclared \ncash to Syria, and who had lied about the amount of money he had with \nhim when questioned by a Customs inspector. By ruling that the federal \ngovernment cannot seize the money of a person trying to carry funds out \nof the country when that individual fails to declare it, unless the \ngovernment can show it is tainted money, the High Court's decision may \nvery well reinforce the recent lower court decisions against \nforfeiture--a critically important weapon in our drug interdiction \narsenal. Our bill would address these adverse court decisions by \nproviding needed statutory guidance on the important and contentious \nissue of property subject to seizure.\n  Our bill has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, and the Federal Law Enforcement \nOfficers Association. I hope that my colleagues will support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill be \nprinted in the Record together with appropriate relevant materials.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2449\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Max W. Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: I am writing to advise you of the \n     strong support of the more than 272,000 members of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police for your draft legislation, ``The \n     Drug Currency Forfeitures Act.''\n       This bill will amend the ``Controlled Substances Act'' as \n     it relates to the forfeiture of currency deemed to be in \n     connection with illegal drug trafficking or money laundering \n     operations. In order to stem the flow of drugs into the \n     United States, and to reduce the risks to law enforcement \n     officers, government at all levels must have the ability to \n     take away the resources of drug traffickers--whether it is \n     currency, property, or other ill-gotten gains from their \n     illegal narcotics transactions.\n       One of the most frustrating aspects of law enforcement is \n     seeing those who poison our cities and neighborhoods with the \n     scourge of drugs amass sizable fortunes as a result of their \n     actions. Your legislation addresses this issue by taking \n     money away from those who threaten the lives of our children \n     and our nation's law enforcement officers, and is a major \n     step toward tackling the problems posed by drug traffickers \n     and their considerable financial resources.\n       Forfeiture of drug money, and the assets of money \n     laundering operations, increases the penalty for drug dealing \n     and reduces the benefits of engaging in illegal drug \n     trafficking. On behalf of the more than 272,000 members of \n     the Fraternal Order of Police, I want to commend and applaud \n     your leadership on this issue. If I can be of any further \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me, or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco, at my Washington office, (202) \n     547-8189.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Gilbert G.

Max Cleland,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cleland: The International Brotherhood of \n     Police Officers (IBPO) is an affiliate of the Service \n     Employees International Union, the third largest union in the \n     AFL-CIO. The IBPO is the largest police union in the AFL-CIO.\n       On behalf of the entire membership of the IBPO, I want to \n     thank you for introducing legislation that would create a \n     ``rebuttable presumption'' that money is subjected to \n     forfeiture as drug proceeds in cases involving drug couriers \n     carrying large amounts of cash through airports and on major \n     highways, and in cases involving international money \n     laundering. The IBPO officially endorses your legislation and \n     looks forward to working with you to see this bill become \n     law.\n       Your legislation will hurt drug dealers in the most \n     effective way--in the pocketbook. Forfeiture of this money \n     will also benefit the many police departments across the \n     country who supplement their budgets with these types of \n     seizures.\n       The IBPO wishes to thank you for all your support on behalf \n     of the law enforcement community. Be assured that the IBPO \n     will make your legislation a top priority in the 105th \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth T.

Senator Cleland's \n     legislation will preserve and enhance law enforcement's \n     ability to seize the assets of drug dealers and their \n     associates. I want to thank my friend, and law enforcement \n     supporter, Senator Cleland for his efforts to protect the \n     most valuable tool law enforcement has in combating drug \n     traffickers and money launderers.\n\n\n                             about the iacp\n\n       Founded in 1893, the International Association of Chiefs of \n     Police is the world's oldest and largest organization of \n     police executives with more than 16,000 members in 102 \n     countries.

This proposed \n     legislation will enhance the ability of law enforcement \n     officers, at all levels, to seize the assets of drug dealer. \n     FLEOA wishes to inform you of our overwhelming support for \n     this legislation.\n       FLEOA represents criminal investigators and special agents \n     from over fifty-five federal agencies, as listed on the left \n     masthead. We feel that legislation that creates a rebuttable \n     presumption that currency in excess of $10,000 is subject to \n     forfeiture as drug proceeds when transported through an \n     airport, on a highway, or at a port-of-entry, and is found in \n     close proximity to a measurable quantity of a controlled \n     substance would assist law enforcement in our fight against \n     narcotics.\n       We would be pleased to meet with you, or your staff, to \n     discuss our views on this issue in more detail. I can be \n     reached at (516) 368-6117, or you may contact FLEOA's \n     Executive Vice President Walt Wallmark at (202) 433-9230.\n           Thank you for your time.\n                                                 Richard J.

Mr. President, as America celebrated the Labor Day \nholiday this past weekend, it seems appropriate to take a moment to \nhighlight the recent efforts to renew the partnership between the \nNational Guard and Reserve forces and their community employers. Now, \nmore than in any recent decade, the Guard and Reserve are key to \nmaintaining our military commitments. More than a quarter million \nmembers served in Operation Desert Storm, and more than 17,000 have \nbeen called to active duty to support operations in Bosnia.\n  The partnership between all employers, whether in the private or \ngovernment sector, and the Reserve forces must extend beyond the 1994 \nUniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). \nCommunications and cooperation between employers and their employees \nwho participate in the National Guard and Reserve must be maintained to \nsupport our military structure. Without employers' full support, it \nbecomes much more difficult to maintain our military strength.\n  In Idaho, we have more than 5,400 Guard and Reservists. These men and \nwomen not only serve to support our national security, but also carry \nout a wide range of domestic missions. Last year, Idaho lost two \nReservists who were responding to flooding emergencies. We do not \nforget that they paid the ultimate price to protect our community \nduring disaster. Although we may never be able to thank our Guard and \nReserve forces enough for their efforts and commitment, we can ensure \nthat they have flexibility to serve in their units and secure \nemployment upon their return. This renewed partnership between \nemployers and our Guard and Reserve will do just that.\n  Labor Day is not just Labor's Day. It is a celebration of an all-\nAmerican accomplishment and an all-American ethic. Here, the dignity of \nlabor is not a matter of partisan politics, but civic pride. Public \nrecognition of the partnership between individuals who serve their \ncountry and communities, and the employers who support them, is a true \nway to celebrate this Labor Day holiday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9992-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9992-S9993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO DR. JOHNATHAN MANN AND DR. MARY LOU MANN\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish today to speak for a few \nmoments about a terrible loss for the state of Massachusetts, and for \nall those around the world who care about our fight to cure AIDS. Among \nthe dead in the crash of SwissAir flight 111 was a special couple, Dr. \nJonathan Mann and Dr. Mary Lou Clement Mann. Both devoted their lives \nto finding a cure for AIDS, and today I join thousands of people all \nover this country and across the world in mourning the tragedy of \nSwissAir flight 111 and the loss of everyone on board. Jonathan and \nMary Lou Clement Mann selflessly gave of themselves and cared for \npatients from Zaire to New Mexico, Boston to Geneva, embodying the best \nof their profession by bringing hope and comfort to countless \nindividuals and families.\n  Jonathan Mann was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1947 and graduated \nfrom Harvard College in 1969. After attending the Washington University \nSchool of Medicine in St. Louis, he returned to Boston for his formal \nentry into the medical profession. In 1975 he joined the Centers for \nDisease Control as an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer, and from \n1977 to 1984 he was the State Epidemiologist and Chief Medical Officer \nfor the state of New Mexico.\n  After receiving his Masters in Public Health from Harvard University \nin 1980, Dr. Mann returned to the CDC and it was then that AIDS became \nhis primary, professional focus. During these years he established and \ndirected the Zaire AIDS Research Project, which conducted the first \ncomprehensive study of the disease on the continent where AIDS has \nbrought the most widespread devastation and suffering. Dr. Mann's work \nthere led him to the World Health Organization's Global Programme on \nAIDS in 1986, a post of global impact which he held until his return to \nHarvard's School of Public Health in 1990.\n  Dr. Mann's involvement in this issue was total; his life and the \nfight to find a cure for AIDS soon became, in everyone's eyes, \nsynonymous. Beyond his professional service to the cause, he \nparticipated in the AIDS Walk in Boston, World AIDS Day, and countless \nevents, workshops, symposiums and conferences. His ultimate foe was the \nstigma that was attached to AIDS victims. His only weapons in the fight \nagainst AIDS were his passion, his intellect, and his belief in the \ntruth, and with those tools he was well armed to fight his battle on \nthe fields not just of science, but against a public that too often \nfell short of the compassion and humanity that a war on AIDS required. \nDr. Mann was not afraid to declare that AIDS will not be beaten as long \nas we stigmatize those that fall victim to it. He was one of the first \nand unfortunately few researchers who took AIDS seriously in the \ninfancy of the epidemic, when AIDS was still called GRIDS--gay-related \nimmunodeficiency syndrome. Jonathan and Mary Lou Mann understood that \nAIDS was a challenge for every community in this country and he was not \nafraid to speak out and criticize anyone--an administration, a society, \nan entire nation--who denied that truth.\n  Dr. Mann's work echoed from the best of human instincts: to reach out \nto those in need and to wield his power to alleviate suffering. We \nmourn the loss of Dr. Jonathan Mann and his wife Dr. Mary Lou Mann. On \nbehalf of Massachusetts, the United States Senate, and all those who \nwere fortunate\n\n[[Page S9993]]\n\nenough to know these two gifted individuals, we remember them for their \nenergy, their compassion for others, and realize that the world is \nbetter off for their time on this earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9992-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOOSIERS TEACH IMPORTANCE OF GEOGRAPHY\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

They have set themselves apart as Hoosier leaders who \nunderstand that geography should be an intregal part of American \neducation.\n  Geography offers a unique perspective in understanding ourselves, our \nrelationship to the Earth and its resources and our interdependence \nwith other people of the world. With an ever expanding global network \nof trading partners, the United States must look to its future \nentrepreneurs and citizens to have an understanding of the world and \nits geography in order to promote American interests abroad.\n  I urge all teachers to stress to their students the importance of \ngeography, and I appeal to students to study geography and its effects \non the makeup of our global societies.\n  I extend my congratulations to Ms. Bullock and Mr. Leineweber for \nrecognizing the importance of geography and working toward the \ndevelopment of geographic knowledge in our communities and \nschools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9993-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NURSING HOME PATIENT PROTECTION ACT\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nNursing Home Patient Protection Act. I wish this legislation was not \nnecessary, but it is. It is necessary and we must pass this bill \nbecause senior citizens and people with disabilities are being cruelly \nforced to leave their homes. Why? Not because of some failure of their \nown, not because they haven't spent their lives working hard, and not \nbecause they deserve to be kicked out for any other reason. These \npeople, mostly senior citizens, are being told to leave their homes \nbecause of inadequacies in our Medicaid program. This is not right, Mr. \nPresident. It is unfair, unacceptable, and Un-American to sit by while \nmany of our senior citizens are shuffled around like a deck of cards. I \nthink honoring your mother and father is not just good practice--it is \ngood public policy.\n  Most seniors begin paying their nursing home bills with their own \nlife's savings. Later, when they run out of money, they typically enter \nthe Medical Assistance Program. All too often, nursing homes then tell \nthese residents, some of whom have lived in a home for 20 years or \nmore, that they must leave because Medicaid payment rates are too low. \nNo warning is given, and little assistance for relocation is available. \nThey are, quite literally, left out on the street to find another \nfacility on their own. Think of your parents in a similar situation: \ntheir health is not what it once was, they are accustomed to their \ncurrent surroundings, and they were promised by their nursing home that \nthey would be allowed to stay when they ran out of money and became \nMedicaid recipients. Then, without any warning, they are told that they \nmust leave what has been their home within the next two months. How \nwould you react? I know how I would react--with anger, fear, and \ndisbelief. It is wrong and dangerous to disrupt seniors in such a \nmanner. Getting adjusted to a new environment is difficult at any age, \nbut for seniors, the added stress is often enough to significantly \ndiminish their health, leading to additional medical problems, and even \npremature death.\n  This bill does not attempt to force nursing homes to accept Medicaid \npatients. Rather, it recognizes the fact that nursing homes should have \nthe right to take only ``private pay'' patients if they so choose. That \nis the nature of the marketplace.\n  This bill does require nursing homes to be honest about their \npolicies concerning Medicaid and ensures that patients are not misled. \nThis bill would require nursing homes to formally notify potential \nresidents of their policy regarding Medicaid. Furthermore, under this \nlegislation, if a nursing home converts to private pay only status, it \nmust still honor its previous promise to current residents and accept \ntheir Medicaid payments.\n  Senior citizens' advocacy groups strongly support this legislation. \nAs noteworthy, the nursing home industry supports the bill. Calling it \n``intelligent public policy,'' the American Health Care Association, \nwhich represents over 11,000 nursing homes, acknowledges the fact that \nno one should be lied to and kicked out of their homes. Nursing home \nofficials realize, as we do, that this bill will not damage the \neconomic viability of running a nursing home. It will simply give \nseniors the security of knowing they will not be suddenly forced to \nleave their homes when they run out of their own savings.\n  I also want to say a bit about the last section of the bill. The \nfinal section is crucial because it requires the Secretary of HHS to \nexamine Medicaid reimbursement rates and make sure they are reasonable. \nThis work will then be compiled and submitted to Congress within five \nyears after the bill's passage. Hopefully, this report will shed light \non the Medicaid system's problems and initiate the process of \ncorrecting them.\n  This legislation will provide some much needed security for our \nseniors. I hope it will also start the process of improving our \nMedicaid system. People on Medicaid are regularly denied services by \nnursing homes and hospitals because the reimbursement rates are \nunreasonably low. The Secretary's report, required by this bill, is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Graham for introducing this \nimportant legislation. I know that he sincerely shares my concern for \nthe well-being of older Americans, as do all of the bill's cosponsors. \nWe have a responsibility to make sure that Americans are treated fairly \nand humanely. This bill does just that. Let's take care of our parents, \nour grandparents, and ourselves by passing this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9993-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9993-S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO AUBREY ``COTTON'' LAKE\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAubrey ``Cotton'' Lake, a long-time friend and respected member of the \nTuscaloosa community, who passed away on Friday, August 14, 1998 at the \nage of 69.\n  Aubrey was a valued employee of the Tuscaloosa News for 18 years and \ntraveled extensively with the Alabama Crimson Tide football team. His \nphotographs of the team won him the coveted Look Magazine National \nSports Photography award, and many of his photographs hang in \nTuscaloosa's Coach Bear Bryant Museum. Aubrey captured many of the \nCrimson Tide images that have become emblazoned on our memories--from \nphotographs of Bear Bryant coaching the team to victory, to Joe Namath \nbefore his tenure with the NFL. Aubrey was there, documenting sports \nhistory, shooting and selecting the most descriptive photographs for \nthe next day's Tuscaloosa News sports page.\n  Aubrey was more than a sports photographer, however, and served both \nGod and country throughout his life. In addition to his active \nmembership at the First Freewill Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa, he also \nserved many of Alabama's elected officials. For more than 24 years, \nAubrey worked for late Representatives Walter Flowers and Claude \nHarris, and most recently for me, on my own staff.\n  More than just an employee, Aubrey was a friend and a confidant. He \nwas loyal, had a lifetime of experience in Alabama, and was a true \nservant to the people of our state. I could never have asked for a more \ndedicated staff member or friend.\n  After leaving public service, Aubrey worked as president of \nTuscaloosa Insulation Company, and served as a member of the Tuscaloosa \nHome Builders Association. He was an avid sportsman, and attended as \nmany Alabama football games as possible.\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\n  Aubrey was a loving father, devoted community member, and friend to \nmost anyone he met. He will be missed by all who knew him, especially \nhis wife Dot, his daughter Suzanne, his son Greg, his grandchildren, \nand other family members and friends.\n  I'm glad I had the opportunity to know and work with Aubrey Lake. He \nwas a good friend, and I will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9993-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           REMEDIATION WASTE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nregarding efforts to amend the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act \nas it relates to remediation waste. The Majority Leader and the Chair \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee recently concluded that \nthere is not enough time to complete legislation in this area this \nCongress, due to the press of other business and the limited time \nremaining.\n  I would like to commend both the process and the progress that has \nbeen made this year in discussions concerning remediation waste \nlegislation. I also would like to commend Senators Lott, Chafee, Smith, \nLautenberg and Breaux for their roles in this process. I believe that \nthe RCRA hazardous waste cleanup program could be improved through \nresponsible reforms that tailor certain provisions of RCRA to hazardous \nwaste that is generated during cleanup. Targeted amendments in this \narea could promote cleanup, ensure meaningful opportunities for \ncommunity involvement, and reduce cleanup costs, without sacrificing \nprotection of human health and the environment. Republican and \nDemocratic staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \ntogether with representatives of the Administration, have for several \nmonths been engaged in productive, bi-partisan negotiations to reach \nagreement on targeted RCRA amendments in this important area. Despite \nthese efforts, there are still a number of issues yet to be resolved, \nwhich I had hoped we would resolve in the time remaining this Congress.\n  The Administration contributed significantly to the progress made \nthis year. We also received valuable input from representatives of \nvarious interests that would be affected by the legislation, including \nindustry, the environmental community, state and local governments and \ncommunities in the vicinity of hazardous waste cleanup sites. We need \nto continue close coordination with a range of interested persons.\n  I hope that next year we can resume this bi-partisan process. This \nyear's work creates a foundation for efforts next year to achieve \nresponsible reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9994-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING HARVEY FINKEL-STEIN'S RETIREMENT AS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF \n           EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE JEWISH HOME AND HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my \ncolleagues in recognizing Harvey Finkelstein, one of New York's most \nbeloved and esteemed health care executives, as he prepares for his \nretirement.

He has \nserved as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Jewish Home \nand Hospital since 1988. Prior to joining the Jewish Home and Hospital, \nHarvey was the Associate Executive Director of the Daughters of Jacob \nGeriatric Center and held positions with Long Island Jewish-Hillside \nMedical Center and the Queensboro Tuberculosis and Health Association. \nHis sharp intellect combined with his selfless and compassionate spirit \nhave made Harvey a unique leader who is valued and respected by all.\n  During Harvey's tenure as President and CEO, the Jewish Home and \nHospital has gained widespread recognition as an exemplary long term \ncare organization, developing a reputation of excellence for both its \nextensive continuum of senior care services and its innovative \ngeriatric education programs. Most important, it has remained ever \nfocused on its essential mission--providing its residents with the \nopportunity to live lives filled with dignity, meaning, and respect.\n  In addition to his professional responsibilities at the Jewish Home, \nHarvey has also made a wide range of important contributions to the New \nYork health care community. Harvey has taught extensively on topics \nrelated to geriatrics and long term care. His teaching includes classes \nat the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, the New School for Social \nResearch, The Brookdale Center on Aging of Hunter College and New York \nUniversity. Harvey has also published in Journal of Vision \nRehabilitation, Contemporary Administrator, and Journal of American \nCollege of Emergency Physicians. Harvey has been an active member of \nseveral provider associations including the Greater New York Hospital \nAssociation and the National Association of Jewish Aging Services. He \nalso advises the UJA-Federation of New York and the Council of Jewish \nFederations.\n  Mr. President, as Harvey Finkelstein looks toward his retirement, I \nask my colleagues to join with me in expressing their great \nappreciation and admiration for all of the contributions and \nachievements of this exceptional leader. We wish him and his family \nhealth and happiness in the upcoming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9994-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9994-S9995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n IN MEMORY OF MARYLANDERS MARK AND CAULEY CHAPMAN, DR. JONATHAN MANN, \n                     AND DR. MARY LOU CLEMENTS-MANN\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, and to all who are with us in the \nproceedings today, I rise with melancholy to pay tribute to four \nMarylanders who were killed in the tragic crash of Swissair Flight 111 \nlate Wednesday night, September 2, 1998. Dr. Jonathan Mann and Dr. Mary \nLou Clements-Mann lived in Columbia. Mark Chapman and Cauley lived in \nOlney.\n  Mark Chapman was an engineer, and his wife was a flight attendant for \nAmerican Airlines. They were on their way to Greece to visit his \nparents. Friends in their 10-house neighborhood in Olney tell stories \nabout their kindness and thoughtfulness, how the Chapmans kept everyone \nentertained and had the whole neighborhood over for backyard barbeques.\n  Mark and Cauley loved animals, and every morning Mrs. Chapman would \nbe out with her beagle Ruby trotting along on her daily walk. In a \nworld that too often lacks a sense of community, the Chapmans went out \nof their way to be a part of their community and to make others feel \nwelcome in it. According to one neighbor, ``Knowing Cauley, she was \nprobably helping out the other stewardesses on the plane.''\n  Dr. Jonathan Mann created the World Health Organization's AIDS \nprogram, and Dr. Mary Louise Clements-Mann was the director of the \nvaccine research at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. They \nwere partners in science and partners in life, having met at a \nscientific conference three years ago and married last year.\n  Their loss is felt deeply by the medical research community, and it \nis felt deeply by the community of caring they helped to create. More \nthan being dedicated to research, they were dedicated to the people \nthey were trying to help. They believed, as I do, that our policies \nshould reflect our values.\n  Dr. Mann was among the first to declare that AIDS was a disease that \nrightfully concerned all of us, that it did not recognize class, \ngender, or global boundaries. In 1984, he became director of an AIDS \nproject in the central African nation of Zaire (now the Congo). It was \nthere that he traced the transmission patterns and risk factors for \nAIDS. Unusual for a medical researcher, he also traced the political \nand social implications of this deadly disease. He spoke out about the \nconnection between AIDS and human rights, and he worked with \ngovernments to fight cruelty and discrimination against people with \nAIDS. In February 1987, he was appointed head of the WHO AIDS office, \nand he and his staff visited 77 nations in nine months to assess the \nepidemic.\n\n[[Page S9995]]\n\n  Early this year, Dr. Mann took on a new responsibility as dean of the \nSchool of Public Health at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences. \nHe has been described as `a dapper man who wore starched white shirts \nand red bow ties', who boarded the train every day to Philadelphia. \nSince January, he had also been a visiting professor at the Hopkins \nSchool of Public Health.\n  Dr. Clements-Mann had an equally stellar list of accomplishments and \na reputation as a gentle woman who could also be a tough taskmaster \nwhen it came to life-saving medical research. Born in Longview, Texas, \nshe graduated from Texas Tech with a degree in chemistry at a time when \nfew women were encouraged to consider science careers. She earned \nanother degree in chemistry from the University of Texas Southwestern \nMedical School in Dallas, and advanced degrees from the University of \nLondon and from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.\n  In 1986, she moved to Johns Hopkins to start and direct its vaccine \ncenter. She became one of the world's experts in developing vaccines \nagainst life-threatening diseases, from Hepatitis C to influenza. Her \nreputation was built on selecting vaccines for medical trials that had \nthe best chance of success, and one of the vaccines she helped develop \nwas just approved by the FDA last week. Even as an internationally \nfamous researcher, colleagues said she preferred to be called Mary Lou \nby co-workers and volunteers alike.\n  Dr. Clements-Mann loved to garden and they both loved to travel and \ngo camping. Neighbors in their Hickory Ridge neighborhood in Columbia \noften saw the two of them taking walks and holding hands. It is a \ntragedy that the world has been deprived of their knowledge, their \ncompassion, and their ability to affect public policy in the face of \nworldwide epidemics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9994-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nmen and women who serve in the United States Air Force as we celebrate \nthe 51st anniversary of its founding.\n  In 1947, Congress passed the National Security Act, creating the \nUnited States Air Force. Although military aviation units were around \nas early as 1907, these units were a division of the Army and the Navy. \nIt was not until forty years later that the Air Force was established \nas a separate military service. Ironically, President Harry Truman \nsigned the legislation creating the United States Air Force while \naboard the presidential aircraft, which later became known as Air Force \nOne. W. Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the Air Force \nand General Carl A. Spaatz became the first Chief of Staff of the Air \nForce.\n  The inherent strengths of air power--speed, global range, stealth, \nflexibility and precision--are crucial to the achievement of our \nmilitary goals in the world today. Through innovation, the Air Force is \nevolving into an air and space force that will be able to meet the \nchallenges of the next century. Working with the other Armed Forces, \nthe Air Force provides the citizens of the United States with the \nsecurity we enjoy as it watches over America's airspace. On the same \nday the Air Force was established, the Air National Guard was also \nborn, and seven months later, on April 14, 1948, the Air Force Reserve \nwas created. Today, these two are an integral part of the total Air \nForce.\n  Minnesota is home to two Air National Guard units, the 148th Fighter \nWing in Duluth and the 133rd Airlift Wing in the Twin Cities. The 133rd \nAirlift Wing was the first federally recognized Air National Guard \nflying unit. A division of the 133rd unit, the Security Forces \nSquadron, was awarded the Air National Guard's Outstanding Security \nForce Unit for 1994.\n  In addition, Minnesota has one Air Force Reserve unit, the 934th \nAirlift Wing in St. Paul. The Airlift Wing provides support for the \ntransporting of passengers and cargo around the world. In 1992, the \nbrave men and women of the 934th Airlift Wing provided airlift of \npassengers and cargo as part of a humanitarian relief effort in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina.\n  Mr. President, since its birth in 1947, the Air Force has shown the \nutmost dedication and service to this country, while protecting our \nnational interests. I truly appreciate its commitment to defending this \nnation and am honored today to pay tribute to the men and women of the \nAir Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S9995-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9995-S9996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the \nbudget scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office \nunder Section 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for \nSenate scorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First \nConcurrent Resolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the budget \nthrough August 31, 1998. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, \nand revenues, which are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 1998 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget (H. Con. \nRes. 84), show that current level spending is below the budget \nresolution by $17.1 billion in budget authority and above the budget \nresolution by $1.9 billion in outlays. Current level is $1.0 billion \nbelow the revenue floor in 1998 and $2.9 billion above the revenue \nfloor over the five years 1998-2002. The current estimate of the \ndeficit for purposes of calculating the maximum deficit amount is \n$176.4 billion, $2.9 billion above the maximum deficit amount for 1998 \nof $173.5 billion.\n  Since my last report, dated July 30, 1998, CBO has completed its \nestimate of the budget authority for the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century (P.L. 105-178). As a result, the current level of \nbudget authority has been reduced by $923 million. This report also \nincorporates the budget authority, outlay, and revenue impacts of the \nHomeowners' Protection Act (P.L. 105-216), the Credit Union Membership \nAccess Act (P.L. 105-219), and an Act to establish the United States \nCapitol Police Memorial Fund (P.L. 105-223).\n  The report follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report for fiscal year 1998 \n     shows the effects of Congressional action on the 1998 budget \n     and is current through August 31, 1998.

The Congress finds that progress on the peace \n     process in the Middle East is vitally important to United \n     States security interests in the region.

Furthermore, the Congress \n     recognizes that an economically and militarily secure Israel \n     serves the security interests of the United States, for a \n     secure Israel is an Israel which has the incentive and \n     confidence to continue pursuing the peace process. Therefore, \n     the Congress declares that, subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, it is the policy and the intention of the \n     United States that the funds provided in annual \n     appropriations for the Economic Support Fund which are \n     allocated to Israel shall not be less than the annual debt \n     repayment (interest and principal) from Israel to the United \n     States Government in recognition that such a principle serves \n     United States interests in the region.\n\n\n   prohibition on funding for abortions and involuntary sterilization\n\n       Sec. 518.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Indonesia is the World's 4th most populous nation, with \n     a population in excess of 200,000,000 people.\n       (2) Since 1997, political, economic, and social turmoil in \n     Indonesia has escalated.\n       (3) Indonesia is comprised of more than 13,000 islands \n     located between the mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia. \n     Indonesia occupies an important strategic location, \n     straddling vital sea lanes for communication and commercial \n     transportation including all or part of every major sea route \n     between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, more than 50 \n     percent of all international shipping trade, and sea lines of \n     communication used by the United States Pacific Command to \n     support operations in the Persian Gulf.\n       (4) Indonesia has been an important ally of the United \n     States, has made vital contributions to the maintenance of \n     regional peace and stability through its leading role in the \n     Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia \n     Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and has promoted \n     United States economic, political, and security interests in \n     Asia.\n       (5) In the 25 years before the onset of the recent \n     financial crisis in Asia, the economy of Indonesia grew at an \n     average rate of 7 percent per year.\n       (6) Since July 1997, the Indonesian rupiah has lost 70 \n     percent of its value, and the Indonesian economy is now at a \n     near standstill characterized by inflation, tight liquidity, \n     and rising unemployment.\n       (7) Indonesia has also faced a severe drought and massive \n     fires in the past year which have adversely affected its \n     ability to produce sufficient food to meet its needs.\n       (8) As a consequence of this economic instability and the \n     drought and fires, as many as 100,000,000 people in Indonesia \n     may experience food shortages, malnutrition, and possible \n     starvation as a result of being unable to purchase food. \n     These conditions increase the potential for widespread social \n     unrest in Indonesia.\n       (9) Following the abdication of Indonesia President Suharto \n     in May 1998, Indonesia is in the midst of a profound \n     political transition. The current president of Indonesia, \n     B.J. Habibie, has called for new parliamentary elections in \n     mid-1999, allowed the formation of new political parties, and \n     pledged to resolve the role of the military in Indonesian \n     society.\n       (10) The Government of Indonesia has taken several \n     important steps toward political reform and support of \n     democratic institutions, including support for freedom of \n     expression, release of political prisoners, formation of \n     political parties and trade unions, preparations for new \n     elections, removal of ethnic designations from identity \n     cards, and commitments to legal and civil service reforms \n     which will increase economic and legal transparency and \n     reduce corruption.\n       (11) To address the food shortages in Indonesia, the United \n     States Government has made more than 230,000 tons of food \n     available to Indonesia this year through grants and so-called \n     ``soft'' loans and has pledged support for additional wheat \n     and food to meet emergency needs in Indonesia.\n       (12) United States national security interests are well-\n     served by political stability in Indonesia and by friendly \n     relations between the United States and Indonesia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the decision of the Clinton Administration to make \n     available at least 1,500,000 tons of wheat, wheat products, \n     and rice for distribution to the most needy and vulnerable \n     Indonesians is vital to the well-being of all Indonesians;\n       (2) the Clinton Administration should work with the World \n     Food Program and nongovernmental organizations to design \n     programs to make the most effective use of food donations in \n     Indonesia and to expedite delivery of food assistance in \n     order to reach those in Indonesia most in need;\n       (3) the Clinton Administration should adopt a more active \n     approach in support of democratic institutions and processes \n     in Indonesia and provide assistance for continued economic \n     and political development in Indonesia, including--\n       (A) support for humanitarian programs aimed at preventing \n     famine, meeting the needs of the Indonesian people, and \n     inculcating social stability;\n       (B) leading a multinational effort (including the active \n     participation of Japan, the nations of Europe, and other \n     nations) to assist the programs referred to in subparagraph \n     (A);\n       (C) calling on donor nations and humanitarian and food aid \n     programs to make additional efforts to meet the needs of \n     Indonesia and its people while laying the groundwork for a \n     more open and participatory society in Indonesia;\n       (D) working with international financial institutions to \n     recapitalize and reform the banking system, restructure \n     corporate debt, and introduce economic and legal transparency \n     in Indonesia;\n       (E) urging the Government of Indonesia to remove, to the \n     maximum extent possible, barriers to trade and investment \n     which impede economic recovery in Indonesia, including \n     tariffs, quotas, export taxes, nontariff barriers, and \n     prohibitions against foreign ownership and investment;\n       (F) urging the Government of Indonesia to--\n       (i) recognize the importance of the participation of all \n     Indonesians, including ethnic and religious minorities, in \n     the political and economic life of Indonesia;\n       (ii) take appropriate action to assure the support and \n     protection of minority participation in the political, \n     social, and economic life of Indonesia; and\n       (iii) release individuals detained or imprisoned for their \n     political views;\n       (G) support for efforts by the Government of Indonesia to \n     cast a wide social safety net in order to provide relief to \n     the neediest Indonesians and to restore hope to those \n     Indonesians who have been harmed by the economic crisis in \n     Indonesia;\n       (H) support for efforts to build democracy in Indonesia in \n     order to strengthen political participation and the \n     development of legitimate democratic processes and the rule \n     of law in Indonesia, including support for organizations, \n     such as the Asia Foundation and the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, which can provide technical assistance in \n     developing and strengthening democratic political \n     institutions and processes in Indonesia;\n       (I) calling on the Government of Indonesia to repeal all \n     laws and regulations that discriminate on the basis of \n     religion or ethnicity and to ensure that all new laws are in \n     keeping with international standards on human rights; and\n       (J) calling on the Government of Indonesia to establish, \n     announce publicly, and adhere to a clear timeline for \n     parliamentary elections in Indonesia.\n       (c) Report.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     Congress a report containing the following:\n       (A) A description and assessment of the actions taken by \n     the Government of the United States to work with the \n     Government of Indonesia to further the objectives referred to \n     in subsection (b)(3).\n       (B) A description and assessment of the actions taken by \n     the Government of Indonesia to further such objectives.\n       (C) An evaluation of the implications of the matters \n     described and assessed under subparagraphs (A) and (B), and \n     any other appropriate matters, for relations between the \n     United States and Indonesia.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n\n          CONDEMNING ETHNIC VIOLENCE IN INDONESIA IN MAY 1998\n\n       Sec. 585. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) In May 1998, more than 1,200 people died in Indonesia \n     as a result of riots, targeted attacks, and violence in \n     Indonesia. According to numerous reports by human rights \n     groups, United Nations officials, and the press, ethnic \n     Chinese in Indonesia were specifically targeted in the riots \n     for attacks which included acts of brutality, looting, arson, \n     and rape.\n       (2) Credible reports indicate that, between May 13 and May \n     15, 1998, at least 150 Chinese women and girls, some as young \n     as 9 years of age, were systematically raped as part of a \n     campaign of racial violence in Indonesia, and 20 of these \n     women subsequently died from injuries incurred during these \n     rapes.\n       (3) Credible evidence indicates that these rapes were the \n     result of a systematic and organized operation and may well \n     have continued to the present time.\n       (4) Indonesia President Habibie has stated that he believes \n     the riots and rapes to be ``the most inhuman acts in the \n     history of the nation'', that they were ``criminal'' acts, \n     and that ``we will not accept it, we will not let it happen \n     again.''.\n       (5) Indonesian human rights groups have asserted that the \n     Indonesia Government failed to take action necessary to \n     control the riots, violence, and rapes directed against \n     ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and that some elements of the \n     Indonesia military may have participated in such acts.\n       (6) The Executive Director of the United Nations \n     Development Fund for Women has stated that the attacks were \n     an ``organized reaction to a crisis and culprits must be \n     brought to trial'' and that the systematic use of rape in the \n     riots ``is totally unacceptable . . . and even more \n     disturbing than rape war crimes, as Indonesia was not at war \n     with another country but caught in its own internal crisis''.\n       (7) The Indonesia Government has established the Joint \n     National Fact Finding Team to investigate the violence and \n     allegations of gang rapes, but there are allegations that the \n     investigation is moving slowly and that the Team lacks the \n     authority necessary to carry out an appropriate \n     investigation.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the mistreatment of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia and the \n     criminal acts carried out against them during the May 1998 \n     riots in Indonesia is deplorable and condemned;\n       (2) a complete, full, and fair investigation of such \n     criminal acts should be completed by\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\n     the earliest possible date, and those identified as \n     responsible for perpetrating such criminal acts should be \n     brought to justice;\n       (3) the investigation by the Government of Indonesia, \n     through its Military Honor Council, of those members of the \n     armed forces of Indonesia suspected of possible involvement \n     in the May 1998 riots, and of any member of the armed forces \n     of Indonesia who may have participated in criminal acts \n     against the people of Indonesia during the riots, is \n     commended and should be supported;\n       (4) the Government of Indonesia should take action to \n     assure--\n       (A) the full observance of the human rights of the ethnic \n     Chinese in Indonesia and of all other minority groups in \n     Indonesia;\n       (B) the implementation of appropriate measures to prevent \n     ethnic-related violence and rapes in Indonesia and to \n     safeguard the physical safety of the ethnic Chinese community \n     in Indonesia;\n       (C) prompt follow through on its announced intention to \n     provide damage loans to help rebuild businesses and homes for \n     those who suffered losses in the riots; and\n       (D) the provision of just compensation for victims of the \n     rape and violence that occurred during the May 1998 riots in \n     Indonesia, including medical care;\n       (5) the Clinton Administration and the United Nations \n     should provide support and assistance to the Government of \n     Indonesia, and to nongovernmental organizations, in the \n     investigations into the May 1998 riots in Indonesia in order \n     to expedite such investigations; and\n       (6) Indonesia should ratify the United Nations Convention \n     on Racial Discrimination, Torture, and Human Rights.\n       (c) Support For Investigations.--Of the amounts \n     appropriated by this Act for Indonesia, the Secretary of \n     State, after consultation with Congress, shall make available \n     such funds as the Secretary considers appropriate in order to \n     provide support and technical assistance to the Government of \n     Indonesia, and to independent nongovernmental organizations, \n     for purposes of conducting full, fair, and impartial \n     investigations into the allegations surrounding the riots, \n     violence, and rape of ethnic Chinese in Indonesia in May \n     1998.\n       (d) Report.--(1) Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     Congress a report containing the following:\n       (A) An assessment of--\n       (i) whether or not there was a systematic and organized \n     campaign of violence, including the use of rape, against the \n     ethnic Chinese community in Indonesia during the May 1998 \n     riots in Indonesia; and\n       (ii) the level and degree of participation, if any, of \n     members of the Government or armed forces of Indonesia in the \n     riots.\n       (B) An assessment of the adequacy of the actions taken by \n     the Government of Indonesia to investigate the May 1998 riots \n     in Indonesia, bring the perpetrators of the riots to justice, \n     and ensure that similar riots do not recur.\n       (C) An evaluation of the implications of the matters \n     assessed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) for relations \n     between the United States and Indonesia.\n       (2) The report under this subsection shall be submitted in \n     unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.\n\n\n PROHIBITION ON ASSISTANCE TO THE PALESTINIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION\n\n       Sec. 586.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) On December 21, 1988, 270 people, including 189 United \n     States citizens, were killed in a terrorist bombing on Pan Am \n     Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.\n       (2) Britain and the United States indicted 2 Libyan \n     intelligence agents--Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen \n     Khalifa Fhimah--in 1991 and sought their extradition from \n     Libya to the United States or the United Kingdom to stand \n     trial for this heinous terrorist act.\n       (3) The United Nations Security Council called for the \n     extradition of the suspects in Security Council Resolution \n     731 and imposed sanctions on Libya in Security Council \n     Resolutions 748 and 883 because Libyan leader, Colonel \n     Muammar Qadaffi, refused to transfer the suspects to either \n     the United States or the United Kingdom to stand trial.\n       (4) The sanctions in Security Council Resolutions 748 and \n     883 include a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline, a \n     ban on flights into and out of Libya by other nations' \n     airlines, a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, \n     and certain oil equipment to Libya, and a freeze on Libyan \n     government funds in other countries.\n       (5) Colonel Qaddafi has continually refused to extradite \n     the suspects to either the United States or the United \n     Kingdom and has insisted that he will only transfer the \n     suspects to a third and neutral country to stand trial.\n       (6) On August 24, 1998, the United States and the United \n     Kingdom proposed that Colonel Qadaffi transfer the suspects \n     to the Netherlands, where they would stand trial before a \n     Scottish court, under Scottish law, and with a panel of \n     Scottish judges.\n       (7) The United States-United Kingdom proposal is consistent \n     with those previously endorsed by the Organization of African \n     Unity, the League of Arab States, the Non-Aligned Movement, \n     and the Islamic Conference.\n       (8) The United Nations Security Council endorsed the United \n     States-United Kingdom proposal on August 27, 1998, in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1192.\n       (9) The United States Government has stated that this \n     proposal is nonnegotiable and has called on Colonel Qadaffi \n     to respond\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\n     promptly, positively, and unequivocally to this proposal by \n     ensuring the timely appearance of the two accused individuals \n     in the Netherlands for trial before the Scottish court.\n       (10) The United States Government has called on Libya to \n     ensure the production of evidence, including the presence of \n     witnesses before the court, and to comply fully with all the \n     requirements of the United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions.\n       (11) Secretary of State Albright has said that the United \n     States will urge a multilateral oil embargo against Libya in \n     the United Nations Security Council if Colonel Muammar \n     Qadaffi does not transfer the suspects to the Netherlands to \n     stand trial.\n       (12) The United Nations Security Council will convene on \n     October 30, 1998, to review sanctions imposed on Libya.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Colonel Qadaffi should promptly transfer the indicted \n     suspects Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah to \n     the Netherlands to stand trial before the Scottish court;\n       (2) the United States Government should remain firm in its \n     commitment not to negotiate with Colonel Qadaffi on any of \n     the details of the proposal approved by the United Nations in \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1192; and\n       (3) if Colonel Qadaffi does not transfer the indicted \n     suspects Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah to \n     the Netherlands by October 29, 1998, the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations should--\n       (A) introduce a resolution in the United Nations Security \n     Council to impose a multilateral oil embargo against Libya;\n       (B) actively promote adoption of the resolution by the \n     United Nations Security Council; and\n       (C) assure that a vote will occur in the United Nations \n     Security Council on such a resolution.\n\n\n                   DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE IN NIGERIA\n\n       Sec. 591. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) The bilateral development assistance program in Nigeria \n     has been insufficiently funded and staffed, and the United \n     States has missed opportunities to promote democracy and good \n     governance as a result.\n       (2) The recent political upheaval in Nigeria necessitates a \n     new strategy for United States bilateral assistance program \n     in that country that is focused on promoting a transition to \n     democracy.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President, acting through the United States Agency for \n     International Development, should--\n       (1) develop a new strategy for United States bilateral \n     assistance for Nigeria that is focused on the development of \n     civil society and the rule of law and that involves a broad \n     cross-section of Nigerian society but does not provide for \n     any direct assistance to the Government of Nigeria, other \n     than humanitarian assistance, unless and until that country \n     successfully completes a transition to civilian, democratic \n     rule;\n       (2) increase the number of United States personnel at such \n     Agency's office in Lagos, Nigeria, from within the current, \n     overall staff resources of such Agency in order for such \n     office to be sufficiently staffed to carry out paragraph (1); \n     and\n       (3) consider the placement of such Agency's personnel \n     elsewhere in Nigeria.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President, acting through the \n     United States Agency for International Development, shall \n     submit to the Committees on Appropriations and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committees on Appropriations \n     and International Relations of the House of Representatives a \n     report on the strategy developed under subsection (b)(1).\n\n\n               COUNTERTERRORISM COOPERATION CERTIFICATION\n\n       Sec. 592. Section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 2781) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``that the President'' \n     and all that follows and inserting ``unless the President \n     determines and certifies to Congress for purposes of that \n     fiscal year that the government of the country is cooperating \n     fully with the United States, or is taking adequate actions \n     on its own, to help achieve United States antiterrorism \n     objectives.'';\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (b) as subsection (e);\n       (3) by inserting after subsection (a), as so amended, the \n     following new subsections (b), (c), and (d):\n       ``(b) Requirement for Continuing Cooperation.--(1) \n     Notwithstanding the submittal of a certification with respect \n     to a country for purposes of a fiscal year under subsection \n     (a), the prohibition in that subsection shall apply to the \n     country for the remainder of that fiscal year if the \n     President determines and certifies to Congress that the \n     government of the country has not continued to cooperate \n     fully with United States, or to take adequate actions on its \n     own, to help achieve United States antiterrorism objectives.\n       ``(2) A certification under paragraph (1) shall take effect \n     on the date of its submittal to Congress.\n       ``(c) Schedule for Certifications.--(1) The President \n     shall, to the maximum extent practicable, submit a \n     certification with respect to a country for purposes of a \n     fiscal year under subsection (a) not later than September 1 \n     of the year in which that fiscal year begins.\n       ``(2) The President may submit a certification with respect \n     to a county under subsection (a) at any time after the date \n     otherwise specified in paragraph (1) if the President \n     determines that circumstances warrant the submittal of the \n     certification at such later date.\n       ``(d) Considerations for Certifications.--In making a \n     determination with respect to the government of a country \n     under subsection (a) or subsection (b), the President shall \n     consider--\n       ``(1) the government's record of--\n       ``(A) apprehending, bringing to trial, convicting, and \n     punishing terrorists in areas under its jurisdiction;\n       ``(B) taking actions to dismantle terrorist organizations \n     in areas under its jurisdiction and to cut off their sources \n     of funds;\n       ``(C) condemning terrorist actions and the groups that \n     conduct and sponsor them;\n       ``(D) refusing to bargain with or make concessions to \n     terrorist organizations;\n       ``(E) isolating and applying pressure on states that \n     sponsor and support terrorism to force such states to \n     terminate their support for terrorism;\n       ``(F) assisting the United States in efforts to apprehend \n     terrorists who have targeted United States nationals and \n     interests;\n       ``(G) sharing information and evidence with United States \n     law enforcement agencies during the investigation of \n     terrorist attacks against United States nationals and \n     interests;\n       ``(H) extraditing to the United States individuals in its \n     custody who are suspected of participating in the planning, \n     funding, or conduct of terrorist attacks against United \n     States nationals and interests; and\n       ``(I) sharing intelligence with the United States about \n     terrorist activity, in general, and terrorist activity \n     directed against United States nationals and interests, in \n     particular; and\n       ``(2) any other matters that the President considers \n     appropriate.''; and\n       (4) in subsection (e), as so redesignated, by striking \n     ``national interests'' and inserting ``national security \n     interests''.\n\n\n               EQUALITY FOR ISRAEL IN THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n       Sec. 593.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Iraq is continuing efforts to mask the extent of its \n     weapons of mass destruction and missile programs;\n       (2) proposals to relax the current international inspection \n     regime would have potentially dangerous consequences for \n     international security; and\n       (3) Iraq has demonstrated time and again that it cannot be \n     trusted to abide by international norms or by its own \n     agreements, and that the only way the international community \n     can be assured of Iraqi compliance is by ongoing inspection.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the international agencies charged with inspections in \n     Iraq--the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the \n     United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) should maintain \n     vigorous inspections, including surprise inspections, within \n     Iraq; and\n       (2) the United States should oppose any efforts to ease the \n     inspections regimes on Iraq until there is clear, credible \n     evidence that the Government of Iraq is no longer seeking to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means of \n     delivering them.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a report to \n     Congress on the United States Government's assessment of \n     Iraq's nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs \n     and its efforts to move toward procurement of nuclear weapons \n     and the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction. The \n     report shall also--\n       (1) assess the United States view of the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency's action team reports and other IAEA \n     efforts to monitor the extent and nature of Iraq's nuclear \n     program; and\n       (2) include the United States Government's opinion on the \n     value of maintaining the ongoing inspection regime rather \n     than replacing it with a passive monitoring system.\n\n\n                     SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING IRAN\n\n       Sec. 597. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) according to the Department of State, Iran continues to \n     support international terrorism, providing training, \n     financing, and weapons to such terrorist groups as Hizballah, \n     Islamic Jihad and Hamas;\n       (2) Iran continues to oppose the Arab-Israeli peace process \n     and refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist;\n       (3) Iran continues aggressively to seek weapons of mass \n     destruction and the missiles to deliver them;\n       (4) it is long-standing United States policy to offer \n     official government-to-government dialogue with the Iranian \n     regime, such offers having been repeatedly rebuffed by \n     Tehran;\n       (5) more than a year after the election of President \n     Khatemi, Iranian foreign policy continues to threaten \n     American security and that of our allies in the Middle East; \n     and\n       (6) despite repeated offers and tentative steps toward \n     rapprochement with Iran by the Clinton Administration, \n     including a decision to waive sanctions under the Iran-Libya \n     Sanctions Act and the President's veto of the Iran Missile \n     Proliferation Sanctions Act, Iran has failed to reciprocate \n     in a meaningful manner.\n       (b) Therefore it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Administration should make no concessions to the \n     government of Iran unless and until that government moderates \n     its objectionable policies, including taking steps to end its \n     support of international terrorism, opposition to the Middle \n     East peace process, and the development and proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery; and\n       (2) there should be no change in United States policy \n     toward Iran until there is credible and sustained evidence of \n     a change in Iranian policies.\n\n\n   JOINT UNITED STATES-CANADA COMMISSION ON CATTLE, BEEF, AND DAIRY \n                                PRODUCTS\n\n       Sec. 598.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) North Korea has been active in developing new \n     generations of medium-range and intermediate-range ballistic \n     missiles, including both the Nodong and Taepo Dong class \n     missiles.\n       (2) North Korea is not an adherent to the Missile \n     Technology Control Regime, actively cooperates with Iran and \n     Pakistan in ballistic missile programs, and has declared its \n     intention to continue to export ballistic missile technology.\n       (3) North Korea has shared technology involved in the Taepo \n     Dong I missile program with Iran, which is concurrently \n     developing the Shahab-3 intermediate-range ballistic missile.\n       (4) North Korea is developing the Taepo Dong II \n     intermediate-range ballistic missile, which is expected to \n     have sufficient range to put at risk United States \n     territories, forces, and allies throughout the Asia-Pacific \n     area.\n       (5) Multistage missiles like the Taepo Dong class missile \n     can ultimately be extended to intercontinental range.\n       (6) The bipartisan Commission to Assess the Ballistic \n     Missile Threat to the United States emphasized the need for \n     the United States intelligence community and United States \n     policy makers to review the methodology by which they assess \n     foreign missile programs in order to guard against surprise \n     developments with respect to such programs.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) North Korea should be forcefully condemned for its \n     August 31, 1998, firing of a Taepo Dong I intermediate-range \n     ballistic missile over the sovereign territory of another \n     country, specifically Japan, an event that demonstrated an \n     advanced capability for employing multistage missiles, which \n     are by nature capable of extended range, including \n     intercontinental range;\n       (2) the United States should reassess its cooperative space \n     launch programs with countries that continue to assist North \n     Korea and Iran in their ballistic missile and cruise missile \n     programs;\n       (3) any financial or technical assistance provided to North \n     Korea should take into account the continuing conduct by that \n     county of activities which destabilize the region, including \n     the missile firing referred to in paragraph (1), continued \n     submarine incursions into South Korea territorial waters, and \n     violations of the demilitarized zone separating North Korea \n     and South Korea;\n       (4) the recommendations of the Commission to Assess the \n     Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States should be \n     incorporated into the analytical processes of the United \n     States intelligence community as soon as possible; and\n       (5) the United States should accelerate cooperative theater \n     missile defense programs with Japan.\n\n\n    SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT BY THE INTERNATIONAL \n        TELECOMMUNICATION UNION OF WORLD STANDARDS FOR WIRELESS \n                      TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES\n\n       Sec. 599D.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. I want to \nexplain, again, what transpired just a couple of moments ago with \nregard to our unanimous consent request.\n  For the information of all Senators, we made the request that the \nSenate have the opportunity to take up the HMO reform bill, the House-\npassed HMO reform bill, Calendar No. 505, and that it be the pending \nbusiness every day after the completion of the legislative business as \noutlined by the majority leader and the distinguished Senator from Utah \ntoday.\n  Why are we suggesting this? We are proposing this because many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have said that we do not have \ntime to take up a careful consideration of HMO reform; we don't have \nthe ability to consider a number of amendments that ought to be \nconsidered with legislation as complex as this.\n  We understand that the Senate has spent days on other bills--150 \namendments on the defense bill, over 100 amendments on the highway \nbill, and over 50 amendments on just about every appropriations bill \neach. But the Republican leadership has said all we ought to have on \nHMO reform is three amendments. Why? Because we don't have time. That \nhas been their premise. We don't have time to deal with this issue, but \nwe have time to deal with a missile defense bill that we will debate in \nthe morning, that would commit hundreds of billions of dollars over the \ncourse of many years to a missile system that has failed every single \ntime it has been tested to date.\n  The only criteria we would use to evaluate that system is \ntechnological feasibility, regardless of cost, regardless of \neffectiveness, and regardless of its implications for treaties around \nthe world. Our Republican colleagues are asking us to commit to a \nmissile defense system, opposed by the Pentagon, that would commit \nhundreds of billions of dollars. That is what the vote is about \ntomorrow, and we have time for it. But we don't have time for dealing \ndirectly with the concerns of millions of Americans who day by day are \nshut out of a health system because their insurance company is playing \ndoctor.\n  We are simply saying, if we don't have time, let's make time. Let's \ndo what others have already done in past Congresses and certainly in \nother situations where production becomes a problem. Let us add a \nsecond shift. Let us address this issue on the second shift. Let's work \nlonger. Let's make more hours. Let's do what we must to complete our \nwork.\n  It is only 6:20, and Senators have already left for the day. We \ndidn't have a vote until 3:30 this afternoon to accommodate Senators \nwho were traveling. Senators have just arrived. I am sure they would be \nmore than willing to stay for a few hours more to debate and to \nconsider carefully the HMO reform bill--6:20 in the evening and people \nare gone. Tomorrow we start with a vote at 9:30. We will have another \nvote at 5 o'clock, and we may be gone again.\n  Mr. President, we are simply asking our colleagues to put in a full \nday's work, to do what others would do under these circumstances--to \nadd a second shift, to work overtime, to complete our work in what days \nwe have left in this session of Congress.\n  We will continue to push for this approach and offer it in a sequence \nof requests simply to make the point that at 6:20 in the afternoon, our \nwork shouldn't be done. At 6:20 in the afternoon, we shouldn't be \nleaving. I don't understand why we couldn't have completed our work on \ncampaign finance reform. I don't understand why we shouldn't be on the \nfloor debating that issue right now. But everybody is gone, and the \nclock keeps ticking and the calendar pages turn, and time runs out.\n  We can run out the clock, but there is no reason why we can't make \nthat clock work harder. There isn't any reason why we can't work \nlonger, and we will make every effort to assure that the Senate does \nits job. I regret very much that we are not doing it tonight. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/08/senate-section/article/S10043-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9 A.M.
