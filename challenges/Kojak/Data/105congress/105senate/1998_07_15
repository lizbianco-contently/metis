Mr. President, in today's USA Today there is an article \nwhich states there is a possibility that on a live site, a web site--\nand I emphasize ``possibility''; that is being advertised--that two 18-\nyear-olds will have sex live on the Internet on August 4.\n  It also noted that there is considerable doubt about the validity of \nthis web site and, in fact, the entire site may be a hoax. For the sake \nof this Nation, I hope it is nothing but a hoax. If it is, it is \nneither clever nor humorous, and if it is not, then something has to be \ndone, I think, to protect our children from witnessing this event.\n  Again, I want to emphasize, I hope that this is a hoax and nothing \nmore. But what it does is highlight the problem that exists concerning \nthe proliferation of pornography on the Internet, some of that \npornography being child pornography and some of it being the kind of \nobscenity that the U.S. Supreme Court has stated is beyond \nconstitutional protections.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article in this \nmorning's USA Today be printed in the Record. It is entitled ``Net to \nbreak ground in virgin territory; But many suspect site is hoax.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, July 15, 1998]\n\n Net To Break Ground in Virgin Territory--But Many Suspect Site Is Hoax\n\n                           (By Karen Thomas)\n\n       Thought a woman giving birth on the Internet was \n     outrageous?\n       Now a Web site is saying it will broadcast a couple, \n     purported to be 18-year-old virgins named Mike and Diane, \n     having sex for the first time Aug. 4.\n       But many posting messages on the site were skeptical. \n     ``This page is a money-making hoax,'' wrote one visitor. \n     ``Mike and Diane are 36-year-old porn stars.''\n       Visitors also noted that the couple, pictured in bathing \n     suits with faces obscured, looked too perfect and well-\n     developed to be average 18-year-olds. Other details sounded \n     like a soap opera script: They haven't told their parents \n     their plans; one father is a minister; the teens are both \n     honor students\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\n     and ``All-American'' kids; they're both active in school and \n     church. Neither was available to talk to reporters Tuesday.\n       The idea for the stunt was Diane's, says Oscar Wells, a \n     California Web page designer who says he met Diane in an on-\n     line chat room during the Internet birth last month. ``She \n     thought (the birth) was educational but said if they showed \n     someone making love, it would be considered obscene. She made \n     the offhand remark, `If I could, I'd lose my virginity on \n     line to make the point.' I said, `If you're serious, I can \n     facilitate that.' ''\n       The ``Our First Time'' site is hosted by Wisconsin-based \n     The Enchanted Web. Owner Craig Brittan says most of his \n     customers are adult Web sites.\n       Among those expressing outrage Tuesday was Sen. John \n     McCain, R-Ariz., who called the announcement ``disgraceful . \n     . . garbage.'' He is the sponsor of a bill that would require \n     libraries and schools receiving federal funds to install \n     filtering software on public computers. ``This will provide \n     the impetus to get legislation done.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are not talking about censorship here. \nI want to emphasize, I do not support censorship in any form, and we \nare not talking about that. What we are talking about is legislation \nthat would require schools and libraries to have some kind of filtering \ndevice on their computers. Children are not allowed into ``Adult Only'' \nstores that sell and make available adult material. Children are not \nallowed to purchase ``Adult Only'' magazines. And our society has \ndecided, in its collective wisdom, that we should let children be \nchildren as long as possible and not expose them to certain activities \nand events.\n  If individual parents want to make such information available to \nchildren, that is their choice. I do not begrudge them that. But \nchildren should not be allowed to enter school or a public library and \ngain access to material that their parents would never allow them to \nsee and that most in society believe is inappropriate for those who are \nyet to be adults. It is for that reason I urge my colleagues to support \nand pass soon S. 1619, the Internet School Filtering Act. Senator \nHollings, the ranking member of the committee, along with Senators \nCoats and Murray, has joined me in introducing this legislation. I \nthank them for their support.\n  A Government program known as the e-rate provides Federal subsidies \nto schools and libraries so that they can receive discounted Internet \naccess. This legislation would require these institutions benefiting \nfrom this program to restrict children's access to harmful Internet \ncontent through the use of a filtering device on their computers.\n  These institutions would be free to choose from a myriad of filtering \ntools that are now available, and they alone would determine what \nmaterials are inappropriate for children based on local community \nstandards.\n  The Commerce Department recently found that more than 100 million \npeople are now using the Internet and Internet usage is doubling every \n100 days. We can expect children to comprise a large portion of these \nnew users as the e-rate and other Government and private programs help \nmake Internet access possible for schools and libraries across the \ncountry.\n  What troubles me is that schools and libraries are availing \nthemselves of enormous Government subsidies to make the Internet more \naccessible to children, and at the same time they are attempting to \nundermine our effort to protect our children from harmful on-line \nmaterial.\n  From the outset, these groups have opposed the legislation and have \nargued in favor of an ``acceptable use policy.''\n  I don't agree that would be an adequate means of protecting children \nfrom the thousands of pornographic sites available on the World Wide \nWeb. I believe implementing a use policy alone would be completely \nineffective.\n  Mr. President, we must act now to require the use of filters. We must \ntake immediate steps to prevent the Internet from doing more harm than \ngood by bringing such offensive materials into our Nation's schools and \nlibraries.\n  Again, I submit for the Record material off a web site called ``Our \nFirst Time,'' which is entitled, ``Tuesday, August 4, 1998, World and \nInternet History Will Be Made,'' and it begins, ``Come and meet Diane \nand Mike, two 18-year-old honor students.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this web site material be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Our First time\n\n\n On Tuesday, August 4, 1998 at 6 p.m. Pacific Time, World and Internet \n                         History WIll Be Made!\n\n       Come and meet Diane and Mike, two 18 year old ``Honor'' \n     students who have recently graduated from high school, and \n     are looking forward to starting college in the fall. They are \n     as close to being ``typical All-American'' kids as you can \n     get. Active in school and church. Well liked by family, \n     friends, and their community--but sexually, they are both \n     virgins. Their lives are going to change in a unique and \n     dramatic way. They are about to leave the safety of youth, \n     accept the challenges of adulthood, and take that frigthening \n     . . . but wonderful, step into adult sexuality. There's one \n     big difference . . . they are going to let the world come \n     along and witness their lives over a 18 day period as this \n     adventure unfolds, when they lose their virginity together. . \n     . .\n\n\n                        why are they doing this?\n\n       Recently, Diane & Mike witnessed the live birth of a child \n     on the Internet. They then decided to make this point--\n       ``The live birth of a child on the Internet was a beautiful \n     event. We want to show that the act of making love, which is \n     the first step that brought that live birth about, is just as \n     beautiful--and nothing to be ashamed of.''\n       The ``Our First Time'' website will open on July 18, 1998--\n     and will follow the daily adventures of Diane & Mike for 18 \n     days, as they meet the challenges of making their ``statement \n     of love'' on August 4.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I hope this is a hoax. I hope it is not \ntrue. If it is true, then I can't tell you how disturbed all of us \nshould be and will be, but it is also indicative that if even a hoax \nlike this, if it is a hoax, should be proposed, it shows there is a \nsignificant problem in America today.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will do something about it. I thank the \nChair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to join \nmy colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, in urging the Senate to \nadopt S. 1619, the child-safe Internet bill.\n  Since I have been here for the last 6 years, I have worked long and \nhard to get computers and technology into our schools. I have sponsored \nlegislation to allow surplus Government computers to be put into \nschools. I have worked hard to have the e-rate established so that many \nof our schools can be connected to the Internet. I have been out in \nschools, and I know personally what a great educational tool the \ntechnology and Internet system is that we have available today.\n  I want our students and I want our teachers to have access to this \ninformation. But Senator McCain is absolutely correct. There is a small \namount of information on the Internet that should not be there to which \nour young children have unfettered access.\n  S. 1619, the child-safe Internet bill, simply requires any school or \nlibrary that uses the e-rate, uses taxpayer money to put technology in, \nbe required to have a filtering device so that inappropriate material \nis not seen by young children.\n  The filtering device is a local control device. The school district--\nthe schools--will determine which filtering device and how to use it at \ntheir own school. The same with the libraries.\n  This is an issue on which I have worked long and hard. I care deeply \nabout the fact that many of our young children today and, frankly, many \nof our parents want to use the Internet but they don't know how to \nwithout getting into information or having their children have access \nto information that is simply inappropriate.\n  I talked with a seventh grade teacher several weeks ago who turned \noff the Internet in her classroom because she said it is simply \nimpossible to watch 30 young students at their computers all of the \ntime. She did not want a situation where a child got into a \npornographic or inappropriate site, went home, complained to their \nparent, have a parent come screaming back to her classroom, and she \nwould be responsible for that. She turned off the Internet.\n  This is going to cause concern among all of our educational \nfacilities across our country if teachers don't have the kind of \ninformation available without a filtering device.\n  The bill is simple. It is common sense. It is the right way to go, \nand I\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\nurge all of our colleagues to push to have this bill come to the floor \nand to pass it. It is the right way to go.\n  I did oppose the CDA Act from several years ago. I knew it was \nunconstitutional. I knew it would be thrown out. We cannot afford to go \nthrough that kind of debate again. This is a problem that needs to be \nanswered today, and the child-safe Internet bill does it in a \ncommonsense, safe way. Most parents would not send a child to a \nplayground in their local community unsupervised. We cannot allow our \nyoung children to be in the Internet unsupervised. The child-safe \nInternet bill is the right way to go. It is a local control way to make \nour technology work for all students, and I urge all of my colleagues \nto be supportive of this approach. I urge our leadership to bring it to \nthe floor as soon as possible.\n\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to stand and join my colleagues from \nArizona and Washington in voicing concerns about the spread of \npornography on the Internet and the general direction in which the \ninformation superhighway is moving.\n  Like my colleagues, I am very troubled by the story that USA Today \ncarried this morning about a particular web site--\nwww.ourfirsttime.com--that is promising to broadcast a video feed of \ntwo 18-year-old high school graduates having sexual intercourse for the \nfirst time as it happens next month.\n  As Senator McCain indicated, it may be that this site is a hoax, but \nit makes a statement about the Internet and the values in cyberspace \nwhich is all too real, because it shows that there are practically no \nstop signs on the information superhighway.\n  The important point here is that two teenagers could quite easily \ndecide to do this and invite every wired American child effectively to \na live sex show, regardless of their age, which tells us that there are \nno recognizable boundaries in cyberspace, no common standards of \ndecency or taste, or any shared sense of accountability. Anyone can do \njust about anything, and they often do.\n  This is no revelation to experienced ``netizens'' who are well aware \nof the wide array of sites concerning bomb-making, bestiality, and many \nother expressions of antisocial behavior and deviancy. They know that \nthe net, while offering incredible riches of information, education, \nand communication, has also managed to catch just about every form of \ndepravity and antisocial behavior and put it on display for all the \nworld and our children to see.\n  Yet, for many nonwired Americans, the extremes of online perversity \nmay be news, and these citizens, particularly the parents, have every \nright to be fearful about what is lurking around the net's next corner.\n  What they will find, I am afraid, is not just more and more \npornography for kids to latch on to, but less and less moral certainty, \nfewer bright lines of right and wrong, the kind that are critical to \nliving in a free, decent, civil society. One of those bright lines we \nnever used to question was our responsibility as adults to protect our \nchildren from harm, both physical and moral, which meant shielding them \nfrom violence and carefully setting sexual boundaries for them as they \ngrow.\n  In recent years, our commitment to this common value seems to have \nweakened, giving rise to a popular culture that is replete with gunplay \nand foreplay, with violence and public displays and comments on all \nforms of sexual behavior, and it teaches children the worst kind of \nlessons about what is acceptable. Today, unfortunately, this \nextraordinary development in our lives, the Internet, which has so \nenriched our lives in so many ways, has also become the highest tech \ndistillation of this anything-goes mentality.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Murray have been forceful advocates for \ndrawing basic lines of online decency and setting basic standards of \nonline behavior. I applaud their leadership on this front. In \nparticular, I appreciate their efforts to promote responsible use of \nthe Internet at schools and libraries. I hope we have a chance to \nconsider their legislation on the floor soon.\n  Mr. President, in the best of all worlds, which is to say what we \nhope this online world might be, the responsibility for drawing lines \nand setting standards really should fall to the leaders of the Internet \ncommunity.\n  I have said over and over again in my comments about television and \nvideo games and records, for instance, that I am extremely reluctant to \nresort to governmental restrictions on speech or any forms of \nexpression and much prefer self-regulation. Also, given the \nsophistication of the net's underlying technology, I doubt that a \nlegally mandated solution to the pornography problem will be as \neffective as we would want it to be in reaching our common goal of \nprotecting children.\n  It was for these reasons that I voted against the Communications \nDecency Act, and it was for those reasons that I recently began working \nwith Representative Rick White of Washington State to push the Internet \ncommunity to get moving on this issue. Nine days ago, we sent a letter \nto the major participants in last December's Online Summit expressing \nour concern about the industry's lack of action and calling on them to \ncollaborate on a comprehensive plan to help parents keep their kids \nsafe online. We made it clear that we did not want to pursue \nlegislation but that we, along with a host of other Members of Congress \nfrom both parties, would have no choice but to vote for Government \nstandards if the industry did not respond with an effective solution.\n  So, in sum, Mr. President, we are still waiting for a response to our \nletter. My hope is that the news about the ``our first time,'' and the \nforcefulness of the statements we are making today, will help to focus \nthe Internet community's attention on the seriousness of this problem \nand prod them to produce some tangible results. In the meantime, I hope \nour comments will raise the awareness of America's parents about the \nthreat that the Internet can pose to children and encourage them to pay \ncloser attention to their children's online activities.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I believe there is no further business \nbefore the Senate. I move we----\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I just want to join my colleagues here in \nurging our leaders and urging the Senate to move forward on legislation \nthat has been debated and discussed and passed by the Senate that needs \nto be revisited. The Supreme Court struck down language I offered more \nthan a year ago that was passed by this body by a 84-16 margin, passed \nby the House of Representatives, and signed by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  That legislation attempts to address the commercial purveyors of \npornography over the Internet--as invasive a practice as anything that \nwe have seen. It makes the corner pornography shop pale in comparison \nin terms of access to some of the rawest, most explicit material that \nis available today, and it makes it available to children through the \nclick of a mouse--in their room, in their home room, in their library, \nwherever a computer terminal is placed. It is easy access.\n  In fact, it is an invasive practice that even the most innocent of \ntyped-in requests can bring a flood of material that should never be \naccessible to children. It is even questionable whether it should be \naccessible to adults. The first amendment puts some pretty severe \nrestrictions on us in terms of what we can do.\n  We carefully drafted and designed our Internet pornography bill to \naddress first amendment concerns. For some reason, the Court chose to \ndistinguish the Internet from other forms of communication, and the \nvery standard which the Court approved for telephone dial-a-porn \nmessages was rejected for computer messages, saying that the Internet \nis a completely different mode of communication, not as invasive as the \ntelephone.\n  I think the Court is behind the times in terms of understanding how \nthe computer works. I understand that. I am of the generation that is \nnot quite sure even how to turn the thing on. For the younger \ngeneration, it is as easy and accessible and as comfortable for them to \noperate as for those of us who learned to drive a car when we were\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\nyoung or the technology that we adapted to in our generation.\n  Nevertheless, the Court has ruled. We took that ruling. We modified \nthe language to comply with the Court's restrictions. I have been \nattempting to bring this bill to the floor for several months. We have \nbeen blocked in doing so, not because it does not enjoy a majority of \nthe vote but because the computer industry and the Internet industry do \nnot want any restraint whatsoever.\n  We are trying to protect the innocence of children. We are trying to \ngive parents a tool by which they can protect their children. We are \ntrying to put penalties in place which will allow us to enforce \nrestrictions against commercial purveyors of pornography that is \nharmful to minors. We have revised the standard to comply with the \nSupreme Court dictates, and we trust that this new legislation will \npass Court muster. But in order to do so, it has to pass this body \nfirst. I think we are at the point of resolving the holds and the \ndifferences of opinion on how to proceed with this legislation.\n  Senator McCain has legislation which provides access to software \npackages that are a help, but an imperfect help, in terms of dealing \nwith the problem. I have legislation which I guess would be described \nas a stick to go along with the McCain carrot, the hammer to lay down \nthe enforcement and put the penalties in place, put the restrictions in \nplace. I think the two are very necessary for us to try to get a handle \non this problem. It will not fully solve the problem.\n  The first line of defense has to be the family. It has to be the \nparents, has to be their oversight of what their children have access \nto--not only in the home but in the school, in the library. It is \ndisappointing that schools and libraries--in particular, library \nassociations--have opposed what we are trying to do. We think we have a \nconsensus now on how to move forward. I am pleased that we are closing \nin on that and urge our colleagues to support the efforts that will \ntake place shortly.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8161-6", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to actually announce to the \nSenate and to, at least from a distance, celebrate the 90th birthday of \none of the great citizens of my State of Michigan, and also one of the \ntruly great citizens of America, Max Fisher.\n  Mr. Fisher is a friend of many of us who have served in public \noffice--certainly in Michigan, and even here at the national level--\nbecause of his longstanding involvement in the political process. But \nhe is much more than a political activist, he is a business leader of \ngreat renown, having built very successful companies in our State and \naround the country. He has grown those companies and employed many, \nmany Americans in a variety of different functions.\n  After establishing his business success, he then turned his attention \nto our State of Michigan and, most particularly, to his hometown of \nDetroit. There, for the last several decades, he has been one of the \ncommunity's great leaders, very much involved in the development of \nDetroit, the rebirth of Detroit after the riots in that city in the \nsixties. He has been very active in the governance of southeastern \nMichigan in a variety of ways, investing his own time and resources in \nmany worthwhile causes aimed at making certain that the Detroit \nmetropolitan area remained a strong, economically vibrant, \ncompassionate community, which it is today.\n  Mr. Fisher's involvements go beyond, however, his own hometown. He \nbecame active in the political process in the early 1960s. He became \nvery involved in the activities of the then Governor George Romney, and \nthen through that he began an involvement with the Republican Party on \na national level. His interests, however, transcended his party. It \nclearly is an interest born of a love of this country and of the issues \nwe confront. As a consequence, he has served as an advisor to many who \nhave held office, both in the U.S. Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives, and even the Presidency itself. He has been a close \nadvisor and a close friend to Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Bush, \nand I believe also some on the other side of the aisle as well. Indeed, \ntonight, at a celebration of his 90th birthday, several of our former \nPresidents will be in attendance to demonstrate their friendship and \nadmiration for him.\n  Max Fisher's interests have gone beyond the shores of the United \nStates as well. He is a great champion of the nation of Israel. He has \nplayed a very active role in the American Jewish community, various \norganizations and foundations; and, through several of those, he has \nprovided a great deal of support and assistance to the development of \nthe nation of Israel. I know that he is held in great esteem there as \nhe is here in the United States.\n  His interest in others transcends just one particular cause. It \nbasically applies to virtually every cause I am familiar with. His name \nis inevitably linked to charitable organizations, to\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\nfoundations, and various other community service entities in our State, \nas well as across this country, that try to make America and Michigan \nbetter places to live and better places to raise families.\n  In any event, Mr. President, Max Fisher has led a great life, and he \nhas contributed much during that life to all of us, and to his nation \nin particular. So I wish to pay tribute to him on the event of his 90th \nbirthday and also to pay tribute to him for the many things he has done \nto advance us, whether it is in the political arena, the business \narena, the charitable arena, or a variety of others. Unfortunately, \nbecause of our schedule, I will not be able to participate in the \nevents this evening that will commemorate his birthday. I know that I \nspeak for a number of our colleagues, who have friendships with Max, in \nsending him, on all of our behalf, warm congratulations on this \nimportant event.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under whose time is the quorum call?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield it on the basis of the time that \nhas been yielded under the previous quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Parliamentary inquiry: Does the order provide for a \nquorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement called for the \ntime to be counted equally against each side.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent, with the permission of the \nSenator from Michigan, to divide the time of the quorum call between \nthe two parties, the proponents and the opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Dan \nWeiner, who is an intern in my office, be allowed to be in the Chamber \nduring the debate on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3146\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Wally \nSparby, who is the State executive director of the Minnesota Farm \nService Agency be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n         United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service \n           Agency, Minnesota State Office,\n                                      St. Paul, MN, June 30, 1998.\n     Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Glickman: Please find attached copies of \n     letters received from several County Committees requesting \n     that CCC commodity loans be extended. The Minnesota State FSA \n     Committee is also requesting your assistance and support. \n     Minnesota producers are facing an economic crisis and \n     conditions will continue to deteriorate without assistance.\n       Market rates have dropped drastically. The last week of \n     June 1995 producers were receiving an average market price of \n     $2.50 for corn. In the last week of June 1996 corn markets \n     were averaging $4.50 and in 1998 the corn price has dropped \n     to an average $1.92 per bushel. The same is true of wheat. \n     The last week of June 1995 the average market price was $4.50 \n     per bushel; in 1996 the average was $5.60 per bushel and in \n     1998 the price has dropped to an average of $3.25 per bushel. \n     Producers have no control over market prices and the Federal \n     Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 and limited \n     the marketing tool provided by the CCC commodity loan \n     program.\n       Due in part to Minnesota's geographic location, \n     transportation can be a major problem. Elevators are \n     indicating there will be a shortage of transportation and \n     storage this fall. As of June 29 there were 13.4 million \n     bushels of wheat, 153.9 million bushels of corn, 31.3 million \n     bushels of soybeans, and 3 million bushels of barely under \n     CCC loan. There are also oats, flaxeed, sunflowers and canola \n     under CCC loan in Minnesota. Of that total 191.2 million \n     bushels and cwt. will mature between July 31, 1998 and \n     December 31, 1998. CCC is already taking delivery of barley \n     and we believe other grains will follow when loans mature. \n     Elevators have indicated that they will be unable to take \n     delivery of grain when the 1998 harvest begins. Harvest will \n     coincide with loan maturity dates creating a major storage \n     problem.\n       The CCC Commodity Loan Program is a marketing tool. \n     Historically CCC commodity loans have provided producers with \n     a chance to market their grain while obtaining capital at a \n     reasonable interest rate. Prior to two years ago loans could \n     be extended during periods of market downturns thus providing \n     producers the flexibility to store their grain until the \n     markets improve. Programs also provided for interest \n     forgiveness and storage payments during market downturns.\n       Extension of CCC loans will only help producers if storage \n     is available, if interest does not continue to accrue of the \n     loans and if there is some type of income to sustain \n     producers until the markets improve. We are proposing and \n     asking for support of a farm storage facility loan program \n     and the extension of CCC commodity loans. To provide a safety \n     net we propose that when market rates reach a certain low \n     that producers be paid storage and that interest stop \n     accruing on CCC commodity loans. A summary of our proposal is \n     attached.\n       We are also asking for full support of the proposal to \n     remove the ``cap'' on corn and wheat loans. The Federal \n     Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 which \n     ``capped'' the loan rate has resulted in loan rates below the \n     five year average (dropping the high and low years). \n     Historically local market have followed the CCC loan rate. It \n     has only been in the past couple of years that has not been \n     true. Higher loan rates would influence an improved market \n     price for commodities.\n       We believe that in many cases these changes could mean the \n     difference between the continuation of the family farm and \n     liquidation.\n       We appreciate your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Wally Sparby,\n\n                                         State Executive Director,\n                                    Minnesota Farm Service Agency.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I speak in favor of this amendment introduced by \nSenator Harkin and ask unanimous consent that if I am not already, I be \nincluded as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This amendment will lift the cap on the farmer's \nmarketing loan rate and extend the loan repayment period from 9 months \nto 15 months. That sounds very impersonal, to lift the cap on the loan \nrate and extend the repayment period, but I say to my colleagues--and I \nknow my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, will speak about \nthis as well--this proposal goes to the heart of what we must do this \nweek if we are to respond to the economic pain, and for that matter, \nthe personal pain, of many farm families in our country.\n  I will be going to another farm crisis meeting in Granite Falls, MN, \nin western Minnesota, this Saturday. I am hoping and praying I can come \nback with a report that we have been able to take some action that will \ngive farmers some hope--it is really a desperate situation.\n  Wally Sparby, who is the director of the Farm Service Agency in \nMinnesota, is predicting that on the current course--and we have to \nchange the course--we could see about 20 percent of the farmers in \nserious trouble. That is a lot of farmers in the State of Minnesota. \nAgriculture is very important to my State. From 1996 to 1997, we saw \nabout a 38-percent drop in farm income.\n  When I talk to farmers at gatherings, or when I am in cafes in \nMinnesota, I think the one thing they talk about more than anything \nelse--and I imagine you hear the same thing in Arkansas--is price. That \nis really the key thing--a fair price in the marketplace. That is what \nfarmers are asking for. They are saying, give us a fair shake.\n  Now, unfortunately, that is not what is happening, and I believe that \none of the mistakes that was made in the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, \nwhich I called then the ``Freedom to Fail Act''--and I wish I could be \nproven wrong, but unfortunately I think the evidence which is staring \nus in the face proves me right--while we gave farmers the flexibility \nin planting, which I am all for,\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nthe problem is that the loan rate which sets the floor price is set at \nsuch a low level. Right now, the 1996 farm bill caps the price at an \nextremely low level artificially. The rate is $1.89 per bushel of corn \nand $2.58 for wheat. No one can cash-flow or stay in business at these \nprices.\n  Since market prices are now, in fact, nearly down to those levels for \ncorn and for wheat, that is exactly why we have this crisis which we \nare calling an emergency. So far in Minnesota this year the average \nprice for corn has been under $2 a bushel and it has been about $3.25 \nfor wheat. In the wheat-producing parts of Minnesota, those low prices \nhave combined with the bad weather and scab disease to create truly \ndire economic conditions.\n  What I want to say to colleagues, and what I want to say to people in \nour country is that right now $2 a bushel for corn and $3.25 for a \nbushel of wheat is way below the cost of production. Farmers cannot \nmake it--nobody can make it--at these prices, unless you are a huge \nconglomerate that can weather low prices while family-sized farms get \ndriven out, and then you can buy up that land. But for the Midwest and \nfor other parts of the country as well--this is not just a regional \nissue--for all of us who value the family farm structure of agriculture \nwhere the people who farm the land live there and live in the \ncommunity, this is a crisis all to be spelled out in capital letters.\n  What our farm policy used to be was that when the prices were good, \nyou let the market pay the farmers. When the market wasn't so good, you \nwould help stabilize income by holding the market price up. Freedom to \nFarm changed that. In other words, the loan rates gave the farmers some \nleverage vis-a-vis the huge grain companies because, if the prices were \ndown, farmers just held on because they knew at least they would get \nthis loan at this price. But, of course, the grain companies needed the \ngrain so they would have to pay more. That set the price for the \nfarmers.\n  Now, what we have done with this cap is we have set the loan rate at \nsuch a low level, the prices are plummeting, people cannot make it at \nthese prices and therefore they are going under. This is a matter of \nelementary justice.\n  This amendment that I speak in behalf of lifts the cap on the loan \nrate. That means that the loan rate would rise to $2.25 for corn and \n$3.22 for wheat. This is still too low a price.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota in the Chamber. If we at least \ndo that, combined with extending the period that the farmers can hold \non for another 6 months, extend the loan rate period, then I think we \ncan begin to lift the market prices.\n  Now, I would like to raise the loan rate further, and Senator Dorgan \nand I may be back in the Chamber to talk about this later or to take \naction on this later. I think it should be something like at least $3 \nfor corn and $4 for wheat, at least for a targeted level of production, \nwhich would be a family farm level of production.\n  But I want to make it crystal clear that at the very minimum what we \nhave to do this week--this is very reasonable; this is a 1-year \nemergency--is take the cap off the loan rate to begin to get the prices \ngoing up, extending the period for the loan rate, making sure that \nthere is some indemnity payment, some disaster relief for farmers that \nhave been hit by this disaster of low prices, bad weather, scab \ndisease. This is all targeted, all focused on a disaster in rural \nAmerica, in agricultural America, and this for us, for those of us who \ncome from the farm States, is a matter of huge importance. There is no \nmore important amendment that we could be speaking for than this \namendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I just want to speak to one argument that has been \nmade on the floor, and that is the argument that trade is the answer. I \nam for trade. In fact, I wish we had fairer trade for agriculture. But \nI find it surprising that some so-called advocates for farmers are in a \nbig hurry to grant fast track negotiating authority.\n  My question is, For what? If we export more bushels of corn, or more \nbushels of wheat, at a loss, how does that do the farmer any good? I \nsay to my colleague from North Dakota, it is sort of confusing to me. \nIf, in fact, the prices are so low that the farmers in our States are \nlosing on every bushel of corn or every bushel of wheat they produce, \nhow does it help them to produce more bushels of corn or more bushels \nof wheat? It makes no sense at all.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota remembers a couple \nof years ago this Congress--or a Congress passed a new farm bill, one \nthat I voted against and one he voted against. Do you remember, \nfollowing the passage of the new farm bill, some of the large corporate \nagricultural interests were celebrating? They said, ``We won.'' The big \ncorporate agricultural interests said they won. So they were having a \nbig celebration.\n  It is not surprising, then, back when they were trying to push this \nkind of farm bill through, that those of us who voted against this farm \nbill said, ``You are pulling the safety net out from under family \nfarmers.''\n  You have minimum wages for folks who work at the bottom of the \neconomic scale in town. What they were trying to do 2 years ago, with \nthe farm bill, is the same as saying to the minimum wage earners: Let's \ncut the minimum wage to a buck an hour and call it ``freedom to work.'' \nIt would be the same thing on minimum wage: Let's cut it to a dollar an \nhour and call it ``freedom to work.''\n  What they said to farmers was: Let's pull your safety net out from \nunder you and call it Freedom to Farm. What a bunch of baloney. Then \nprices collapsed, we have crop disease, we have disaster, we have \nfamily farmers going broke in record numbers, so many that we don't \nhave enough auctioneers to handle the sales in North Dakota, and now we \nare back here a couple of years later and folks say, ``Gee, the farm \nbill is working just fine.'' It is not working just fine. This is not \nan accident. We don't have price supports that are sufficient.\n  I would say the amendment before us, offered by the minority leader, \nis the most modest of amendments. We ought to go, at a minimum, to \n$3.75 or $4 on a marketing loan, triggered to the first 20,000 bushels \nof wheat produced, so that you target some reasonable support to family \nfarms and say, with that, that family farms matter, they have merit and \nworth and value in our society.\n  Does the Senator recall, a couple of years ago, the celebration by \nthe corporate interests in agriculture over the passage of that farm \nbill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in reply to my colleague from North \nDakota, I also want to ask my colleague to focus his attention for a \nmoment on the original United States-Canadian trade agreement \nsuperseded by NAFTA and ask him how well our wheat growers have fared \nby that agreement.\n  Those who are talking fast track without a fair trade agreement for \nfarmers--I want to raise a question about that in a moment. But let me \nsay to my colleague, the thing I find maddening right now--and I hope I \nam wrong--is that, yes, obviously, if the farmers don't have the \nleverage and they can't get the price, it is great for the grain \ncompanies; they get to buy from the farmers at record low prices. The \nproblem is that I think a lot of colleagues are not willing to revisit \nthis question. In other words, we voted for what was called Freedom to \nFarm. We set the loan rate at such a low level, the prices have \nplummeted, and what I worry about is that somehow this amendment \nbecomes a referendum on Freedom to Farm. It is not.\n\n  For those colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, who supported \nthe Freedom to Farm bill--fine; we can continue to agree or disagree. \nBut for right now, given the fact that prices are way down, all we are \nsaying in this amendment is, for 1 year, as an emergency measure, take \nthe cap off so we can get the loan rate up, so we can get prices up. \nCombine that with indemnity payments and a couple of other measures, \nbut in particular these two measures, and we can help get farm income \nup and enable people to stay on the land and not be driven off their \nland. That is what it is all about. In other words, time is not \nneutral. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now.\n  I would say to colleagues, I am willing to debate trade policy. \nPersonally, I don't think the United States-Canadian agreement has \nworked well at all\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\nfor our wheat farmers. Nor has NAFTA--it has been a terrible agreement, \na terrible agreement. You can ask the farmers about that.\n  But above and beyond any debate about trade policy today, above and \nbeyond the overall debate about the Freedom to Farm bill, let me just \nsimply make this appeal to everybody who is out here. For right now, \ncan't we at least reach some common agreement on some emergency \nmeasures that we can take? The fact of the matter is, you can export \nmore bushels of corn and more bushels of wheat, but if the price is so \nlow it is costing the farmers more to produce that bushel of corn than \nthe farmer is getting for that bushel of corn or bushel of wheat, they \ngo further and further in debt.\n  At least let's get the floor up. At least let's get the price up. At \nleast let's get the disaster payments out there. If we do that, then we \nwill have taken some action that will be concrete, will be real, and \ncan make a difference. There is a lot more I would like to say about \nwhat I call the ``freedom to fail'' bill. I am a critic of it. I think \nit is a terrible piece of legislation. I said it then; I will say it \nnow. It was great for the grain companies; it was terrible for the \nfamily farmers. It looked great when prices were up and transition \npayments were out there, but what goes up goes down, and now we have no \nway of stabilizing the situation for family farmers in this country.\n  This amendment goes a significant way toward stabilizing the \nsituation, getting the prices up, enabling our farmers to get back on \ntheir feet to be able to cash-flow. Combine it with the disaster relief \npayments and we will have done something good.\n  I hope we will have support for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the thoughts expressed by the \nSenator from Minnesota. I want to follow on, just briefly, on the \nquestion of trade. It relates to this entire issue of how farmers are \ndoing, because farmers are told by some: You go ahead and compete in \nthe free marketplace. We will set you loose. Go ahead and compete in \nthe free market.\n  Then farmers discover there is no free market. When they market up, \nthe large grain trade firms have their fists around the neck of the \nbody of a few firms that control all that. Four firms control most of \nthe flour milling; four firms control most of the meat packing--you \nname it. I have shown the list out here. In every area where farmers \nmarket, there are four firms that control the majority of the \nprocessing.\n  With respect to trade--the Senator from Minnesota mentioned trade--\nfarmers are told: You compete in the free market system.\n  Let me tell you just about the United States-Canadian situation. The \nvote on the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, when I was in \nthe House of Representatives and on the Ways and Means Committee, was \n34 to 1; 34 to 1. Guess who the ``1 '' was. Yes, that's me. It probably \nsays one of a couple of things. It probably says I have no influence at \nall with the other 34 members. It may say that. They said to me, ``You \nare going to be the only one who votes against this. Gee, this must be \na unanimous vote. We must have your vote. Everybody else in this \ncommittee is going to vote for this.''\n  I said, ``This is a terrible piece of legislation for this country. \nYou are selling out American farmers with this trade agreement, and you \nknow it. And I wouldn't vote for this in 100 years.'' And I didn't.\n  Let me tell you what has happened. We have a woman from North Dakota \nwho marries a Canadian, and they go back to southwestern North Dakota \nfor Thanksgiving. She decides, ``I am going to take some of that good \nhard red spring wheat that they produce in North Dakota--we produce in \nNorth Dakota, back to Canada, because I am going to crush it a little \nbit back there and bake some whole wheat bread.'' She loves to bake \nbread.\n  So they go back to Canada after their Thanksgiving break. She has a \ncouple of grocery bags full of hard red spring wheat from North Dakota, \nso that when she gets back home she can bake a little bread. She gets \nto the Canadian border and she is told, ``Oh, we are sorry, you can't \ntake that wheat into Canada. You can't take a couple of grocery sacks \nfull of wheat into Canada.'' All the way to the border she meets semi-\ntruckload after semi-truckload after semi-truckload of Canadian wheat \ncoming south.\n  Or a man with a pickup truck, and just kernels of wheat in the back, \nis told you must sweep out the back of the pickup truck before you can \nenter Canada with kernels of wheat. So he sweeps the pickup truck box \nout. All the time he is sweeping, Canadian 18-wheel semi-truckloads of \nwheat are coming into this country. In fact, we even had an agreement \nwith Canada at one point to provide some sort of reasonable limit, and \nthey exceeded the limit last year by 25,000 semi-truckloads--25,000 \nsemi-truckloads.\n\n  I went up to the border--I told my colleagues this many times \nbefore--with Earl Jensen, and we had a 10-year-old, orange, 2-ton truck \nwith a few bushels of wheat on it. We almost had to use our windshield \nwipers to wipe away the grain splattering against our windshield on a \nwindy day from Canadian 18-wheelers hauling all that flood of Canadian \ngrain into our country.\n  Guess what? When Earl and I pulled up to the border, we were told, \n``We're sorry, you can't get that American grain into Canada.''\n  Free trade? Who negotiated that kind of soft-headed, weak-kneed trade \nagreement do we have that refuse to stand up for this country's \ninterest, that say to other countries, ``Yeah, you can close your \nborders to us and we will open our borders to you, and we will call it \nfair, and we will call it square''--what kind of a deal is that?\n  In this town, everybody talks about free trade, never wanting to talk \nabout the details. The fact is, every one of our farmers in North \nDakota and every one of the farmers in Minnesota, represented by \nSenator Wellstone, confront that problem every day, and it is unfair.\n  That grain comes flooding across our border, I am convinced unfairly \nsubsidized, and we sent the Government Accounting Office up to the \nCanadian Wheat Board to audit their books and records, because we think \nthey are dumping illegally in this country. Guess what they said? ``We \nare sorry, we have no intention of opening our books and records to \nyou; scram, get out of here.'' So here we are.\n  Prices collapsed because of unfair trade and, yes, Canada is a major \npart of that. Prices collapsed for a dozen other reasons. Rampant crop \ndisease devastates the quality of the crop, and then we have farm \nfamilies who for 30 years have been turning that yard light off and on \nevery morning as they get up to do chores, gas their tractor, go out \nand plant their seeds and hope they can raise a crop. And now they are \ntold, ``Well, gee, we are sorry; we have free trade and a free market \nand if you can't make it in either, tough luck.''\n  The plain fact is, there is no free trade and there is no free \nmarket, and anybody who thinks about the details and the specifics \nknows it. We owe it to the farmers of this country in a range of areas, \nwhether it is international trade or price supports or other areas to \nsay we want to stand for the interest of family farmers.\n  Let me also say the Freedom to Farm bill was a bill that had a couple \nof propositions, one of which makes eminent good sense, and I support \nit, and that is, farmers ought to be able to choose to plant what they \nwant to plant when they want to plant it. That makes sense to me, and I \nsupport that. But the other is to say we will now essentially withdraw \nprice supports and tell farmers you operate in the free market, despite \nthe fact the free market doesn't exist. That doesn't make any sense. If \never an example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater is \nappropriate, it is here.\n  We didn't need, in order to give farmers planning flexibility, to \ndecide that price supports don't matter. Eighteen years ago, the target \nprice for wheat was $4.38 a bushel, and the loan rate was $3.65 a \nbushel. In every other area, prices have gone up for input costs; in \nevery other area dealing with other earners, minimum wages have been \nincreased some. But the compensation for farmers has been substantially \ndiminished in terms of support prices. It is as if to say the economic \nall-stars in this country don't matter. They work hard, they produce \nwell, they produce the best quality food for the lowest\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\npercent of disposable income anywhere on the face of the Earth, and \nthey are told, ``By the way, the value of what you produce does not \nhave worth.''\n  I said yesterday, and I say it again, because at least to \nme personally it is so perplexing and seems so Byzantine, this morning, \nas I speak, halfway around the globe, we are told there are old women \nclimbing trees in Sudan to forage for leaves to eat because they are \nnear starvation. A million, a million and a quarter people are on the \nabyss of starvation. And then halfway around the globe, again, we are \ntold those family farmers, who raise food in such abundant quantity and \nsuch good food, that what they produce doesn't have value and doesn't \nhave worth.\n\n  The marketplace says to them--whatever this marketplace is--choked \ndown on the top, choked from the bottom, choked on the sides by unfair \ntrade by monopolies from railroads, to grain processors, to millers, \nyou name it; they are telling the farmer in this distorted marketplace \nthat what you produce doesn't have value. It costs you 5 bucks per \nbushel to produce; we will give you $3 for it. Want to lose $2 a \nbushel? That is fine. Lose your heritage, lose what your dad produced, \nlose what your grandad produced. And you go to these meetings and you \nfind these folks who stand up at a meeting, as they have for me, and \none sticks out in my mind--I have had many of them in recent weeks--a \nbig, burly, husky kind of guy with a beard and with friendly eyes who \nsaid, ``You know, I have been a farmer all my life. I love farming. My \ngrandad farmed. My dad farmed, and I have farmed for 23 years.'' He got \ntears in his eyes and his chin began to quiver as he said, ``But I have \nto quit. I can't make it. I can't raise grain at $5 a bushel or $4.50 a \nbushel and sell it at $3.50 a bushel and my lender says I can't get \nenough money to put in the next crop.''\n  When you see people like that begin to tear up and talk about what \nfamily farming means to them, then you understand this is not dollars \nand cents, this is not just some macroeconomic theory, this is \nsomething much more in this country.\n  Family farming has always meant much more than just dollars and \ncents. Thomas Jefferson described it, as I said yesterday, as the most \nimportant enterprise in America. His words were more eloquent than \nthat, but that is what he said. What he meant was these people who dot \nthe landscape in America, the broad-based economic ownership that comes \nwith family farming contributes immensely to our country. I have said \nbefore, it contributes to the family values of our country. Family \nvalues have always originated on family farms and rolled through to our \nsmall towns, nourishing our small towns and our big cities.\n  There is much more here than just dollars and cents. I hope that as \nwe begin these discussions we can remember this. At least the first \namendment that we adopted yesterday says, yes, this Congress recognizes \nthere is a crisis. In my State, family farmers have seen a 98-percent \ndecrease in net income. Name anybody living anywhere, except the \nwealthiest among us, who could, at the end of a period where they have \nlost 98 percent of their income, stand and say, ``Well, I am doing just \nfine.'' Most everybody on every block in every community in every facet \nof life would be flat on their back losing 98 percent of their income, \nand we know that.\n  It is not different for family farmers. They are now flat on their \nbacks facing collapsed prices, rampant crop disease and fundamentally \nunfair trade in every direction, markets that are captured and cornered \nand collapsed by a few companies, a few companies that control those \nmarkets.\n  It is one thing to say to farmers, ``It is a free market and free \ntrade, and God bless you, and what happens.'' That is not, in my \njudgment, what this country ought to offer family farmers in terms of \ndomestic policy.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, may I direct a question to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to respond.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. As I understand the immediate amendment before the \nSenate having to do with marketing loans, it strikes me, and I wonder \nif the Senator shares this view, that we need to put this in some \nperspective. There are some who view this as a debate on Freedom to \nFarm, and certainly there are those of us who have widely and varied \nopinions on that underlying legislation. But the amendment that is \npending, does the Senator agree, does not unravel or turn inside out or \notherwise dispose of the Freedom to Farm legislation?\n  The amendment, as I see it before me, builds on what is already in \nthe existing farm bill; that is, a marketing loan provision that is \nalready there, at an inadequate level, but it is there, and the \namendment that is pending simply gives the President of the United \nStates the authority in a state of emergency for 1 year to remove the \ncurrent loan caps and raise the cap on wheat from $2.58 a bushel to \n$3.22, on corn from $1.89 to $2.25, on soybeans from $5.26 to $5.33 and \nextend the loan period from 9 months to 15 months?\n  Would the Senator agree that this is not a radical amendment? This is \nnot an amendment that somehow sweeps away the previous legislation--and \nwe have different opinions about what ought to happen--but this \namendment, it would seem to me, is a very modest, in fact, very \nnarrowly crafted and a very modest change in what is already existing \nlaw. Would the Senator agree with that point on this issue?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, states it \nexactly as it is. I have said before, this particular amendment gives \nmodesty an understated reputation, in my judgment. It is too modest for \nmy taste. I certainly am going to support it. I certainly will support \nit because it does increase the loan rate, albeit to a level that is \nfar too low. It does increase the loan rate some. It does extend the \ntime in which a farmer can use that marketing loan to better market \ntheir grain; and certainly we ought to do that.\n  If we say, as a consistent philosophy, farmers should go to the \nmarketplace for their price, then you must give farmers the time to \naccess the marketplace when the price might be better than it is just \nafter harvest. Normally, just after harvest they truck that grain to \nthe elevator and--guess what--they find prices that are not very high. \nIt would be better for them to hold it and wait until it is in their \nadvantage to market it.\n  The Senator from South Dakota describes it as it exactly is. This \ndoes not, in any way, unravel the tenets of the current farm program. \nWould I like to unravel it? You bet your life I would. I do not support \nit. I never did. I think it is a terrible farm program. Does the \nplanning flexibility make sense? Yes, it does. I support that fully. \nBut the notion that somehow we ought to decide that in every other area \nwe will provide some basic support because that area has merit and \nworth and value, but in family farming we will pull the support out \nbecause somehow that is of lesser value to this country--as I said \nearlier, this is a lot more than dollars and cents.\n  That is what the farm bill debate missed a couple of years ago. The \nspecific amendment which I intend to vote for but which is so \nincredibly modest--it really ought to be replaced by an amendment that \nsays for a certain amount of production, 20,000 bushels of wheat, for \nexample, we will provide a $3.75 or $4 loan rate, marketing loan rate--\nnot the kind of loan where the Federal Government takes control of the \ngrain but, in effect, it becomes a marketing loan where we pay the \ndifference between what the farmer gets on the open market and what the \nsupport price is. That is what we ought to be doing. But this amendment \nis certainly worth supporting because, as the Senator says, it does not \nfray, undermine or unravel the tenets of the current farm program.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Well, may I ask the Senator from North Dakota--I applaud \nhis work on this amendment. I have long supported his concept of \ntargeted assistance for family producers in this context and various \nothers. We have discussed this over the years. But when we expand the \nloan period from 9 to 15 months, if the producers are required to sell \ntheir product within a shorter window of time, does that depress the \nprice further? And who gains by producers having to sell their grain \nwithin a shorter window of time than over a longer window of time? Who \nare the winners and who are the losers when\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\nall of the farmers are required, within a relatively short window, to \ndispose of their grain at one time? Who wins and who loses by that \npolicy?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The answer to that is clear. The bigger interests win, \nthe littler interests lose. That is why it seems to me that if you \nfollow the philosophy of the current farm policy, you have to give them \nthe flexibility of going to the marketplace when it is in their \ninterest. And they do not have that capability now because most of them \nare forced to haul that to the market and sell it as soon as they get \nit off the ground because they have to pay back the operating loans.\n  Anybody who says this isn't about big versus little is just flat \nwrong. Look, if somebody wants to farm an entire county, they have \nevery right to do that. They can farm the entire county. They can buy \n50,000 acres of land. They can plow as far as they can plow in 24 \nhours, camp overnight, and plow back as far as they can. They have a \nright to do that in this country. But they ought to join with the good \nLord and their banker and figure out how they make ends meet. I am not \nterribly interested if they want to try to farm the whole county, how \nwe offer price supports for them.\n\n  But the family out there farming a family-size operation, they are \nturning on the yardlight, they are doing chores, they are taking \nenormous risks--do I want to provide some type of continuity and help \nfor them? Of course I do. It seems to me, we ought to construct an \napproach that says to those folks, ``You really do matter.'' We have in \nNorth Dakota--you probably have the same in South Dakota, and I assume \nother States--we have 53 counties. Ten of them are growing and 43 of \nthem are shrinking. My home county was 5,000 people; it is now 3,000 \npeople. All that has to do with family farmers leaving the farm. And \nthey are now leaving at an accelerated pace.\n  I do not know that there is a magic answer to all of this. It is just \nthat this particular amendment is an amendment that says, let us try to \nfind a way to give farmers some flexibility to access the marketplace \nwhen it is more in their interest to do so rather than be forced to \nhaul their grain to market and sell it when perhaps the prices are at \nbottom levels.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Would the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. My question is, How long do you intend to hold the \nfloor? I am curious--not critical at all--but curious, because I agreed \nto yield to the chairman of the Agriculture Committee time on the \namendment. He has been on the floor now for almost 30 minutes. I was \njust curious to know when I might be able to yield some time to him.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have nearly completed my statement. I respect the \nSenator from Indiana and the Senator from Mississippi. They both are \nwonderful legislators. We might disagree from time to time on some of \nthese issues, but I know he has been here for some while. This is, as \nyou might imagine, enormously important. Agriculture drives our State's \neconomy. I feel very strongly about a number of these issues. But I \ncertainly want the Senator from Indiana to be able to make his \nstatement.\n  Let me finish by saying, I do not come here trying to figure out who \nis at fault. While I have strong feelings about farm policy, when I \nthink this current policy is not good farm policy, and I have opposed \nit in the past, I think everyone comes at this with good will and with \ntheir own strong feelings about what ought to be done.\n  But I do think that family farmers out there, are struggling these \ndays against the odds and circumstances where they cannot control their \nown destinies at all. It is not their fault they have been devastated \nby crop disease. That is not their fault. It is not their fault that \ngrain prices have collapsed. They did not have anything to do with \nthat. And it is not their fault that the Crop Insurance Program, that \nwe advertised as replacing a disaster program, does not work at all for \nsomebody who suffers five straight disasters.\n  One-third of our counties in North Dakota have had a disaster every \nyear for 5 straight years--every year for 5 straight years. It is not \ntheir fault that crop insurance does not work for them. Each succeeding \nyear means you get less of a base because you did not get a crop the \nprevious year, so you still pay those premiums and get less from the \nCrop Insurance Program.\n  Again, farmers ought not to be faulted for these circumstances. We \nought to find a way to create a connection here to something that does \nwork, to say to them, ``You matter. And we want to do something that \nmakes a difference for you. We want to do something that gives you the \nopportunity to continue to farm.'' If you are a good manager and if you \nare willing to take some risks, we're willing to stand for you and with \nyou to say, `Yes, here's a disaster program. Here's an indemnification \nprogram. Here's a little better opportunity on a loan rate. Here's the \nability to hold that grain a little longer. Here are a number of things \nwe want to do to try to make your life a little easier.' ''\n  If we do that together--and I hope we will--and if we work with \nPresident Clinton who some of us plan to meet with this afternoon--I \nhope that perhaps at the end of the day we will all have decided that \nwe have made a difference for family farmers. And, more importantly, I \nhope that family farmers will decide that we have made a difference in \ntheir lives as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee for his insistence on my gaining recognition. I \nappreciated the colloquy between the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota and the distinguished Senator from South Dakota and the earlier \ncomments of the distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n  I come before the Senate as a fifth-generation family farmer; that \nis, five family generations of Lugars, from the 1820s in Grant County, \nthrough the present farming operation we have in Marion County, have \nbeen involved in the business of farming. We take the family farming \nvery seriously on the 604 acres of corn and soybeans and tree stands \nthat I am now responsible for and have been for the last 42 years.\n  The contents of farm legislation are interesting to me as a citizen \nof this country, certainly as a member of the Agriculture Committee, \nand as one who is affected by those policies as I try to determine what \nI ought to plant, what my opportunities are as a family farmer in \nIndiana. I have been a long-time member of the Indiana Farm Bureau, as \nwas my father, Marvin Lugar, and my uncle, Harry Lugar, a long-time \nmember of the farmer's union in Indiana. I have been responsive to both \ngroups and to others who have been involved in organizational \nagriculture as we helped to fashion the last four farm bills.\n  I come before the Senate today just having addressed a meeting 2 days \nago of the American Farm Bureau President's Group. At least on a couple \nof occasions a year, the president of each of the 50 State farm bureaus \ncome to Washington, along with the various persons in their \norganizations. During the course of that colloquy with the farm bureau \npresidents, I was approached by a gentleman who mentioned he is the \npresident of the North Dakota Farm Bureau. His name is Jim Harmon. Jim \nHarmon, the president of the North Dakota Farm Bureau, gave to me an \narticle which he had published in the North Dakota Farm Bureau Journal.\n  I quote from his article. Mr. Harmon says:\n\n       It seems whenever things get difficult in farming, we look \n     for someone or something to blame. That is certainly the case \n     with the financial crisis facing farmers and ranchers in the \n     northern plains where we have had continuous years of adverse \n     growing conditions, now compounded by low prices. Some would \n     like to assign blame to the ``Freedom to Farm'' bill; and \n     have Congress reopen it to ``fix'' the price problem. This is \n     the wrong route to take, because ``Freedom to Farm'' is not \n     the problem--only the scapegoat. If the Act is reopened, I \n     fear that farmers stand to lose much more than they can \n     possibly gain.\n\n  Mr. Harmon continues:\n\n       The argument is being made that we need to reinstate the \n     old ``safety net'' program of the last 50 years. Fifty years \n     ago, we had almost seven million farmers in the United\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\n     States. We now have two million. What kind of ``safety net'' \n     lets that many producers slip through it? The only thing \n     those programs guaranteed was a price ceiling on most \n     commodities in most years. Stable prices at low levels with \n     rising production costs is not the prescription for \n     profitability in farming. In the current legislation, the \n     ``safety net'' of price supports and disaster declarations \n     (not always successful), was replaced by ``transition \n     payments'' to offset the impact of depressed prices, and the \n     promise of meaningful risk management tools to reduce the \n     effects of natural disasters. For North Dakota farmers, the \n     promise of an improved crop insurance program in our risk \n     management tool kit still needs to be fulfilled.\n       A recent study by researchers in the Agricultural Economics \n     department at NDSU indicated that about three-fourths of \n     North Dakota's 1997 decline in net farm income was due \n     to yield and quality reductions, and one-fourth to low \n     commodity prices.\n       Blaming the current farm bill for the depressed cereal \n     grain prices is also off the mark. The bill authorizes $500 \n     million for the Export Enhancement Program. Only $150 million \n     was appropriated, of which NONE has been used until the now \n     famous EEU barley shipments into the United States. Adequate \n     funding of the Market Access Program, along with a \n     comprehensive strategy for expanding foreign markets for our \n     commodities are tools that must be developed and implemented \n     if agriculture is to succeed in the global marketplace.\n\n  Mr. Harmon continues:\n\n       Another area that deserves attention is the fact that the \n     United States has made sanctions against countries that \n     comprise 11 Percent of the world wheat market (accounting for \n     40 percent of the world wheat export market). Given American \n     agriculture's dependence on export markets, trade sanctions \n     usually punish farmers more than the leadership of the \n     country we're mad at.\n       Farm Bureau strongly believes that the following components \n     are necessary to ensure the success of the current farm \n     programs:\n\n  Mr. Harmon says:\n\n       Improve Federal Crop Insurance and develop new cost-\n     efficient income coverage programs.\n       Utilize to the fullest extent, all of the trade tools \n     available, including EEP, GSM 102 and 103 Credit Programs, \n     MAP, and the Foreign Market Development (FMD) Programs.\n       Provided promised reforms in the areas of wetlands, \n     pesticides, air and quality regulations.\n       Expand agricultural research funding.\n       Other items that will complete an integrated ag package \n     include FARRM accounts, income averaging, estate and capital \n     gains tax relief.\n       Changing current farm law will only open the door to false \n     hope for those of us who need real answers. Real answers can \n     be found by using the tools available to their fullest \n     potential.\n\n  I believe that Mr. Harmon, the president of the North Dakota Farm \nBureau, has made the case very well for the current farm bill. He has \nalso offered some excellent suggestions. I am hopeful that, as Senators \nmeet with the President today, the President will subscribe to many of \nthe suggestions that Mr. Harmon has made.\n  Let me simply add, as that conversation with the President commences, \nthat it would be helpful to have in front of the President U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture estimates that the farm bill now in force in \nthis country is providing payments totaling $17.180 billion over the \n1996-1998 marketing years; that is, the first 3 years of this new farm \nbill. This $17.18 billion of payments to producers is in comparison to \nwhat would have been paid under the old farm bill. That would have been \nonly $9.63 billion.\n  In essence, the current farm bill, during 1996, 1997, and 1998, will \nhave made available to producers in these transition payments $7.55 \nbillion more than they would have received if we had continued the old \nfarm bill. I think that is an important point, Mr. President, because \nthat amount of income, $7.5 billion, is out there in farm country now. \nIt is in the hands of family producers, family farmers, and it is \nreality, as opposed to speculation.\n  Further, the transition payments under the farm bill are made earlier \nin the planting season than were the old deficiency payments. This has \nallowed family farms more latitude for planning as they go into \nplanting their crops.\n  Under the new farm bill, farmers have the flexibility as to what \ntypes of crops to plant and in what amounts. Farmers plant for the \nmarket rather than for the Government. The distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota noted that was one portion of the new farm bill that he \nliked. It is a very important one.\n  As a family farmer, let me simply testify that for many years we \nplanted corn because we were in the corn program and failure to plant \ncorn might diminish the base on which our support payments were based. \nTherefore, we had to follow the dictates of the Federal Government that \noften asked us to set aside 5, 10 or 15 percent of our cropland.\n  We could have produced things that did not have a program, Mr. \nPresident, but that would have diminished the base, so that if we \nwanted to return to the program, we would have been out of luck. As a \nresult, for years, USDA essentially dictated the amounts of corn, \nwheat, cotton and rice--so-called program crops--to family farmers. \nNow, as a matter of fact, with Freedom to Farm, we are exercising that \nfreedom. We are planting what the market signals the market wants. We \nare maximizing our opportunities. It is a critical point, Mr. \nPresident, but totally impossible under the old supply management of \nthe farm bills of 60-some years.\n  I note that current farm prices have prompted some Senators to \nsuggest that the 1996 farm bill should be changed to alleviate what \nthey perceive to be a farm crisis. Mr. President, we have had a lot of \ntestimony before the Agriculture Committee and, indeed, we have heard \nfarmers from the Dakotas and from the Chair's own State of Montana, and \nfrom northern Minnesota, testify about terrible weather problems, \nmultiple crop failures--extraordinary difficulties that were recognized \nby this body when emergency disaster relief aid went to the Dakotas and \nto some other States last year.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that even granted this crisis--and it \nis one that hopefully can be met by many farmers through the crop \ninsurance that they have taken out, and participation in the Dakotas, \nwhere crop insurance is intensive, perhaps more so than most any other \ntwo States--given marketing opportunities that have been available \nthat, hopefully, will be available again given the cyclical nature of \ncrop prices, and certainly the changes in the weather that dictate from \nday to day very sharp changes in the futures market, we are all hopeful \nof trying to alleviate the crisis as perceived by some States and some \ncounties that have a genuine crisis.\n  I just point out, however, to all Members that 1998 farm prices--the \nones we now have either for crops that have been harvested, or \nprospectively, for those in the fields--are low in comparison to the \nunusually high prices of 1995 and 1996. But they are about equal to the \n1990-94 average price levels for wheat, corn, and soybeans. I point out \nthat 1995 and 1996 had some unusual factors; namely, that the USDA \nguessed wrong and required farmers, such as myself, to set aside \nacreage and, in fact, the weather did not cooperate and we had very \nsmall crops in the country. Prices went up, predictably.\n  I just say, Mr. President, that we are now in more normal planting \nsituations in which there are not excessive stocks around the world. \nFarmers are planting for the market. And my point is that the prices \nnow are roughly the 1990-94 average for wheat, corn, and soybeans. USDA \nprojects that farmers, this year, will receive an average of between \n$2.70 and $3.10 for the 1998 crop of wheat. The 1990-94 average was \n$3.11. Corn prices are projected between $1.95 and $2.35, according to \nthe USDA, and that is certainly much more speculative given the fact \nthat we still have some time to make that crop, as compared to an \naverage of $2.30 in the early 1990s.\n  Mr. President, anyone who has watched the futures markets in the last \nfew weeks has seen prices reverse direction drastically and \ndramatically. December corn closed on June 23, for example--not long \nago--at $2.67 and three-quarters, a recovery of 30 cents from the \ncontract lows--all in one fell swoop. Similarly, November soybeans \nclosed at $6.40 and three-quarters, a 70 cent recovery from contract \nlows earlier in the season.\n\n  Today's low prices are not caused by the farm bill. They reflect \nlarge world grain supplies, a direct result of the high prices of 1995 \nand 1996, distorted somewhat by USDA set-asides. But they reflect \nsomething much more, Mr. President, and that is a profound crisis\n\n[[Page S8171]]\n\nin the economies of many Asian nations. If it were not for the Asian \ncrisis, this Nation would be well on the road to setting another all-\ntime record for the dollar value of farm exports. USDA's current \nprojection of $56 billion in 1998 exports is about $4 billion less than \nthe record--$60 billion--in 1996. If Asian demand simply matched last \nyear's level, with no growth, we would have matched and exceeded the \n$60 billion figure. USDA forecasts that our exports to non-Asian \ncountries will actually be 8 percent greater than in the record-setting \nyear of 1996.\n  The farm bill is a source of help and not harm for farm income. From \n1996 to 1998, as we pointed out, the payments have been $17.18 billion, \n$7.5 billion more than the old farm bill. I just simply say that this \nmoney continues throughout the duration of the current farm bill. The \npayments are well known to farmers. So in terms of forward planning of \ntheir operations, they understand the money in the bank that is \nprovided by the current farm bill.\n  Let me just say that one of the ways in which many northern plains \nfarmers who have been especially afflicted by very bad weather, and \nsometimes by wheat scab disease--a number of the northern plains \nfarmers have adapted to these wheat problems, and scab and other \ndisease problems, by changing the crops that they plant--oilseed \nacreage, for example, in North Dakota. And other States have expanded \ndramatically at the expense of wheat acres. Such wholesale shifts could \nnot have occurred under the old farm policy. The disincentives to \nchange crops were simply too great. Freedom to Farm is a package deal. \nIts aim is to leave planting decisions in the hands of the farmers and \nnot the Government. And to achieve this goal, the FAIR Act provides \nfull planting flexibility, bans production controls, and decouples \nincome support payments.\n  Another element in the farm bill is the relatively low loan rates, \nand that is the subject of the amendment before us. The purpose of the \nloan rates in the farm bill now is the same as the act's other \nfeatures: to make certain that price supports are a short-term \nmarketing tool and not an alternative market. Loan rates should not be \nset high enough to influence farmers' planting decisions, and they \nshould not tie up grain in storage for such a long period of time that \nmarket signals are distorted.\n  To state it another way, Mr. President, I have been asked by \nSenators, ``Why is it a bad thing for marketing loans to bring grain \ninto the hands of the Federal Government?'' The basic reason is that \ngrain doesn't disappear on its own accord. It is there; it is a drag on \nthe supply side. It means everybody taking a look at futures markets \nknows it is still there. It has to be sold at some point. It depresses \nprice. It depresses income. It is not a quick fix; it is not a good \nfix. Under the current farm bill, it is not meant to happen. That is \nwhy proposals to raise loan rates or extend the time for loans are \ndoubly objectionable.\n  Not only do they put a further strain on the Federal budget, but they \nput the Government back in the business of substituting its judgment \nabout crop decisions for the market's judgment, and for that matter, \nabout marketing the stores of grain the Government accumulates. The \nprojected crop prices for the 1998 marketing year are much lower than I \nwould like to see, particularly when compared to the high prices of \n1995 and 1996.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of steps that we will need to take \nin the Agriculture Committee and on this floor to assist farmers to \nobtain higher prices. I want to discuss some of those later in the day. \nBut for the moment on the current amendment, just for the benefit of \nSenators, the amendment deals with removing the 1996 farm bill ceiling \non loan rates. And it would mean that the USDA would be free to raise \nthe 1998 crop loan rate to 85 percent of the past 5-year market price \naverage excluding the high and the low years. The amendment would \nremove loan rate caps for marketing assistance loans for wheat, for \nfeed grains, for cotton, and rice measured in fiscal year 1999 \neffectively uncapping the loan rates for the 1998 crops.\n  Finally, the amendment would permit the Secretary of Agriculture to \nextend the term in the marketing assistance loans from the current 9 \nmonths to 15 months.\n  I state all of this, Mr. President, because I am not certain in the \ndebate thus far that it has been clear exactly what uncapping the loan \nrates means. It means, as I have stated, taking the last 5 years in \nthese program crops, excluding the top and the bottom years, and, \ntherefore, the average of the remaining three. And this results, for \nthe benefit of Senators who are wondering about the amounts of money \ninvolved, that the current loan ceiling for wheat under the current \nfarm bill is $2.58 a bushel. The calculation of the 85 percent of the \n5-year average, excluding high and low prices, would raise that loan \nrate to $3.16.\n  Mr. President, I make the point about wheat because I have already \nsuggested that the average price of wheat calculated by USDA is now \nestimated after a pretty good harvest at between $2.70 and $3.10 for \nthe year. Thus, we would be creating a loan rate higher than the likely \naverage price for wheat marketed this year. It is logical in that event \nthat very large amounts of that crop are going to go under the \nmarketing loan. If, in fact, to take a practical example, a wheat \nfarmer has some prospects for the average price of $3.10, or lower than \nthat, he or she might decide to use the marketing loan to get the \n$3.16, and let the Federal Government worry about what is going to \nhappen generally with the supply of wheat in this situation.\n  For corn, the situation is not quite so generous. The current farm \nbill marketing loan would be $1.89 a bushel. Given this 5-year \naveraging, again with the high and low out, that goes up to $2.17. It \nis conceivable that given a bumper crop of 9.5 billion bushels that \ncorn could dip below $2.17, and, if so, a good bit of corn would come \nunder this procedure.\n  Soybeans are at $5.26, the marketing loan rate. Under the farm bill, \nthat would be $5.54 given the 5-year calculation if you removed the \ncap. It is hard to tell precisely what the situation would be for \nbeans, but maybe a similar one to corn.\n  In any event, you can predict that stock accumulations would be \ninevitable. These would lead, I suspect, to calls from the floor for \nsupply control for USDA to step in and try to prevent a further \naccumulation of a glut of grain that is depressing prices in this \ncountry, and depressing farmers as they see those prices going down. \nMr. President, this is not even a good quick fix. It is a prescription \nfor enormous difficulty.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us, as I understand, has been \ntailored in various ways so that, although the Congressional Budget \nOffice has not yet scored the amendment, it is clear that it would cost \nat least $1.6 billion, with approximately $400 million of that cost due \nto extending the term in the marketing loan by 6 months, and the \nremaining $1.2 billion due to uncapping the loan rates,\n\n  Mr. President, I point out that in the action taken in this body the \nother day to make possible the tender offer by Pakistan, if it comes, \nfor 37 million bushels of U.S. wheat, the Congressional Budget Office \nfinally scored that, as I recall, at about $35 million in costs. And a \nhuge scramble occurred to try to find where $35 million is, even to \nmeet that emergency action. They found it. That is why the legislation \nfinally made it through both Houses to be signed by the President.\n  But we are talking now about $1.6 billion in this amendment. The \nquick fix of this situation is to say, ``Well, it is an emergency \noutside the budget.'' Unless somebody declared that today with regard \nto each of the same things that we are discussing, I see no majority \nsupport in this body for a declaration of emergency of this character. \nI see no prospect in the other body for that to occur. The money simply \nwould have to come, if it is to be appropriated in this way, from other \nagriculture programs. And the scramble will begin as to who will pay \nthe piper. This is a zero sum game.\n  Mr. President, I add, finally, I started my talk by mentioning my \nvisit with the state presidents of the American Farm Bureau. The \nAmerican Farm Bureau and the 50 presidents who were there are not \ncalling for this amendment. As a matter of fact, they do not believe \nthe amendment is good policy, nor do I.\n  Let me just suggest that there are things for which farm \norganizations\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nare calling. The distinguished occupant of the Chair organized an \nimportant meeting of a good number of producer groups not long ago. \nDuring the course of that meeting a number of suggestions were made \nthat are important policy changes. Among those were reauthorization of \nthe Presidential fast-track trading authority. If there is a single \nitem, Mr. President, that is important to higher income on the farm, it \nis that one, because in order to have an extension of our exports, an \nextension of our sales and our marketing, the President must have fast-\ntrack authority. No other country will deal with it. It is quite apart \nfrom the World Trade Organization, which is about to have an important \nmeeting in 1999. At that meeting we are all encouraging Ms. Barshefsky, \nour Trade Representative, or anybody else who might represent us, \nincluding the Secretary of Agriculture, to make certain that \nagriculture is at the top of the priorities. Normally agriculture is at \nthe bottom of the priorities. And that will take some pushing and \nshoving, because a good number of other interest groups in our country \nwill say, ``We don't want to hold up a deal with other countries due to \ntheir antagonism to agriculture.'' The most protected of all areas is \nstill in agricultural trade.\n  So we have to have fast-track authority. We ought to be debating that \nif we are talking about agricultural income, and hopefully we will be \ndebating that very soon on this floor.\n  Second, we must have International Monetary Fund reform. I start by \n``reform,'' because I appreciate the comments that have been made in \nvarious meetings of our committees about how IMF operates. But we are \nalso going to have to have refunding and replenishment for the IMF. The \ncupboard is almost bare. The possibilities are that the nations of the \nworld--we contribute about 18 percent of that money, and it is good to \nhave at least 82 percent contributed by others. The nations of the \nworld may, indeed, come to the rescue of other nations very promptly. \nCommodity prices are down worldwide. We are discussing today the \nproblem of agricultural prices in the world. But, if we were in another \ncountry at another time, we would be discussing the implications of low \noil prices, or low copper prices, or the fact that a certain \ndeflationary trend seems to have come over primary foods and materials \nthroughout the world affecting the economies. Enormous flexibility and \nsafety net situations are going to be required.\n  Third, the agricultural groups almost unanimously have talked about \neconomic sanctions reform with a special emphasis on unilateral \nsanctions, the ones that we impose all by ourselves, and that we have \nimposed 61 times in the last 5 years and that have affected maybe $20 \nbillion of American income and several hundred thousand American jobs.\n  Later in this debate on the agriculture appropriations bill, I will \nbe offering as an amendment a sanction reform bill that deals \nprospectively; that is, just with the future, but at least sets in \nmotion criteria for the administration and for Congress in considering \nunilateral economic sanctions and estimates as to their cost and a \nsunsetting provision that we can get rid of them after they have \nachieved what they were supposed to do. It is a modest amendment, but \nit is an important amendment in the sense of giving hope to farmers in \nAmerica. Do we care about them enough to be thinking how the sale is \ngoing to be made, how marketing can occur with this most vital of \nhumanitarian commodities, food supply.\n  Fourth, farm groups have called for establishment of normal trade \nrelations with China. They have called for stronger oversight on \nbiotechnology in negotiations with the Common Market and with others so \nthat we are not denied the remarkable breakthroughs in our own science. \nThey have asked for full funding of the agricultural research bill, and \nhopefully we will pass that as a part of this overall ag appropriations \nlegislation.\n  Earlier, of course, the farm groups were instrumental in helping us \nall to come to passage of the agricultural research bill itself.\n  And 5 years of crop insurance provisions, which we now see were so \ncritically important given the precarious nature of agricultural income \ndue to weather and other events in so many parts of the country.\n  I would point out that act alone, the Ag Research Act, and the crop \ninsurance provisions for 5 years were tremendously important in making \na difference for agricultural income now as well as for the foreseeable \nfuture in our country.\n  The farm groups are calling for estate tax reform. Of anything that \nhas come before our committee, that has had greater unanimity in terms \nof farm families, and these are the same family farms bandied about in \nthe conversation all the time. They are saying, if we are going to have \na family farm, we are really going to have to have estate tax reform \nand reduction and preferably abolition. Hopefully, that will come \nbefore the body.\n  These are elements of a successful farm policy. We are finally going \nto have to come down to the point of discussing the difference between \nselling the crop and storing the crop, and there is a big difference. \nWhat I and many others are advocating is that we sell, that we market, \nthat we move the crop. A third of all that we do in agricultural \nAmerica has to move; a tough job in the face of the Asian demands \nfalling off precipitously but not impossible.\n  As I have pointed out, we are exporting to non-Asian countries 8 \npercent more now than we were doing in the 1996 record export year, and \nthat did not happen by chance. It happened because agricultural \nmarketers and farmers taking trade groups and personally visiting \ncountries have done a remarkable job. We have to help that \nsubstantially, and we can. The policies I have talked about today are \nfully within our purview in the Senate to debate and to discuss and to \nenact.\n  Let me just mention that those of us on this side of the aisle know \nthat there are no quick fixes, but we do know that action is important \nas well as rhetoric. Less than an hour after the Senate approved the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment offered by the distinguished Democratic \nleader last evening, we gave final congressional approval to the broad \nexemption of agricultural products from India and Pakistan sanctions \nunder the Glenn amendment. The Senate's action should allow U.S. wheat \nto compete in today's Pakistani tender for 350,000 metric tons of \nexports.\n  Yesterday, I joined nine other Senators from farm States in calling \nfor action this session on the distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley's Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act, which gives farmers \nimportant new tools to manage the variability of farm income. I am \nhopeful that will be enacted in this session.\n  Also, yesterday nine of us from farm States wrote the Secretary of \nAgriculture, Mr. Glickman, in support of actions which he can take now \nwithout legislation to increase exports of humanitarian food \nassistance. The CCC Charter Act provides authority for a wide range of \nSecretarial action, and our letter lays out how a new initiative could \nuse existing funds to expand overseas concessional sales of wheat, \nvegetable oil, feedgrains and other commodities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of the letters enunciating these \npolicies be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Dan Glickman,\n     Secretary of Agriculture, Department of Agriculture, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We have reviewed your July 7 letter to \n     the Vice President, transmitting a draft bill to permit \n     unobligated funds of the Export Enhancement Program to be \n     utilized for food aid. We share your goals of enhancing U.S. \n     producers' incomes through higher exports and augmenting our \n     nation's ability to meet humanitarian needs throughout the \n     world.\n       Without prejudice to your legislative proposal, we believe \n     it may also be possible for you to take administrative \n     actions, consistent with existing statutes, which will \n     achieve many of the same purposes more expeditiously. We \n     would like to share our reflections on this matter for your \n     consideration.\n       The Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act grants \n     relatively broad powers to the Secretary to achieve stated \n     purposes. These powers are not unlimited, but they do afford \n     you considerable latitude of action.\n       In particular, Section 5 of the Charter Act instructs you \n     to use the CCC's general powers for eight stated purposes. \n     Among these\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\n     are to ``[p]rocure agricultural commodities for sale to . . . \n     foreign governments, and domestic, foreign, or international \n     relief . . . agencies . . .'' Another priority is to \n     ``[e]xport or cause to be exported, or aid in the development \n     of foreign markets for, agricultural commodities . . .''\n       The Charter Act's history suggests that these purposes may \n     be achieved through programs and procedures that are similar \n     to those which exist or have existed under other statutes. \n     Thus, in the mid-1980s the EEP was operated for a time under \n     Charter Act authority after the statute which then authorized \n     EEP had lapsed.\n       We believe a fair reading of the Charter Act permits you to \n     establish a program which would operate in the following \n     manner. During a specified period (perhaps the last fiscal \n     quarter as proposed in your draft bill), the Secretary could \n     determine that all or part of funds authorized for EEP during \n     that fiscal year would not be used. In this situation, the \n     Secretary could authorize the use of CCC funds in an amount \n     equal to the unused portion of EEP authority. The CCC funds \n     would be utilized in a newly created Food Assistance and \n     Market Development (FAMD), program.\n       The FAMD would be established under Charter Act authority \n     to export agricultural commodities. CCC would purchase \n     commodities at prevailing market prices for concessional \n     sales to foreign buyers, whether public or private. The \n     FAMD's terms and conditions would be similar but not \n     identical to those for Title I of P.L. 480. Notably we would \n     suggest that priority FAMD be given to market experiencing a \n     temporary need for food aid because of macroeconomic or other \n     problems, but likely to resume commercial purchases in \n     future. Other priorities under the new program might be \n     markets which have recently made political or economic \n     reforms, as well as countries with which the U.S. has \n     recently resumed diplomatic relations. It might be that \n     repayment terms and grace periods would also differ from \n     those under Title I, although all terms and conditions would \n     need to be consistent with international norms for bona fide \n     food aid. We intend these parameters to be descriptive rather \n     than prescriptive, and acknowledge that you will want to tap \n     the expertise of market development professionals in both \n     USDA and the private sector in developing any new program.\n       We do note, though, that there is ample need for the \n     American products which would be exported under this program. \n     Title I funding has declined by roughly half in recent years. \n     In correspondence which we earlier shared with you, U.S. \n     producer groups identified potential non-emergency food \n     assistance needs of about $150 million for wheat alone. \n     Additional opportunities to assist developing countries and \n     lay the groundwork for commercial relationships exist for \n     vegetable oils, protein meals, feed grains, meats and other \n     commodities.\n       In our judgment, you possess the authority to implement the \n     program we have described. We will be happy to discuss \n     further with you or officials of your Department the \n     potential for moving quickly to assist needy populations and \n     enhance U.S. farm exports.\n           Sincerely,\n         Dick Lugar, Pat Roberts, Larry E. Craig, Rick Santorum, \n           Chuck Grassley, Mitch McConnell, Thad Cochran, Paul \n           Coverdell, Jesse Helms.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \n           Forestry,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: We write to share our thoughts about one \n     important way Congress can safeguard the future of our \n     nation's family farms.\n       The FAIR Act is providing income support to agricultural \n     producers. Because of its system of direct transition \n     payments, farmers in 1996-98 will have received $7.6 billion \n     more in federal assistance then would have been the case \n     under an extension of prior law. We will join you in \n     resisting any changes to the FAIR Act's basic provisions.\n       To prosper, however, the agricultural industry requires \n     sound macroeconomic, fiscal and trade policies. In our recent \n     meeting with national farm leaders, all of us heard these \n     producers advocate fast-track trade authority, the reform of \n     economic sanctions and other forward-looking initiatives. We \n     thank you for your leadership in these and other areas.\n       The farm leaders also praised S. 2078, the Farm and Ranch \n     Risk Management Act, which Senator Grassley introduced and \n     all the undersigned Senators support. The FARRM Act will \n     allow producers to save a portion of their farm income on a \n     tax-favored basis in an effort to smooth out volatile income \n     streams and minimize the risks involved in farming. If \n     farmers and ranchers had been able to avail themselves of \n     such FARRM accounts in recent years, the impact of this \n     year's lower commodity prices would have been significantly \n     mitigated.\n       Under S. 2078, eligible producers may take a deduction of \n     up to 20 percent of taxable net farm income for FARRM account \n     use. Interest income earned from the account will be \n     distributed (and taxable) annually. Withdrawals of principal \n     from the FARRM account will be taxed as ordinary income in \n     the year the withdrawals occur. Money cannot remain in a \n     FARRM account more than five years.\n       Thus, the FARRM account is not a retirement plan but a \n     risk-management tool. Revenues in farming and ranching are \n     notoriously volatile. We need only look at the wide swings in \n     commodity prices between 1996 and the present to see that \n     farmers need a range of ways to manage variable prices. The \n     FARRM Act will let producers set pre-tax money aside during \n     good years and then use it during years of financial stress. \n     The responsibility to manage the account will rest with the \n     producer, who is best able to assess his or her individual \n     financial situation in a given year.\n       S. 2078 is a bold and innovative proposal. We seek your \n     assistance in securing fair consideration for this important \n     legislation, and hope that if the Senate acts on major tax \n     legislation this year, S. 2078 will be included in any such \n     bill.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Chuck Grassley, Dick Lugar, Larry E. Craig, Thad Cochran, \n           Pat Roberts, Paul Coverdell, Phil Gramm, Dirk \n           Kempthorne, Chuck Hagel, Kit Bond.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, Republicans will continue to press for \nprompt action on appropriate legislative vehicles. We will join our \nHouse colleagues on both sides of the aisle in asking for a vote this \nyear on fast-track authority, and we want to proceed with all Senators \nto move ahead on IMF replenishment and reform. We are hopeful of seeing \npassage of sanctions reform legislation.\n  We are determined to create additional demand for American farm \nproducts and thus higher prices and hopefully higher income. We are \nworking with farm groups all over the country for implementation of \nthose portions of the farm bill which have led to the lowering of \ncosts, so that the bottom line in terms of net income for farm families \nmight be more positive.\n  I share the general feeling in this debate that these are stressful \ntimes for millions of people in farm country. We have to address that \nup front and soberly. In these comments this morning, Mr. President, I \nhave tried to illustrate that I believe the general outline of the farm \nbill has led to more income, more cash in these 3 years for farmers, \nand will in the next 4; that we have great possibilities, given Freedom \nto Farm, to do things on our farms that are most profitable guided by \nmarket signals. And finally, we have our work cut out for us in the \nSenate in dealing with the strengthening of our foreign trade position \nand the demand that we must have.\n  Not long ago, I heard a lecture using this same general idea, that a \nthird of our sales now go abroad--a third exported of our farm \ncommodities and farm animals. The suggestion was, as a matter of fact, \nthat already a third of the world trade that we were doing was with \nAsia. We had hoped for more expansion, and that seemed on the horizon, \ngiven the rise in Asian incomes prior to this year.\n  Most of that third of the Asian trade is gone temporarily. We may \nhave some success with this sale in Pakistan, and I hope that we will. \nCertainly, we are active as a Nation in South Korea, and there are some \npossibilities for sales there. The Indonesian market for the time being \nis devastated, and likewise not too much from Thailand, from Malaysia, \nand from other countries that have been afflicted.\n  If you take away a third of the third of income that already was \nexported, that amounts to about one-ninth the demand for all that we \ndo. It is no wonder that prices have fallen, but it should be a wonder \nif we do not act to market, to sell, to move this grain and this \nlivestock by originating new policies that make a difference in world \ntrade, where our bread and butter will come in agricultural America.\n  For these reasons, I hope Senators will reject the amendment before \nus dealing with the marketing loan fix. In my judgment, it will be \nexpensive, with money we do not have, it will depress prices rather \nthan lead to an increase, and it will give the impression that this is \nin any way even a partial solution when, in my judgment, it will be a \nstrong step backwards.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am delighted the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, the distinguished Senator from Indiana, has had \nan opportunity to make the case against this amendment offered by the \nDemocratic leader, by Senator Harkin, and by others. It is just as \nclear to me as anything can be that the weight of the evidence is \nagainst the passage of this amendment by the Senate.\n  One other point that I do not think has been made enough is that the \npurpose of this legislation we are dealing with today is to appropriate \nmoney to fund the Department of Agriculture programs, the FDA, and CFTC \nas well. We are not here to really pass judgment on the legislative \nauthority for the Department's expenditure of money. This amendment, \noffered by the Democratic leader, purports to and intends to rewrite \nlegislative language that was approved by the Congress in the 1996 farm \nbill and was signed by the President and implemented through \nregulations and administrative actions by this administration.\n  Our committee has the responsibility of determining how much money is \nneeded to carry out that farm bill and what authorities we have in law \nto spend the funds that have been allocated to our subcommittee under \nthe budget. So our responsibilities are really limited by law. If we \ndecided to start rewriting provisions of the farm bill of 1996, that \nwould be a never-ending ordeal for the Senate to put itself through. \nFor that reason, the Senate ought to reject this first amendment that \nseeks to start that process. This is the first amendment offered to \nthis bill that seeks to rewrite legislative authority of the Department \nof Agriculture to administer a farm program. If we start down this road \nthis morning on this amendment, it may never end.\n  Think about this. When we were writing the farm bill of 1996, we had \nthe best information, advice, and counsel from experts on agriculture \nprograms at our hearings in the Committee on Agriculture. The House \nwent through the same exercise. The administration was actively \ninvolved. There was give and take. There was compromise. But, in the \nend, we developed a consensus of what ought to be done to put our \ncountry on a firm footing of legal authority for programs that would \nsupport agriculture. So the end product was the 1996 farm bill. If we \nstart trying to undo it and rewrite it piecemeal, section by section, \nwe are going to have the biggest mess on our hands you could ever dream \nof.\n  So the Senate ought today to vote for the motion to table, which I \nwill make in due course, when time has expired or when all time is \nyielded back on this amendment. I hope the Senate will reject this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nsuggest the time should be charged equally between the proponents and \nopponents of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time does this side have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 44 minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 20 minutes, to begin with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I listened, of course with great interest and intent, to \nthe comments by the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, my good friend from Indiana. I am privileged to serve as his \nranking member on the Agriculture Committee.\n  I think, first of all I will just respond to that and also to the \nstatement made by the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations \nSubcommittee about, ``My gosh, we passed the farm bill in 1996. Here we \nare, do we want to rewrite it?''--and all that kind of stuff--``We \nshould not open it again right now. It's the third year we are in it.''\n  The 1996 farm bill is not the Ten Commandments. It was not written in \nstone for all time. We have a crisis impending on us in agriculture. \nThe bottom is falling out. Prices are going down every day. Are we so \nstuck in our ways here, are we so wedded to some ideology imprinted in \nthe 1996 farm bill, that we cannot respond?\n  ``Oh, I am sorry. We see you are losing your farms. We see the prices \ngoing down. But, I am sorry, we passed a bill here 3 years ago and we \ncannot touch it.''\n  Again, we are not really opening up the farm bill. We are simply \nmaking one minor change. Loan rates were capped in the 1996 farm bill--\ncapped, frozen; they are still there. We are not introducing something \nnew into agricultural legislation. It is simply that a decision was \nmade to cap them.\n  That is OK. That was OK for the last couple of years, because grain \nprices have been relatively high. But now when the bottom is falling \nout of the market for a variety of reasons, now is the time when \nfarmers need a little bit of assistance. What kind of assistance? They \nneed flexibility.\n  We hear a lot about that word, ``flexibility.'' In the 1996 farm \nbill, it did give farmers flexibility in planting decisions. That was a \ngood part of the 1996 farm bill, a concept that was supported by \neveryone. But how about flexibility for the farmer to be able to decide \nhow to market their crops? That is what we are trying to do by raising \nthe caps on the loan rates--to give the farmer the ability to harvest \nthe crop, get a loan on that crop to pay the bills, and then be able to \nmarket that crop when the farmer feels it is most advantageous over the \nnext 15 months. That is called flexibility, Mr. President, \nflexibility--to give the farmer some flexibility in marketing.\n  What I am hearing from the other side now is, ``No, we don't want to \ngive that farmer flexibility. We want to give the farmer flexibility in \nwhat to plant. But when it comes time to market, he is at the whims of \nthe marketplace, of weather, of other countries and what they do, over \nwhich we have no control.'' That farmer is at the whims of the \ndisastrous Asian economy. We cannot even give that farmer a little bit \nof support to give him the flexibility to market over 15 months? What \nnonsense. What utter, absolute nonsense.\n  Thousands of farm families are facing severe economic hardships. They \nare in danger of losing their livelihood, their life savings. Just \nyesterday, the Senate went on record with a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution saying there is a great economic crisis in agriculture and \ncalling for immediate action by Congress: 99 to nothing. Nice words on \npaper. But now, here is the first vote to implement that sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution that we passed yesterday.\n  We are for the first time trying to raise the caps on the loan rates \nto give the farmer the flexibility to market, and now we can't even \ngive them that much. We can't even do this modest step. What did that \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution mean?\n  Mr. President, I offered that sense-of-the-Senate resolution along \nwith Senator Daschle. It passed 99 to 0. I am wondering, if we can't \neven do this modest little step to help our farmers out, maybe we ought \nto recall that amendment. Maybe we ought to have another vote on it and \nthis time vote it down. Why give all this flowery support that we are \ngoing to help agriculture? There is a problem out there and on the \nfirst vote, ``I am sorry, the farm bill is written in stone; we can't \ntouch it.''\n  What we are proposing is a quite modest and reasonable response to \ntry to prevent the farm situation from becoming any worse and to help \nturn it around. Quite frankly, I am a little embarrassed at the modesty \nof our proposal, but we thought in order to minimize any opposition, we \nwould keep it limited. We are not proposing any radical changes in farm \npolicy. We are not opening the floodgates of the Treasury. We have been \nvery careful in that respect.\n  I must confess, if we cannot manage to adopt even this modest \namendment today, it will speak volumes about the willingness of this \nbody to respond to the dire situation in rural America that we just \nrecognized yesterday in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I underscore that the rural economic crisis is not the fault of \nAmerica's farmers. We have a world situation where large supplies of \ncommodities\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\nhave combined with weakened demand, with a terribly depressed Southeast \nAsian economy that has driven commodity prices lower. In the last 2 \nyears, farm level prices for corn, wheat and soybeans have declined 39 \npercent. Cattle prices are 20 percent below the level earlier this \ndecade. Hog prices for the first half of 1998, are the lowest seen in \n20 years. On top of that, numerous regions have experienced bad weather \nand crop diseases that have devastated our farmers.\n  As of yesterday, a farmer would receive a price of $2.50 a bushel for \nwheat at a country elevator in Dodge City, KS. At that price, the \naverage Kansas farmer with about 350 acres of wheat in the ground right \nnow will suffer a loss of more than $40,000 over his cost of \nproduction. And we are telling that farmer we can't do anything to help \nhim?\n  With the average corn market price announced by USDA on July 10, the \ntypical Iowa corn farmer will be losing more than 35 cents of every \nbushel of corn he markets, even considering the modest Government \npayment that he is going to receive under the 1996 farm bill.\n  Mr. President, 32 of 50 States have suffered declines in farm income \nin 1996 and 1997. Here it is, 32 of 50 States: North Dakota, 98 \npercent; Iowa, down 16 percent; New York, 44; Pennsylvania, 32 percent; \nKentucky, down 29 percent; Tennessee, loss of 28 percent; Missouri, \ndown 72 percent. That is what is happening. That is the loss in farm \nincome, according to Dept. of Commerce figures. As I noted yesterday, \nStandard & Poor's Index for Wall Street has gone up 36 percent in the \nlast year. Look what has happened in agriculture. And yet we can't do \nanything? Not even this modest, little increase in loan rates?\n  If the price estimates released July 10 by USDA hold up, lower corn \nand soybean prices will cause an additional loss of farm income in my \nState of Iowa alone of over $1 billion this year. That translates into \n19,000 jobs in my State affected directly or indirectly by agriculture.\n  On a national basis, this year's crisis will strike a severe blow. \nUSDA estimates suggest that 1998 farm income will fall below $50 \nbillion, 13 percent lower than it was in 1996. With the season average \ncorn and rice projections being lowered 6 percent in July, that number \nis going to fall even more. The $5.2 billion decline in farm income \ncould translate into a loss of nearly 100,000 jobs in the agricultural \nsector and ag-related businesses.\n  Mr. President, 1998 total farm debt is estimated to amount to $172 \nbillion, the highest level since 1985. For those of you who don't \nremember 1985, let me refresh your memory. That was the height of the \nfarm crisis. From 1985 to about 1988, hundreds of thousands of farmers \nlost their farms in the United States. It devastated rural America. It \ntook us, well, almost the next 10 years to climb out of it. Now that we \nare getting out of it, farmers are hit once more.\n  We are going to have a huge farm debt again this year. We are going \nto have another wave of farm foreclosures and farm losses. Families are \nlosing the equity they have built up in their farms. Those who survived \nthe 1980s and thought they had it made because they weathered the worst \nfinancial crisis in agriculture since the 1930s are on the edge and \nthey are getting pushed off.\n  Farm families and communities are facing an emergency, and we in the \nSenate must act, as we have traditionally done when emergencies strike.\n  It is important that all Senators understand what our amendment does. \nIt focuses on the level of the loan that a farmer can take out on farm \ncommodities after harvest using the crop as collateral. This loan \nallows the farmer to pay the bills, as I said, and retain the crop for \nup to 15 months so they can market it in a flexible manner. It let's \nthe farmer make the decision of when to sell rather than being forced \nto sell because the bills are due. You can think about this amendment \nas the ``flexibility to market'' amendment.\n  The formula has been around for a long time. As I said, there is \nnothing new about this. It is in the farm bill: 85 percent of the 5-\nyear average, throwing out the high and the low years. That is the \nbasic formula, 85 percent.\n  The distinguished Senator from Indiana went on at great length \ntalking about how we don't want this loan rate set so that it will \ninfluence farmers to make their planting decisions, because if the loan \nrate is too high, then the farmer plants for the loan, not for the \nmarket.\n  I have three observations on that. First of all, this amendment only \ncovers the 1999 Fiscal year. We re talking about crops that are already \nplanted, for the most part. So how can a one-year amendment have any \nsubstantial influence on farmers' decisions about what to plant next \nyear? I think perhaps people who have been speaking against the \namendment don't understand that. It is only for one fiscal year.\n  Even assuming somehow psychologically it did because the farmer might \nsay, ``Well, I got that loan this year and if things remain bad next \nyear, maybe they will do the same thing next year, so, therefore, I \nwill make my planting decisions based upon that possibility'' that is \nridiculous in the extreme. Why? Because, first of all, this loan rate \nis only 85 percent of the last year 5-year average, throwing out the \nhigh and low years--85 percent. For corn right now, the farm bill cap \nis $1.89 a bushel. Our modest amendment would remove that rate, raise \nit to $2.19 for this crop year. Wheat right now is capped at $2.58 a \nbushel. Removing the cap would put the rate at about $3.22 a bushel. \nBoth of those are way below the cost of production.\n\n  If you are a farmer, and you are making planting decisions based upon \nthe loan rate, then what my friend from Indiana is saying is that the \nfarmer is going to plant more corn to get a loan rate that is lower \nthan his cost of production. It reminds me of the old joke, the old saw \nwe always hear around my State about farmers. Someone asked the corn \nfarmer how he expected prices to be? He said, ``Well, I hope to at \nleast break even because I need the money.''\n  According to the Senator from Indiana, raising the loan rate to $2.19 \nwould somehow encourage a corn farmer to plant corn. Nonsense. That is \nway below the cost of production and no farmer would ever do that. They \nare going to plant based upon what they think they can get in the \nmarket next year.\n  So those are two things. First of all, our raising the caps only \napply to this upcoming fiscal year; secondly, there is no way that this \nmodest raising of loan rates will in any way influence any farmer to \nplant for the loan. In no way would that do that.\n  And third, I must again remind our Senators and others that in \nagriculture--I do not know why we never learn the lesson of ag \neconomics--a farmer has a fixed amount of land, he has fixed machinery, \nhe has a lot of fixed input and equity costs. If prices drop, there are \nthose who say, ``Well, see, that will send a message to the farmer. If \nthe prices go down, they will plant less of that crop next year.'' That \nis not so. Because when you have your fixed base and your fixed amount \nof land and your machinery, if prices go down, your first impulse is to \nget more production out of that unit of land. Maybe you will check on \nfertilizer prices. Maybe you will put on a little more fertilizer. \nMaybe you will put the rows a little closer together. Maybe you will do \nsome other things. Maybe you will plant a little more on some land you \ndid not want to plant on because you already have the machinery out \nthere.\n  The marginal cost of production for an additional acre of corn, if \nyou are already planting 500 or 1,000 acres of corn, that marginal cost \nof planting that extra 20 acres or 50 acres is minimal. Yet, if you can \nraise your production, well then, that will take care of the lower \nprices. But that feeds on itself.\n  I predicted 2 years ago, when the 1996 farm bill passed, that that is \nexactly what would happen: We would see increasing production. \nHopefully, the price would stay up. But if other countries' economies \nwent to pot--and we saw a couple years ago that it looked like that \nmight happen--well, then, prices would drop. And how would farmers \nrespond? They would plant more and produce more. And that is exactly \nwhat has happened--exactly what has happened.\n  We probably have a record production of soybeans this year, near \nrecord production of both wheat and corn. But\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\nsomehow people just think that agriculture is just like making widgets. \nAnd it is not. It is a lot different.\n  This amendment is very modest--very modest. We are not proposing to \nchange the 1996 farm bill in any way. As I said, this provision is in \nthe 1996 farm bill. It is just capped. We are just raising the caps. We \nare not interfering with planting flexibility, for farmers to make \ntheir own decisions. In fact, we are enhancing the flexibility of \nfarmers to market their commodities when it is advantageous for them to \ndo so.\n  Then, I know we keep hearing the old refrain about keeping Government \nout of agriculture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator has used the 20 \nminutes yielded to him.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. So we hear the old refrain, get the Government out of \nagriculture; give the farmers more freedom. That is what this amendment \ndoes. If that is what you like, this amendment gives the farmers more \nfreedom. I just ask my colleagues, what kind of freedom do they have in \nmind when they talk about giving farmers freedom? The freedom to be \nforced out of business by events beyond their control?\n  As I said yesterday, I read a comment in the newspaper by one of my \ncolleagues here who said they wanted to give farmers more ability to \nmanage their destiny. I said, I do not understand that. How can my corn \nfarmer in Iowa manage El Nino? How can my soybean farmer in Iowa manage \nthe disastrous Southeast Asian economy? How can our wheat farmers \nmanage the subsidies that other governments give their wheat farmers to \ncompete unfairly with us? How can those wheat farmers manage the \ndisastrous scab disease that we have had in some of our northern Great \nPlains States? These are all events that are beyond their control.\n  Is this the kind of freedom that my colleagues have in mind for \nfarmers? To be forced out by events beyond their control? The freedom \nto be forced to sell their crops at a loss because they cannot afford \nto hold onto them or get a decent loan to be able to market it when \nprices improve a little; is that the kind of freedom we have in mind? \nIs the freedom that my colleagues have in mind the freedom to struggle \nat poverty-level income while growing the food for our Nation? Is it \nthe freedom for farmers to take less and less and less of the consumer \ndollar? Is that the kind of freedom they have in mind?\n  Well, we have heard a lot of arguments on this amendment. It has been \nclaimed that farmers receive more money under the 1996 farm bill than \nthey would have under the continuation of the 1990 farm bill. That is \ntrue for the last 2 years when commodity prices were high. You have to \nunderstand, in the 1996 farm bill we gave farmers all the planting \nflexibility, but there was this payment called the Agriculture Market \nTransition Act payment, AMTA payments, without any payment limitations. \nNo matter what farm income was like, you got a paycheck. I always \nthought that was kind of ridiculous.\n  I had a farmer come up to me once in Iowa last year, after the \nprevious year's crop, and he said, ``Gee, I had one of the best years I \nhave ever had. I had a great year, and I got a paycheck from the \nGovernment. What are you people thinking about?'' See, I always thought \nthat Government safety nets ought to be there when prices were low. If \na farmer can make their money from the marketplace, that is the way it \nought to be. But when there are events beyond their control, like bad \nweather and bad markets and interference by foreign governments, that \nis when the Government has to come in with a safety net.\n  The last couple of years farmers got Government payments. But for \nthis year--when prices are in the tank--for wheat farmers they will \nhave less income protection than they would have had under the 1990 \nfarm bill. According to current USDA price estimates, per-bushel \npayments to wheat farmers would have been 40 percent higher under the \n1990 farm bill than they are scheduled to be under the 1996 farm bill \nthis year. That difference would amount to nearly $22,000 for a farmer \nwith 1,000 acres of wheat.\n  One might infer that these farmers got these Government payments, and \nthey could have taken these payments and sort of invested them and put \nthem in the bank, so to speak, to get them through this year. Sounds \nnice. But is that really what happened? Hardly.\n  First of all, a lot of farmers were paying off buildup debt, No. 1. \nThey used the payments for that. No. 2, what happened was, a lot of \nfarmers who rent found that their landlords increased the rent. Why? \nBecause the landlords knew the farmer was going to get this Government \npaycheck, knew exactly what he was going to get. So the landlords \nraised the price of rent. Consequently, a lot of farmers did not even \nsee the Government payment that came out in the form of that cash \npayment under the 1996 farm bill. A lot of farmers did not even get \nthat money. But I will tell you who did get the money. The big farmers. \nThe larger the farmer you are, the bigger the check you got over the \nlast couple of years. And the larger the farmer you are, the better \nable you are to go through periods of stress.\n\n  So it was all kind of screwed up. The bigger farmers got the most \nmoney over the last 2 years when prices were high. Now, when prices are \nlow, our smaller farmers can't get enough help. The bigger farmers are \nable to get through it because they have more equity.\n  Now we are going to say we can't even modestly raise the loan rates? \nI don't know, but I would think wheat farmers out there who are \nsuffering would say they could use the ability to market their wheat \nover the next 15 months rather than have to sell this fall. Right now, \nthe wheat loan is $2.58 a bushel. We are just asking to raise it to \n$3.22 a bushel. That is not a lot of money, but it might be a little \nbit of help.\n  As I said, I think we checked the wheat in Dodge City, KS, \nyesterday--$2.50 and going down. The first of July, it was $2.64. Now \nit is down to $2.50 and going down every week. So our wheat farmers and \nour corn farmers need some help.\n  I talked about farmers getting less and less of the share. This chart \nshows the farm share of the retail beef dollar, going down all the \ntime. So for every dollar, when you buy that steak or you buy that \nhamburger, the farmer is getting less and less from the dollar you \nspend for it. Here is the pork dollar. Every time you buy a pork loin \nroast or one of our delicious Iowa chops--if I can put in a plug for \nthat--our pork farmers are getting less and less of that dollar you \nspend for pork.\n  Here is the wheat prices--farm-level wheat price. Here is when the \nFreedom to Farm bill was enacted. Here are the wheat prices, going \ndown, over the last couple of years. Same thing for corn. Here we are \ncoming up to Freedom to Farm; down it comes. So corn prices are going \ndown, also.\n  There is a crisis out there. We are not talking about increasing \nconsumer food costs or livestock feed costs, nor are we going to price \nthe United States out of world markets. If the price of the commodity \nis below the loan rate, the farmer can sell at that lower price and \nrepay the loan at the going market price. So the marketing loan does \nnot prop up the U.S. price among world market prices. Hence, there is \nno adverse impact upon U.S. competitiveness because of this amendment.\n  Taking the cap off will help our farmers stay in business. The fact \nis, it may be the only thing that will keep them in business for \nanother year.\n  Again, we have heard all these arguments, but for the life of me, I \ncan't understand--I can't understand--why we on one day can say there \nis a crisis in agriculture, Congress has to respond, and 99 Senators \nvote for that; the next day, we want just a modest increase in the loan \nrates to help, and we can't do that? I hope that is not so. I hope we \ndo this today.\n  Lastly, I heard the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee talking about getting fast-track legislation through, as if \nsomehow that is going to help prices this year. Even if fast track were \nto pass this year, it would take several years to conclude agricultural \ntalks. I point out, the last Uruguay Round of multilateral talks took 7 \nyears. Keep in mind, even if we got fast track through, that is not \ngoing to mean a darn thing for 3, 5, 6, 7 years. That will not help \nthis year--not going to help a bit.\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\n  Second, the crisis is now, not 7 years from now. It is right now. \nSometimes we have short memories around here. We talk about, yes, we \nwill do all this stuff; we are going to get our trade going again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time the Senator requested has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  In addition, my colleague from Indiana worries about the potential \nimplications for stocks from this amendment. World grain reserves right \nnow, as a percentage of consumption, are at historically low levels. I \nbelieve the American people would be appalled to learn that our \nGovernment holds virtually no food in reserve to help us out if we ever \nhave a widespread crop failure.\n  The chairman suggests that if the Government holds this grain, it \nstays over the market and depresses prices. Not if you have a \ngovernment reserve withheld from the market--absolutely not true. But \nthis concept of having a modest reserve is not a new idea. Someone said \nit began with the Roosevelt administration. This is a Roosevelt New \nDeal idea, to have a grain reserve, and, as such, we had to do away \nwith it because it was a New Deal idea and we don't need all that stuff \naround anymore.\n  The concept of a grain reserve is as old as the Book of Genesis. \nSurely my colleagues remember the story of Joseph interpreting the \ndream of the pharaoh, that there would be 7 good years followed by 7 \nlean years and that food should be stored during the 7 good years to \nfeed the people when the bad years came.\n  It was true at the time of Genesis and it is true today that we need \nsome food set aside in this country and around the world to meet \nexigencies. For the life of me, I can't understand why people want to \nignore history. We ignore it at our own peril. Ignore it, and we will \nlose more and more farmers, and we will see a day come when there will \nbe panic because we will have those lean years and we won't have any \nfood to help feed our hungry people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are getting to the point where I think \nthe Senate should seriously consider preparing for a vote on a motion \nto table this amendment. I know the time continues to exist on both \nsides, but I am hopeful we can yield back whatever time has not been \nused as soon as everybody who wants to talk has had a chance to talk.\n  We don't want to cut anybody off. I am not going to do that. I am \njust expressing the hope that if everybody has had their say on this \namendment, and we have had arguments on both sides--we had a very \nstrong, convincing argument by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, \nthe chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee; we have had \ndiscussions on the Democratic side by four Senators that I recall \nspeaking in support of the amendment; Senator Daschle talked in support \nof the amendment yesterday when he offered the amendment--so I am \nhopeful that those who want to speak will come to the floor and speak \non this amendment and then we will have a motion to table and a vote.\n  I think the time expires sometime a little after 2 o'clock. We had 3 \nhours on the amendment. That is just a request. I hope Senators will \nrespond to that request so we can make progress to complete action on \nthis bill today.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I inquire of the chairman, I understand we have one other \nSenator on this side who would like to come down and speak.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We will be glad to accommodate that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to inquire of the chairman--obviously it is well \nwithin his right to move to table--why can't we have an up-or-down \nvote?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is in the order. We negotiated that last night.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thought perhaps the chairman might be willing to place \nthis matter for an up or down vote, rather than vote on a motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It was in the unanimous consent agreement. We can get \nthe clerk to read it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry if I am impeding the business of the Senate in \nraising this question.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It was contemplated I would move to table the Daschle \namendment. That is what the Democratic leader understood. We talked \nabout it last night. It was in the order as entered last night--3 hours \nof debate on the amendment--and that is what we are operating under.\n  I want to remind everybody that it is my intention to move to table \nand to have a vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is fully within the chairman's right to do that.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is not any reflection on anyone.\n  It is certainly not personal.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that. I hope we have an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, the \nesteemed chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee. Let me say how \nmuch I appreciate his perseverance and patience as we work to try to \nget what I think is a very good agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I made some remarks yesterday. I will not take up much time of the \nSenate to go over that again. But I do have some comments, more \nespecially as to the criticism by those across the aisle in regard to \nthe loan rate and in regard to the Daschle amendment which, I \nunderstand, is intended to be of help to the farmers and, more \nespecially, the farmers in the northern plains who are going through a \nvery difficult time.\n  Mr. President, we have heard that there is no longer a ``safety-net'' \nfor America's farmers. Advocates of this position argue that we must \nextend marketing loans and remove the caps on loan rates. Based upon \nrecent figures, it is estimated the loan rate for wheat would rise to \n$3.17 per bushel from its current level of $2.58. However, when you add \nthe transition payments of 63 cents per bushel on the historical base \nthat farmers are receiving for wheat, you have a new safety net of \n$3.21. We are told raising the loan cap will cost nearly $1.5 billion \nfor one year. And, if we were to come back and make the increase \npermanent, we are told it would cost $3.5 billion to $4 billion over \nfive years. Why should we approve amendments that will bust the budget \nwhen they provide a lower safety net than the current program?\n  Raising and extending loan rates will not improve prices and producer \nincomes. Extending the loan rate actually results in lower prices in \nthe long-run. Extending the loan for six months simply gives producers \nanother false hope for holding onto the remainder of last year's crop. \nFarmers will be holding onto a portion of the 1997 crop, while at the \nsame time harvesting another bumper crop in 1998.\n  Thus, rolling over the loan rate actually increases the amount of \nwheat on the market and results in lower prices--not higher prices. \nSince excess stocks will continue to depress prices, will we then \nextend the rate again? It will become an endless cycle that will cost \nbillions of dollars, and which will eventually lead to a return to \nplanting requirements and set-aside acres in an attempt to control \nagricultural output and limit the budgetary effects. Where will we get \nthe offsets the Senate and House will require?\n  Extending and raising loan rates will only serve to exacerbate the \nlack of storage associated with the transportation problems in middle \nAmerica, because it simply causes farmers to hold onto their crops and \nfill elevator storage spaces. Kansas just harvested its second largest \nwheat crop in history and there are predictions of record corn and \nsoybean crops in the fall. If we do not move the wheat crop now, it \nwill create transportation problems in the fall that will surpass \nanything we experienced last year.\n  I feel it should also be mentioned that advocates of higher or \nextended loan rates argue that it will allow farmers to hold their \ncrops until after the harvest when prices will rise. To those who \nadvocate this position, I would point out that Kansas State University \nrecently published a report\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nwhich looked at the years 1981 through 1997 and compared farmers \nearnings if they held wheat in storage until mid-November versus \nselling at harvest. In all but five years, farmers ended up with a net \nloss as storage and interest costs exceeded the gains in price. Simply \nput, extending and raising the rates provides a false hope for higher \nprofits that most often does not exist.\n  Mr. President, we must ask what is the purpose of loan rates? Are \nthey intended to be a marketing clearing device or a price support? \nThey cannot be both as the other side of the aisle would. And, if we \nset price at $3.17 it very well may become a ceiling on price.\n  Mr. President, raising loan rates is simply not the answer. We need \nto continue on course and continue to pursue the new trade markets and \ntax relief that farmers need. And, as I mentioned yesterday, I would \nremind my colleagues of the meeting 14 Senators had with 12 major farm \norganizations approximately one month ago. At the top of every \norganizations wish list was trade, trade, and more trade.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned yesterday that I like to think I have \nspent more time on the wagon tongue listening to our farmers than any \nMember of Congress. And, farmers tell me to leave loan rates alone. \nThey want export markets opened. They want sanctions that shoot them in \nthe foot removed. These are the policies we should be pursuing, not the \npolicies of the past that put our farmers at a competitive disadvantage \nin the world market.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two articles, which fit \nwithin the restrictions of Senate rules, by Pro Farmer's Washington \nBureau Chief Jim Wiesemeyer, be printed in the Record. One is regarding \nfailed policies of the past, and the second one is regarding trade \npolicy.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From Inside Washington Today, June 18, 1998]\n\n       Populist Democrats Again Push Failed Policies of the Past\n\n                          (By Jim Wiesemeyer)\n\n       Saying ``I told you so'' to any lawmaker and any person or \n     farmer who either voted for or pushed for the 1996 Freedom to \n     Farm legislation, a group of decidedly populist Democrat \n     senators on Wednesday railed at the omnibus farm policy \n     contained in that legislation and said it was that measure \n     and not trade problems which alone is the reason for \n     slumbering U.S. commodity prices.\n       The group of naysayers to Freedom to Farm who showed up at \n     a press briefing with very few answers to questions were: \n     former House Speaker and very likely presidential candidate \n     Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Missouri), Senate Minority Leader Tom \n     Daschle (D-S.D.), and Democrat Sens. Tom Harkin (Iowa), Paul \n     Wellstone (Minnesota), Kent Conrad (N.D.), Tim Johnson (S.D.) \n     and Byron Dorgan (N.D.).\n       What they said and didn't say: Headed by Daschle, the group \n     squarely and wrongly laid the blame for the current farm \n     price doldrums with the Freedom to Farm concept enacted into \n     law in 1996 and signed by President Bill Clinton who did not \n     receive a veto recommendation from his Secretary of \n     Agriculture Dan Glickman.\n       Displaying price charts showing the decline in commodity \n     prices since 1996, the lawmakers took turns ``briefing'' the \n     Washington press corps (but very few took questions), \n     claiming the 1996 Farm Act failed and they could all say ``I \n     told you so'' to those who voted for the package.\n       ``This was radical, extreme policy brought on by (House \n     Majority Leader) Dick Armey (R-Tex.), Gephardt charged. \n     Others at the gathering quickly chimed in to say it was \n     merely a ``Republican farm bill.''\n       Sen. Wellstone pledged an ``all-out, full-court press'' to \n     get the following four main components of the group's plan \n     enacted into law: dramatically increasing commodity loans \n     rates and allowing 6-month loan extensions; addressing \n     livestock concentration and requiring labels on imported \n     meat; waiving of sanctions on agricultural trade; making \n     indemnity payments to farmers.\n       Where's the proof? The senators cited dramatic downturns in \n     farm income but based that on data from the Bureau of \n     Economic Analysis (Commerce Department) regarding personal \n     income derived from farming.\n       The group should have referred to a recently completed USDA \n     analysis of spring wheat farms in the Plains states. That \n     survey shows that in 1996, the average net cash farm income \n     for these spring wheat farms was $37,500; in 1997 it was \n     $14,500; and a projected 1998 net cash farm income of only \n     $5,000.\n       The USDA info clearly shows pain, and a crisis for spring \n     wheat producers in a specific area of the country. But as one \n     USDA official told me this morning, ``Do we have a crisis in \n     U.S. agriculture today or a regional crisis, and if we do, \n     what is the best way to deal with it?''\n       Certainly a blunt instrument of help would not be to jack \n     up wheat loan rates to over $4 as proposed by Sen. Conrad.\n       Populist Democrat senators didn't note popular Freedom to \n     Farm transition payments. USDA data show that for the 1996, \n     1997 and 1998 crops (combined), Freedom to Farm legislation \n     will provide $7 billion to $8 billion in additional payments \n     to farmers that would have been the case under the prior farm \n     policy. Talk about indemnity payments!\n       Sure, if loan rates would not have been capped via the 1996 \n     farm bill, there would have been a larger cash infusion this \n     year especially for wheat producers, but certainly not the \n     prior two years relative to those payments I previously \n     mentioned, and when wheat prices were higher to much higher \n     than current values.\n       I asked several USDA analysts to list reasons why U.S. \n     commodity prices are lower. They listed the following two \n     major reasons:\n       1. Lack of export growth.\n       2. Good grain crops around the world the last three years.\n       What does the above have to do with Freedom to Farm? \n     Nothing.\n       Questions for the populist senators. While the senators \n     didn't take much if any time to answer reporter questions, \n     here are a few they should ponder:\n       Rep. Gephardt labeled Freedom to Farm legislation as a \n     ``radical extreme policy brought on by (House Majority \n     Leader) Dick Armey'' (R-Tex.).\n       Question: Since you will very likely run for president in \n     the year 2000, why didn't you say that President Clinton \n     should have vetoed the farm bill? Why didn't you say that \n     USDA Secretary Glickman should have recommended a veto?\n       Another question: Rep. Gephardt in the 1985 farm bill \n     debate, along what Sen. Harkins, pushed mandatory supply \n     controls. That was soundly repudiated by Congress, which just \n     so happened to be controlled at the time by Democrats. If \n     there is one major aspect of Freedom to Farm that most non-\n     dissident farmers love, it is the planting flexibility \n     contained in that legislation. Do you agree?\n       Sen. Byron Dorgan said the group ``didn't have the \n     details'' regarding their proposals and thus did not know the \n     costs. ``We're working on a number of things,'' Dorgan said.\n       Question: It would be costly, and not just in budget \n     outlays, but in a return to failed farm policies of the past. \n     Why don't you agree?\n       A specific question for Sen. Dorgan: You keep pushing for \n     targeted farm program payments, having done so for what \n     appears to be over 10 years. Some analysts told me to ask \n     you, ``What chances do you think of this happening? And are \n     they simply to provide feel-good comments for the folks back \n     home?''\n       Questin to all Democrats: Many Democrats in Congress \n     honestly say they are showing some fiscal discipline. But to \n     propose major changes in farm policy without any budget \n     assumptions runs counter with the previous goal. Question: \n     What are the costs? And to the extent the agriculture \n     committees boost spending on any of the Democrat senators' \n     proposals means a budget offset would have to be found. What \n     will be cut to pay for your proposals?\n       Sen. Harkin said that by just removing the loan cap on \n     wheat, prices for wheat would be 25% higher than current \n     levels and corn prices would be up 20% from their current \n     level. Question: U.S. commodities are already having trouble \n     competing in the export market, why do you think higher \n     prices at this time would bode well for exports? And would \n     this not also provide incentive for increased production for \n     wheat and corn outside the United States, as was the case \n     under prior U.S. farm policy when loan rates (not an income \n     transfer tool) were set much higher than market-clearing \n     levels? And, wouldn't such a scenario cause prices to \n     eventually be lower than the track they currently are on?\n       Also, why wouldn't pushing prices far above market-clearing \n     levels result in government-owned surplus wheat that no one \n     wants and lead to calls for a return to an ever upward spiral \n     of set-aside requirements to slow the growth in the mountain \n     of government-owned grain? Usually the answer is, ``Marketing \n     loans will take care of that?'' But that raises the question \n     again: ``At what cost?'' And if marketing loans shouldered \n     those significant costs, wouldn't they be seen as a subsidy \n     by the rest of the world and completely undo many years of \n     work on trade issues and renew the race toward subsidized \n     production and subsidized exports worldwide?\n       What many farmers say are the big-ticket issues: Ask a \n     group of farmers what their long-term issues and concerns are \n     and you will surely find disagreement, but based on many \n     conversations with this great industry, they boil down to the \n     following three areas:\n       1. Taxes.\n       2. Environmental regulatory reform.\n       3. Trade issues (sanctions, denied market access, etc.).\n       To repeat, farmers in the Northern Plains are hurting and \n     hurting bad. I met Wednesday with several North Dakota \n     farmers at the Washington office of the National Farmers \n     Union. It didn't take many testimonials to feel their pain. \n     As for the reasons why, they centered on low yields, scab and \n     drought--compounded by those events happening in successive \n     years with a crop insurance program unable to cope with those \n     events. Solution: fix crop insurance.\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\n       Is this just an aberration of bad luck? Or, should the \n     United States come up with a regional assistance program \n     rather than changing comprehensive U.S. farm policy?\n       Northern tier farmers need help, but they're certainly not \n     going to get it based on the political-platform briefing the \n     stated Democrat senators provided on June 17.\n       We asked USDA Secretary Glickman to comment on remarks the \n     Democrat senators made Wednesday. Glickman said current farm \n     policy needs some modifications to address low prices and \n     growing problems in some regions.\n       ``I think the best view is to not engage in recriminations, \n     but to recognize that there are strengths and weaknesses in \n     the Freedom to Farm legislation,'' Glickman said. `One of the \n     weaknesses,'' he added, ``is the inability of my office to \n     respond when prices are weak and supplies are high. I think \n     that Freedom to Farm needs some modifications to it, and \n     we're working on it now.''\n       Asked how much in payments farmers have received in the \n     past several years under the Freedom to Farm compared to what \n     would have been the case under the previous farm policy, \n     Glickman replied, ``Many billions (of dollars)--I can't tell \n     you how much. (I've provided him the answer, above.) The \n     first two years (of current farm policy), there was much more \n     (paid to farmers via market transition payments) than (would \n     have been the case) under the old program. This year, it's \n     hard to tell, but I think in some of the crops it might be \n     less.''\n       Regarding current prices and global supply and demand, \n     Glickman said grain supplies are high for a lot of reasons--\n     Asian markets are weaker and higher U.S. dollar valuations \n     have reduced exports, resulting in higher domestic supplies.\n       Also, Glickman said he lacks the marketing tools available \n     to previous ag secretaries.\n       ``I don't have the power to deal with the marketing of \n     commodities in the way that prior (USDA) secretaries have \n     had,'' Glickman stated. ``I think those things need to be \n     fixed.''\n       Glickman pointed out that the lack of federal disaster \n     programs for farmers and a crop insurance program that works \n     better in some parts of the country and not so good in other \n     regions as a difference in the tools he has available versus \n     previous USDA chiefs.\n       ``So, without any kind of intermediate assistance,'' \n     Glickman concluded, ``it makes it difficult to respond to \n     certain conditions in some regions of the country that have \n     been currently (adversely) affected.''\n       Bottom line regarding the populist Democrat senators' \n     proposals: A wise man once said that one form of insanity is \n     doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different \n     result.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From Inside Washington Today, June 19, 1998]\n\n               Fast-track Approval Part of Top Ag Agenda\n\n                          [By Jim Wiesemeyer)\n\n       What a difference a day and different senators make when it \n     comes to the focus of U.S. agriculture and trade policy. \n     Thursday we highlighted the drive by some Democrat farm-state \n     senators to change U.S. farm policy to address the current \n     very low price and income situation in parts of the country \n     but especially the Northern Plains. Their plan focused on \n     higher loan rates, extending commodity loans and making \n     indemnity payments to producers.\n       By stark contrast, some Republican farm-state Senators \n     Thursday morning met with 12 farm and commodity groups to \n     prioritize the farm policy agenda. These lawmakers and farm \n     group representatives did not recommend wholesale if any \n     changes to the 1996 farm act. Instead, they focused on what \n     can be done in trade and trade policy to keep U.S. \n     agriculture products moving to overseas markets.\n       Republican senators huddle with farm commodity groups on \n     priority agenda. In a meeting Thursday with major farm \n     groups, the session concluded with the following list of \n     priorities: Reauthorization of presidential fast-track \n     trading authority; IMF funding and reforms; passage of \n     sanctions reform legislation; Most Favored Nation (MFN) \n     trading designation for China; stronger oversight on GMO and \n     biotechnology negotiations; full funding for Sen. Dick \n     Lugar's agricultural research bill; estate tax reform; and \n     reform of the farm savings system\n       Farm groups represented at the session: American Farm \n     Bureau Federation; American Soybean Association; National \n     Association of Wheat Growers; National Barley Growers \n     Association; National Corn Growers Association; National \n     Cattlemen's Beef Association; National Cotton Council of \n     America; National Grain Sorghum Association; National Grange; \n     National Oilseed Processors Association; National Pork \n     Producers Council; and National Sunflower Association.\n       Senators participating in the agenda-setting confab: \n     Majority Leader Trend Lott (R-Miss.); Senate Ag Committee \n     Chairman Dick Lugar (R-Ind.); Senate Ag Appropriations \n     Chairman Thad Cochran (R-Miss.); Pat Roberts (R-Kan.); Conrad \n     Burns (R-Mont.); Larry Craig (R-Idaho); Craig Thomas (R-\n     Wyo.); Rod Grams (R-Minn.); Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa); Dick \n     Kempthorne (R-Idaho); Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.); Wayne Allard (R-\n     Colo.); and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n       What was said and wasn't said: ``Farmers and ranchers tell \n     us they don't want the government back in their back \n     pockets,'' says Sen. Burns. ``That means doing everything we \n     can to open up markets to them and to provide more of the \n     agricultural dollar to the producer level. We've also \n     determined that while trade is very important, issues such as \n     fast track are worthless unless the (Clinton) administration \n     commits to sending trade negotiators abroad who are sensitive \n     to the needs of agriculture.''\n       Burns said that while income averaging and some estate tax \n     relief has come for farmers, more still needs to be done.\n       Sen. Lugar says the group agreed that ``the current debate \n     should not be about changes to the 1996 Farm Bill, as some \n     are proposing, but what can be done in this new farm \n     environment to move ahead.'' The Senate ag panel chairman \n     noted ``there are some, even in the Senate, who are talking \n     about supply management,'' a policy that Lugar labeled as ``a \n     defeatist, defensive policy.''\n       Lugar was asked to comment on proposals unveiled Wednesday \n     by a group of Democrat senators which included a call to \n     raise loan rates and to make indemnity payments to farmers. \n     ``These would not be helpful,'' Lugar responded. ``We've gone \n     down that trail before. They led to an increase in supplies \n     so that the price was depressed for years, not just a few \n     months.''\n       ``Why people want to repeat history . . .'' Lugar continued \n     in his pointed comments regarding some Senate Democrats' farm \n     policy proposals. ``My own view,'' he said, ``is that we \n     would not change the loan rate, we should not extend the loan \n     (term), we should not be sending indemnities out, we should \n     not be sending massive amounts of money. We've got a good, \n     solid farm policy.''\n       Sen. Pat Roberts, the ``father of Freedom to Farm'' when he \n     was House Ag Committee chairman, also responded to \n     alternative farm policy proposals from a small group of \n     Democrat senators. He said he would be the first one in line \n     to back raising loan rates if that was a sound idea. Key word \n     there is if.\n       The issue of loan rates, Roberts continued, comes down to a \n     debate on the purpose of the loan program. ``You have to have \n     a policy judgment,'' Roberts stated. ``Do you want the loan \n     rate to be a market-clearing device, or an income protection \n     device?'' He noted that today, farmers are receiving \n     ``transition payments that are twice as much as they would \n     have had under the previous (farm policy) program.''\n       Roberts zeroed in on farm woes in the Northern Plains. He \n     said a look at what is causing the trouble in this region \n     shows: ``Number one, you've had bad weather; ``Number two, \n     you've had wheat disease for six years; ``Number three, \n     you've got some real border problems with Canada; ``Number \n     four, (Northern Plains) cost of production is historically \n     higher.''\n       ``There is a serious problem'' in the Northern Plains, \n     Roberts stressed. ``But what is the answer?'' he asked. He \n     said a return to the failed policies of the past such as \n     raising the loan rates ``is a dead-end street.''\n       Roberts signaled a possible assistance tool ahead for needy \n     producers when he said he has talked to USDA Secretary Dan \n     Glickman about credit issues such as getting loans on coming \n     Freedom to Farm transition payments.\n       Sen. Chuck Hagel focused on getting the IMF funding package \n     and fast-track negotiating authority as top priorities.\n       Hagel admitted that the House Republican leadership will \n     have to be encouraged to bring these measures up for votes. \n     But he quickly added, ``Let's recall that all trade issues \n     have been non-partisan,'' noting that he certainly hopes the \n     situation remains that way.\n       Fast-track gets new life. One of the top agenda items Lugar \n     and other senators mentioned was getting the administration \n     fast-track trade negotiating authority. Consider the \n     following recent developments:\n       Sen. Roberts said that while he can't and won't speak for \n     House Speaker Newt Gingrich, discussions he's held with \n     Gingrich indicate a plant to bring fast track to a vote in \n     the House in September. Roberts says, ``Why wait? Let's do it \n     now!''\n       Gingrich, in an interview with CongressDaily earlier this \n     week, confirmed that Congress will consider fast-track trade \n     legislation sometime before adjourning this fall. He cited \n     the ongoing Asian financial crisis as a reason to bolster the \n     United States' trade position. He said renewing this \n     authority to negotiate trade deals via fast track would be \n     good for U.S. business, particularly agriculture.\n       House Ag Committee Chairman Bob Smith (R-Oregon) said he is \n     waiting for a response from the Clinton administration to a \n     previous proposal he made that he estimates could deliver up \n     to 30 votes for fast track. That could be enough to pass the \n     contentious trade measure.\n       Smith sent a letter last month to U.S. Trade Representative \n     Charlene Barshefsky proposing the administration change \n     authorizing language in the measure so the House and Senate \n     Ag panels would have greater authority to review implementing \n     agreements related to fast track. (In Beijing this week, \n     Barshefsky welcomed Gingrich's call for a vote on fast-track \n     trade legislation this year.)\n       ``If they give me the go-ahead,'' Smith said he could \n     ``deliver the votes.'' Noting the fast-track measure was \n     within around 10 votes of achieving House passage last year, \n     Smith said his idea could help switch as many as 30 votes. He \n     said his approach would allow members to ``cross over and \n     they could then go back home and answer the people who say \n     that agriculture always gets traded out.''\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\n       Sen. Grassley this week called on President Clinton to \n     ``back up his speech that he made in Geneva'' on the \n     importance of trade. He further called on Clinton to use \n     ``his power of persuasion'' and the ``power of the office'' \n     to muscle up support for fast track.\n       Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) said that without the ability to \n     negotiate trade deals and keep U.S. ag trade moving, \n     ``serious problems facing U.S. agriculture today are apt to \n     get worse.'' He added that U.S. agriculture is relying \n     heavily on ``demand in foreign markets.''\n       Bottom line: sooner or later in this town common sense \n     prevails. Momentum for getting congressional approval of \n     fast-track trade negotiating authority is growing. But in the \n     past, fast-track proponents didn't keep the issue front-and-\n     center. It looks like farm groups and others have learned \n     some hard lessons. Frankly, I think fast track would have \n     passed before if there would have been an actual vote on the \n     floors of Congress (a minority viewpoint, for sure). Let's \n     just hope a vote occurs this time, this year. We need to see \n     the true Hall of Shame of those lawmakers who vote against \n     authority to simply negotiate. Any trade agreement can be \n     voted down. But not to give U.S. trade negotiators a chance \n     can only be deemed for what it is: protectionism in disguise.\n       And if Rep. Smith gets his worthwhile proposal okayed, then \n     farm-state lawmakers voting against fast-track would have a \n     lot of fast explaining to do--to their agribusiness \n     constituents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank our leader for \nyielding time to me.\n  I wanted to speak earlier for the Record to give my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa some words from Louisiana. We talk a lot about the \nMidwest and the Northwest, and the difficulty that our farmers are \nexperiencing, actually all over our country. And the South, Mr. \nPresident, is no different.\n  I had a very lengthy conference call with the leaders of many of our \ncommodity groups. I am sorry to bring to this floor that the situation \nis fairly urgent in Louisiana. I am sure that is true in other places \nin the South. They are facing economic hardships, unparalleled in many \ninstances. In fact, I asked Ken Methavin, one of our cotton producers \nfrom Natchitoches, LA, if he could describe the situation. He said, \n``Ms. Landrieu, there ain't nobody alive that has ever seen anything \nlike this for a hundred years.'' We are experiencing in Louisiana a \n100-year drought, and for us with usually an ample supply of water it \nis hard for me even to be able to speak here about the situation that \nthe farmers are experiencing. It is very unusual.\n  Over the past 3 and a half months, our State has received virtually \nno measurable rainfall in the crop-growing regions of the State. As of \nthis week, the average rainfall totaled 13 inches below our State \naverage.\n  In addition to facing one of the worst droughts in our history, the \nState is experiencing very high temperatures, over 100 degrees. The \ncombination has resulted in extensive damage to our corn crop.\n  Our soybean farmers, in addition, tell me that about a third of their \ncrop will be in jeopardy.\n  Our dairy farmers continue to face not only the weather conditions--\nthe lack of water and the high temperatures--but depressed prices are \nalso driving many of them out of business. Milk production has \ndecreased more than 50 percent, in addition, due to damaged \npastureland.\n  Our cotton and rice farmers are also expecting to suffer from the \ndrought. In addition, the Asian financial crisis, which has not yet \ncompletely hit, threatens to further complicate the situation.\n  Our forest production report is equally disturbing. We planted 100 \nmillion seedlings this last year and to date have lost over 50 million, \nand 15,000 acres of forest in Louisiana have burned, resulting in fire \nnot to be compared to what is happening in Florida, but still a \nsignificant amount of acres has been lost.\n  In parish after parish, I am hearing nothing but grim news about the \nimpact of the drought on depressed prices in some areas, and the \nextreme heat. I am told that even with crop insurance under the current \nCrop Insurance Program, many of our farmers will not be able to recoup \nany measurable portion of their input costs. Other farmers who are not \neligible for crop insurance have no similar assistance at all to avail \nthemselves of.\n  So I am pleased to be here today on the floor to join our leader, \nSenator Daschle, in his plea--his urgent plea--for this Congress to \ncome together and to give appropriate assurance and appropriate \nmeasures to our farmers at this time. It is not enough, Mr. President, \nI don't think, to pass a sense of the Senate. What is appropriate is to \ngive meaning to that resolution that we passed yesterday. We should \nhave specific, concrete relief and a safety net for our farmers to get \nthem through a difficult time and to realize that perhaps the laws that \nwe have outlined are not perfect and could be improved with some \nchanges that our leader has put forward.\n  So I am happy to join him today, and Senator Harkin, to continue to \nfight and to support our farmers not only in Louisiana but around the \nNation.\n  Thank you, and I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrat leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nher excellent statement and appreciate very much her reflecting on the \nseriousness of the situation in Louisiana as well.\n  As I noted, Mr. President, I will use my leader time to finish the \ndiscussion of this amendment.\n  I think this poster probably says it as well as anything. The only \nthing I would call to everyone's attention is that when it says ``rural \nS.D.,'' it could say ``rural Louisiana,'' it could say ``rural \nIllinois,'' or it could say ``rural'' any State in the country. ``Ag \nslump threatens rural''--blank. For me, it is ``rural S.D.''.\n  The problems that we are having here that are outlined in these \narticles say it very well. Prices have dropped dramatically. Prices \nhave dropped in corn, in wheat, sorghum, barley, soybeans--you name the \ncommodity. Prices have plummeted. It is not just the grain, it is the \nlivestock as well.\n  There is a statement here in the first part of the article by David \nKranz, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these articles, one by \nDavid Kranz of the Argus Leader, and the other by Kevin Woster of the \nArgus Leader, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Argus Leader, July 15, 1998]\n\n   Ag Slump Threatens Rural S.D.--Small Towns Vulnerable to Downturn\n\n                            (By David Kranz)\n\n       As politicians scramble to prop up a flagging farm economy, \n     South Dakota's small-town main streets are bracing for the \n     financial ripples.\n       Cheap grain coupled with depressed livestock prices have \n     farmers in an unusually tight economic clutch this summer. \n     And some small businesses are already seeing the effects.\n       ``We are seeing a major impact. It's all because of $2 corn \n     and under--$5 beans and\n\n[[Page S8181]]\n\n     going lower. And you have $30 hogs and $50 cattle. I don't \n     know if you could call it a depression, but it is awfully \n     close to it,'' said Tom Reecy, owner of Reecy Farm Supply Co. \n     in Dell Rapids.\n       Contributing to farmers' problems are weakened demands for \n     agricultural imports and some prolonged periods of weather \n     disasters and crop diseases. Some agriculture economists are \n     predicting financial fallout as harsh as during the farm \n     crisis of the mid-1980s.\n       Some small businesses, already struggling to survive \n     economically, may lose the battle.\n       ``Those (towns) that are detached from urban centers may \n     have some problems. When a community becomes totally \n     dependent on one industry, any blip on the graph will hit \n     them more than your commuter towns,'' said James Satterlee, \n     head of the Department of Rural Sociology at South Dakota \n     State University.\n       Satterlee said many small towns have been reluctant to \n     accept change and diversify their economies over the years.\n       Census reports show about 200 South Dakota communities are \n     steadily losing population, and some of those will be \n     vulnerable to another downturn in agriculture.\n       ``If those towns have been diversifying, it won't be as \n     severe. There will be less chance of impact because of \n     something that happens with one particular product,'' \n     Satterlee said.\n       Freeman is one South Dakota community largely dependent on \n     the ag economy. The town is also watching its population \n     continue to shrink.\n       Rita Becker closed her clothing store in Freeman in March \n     because the store was no longer profitable. She now works on \n     the farm with her husband, Rudy.\n       ``When we talk with people in the business, ag prices are a \n     part of it, but another part is that people just go elsewhere \n     to shop. We are 50 miles away from Sioux Falls, but nowadays, \n     50 miles isn't a long ways to drive.''\n       The current agricultural situation has Becker and her \n     husband questioning the advantages of farming.\n       ``We are in our mid-40s. We raise about 500 acres of beans \n     and corn. Hearing my husband speak with his friends, they are \n     discouraged. People have just had it. They have farmed all \n     their lives and there is just no money in it,'' she said.\n\n\n                         hardware store hurting\n\n       Down the street from where Becker once did business. Don \n     Wipf is watching a decline in agriculture-based spending at \n     the Coast-to-Coast hardware business his family has owned for \n     59 years.\n       ``We have seen it coming for a couple of years. The farmers \n     aren't spending money like they normally do. Sales are down. \n     I think they are buying more nonnecessities,'' he said, \n     ``They notice it over at the grocery store, too. They are \n     buying more of the cheaper cuts of meat these days.''\n       Wipf says Freeman business people are worried about the \n     future.\n       ``Everybody is trying to come up with ways to keep the \n     businesses we have. It is just generally tough for small \n     towns. I wish we could come up with an answer. I'd be rich.''\n\n\n                        census numbers down, too\n\n       Things aren't much brighter in Redfield. This community, \n     located between Aberdeen and Huron, is also losing \n     population. The 1996 census update showed another 3.3 percent \n     drop in population from the year before.\n       Rod Siegling owns the family's grocery store, Siegling \n     Super Value, which has been operating in Redfield for 40 \n     years.\n\n\n                          Tougher in bad times\n\n       He has seen the ups and downs that come with agricultural \n     prosperity and decline, but says it is getting tougher to \n     absorb the bad times.\n       ``It hasn't had much of an effect yet, but it will come \n     gradually. They will watch how they spend their dollar,'' he \n     said.\n       Ironically, a drive through the countryside this summer can \n     be deceiving, he said.\n       ``The crops look good, but it isn't worth anything if you \n     can't get a good price,'' he said.\n       Feed is Reecy's business and he has ridden the agriculture \n     price roller coaster since 1973.\n       ``It (the farm economy) has affected our total feed \n     business very dramatically. Our major customer with 20 to 50 \n     sows . . . They are just getting out,'' he said ``That style \n     of person is farming their farm land, looking to cash it out \n     and look for another job.''\n       The low prices don't reduce farmers' financial obligations, \n     though, Reecy said.\n       ``At the same time they all know their taxable valuation is \n     going up. School cost is going to go higher. Those things \n     have them very concerned.''\n       Tim Clarke hears the talk from farmers about the pending \n     economic predicament. He opened a farm equipment business \n     last April in Howard.\n       ``I am starting from scratch. I have nothing to compare \n     with, but I sell smaller ticket items like live-stock-\n     handling equipment and business has been good,'' Clark said.\n\n\n                        Trying to stay positive\n\n       Although he prefers to stay positive, he's also realistic.\n       ``I try to ignore it (talk of the bad farm economy), \n     Agriculture has always been cyclical. But if it (the \n     downturn) is not brief, there will be nothing but tail lights \n     in this part of the country.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Argus Leader, July 15, 1998]\n\n                   Democrats Turn up Heat on Farm Act\n\n                           (By Kevin Woster)\n\n       South Dakota's two U.S. senators joined other Democrats on \n     Tuesday in an increasingly pointed attack on Republican-\n     inspired farm policy that critics claim has failed.\n       In an assault that Democrats hope can produce more \n     congressional seats as well as better market prices. Sen. Tom \n     Daschle said almost every major commodity has dropped in \n     price since Congress in 1996 passed the Freedom to Farm Act.\n       That act is phasing out decades-old farm subsidies and \n     production controls in favor of free-market, free-planting \n     policies. It allows farmers to take better advantage of \n     market highs but also leaves them more at risk during lows.\n       ``We've seen some of the lowest prices in decades for \n     months now,'' Daschle said during a teleconference with \n     reporters across the nation. ``We'll see a serious decline in \n     farm prices for the foreseeable future unless something is \n     done.''\n       That something is included in a five-point relief plan \n     presented Tuesday by Daschle. Sen. Tim Johnson and Democratic \n     senators from Iowa, Minnesota and North Dakota.\n       The Democrats intend to offer the rural relief package as \n     amendments to an agricultural appropriations bill. The Senate \n     could vote on some parts of that proposal today.\n       On Tuesday night, the Senate approved an amendment by \n     Daschle acknowledging that there is a crisis in farm prices \n     and that it must be addressed. Daschle and other senators are \n     scheduled to meet with President Clinton tonight to discuss \n     the situation.\n       The center of the Democrats' package is a proposal to \n     increase the rate and extend the repayment period for \n     government marketing loans. Farmers can use the loans, based \n     on a set price per bushel, to acquire operating cash. When \n     prices rise, they can sell their grain for a batter price, \n     repay the loans and have money left.\n       Other provisions would require large meatpackers to reveal \n     more information about prices they pay for livestock, require \n     labeling of imported beef and lamb, boost foreign-trade \n     programs and create a $500 million fund for targeted disaster \n     assistance.\n       Providing a higher loan rate and a longer repayment \n     period--from the current nine months to 15 months--would give \n     farmers more cash immediately and allow them more time to \n     find better markets, Democrats said.\n       Critics complain about the cost, which Daschle said would \n     be $1.6 billion a year. They also worry that the longer \n     marketing period could allow grain stocks to build and \n     actually depress prices.\n       ``The buyers know that product is there. And it has to come \n     to market sometime. It can't stay in the bins forever,'' said \n     Kimball farmer Richard Ekstrum, past president of the South \n     Dakota Farm Bureau.\n       The Farm Bureau supports the current farm bill, while the \n     South Dakota Farmers Union has pushed for changes, including \n     those advanced by the Democrats.\n       Ekstrum said he supports some portions of the Democrats \n     plan, such as provisions aimed at improving foreign markets. \n     He said market development is the long-term key to better \n     prices.\n       Although raising the marketing loan rate might help boost \n     prices for grain farmers, even that benefit creates negative \n     impacts in the complicated world of agriculture, Ekstrum \n     said.\n       ``That loan rate has an impact on grain prices, which \n     livestock producers have to purchase. And they already are in \n     a very tight squeeze. If they have to pay more for grain, \n     they might cut production,'' he said. ``There's just no \n     simple solutions.''\n       Ekstrum said the depressed market prices re painful for \n     farmers, but the entire outlook isn't bleak. Many farmers in \n     South Dakota have promising fields of corn and soybeans, he \n     said.\n       ``It's not in the bin yet. But right now we have the \n     potential for yields much, much above what is average. If you \n     can produce more grain with the same inputs, that's always a \n     positive thing,'' he said.\n       South Dakota's Republican congressman, Rep. John Thune, \n     said he probably would support the loan-rate increase. He \n     also might support the loan-repayment extension, although he \n     worries about the potential effect of stockpiling more grain.\n       Either way, the Democratic plan faces a hard collision with \n     Republican leaders intent on maintaining the new free-market, \n     less-government approach to federal farm policy, Thune said.\n       ``When you get outside of the Northern Plains states, they \n     aren't experiencing the type of stress that we are, so it's a \n     harder case to make,'' Thune said. ``I certainly don't think \n     there's any inclination there now to overhaul Freedom to \n     Farm.''\n       Supporters of current farm policy think the long-term \n     answer is in new and expanded foreign agricultural markets, \n     which will help boost market prices. The House moved Tuesday \n     evening to help in that area by approving a companion bill to \n     one already approved by the Senate exempting agricultural \n     commodities from trade sanctions imposed against Pakistan and \n     Indian.\n       Thune said work on foreign trade needs to be a national \n     priority. But he said there might be ways to provide farmers \n     and ranchers with needed assistance while maintaining the \n     free-market approach.\n       He hopes to announce related proposals later this week.\n       Democrats said that without immediate action, Congress will \n     fail rural America.\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\n       Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said farmers in his state are \n     experiencing a 98 percent drop in farm income in one year \n     because of lower market prices, crop diseases and weather \n     problems. Such severe financial pain deserves federal \n     assistance, he said.\n       ``It isn't a wind or tornado. It's not a flood. It's not a \n     fire. It's not an earthquake. But it's every bit a \n     disaster,'' Dorgan said.\n       Johnson said the Freedom to Farm concept, which phases out \n     farm subsidies by 2002, amounted to giving farmers ``five \n     years of declining payments, then a pat on the back and good \n     luck.''\n       Johnson continues to push for meat labeling laws that would \n     allow consumers to choose between U.S. and imported meats. He \n     said that would help lift prices for U.S. livestock \n     producers.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will quote from the article:\n\n       ``We are seeing a major impact. It's all because of $2 corn \n     and under $5 beans and going lower. And you have $30 hogs and \n     $50 cattle. I don't know if you could call it a depression, \n     but it is awfully close to it,'' said Tom Reecy, owner of \n     Reecy Farm Supply Co. in Dell Rapids.\n       Contributing to farmers' problems are weakened demand for \n     agricultural imports and some prolonged periods of weather \n     disasters and crop diseases. Some agricultural economists are \n     predicting financial fallout as harsh as during the farm \n     crisis of the mid-1980s.\n\n  This isn't a Democratic Senator saying this. This isn't even a farmer \nsaying this. What they are saying is that, because of these falling \ncrop prices, you have got the owner of a very important business in \nDell Rapids, SD, saying, ``It's over.'' Its over unless we change what \nis happening out here today.\n  The article by Kevin Woster makes it very clear that the problem goes \nbeyond--it is not on this chart--but it goes beyond Dell Rapids, SD. He \ntalks about Redfield, a very important community in the northeastern \npart of our State. The 1996 census update showed a 3.3 percent drop in \npopulation in just that year. Rod Siegling owns the family grocery \nstore, Siegling Super Value, which has been operating in Redfield for \n40 years.\n  Mr. Siegling talks about the extraordinary reduction in the business \nin his store, in the article that I have already inserted in the \nRecord. Why? Because prices are so low people can't afford to buy their \ngroceries.\n  Mr. President, I have one other matter I would like to insert in the \nRecord, and that is a letter sent to the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee by the Tripp County Board of Commissioners: Louis \nPolasky, Ray Petersek, Harold Whiting, Neil Farnsworth, and Marion G. \nBest.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the ________________ was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Tripp County\n\n\n                                       Board of Commissioners,\n\n                                         Winner, SD, July 7, 1998.\n     Senator Richard Lugar,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Agricultural Committee, Senate Hart \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: The Tripp County Commissioners are \n     writing this letter to inform you as to the economic disaster \n     involving the farmers and ranchers in Tripp County, South \n     Dakota.\n       The county consists of approximately 700 farm and ranch \n     families in a populas of 6,900. During the last decade, the \n     devastating effect of low commodity and cattle prices have \n     affected every household in the county. Commodity prices at \n     the 1950 levels have continued the exodus of our youth to \n     cities for jobs while the age of our farmers and ranchers \n     average in the 60's.\n       Ever since the NAFTA and GATT agreements were entered into, \n     the farm and ranch economy has plummeted. While trying to \n     become more efficient, they cannot compete with the \n     inflationary rate that the rest of the economy or businesses \n     have placed on their products while receiving historical low \n     prices!\n       While the large four packers have capitalized on the \n     livestock market, the stock market moves up or down only to \n     the pleasure of the traders' profit at the expense of the \n     farmers and ranchers. Where else can a market move lower \n     because it rains in Indiana or higher because Texas is dry!\n       It has, for these reasons and many others, become very \n     important for the need of assistance to restore a safety net \n     to grain and livestock producers! All our producers need are \n     fair prices for both grain and livestock and the rural \n     economy will heal itself! This crisis has escalated to the \n     point where immediate help is needed. The rural outcry has \n     become a deafening cry for help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Tripp County Commissioners:\n     Louis Polasky,\n       Chairman.\n     Ray Petersek.\n     Harold Whiting.\n     Neil Farnsworth.\n     Marion G. Best.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will simply read one paragraph:\n\n       During the last decade, the devastating effect of low \n     commodity and cattle prices has affected every household in \n     the county. Commodity prices at the 1950 levels have \n     contributed to the continuing exodus of our youth to cities \n     for jobs while the age of our farmers and ranchers average in \n     the 60s.\n\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted 99 to nothing simply to say, with \nbipartisan emphasis, we hear you. We understand. We know that when \nprices are this low, you are going to see the consequences as reported \nin these stories and this letter.\n  Today, we now offer our solutions. This amendment, the one upon which \nwe will be voting briefly, lifts the cap on marketing loans and extends \nthe loan term as one of the most consequential ways with which to \nrespond immediately to the problem of low prices.\n  Why? Because we are giving farmers some flexibility to say, look, if \nthe prices continue this way, I am going to take out a loan for at \nleast 15 months to see if all of the other things they are doing out in \nWashington and throughout our agricultural economy will give me a \nbetter price later on.\n  That is what we are suggesting. Let's give our farmers the \nopportunity to obtain a better option in the short term. We are talking \nabout farmers' ability to survive the 1 year that this amendment takes \nplace. That is all it is, 1 year. We are not suggesting this be a \npermanent change to the legislation pending. We are simply saying the \nvery survival of thousands of family farms depends upon whether we give \nthem the tools right now.\n  For those who oppose this amendment, I would simply ask, What \nimmediate action do they propose? What will they do to help farmers \ntoday?\n  We are all for trade. I don't know of a Senator who will come to the \nfloor and say, ``I oppose increasing trade.'' That is like saying I \nwill oppose eating apple pie. We favor trade. We want to see our \nmarkets opened. And I might say parenthetically the fastest way to open \nthem is to pass the funding of the International Monetary Fund so that \nwe can open these markets and stabilize the economy.\n  So let me just describe again this first in a series of steps that we \nare proposing to deal with these prices. The amendment, again, that we \nwill be voting on momentarily would eliminate the caps on marketing \nloans and set the new rate at 85 percent of the average price of the \nprevious 5 years, and here is the key, ``on an emergency basis.'' On an \nemergency basis, it would extend the marketing loan term from 9 months \nto 15 months under the same conditions.\n  I hope everyone will note the distinction between this amendment and \nearlier legislation to break the loan caps. In contrast to other \nmarketing loan proposals, this measure only goes into effect in the \ncase of an economic crisis. It gives the President discretionary \nauthority to control extreme, persistent income loss by lifting the \nmarketing loan caps and extending their terms in this year only.\n  Regardless of how my colleagues may feel about changes in permanent \nlaw, regardless of how they may have voted in the past, I really cannot \nimagine that anybody can say that for 1 year, under these \ncircumstances, I am opposed to bumping up that loan that has to be paid \nback by the farmers, regardless of whatever concerns they might have. \nIn every single case that I am aware of in talking to farmers around \nthe country, they tell us that the single most effective thing we can \ndo, the single most important thing we can do to affect price in the \nshort term is what we are offering right now.\n  You can listen to some of our colleagues complain that this is an old \nsolution. The fact is that this is the best solution, the best short-\nterm emergency solution that we are aware can be proposed. It is \nsupported by the National Wheat Growers, by the Barley Growers, by the \nAmerican and National Corn Growers, and by a growing list of farmer \norganizations and farmers across this country who say, yes, with an \nexclamation point, pass this.\n  Combining the two provisions--the extension of the time and the \nmoderate increase in the availability of the loan value--provides our \nfarmers with increased market flexibility and a far better shot at \nsurviving over the next\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\n12 months. Adopting this proposal would result in loan rate increases, \nand we think price increases, for every single grain commodity. Wheat \nloan rates would increase 64 cents a bushel; corn loan rates would \nincrease 36 cents a bushel; soybean rates would increase.\n  The flexibility contained in the new farm bill is great. Farmers get \ntheir signals from the market but not the Government. But they cannot \nbe left without the marketing tools necessary to capitalize on the new \nfree market. This is an opportunity to send a clear message to farmers \nin every State, every State where we can add ``rural'' in front. We \nunderstand the ag slump threatens rural States, rural South Dakota, \nrural North Dakota, rural Maine, rural California, rural Louisiana, and \nwe are going to do something about it. We are going to offer this as \nour best opportunity to deal immediately with price, knowing how \nconsequential this could be for every single farmer who is watching and \nlistening and hoping that we understand. We can use all the rhetoric we \nwant. The only way we are going to get this job done is to match our \nactions to our rhetoric. The rhetoric came yesterday. The actions now \nmust come today, and they must start by increasing this loan rate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we have had a full and complete \ndebate on the Senator's amendment. We have heard from Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. I am prepared to yield back any time that remains \nto this side on the amendment of the Senator from South Dakota, but \nbefore doing that I am happy to announce to the Senate that we have \nreached an agreement on both sides with respect to the amendments that \nwill be in order to this bill and, following the disposition of the \nDaschle amendment, we will proceed to consider other amendments.\n  With the authority of the majority leader and with the permission and \nconsent of the minority leader, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nconsideration of the agriculture appropriations bill, the following be \nthe only first-degree amendments in order, subject to relevant second-\ndegree amendments, and following the disposition of the amendments, the \nbill be advanced to third reading and the Senate proceed immediately to \nCalendar No. 430, the House companion bill.\n  I further ask that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the \ntext of the Senate bill as amended be inserted, the bill be advanced to \nthird reading and passage occur, all without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  Finally, I ask that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and the \nSenate bill be placed back on the calendar.\n  I submit the list of amendments to be offered on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the list be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                Amendments to Agriculture Appropriations\n\n       Craig--Bio-diesel.\n       Grassley--S.O.S. on farmers relief.\n       Grassley--S. 1269--Fast track.\n       Lugar--Sanctions.\n       McConnell--2nd degree place holder.\n       Hatch--Interstate distribution of meat.\n       DeWine--S.O.S. on asthma inhalers.\n       Kempthorne--Funding for secondary agriculture education \n     programs.\n       Brownback--Limit length of agriculture census.\n       Coverdell--Ag. credit.\n       Coverdell--E coli.\n       Roberts--Nuclear nonproliferation.\n       Roberts--Nuclear nonproliferation.\n       Cochran--Managers amendment.\n       Cochran--Managers amendment.\n       Stevens--Relevant.\n       Santorum--Farmland preservation funding.\n       Brownback--Nine month waiver permanent sanctions--Pakistan/\n     India.\n       Baucus--Research.\n       Baucus--Commodity loans.\n       Baucus--Research.\n       Baucus--Relevant.\n       Bryan--Market access program.\n       Bryan--Market access program.\n       Byrd--Relevant.\n       Byrd--Relevant.\n       Bumpers--Relevant.\n       Bumpers--Relevant.\n       Bumpers--Relevant.\n       Conrad--Emergency indemnity payments.\n       Conrad--Relevant.\n       Conrad--Relevant.\n       Daschle--Market loan rate (pending).\n       Daschle--CRP hay.\n       Daschle--Fund for Rural America.\n       Daschle--Price reporting.\n       Daschle--Conservation reserve.\n       Dodd--Waive sanctions food and medicine.\n       Dodd--FDA recall drugs and medical devices.\n       Dodd--Authorize experiment station research $.\n       Dorgan--Scab research.\n       Dorgan--Cost of production.\n       Dorgan--Sanctions.\n       Dorgan--Food for peace.\n       Dorgan--Fruits and veggies.\n       Durbin--Clinical pharmacology.\n       Durbin--National corn-to-ethanol.\n       Durbin--Meals on wheels.\n       Feingold--Small farms.\n       Feingold--Relevant.\n       Graham--Fires.\n       Graham--Country origin produce labeling.\n       Graham--$ Med fly.\n       Harkin--Relevant.\n       Harkin--WIC related.\n       Harkin--Food safety.\n       Harkin--Relevant.\n       Harkin--Relevant.\n       Harkin--Relevant.\n       Harkin--Bio containment.\n       Johnson--Meat labeling.\n       Kerrey--Mandatory price reporting pilot.\n       Kerrey--Economic research service study.\n       Leahy--Relevant.\n       Leahy--Relevant.\n       Levin--Fire blight.\n       Levin--Disability discrimination.\n       Mikulski--Relevant.\n       Mikulski--Relevant.\n       Robb--Remedy discrimination by USDA.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Kansas, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\nBrownback, and other Senators, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. \n     Brownback, for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Gorton \n     and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment numbered 3155.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n                 TITLE ____--INDIA-PAKISTAN RELIEF ACT\n\n     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``India-Pakistan Relief Act of \n     1998''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. WAIVER AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Authority.--The President may waive for a period not to \n     exceed one year upon enactment of this Act with respect to \n     India or Pakistan the application of any sanction or \n     prohibition (or portion thereof) contained in section 101 or \n     102 of the Arms Export Control Act, section 620E(e) of the \n     Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, or section 2(b)(4) of the \n     Export Import Bank Act of 1945.\n       (b) Exception.--The authority provided in subsection (a) \n     shall not apply to any restriction in section 102(b)(2) (B), \n     (C), or (G) of the Arms Export Control Act.\n       (c) Amounts made available by this section are designated \n     by the Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to \n     section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended: Provided, That such \n     amounts shall be available only to the extent that an \n     official budget request that includes designation of the \n     entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement as \n     defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985, as amended, is transmitted by the President to \n     the Congress.\n\n     SEC. ____03. CONSULTATION.\n\n       Prior to each exercise of the authority provided in section \n     ____02, the President shall consult with the appropriate \n     congressional committees.\n\n     SEC. ____04. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Not later than 30 days prior to the expiration of a one-\n     year period described in section ____02, the Secretary of \n     State shall submit a report to the appropriate congressional \n     committees on economic and national security developments in \n     India and Pakistan.\n\n     SEC. ____05. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.\n\n       In this title, the term ``appropriate congressional \n     committees'' means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on International Relations of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committees on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the India-\nPakistan Relief Act, which I am cosponsoring with my colleague from \nKansas.\n  Even as we have implemented a strict regime of sanctions on India and \nPakistan as called for by law, it is my belief that we must also look \nto the future and to creating the sort of environment which will allow \nthe United States to engage India and Pakistan in a positive \nrelationship and to restore stability to South Asia.\n  To that end, this Amendment does something very simple, and something \nmuch needed. It is also something which I believe the great majority of \nthis body supports.\n  The Amendment provides the President with the discretion to waive the \napplication of any sanction or prohibition, for a period of 1 year. It \ncontains an exception for those sanctions dealing with dual-use exports \nor military sales, which will remain off-limits.\n  Before the waiver authority is exercised, the President is required \nto consult with Congress.\n  And, prior to the expiration of the waiver authority granted in this \nAmendment, the Secretary of State must report to Congress on \ndevelopments in India and Pakistan.\n  This last point is crucial. The waiver authority granted in this \nAmendment is limited to 1 year. Should India and Pakistan prove to be \nunwilling to resolve their differences--should the Secretary be unable \nto report on substantial and significant progress--this Amendment will \nsunset, and the current sanctions will go back into effect.\n  It is my belief that the President be given flexibility to use and \nshape sanctions as most appropriate to attempt to create a positive and \nconstructive environment for the resolution of political and security \nproblems in South Asia. Our current sanctions policy does not provide \nfor that flexibility.\n  In fact, without this flexibility it is difficult to conceive how the \nUnited States can play a positive and constructive role in attempting \nto head off a potential nuclear arms race in South Asia or to restore \nstability to the region.\n  Indeed, the Administration currently has a high-level delegation, \nheaded by Deputy Secretary Talbott, en route to the region to continue \ntalks with India and Pakistan and to continue discussions on bringing \nthe current crisis to a close.\n  Hopefully, this Amendment will send a positive signal to India and \nPakistan that the United States is interested in working with them to \nresolve their problems, and will provide our negotiators with the \nleverage that they need if they are to have success in moving the \nprocess in a positive direction.\n  This Amendment structures U.S. policy to secure commitments from \nIndia and Pakistan to make real and meaningful progress in rolling back \nthe current crisis, to settle their differences, and to bring peace to \nSouth Asia.\n  Although we do not spell out explicit conditions that India and \nPakistan must meet in this Amendment, it is my hope and belief that the \nflexibility that this Amendment introduces will allow the \nAdministration to work with India and Pakistan to take necessary \nactions to resolve their political and security differences, including \nceasing any further nuclear tests; engaging in a high-level dialogue, \nputting confidence and security building measures in place; and, take \nsteps to roll-back their nuclear programs and come into compliance with \ninternationally accepted norms on the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Indeed, my support of this Amendment lies, in part, in my belief that \nthis is that path that India and Pakistan themselves have indicated \nthat they would like to pursue.\n  Both India and Pakistan have made statements indicating that they \nwill refrain from future testing. Both have indicated that they are \nprepared to consider joining the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And, in \na message to the Security Council on July 9, Secretary General Annan \nwrote that ``I have been encouraged by indications from both sides of \ntheir readiness to enter into dialogue addressing peace and security \nmatters and causes of tension, including Kashmir.''\n  In South Asia today it appears to be too late to talk about \npreventing the capability of developing nuclear weapons. As I stated on \nthis floor immediately following the first Indian nuclear test, the \ninternational community cannot successfully impose nonproliferation \npolicies on South Asia. Ultimately, India and Pakistan must determine \nfor themselves that their own interests are best served by ridding \nSouth Asia of weapons of mass destruction--and not by turning the \nregion into a potential nuclear battleground.\n  The United States, however, must seek ways to work with India and \nPakistan to help them reach that determination. It is my belief that \nthis Amendment serves to structure our policies to make that outcome \nmore likely. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nAmendment.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as has been made clear, this amendment is a \nversion of a bill offered last week by Senators McConnell, Biden, and \nothers. At that time, Senators felt pressure to lift sanctions on India \nand Pakistan, thereby precluding U.S. companies from participating in a \nsignificant wheat tender.\n  I understood the urgency, and I therefore supported my colleagues. On \nthe question of sanctions in general, and sanctions on India and \nPakistan in particular, however, several points need to be emphasized.\n  The sanctions tasks force appointed by the majority and minority \nleaders, as of last week's sanctions relief bill, had met twice at a \nstaff level. No one saw the proposed bill language, which, as \noriginally written, would have lifted not only economic, but also \nmilitary and dual use sanctions on India and Pakistan for a period of \nnine months.\n  Mr. President, I believe the majority leader was serious in his \ndesire to constitute a group of Senators who, after due deliberation, \nwould make recommendations on sanctions. That did not happen. Instead, \nwe have rushed\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nforward, willy nilly, with bills and amendments that the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee has not considered. Indeed, last week we were \npresented with language that even the members of the sanctions task \nforce had not considered.\n  It is my firm belief that at any given time we have one Commander in \nChief and one Secretary of State. I support the President's right to \nmake decisions on foreign policy, even when I disagree with those \ndecisions. I also agree that it is important that the President have \nsome flexibility in making those decisions.\n  That is why I am willing to support a limited waiver on economic \nsanctions--economic sanctions only--for nine months for India and \nPakistan--which I do with some reservations. I shall expand on this \nfurther at another time. Suffice it to say that I do not believe \nforeign aid, foreign loan guarantees or international bail outs are an \n``entitlement'' to any nation.\n  Equally importantly, Mr. President, no nation deserves military \nhardware, services or dual use items capable of supporting military \nprograms if and when that nation engages in conduct dangerous to the \nnational security of the United States. I shall never support U.S. \nsupercomputers going to help the Indian nuclear program or U.S. space \ntechnology supporting a South Asian missile program. The line must be \ndrawn somewhere.\n  The bill presented to me last Thursday at 9:30 a.m., one hour prior \nto its consideration by the full Senate, would have allowed anything--\nmunitions list items, aircraft, weapons, advanced weapons technology--\nto go to India or Pakistan. I refuse to believe that even those most \nardent to appease big business could countenance a U.S. military \nrelationship with a nation that just detonated a nuclear weapon.\n  Mr. President, sanctions have their downsides, and I am ready to \naddress those downsides. What I am not willing to do is to permit \nCongress to rush headlong into approving legislation which would open \nthe floodgates to the rogues of this world.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment deals with the sanctions \nagainst India and Pakistan. The amendment has been cleared on this side \nof the aisle. I understand that it has also been cleared on the other \nside. But I yield to my friend from Arkansas for any comments.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on this \nside of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry, I am not aware of the amendment the Senator from \nMississippi is talking about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am told there are a couple questions on \nour side of the aisle. I regret that I announced earlier there was no \nobjection on this side. Apparently, there are at least a couple \nquestions. So if we could leave that amendment, set it aside in order \nto let Senator Lugar go, then we will try to clear it between now and \nthe end of that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot want to object and will not, maybe the thing to do is put in a \nquorum for a second or two and see exactly what the questions are. \nMaybe they can be answered. If not, then I agree with you, we will set \nit aside and go to another amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we are ready now to proceed to a \nvote on the Brownback amendment\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the vote.\n  The amendment (No. 3155) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3156\n\n (Purpose: To provide a framework for consideration by the legislative \n  and executive branches of unilateral economic sanctions in order to \n  ensure coordination of United States policy with respect to trade, \n                      security, and human rights.)\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3156.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to propose an amendment that seeks \nto improve the way Congress and the executive branch consider and \nimpose unilateral economic sanctions on other countries and entities. \nThere has been a dramatic rise in the number and variety of U.S. \neconomic sanctions directed against other countries to achieve one or \nmore foreign policy goals. More often than not they have not been \nsuccessful. Despite this record, we continue to impose one new \nunilateral sanction after another. We typically do so without careful \nanalysis of their effects on our interests and our values.\n  Because of this, I believe it is time we engage in a serious debate \non the merits of using unilateral economic sanctions to accomplish \nforeign policy goals. That is the purpose of this amendment. My \namendment is a modification of Senate bill S. 1413, the ``Enhancement \nof Trade, Security, and Human Rights Through Sanctions Reform Act'', or \nsimply the Sanctions Policy Reform Act, which we introduced last \nNovember. The companion bill was introduced in the House at the same \ntime. There are now 36 Senate cosponsors from both sides of the aisle.\n  Let me take a moment to note some of the important changes from \nSenate bill 1413 that are now in my proposed amendment. These changes \nwere included to reflect discussions with the administration, with \nlegal counsel of the Senate, with our colleagues in the House, and with \nothers. First, we clarify in the amendment that our general sanctions \nguidelines, procedural requirements, analytical reports and sunset \nprovisions pertain only to future sanctions. I underline that point. \nThis amendment deals only with the future. It is not an amendment about \nsanctions past or sanctions present. We are talking about sanctions in \nthe future and only unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States \nalone.\n  Our bill is totally prospective. We have eased some of the public \nnotification requirements about the proposed new sanctions. We do not \nwant the President to inadvertently alert a country targeted for \nsanctions to take steps to avoid our sanctions before they are imposed. \nIf a country knows in advance that we intend to impose an asset freeze, \nfor example, it would initiate moves to conceal, shift, or otherwise \navoid our sanctions, thereby undermining their effectiveness.\n  We have strengthened the language in the bill against the use of \nfood, medicine, and medical equipment as a tool of American foreign \npolicy. As a guideline, we believe food should never be used this way \nexcept in cases of war or a threat to the security of the United \nStates. We have also included language in the bill that permits a \nslowing down of the process in the Congress to help guarantee that \ninformation about proposed new sanctions is available to the Members \nprior to their voting on the floor.\n  There are other minor changes in reporting requirements and \nprocedures.\n  The fundamental purpose of my amendment is to promote good governance \nthrough thoughtful deliberation on those proposals involving unilateral \neconomic sanctions directed against other countries. My amendment lays \nout a set of guidelines and requirements for a careful and deliberative \nprocess in both branches of Government when considering new unilateral\n\n[[Page S8186]]\n\nsanctions. It does not preclude the use of economic sanctions, nor does \nit change those sanctions already in force. It is based on the basic \nprinciple that if we improve the quality of our policy process and our \npublic discourse, we can improve the quality of the policy itself.\n  This principle is familiar to us all. James Madison wrote eloquently \nin the Federalist Papers on the merits of slowing down the legislative \nprocess on important matters in order to achieve more careful, \nthoughtful deliberation and avoid the passions of the moment. This \namendment is consistent with Madison's view. When we introduced Senate \nbill 1413 last fall, we did so because we believed that unilateral \neconomic sanctions, when used as a tool of foreign policy, rarely \nachieved their goal, and frequently harmed the United States more than \nthe target country against whom they were aimed.\n  The imposition of unilateral sanctions may help create a sense of \nurgency to help resolve a problem, but it often creates new problems, \nmany of which may be unintended. In some cases, unilateral sanctions \nmay be counterproductive to our interests.\n  Over the past several years, there has been a growing interest in the \npractice of unilateral economic sanctions as a tool of American foreign \npolicy. Numerous studies have been conducted by think tanks, trade \ngroups, the business communities, the U.S. Government, and foreign \ngovernments. These studies reached similar conclusions that unilateral \neconomic sanctions that are utilized to achieve foreign policy \nobjectives rarely succeed in doing so.\n  They further conclude that unilateral economic sanctions seldom help \nthose we seek to assist, that they often penalize the United States \nmore than the target country, and that they may weaken our \ninternational competitiveness and our economic security. The studies \nalso show that unilateral economic sanctions have increasingly become a \nforeign policy of first choice, even when other policy alternatives \nexist.\n  Because of these studies, data on the use of sanctions are becoming \nfamiliar. According to Under Secretary of State, Eisenstat in testimony \nbefore the House International Relations Committee, the United States \nhas applied sanctions 115 times since World War I and 104 times since \nthe end of World War II. Nearly one third of the sanctions applied over \nthe last 80 years have been imposed in just the past 4 years.\n  There are now dozens of new proposals before the Congress that would \ntighten or impose sanctions on one or more countries, many of whom are \nour friends or our allies. There are other sanctions pending at the \nState and local level directed at nearly 20 countries.\n  The 1997 Report of the President's Export Council on U.S. Unilateral \nEconomic Sanctions, for example, cited 75 countries representing more \nthan half the world's population, that have been subject to or \nthreatened by U.S. unilateral sanctions. The application of new \nsanctions in the past 2 years have increased this global percentage to \nnearly 70 percent of the world's population affected or threatened by \none or more U.S. sanctions.\n  These sanctions are not cost-free. They are easy to impose because \nthey appear to be cost-free and are almost always preferable to the use \nof force or to doing nothing, but they have many unintended victims--\nthe poor in the target countries, American companies, American labor, \nAmerican consumers, and, quite frankly, American foreign policy. One \ncost estimate put the income loss to the American economy from economic \nsanctions at between $15 billion and $19 billion, while impacting more \nthan 150,000 jobs in 1995 alone. Magnify this overtime, and the \neconomic and foreign policy costs to the United States become enormous. \nThese sanctions weaken our international competitiveness, lower our \nglobal market share, abandon our established markets to others and \njeopardize billions in export earnings--the key to our economic growth. \nThey may also impair our ability to provide humanitarian assistance. \nThey sometimes anger our friends and call our international leadership \ninto question.\n\n  Someone compared the use of unilateral economic sanctions in foreign \npolicy to the use of carpet bombing in warfare. He noted that both \ntactics are indiscriminate and fail to distinguish between innocent and \nguilty victims. Those who are well-off financially, entrenched \npolitically, or responsible for foreign policy actions we oppose, are \nthose who tend to be least affected by unilateral sanctions. The point \nis that unilateral sanctions are blunt instruments of foreign policy \nthat are too readily employed against foreign targets, even when other \npersuasive instruments of foreign policy may be available.\n  The statute regulating our actions against India's and Pakistan's \nbehavior, for example, is unusually inflexible and limits our options \nto develop solutions that work in South Asia. Our punitive sanctions, \nhowever meritorious they may be, do not help us achieve cooperation \nwith either country in coping with regional and global problems; nor do \nthey promote essential American goals of democracy, human rights, \nreligious freedom, or other values we would like to see in both \ncountries. Indeed, these particular sanctions could inadvertently serve \nto destabilize an already unsteady situation in Pakistan--a nuclear \nPakistan--which would not be in anybody's interest.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not prohibit sanctions. There will \nalways be situations in which the actions of other countries are so \noutrageous or so threatening to the United States that some response by \nthe United States, short of the use of military force, is needed and \njustified. In these instances, sanctions can be helpful in getting the \nattention of another country, in showing U.S. determination to change \nbehaviors we find objectionable, or in stimulating a search for \ncreative solutions to difficult foreign policy problems.\n  Indeed, many unilateral sanctions are intended to achieve very \nlaudable foreign policy goals--human rights improvements, the non-\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, stemming the flow of \ninternational narcotics, countering terrorism, prohibiting child labor, \nand others. These goals are worthy foreign policy objectives. \nUnfortunately, unilateral economic sanctions are not effective tools \nfor advancing these objectives or our interests. They may, in some \ncases, undermine them. In the end, they typically inflict punishment on \nthe American people or on the most vulnerable populations in the \ncountry against whom the sanctions are directed.\n  Mr. President, if we use unilateral economic sanctions to advance our \nforeign policy, we must be more sparing in their use, we must improve \nthe process by which we consider international sanctions, and find ways \nto increase their effectiveness once they are implemented.\n  My amendment proposes to do that by improving the way we consider \nunilateral sanctions in both branches of the government. It is a modest \namendment. It applies to a very limited class of sanctions which are \nunilateral in scope and which are intended to accomplish one or more \nforeign policy objectives.\n  My amendment excludes those trade remedies and other trade sanctions \nimposed because of market access restrictions, unfair trade practices \nand violations of U.S. commercial or trade laws. It excludes those \nmultilateral sanctions regimes in which the U.S. participates, when \nother participating countries are imposing substantially equivalent \nsanctions and taking their burden. Our legislation is prospective and \nwould not change, amend or eliminate existing U.S. sanctions, although \nI believe they should be reviewed as well. The Sanctions Task Force set \nup by the Senate leadership is undertaking that review. Finally, the \namendment does not pertain to state and local sanctions intended to \nachieve foreign policy goals. It deals simply with those of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  To help achieve a more deliberative policy process, the bill \nestablishes procedural guidelines and informational requirements before \nunilateral economic sanctions are considered by the Congress or the \nPresident. My amendment provides that any unilateral economic sanction \nproposed in the Congress or by the President should conform to certain \nguidelines. These should include:\n  clearly defined foreign policy or national security goals;\n  contract sanctity;\n\n[[Page S8187]]\n\n  Presidential authority to adjust or waive the sanctions if he \ndetermines it is in the national interest to do so;\n  narrowly targeted sanction on the offending party or parties;\n  expand export promotion if our sanctions adversely affect a major \nexport market of American farmers;\n  efforts to minimize the negative impact on humanitarian activities in \ntargeted countries; and\n  a sunset provision to terminate new sanctions 2 years after they are \nimposed, unless reauthorized.\n  The amendment includes provisions to fully inform members of the \nproposed sanctions and requires new sanctions be consistent with these \nguidelines. It also mandates that all proposed new unilateral sanctions \ninclude reports from the President which assess the following:\n  the likelihood that the proposed sanctions will achieve the stated \nforeign policy objective;\n  the impact of the sanctions on humanitarian activities in affected \ncountries;\n  the likely effects on our friends and allies and on related national \nsecurity and foreign policy interests;\n  any diplomatic steps already undertaken to achieve the specified \nforeign policy goals;\n  the prospects for multilateral cooperation and comparable efforts, if \nany, by other countries to impose sanctions; against target country;\n  prospects for retaliation against the U.S. and against our \nagriculture interests;\n  an assessment as to whether the benefits of achieving the stated \nforeign policy goals outweigh any likely foreign policy, national \nsecurity or economic costs to the U.S.; and\n  a report on the effects the sanctions are likely to have on the U.S. \nagricultural exports and on the reputation of U.S. farmers as reliable \nsuppliers.\n  I include that section, Mr. President, because agricultural exports \nare usually the first hit in retaliation. This is the area in which our \nNation does best and has, by far, the largest surplus. Therefore, this \nis of special importance to the American agricultural producers that \nare the focus of our attention today in this appropriations bill.\n  A separate section includes similar analytical requirements for any \nnew sanctions the President considers. These include those sanctions \nimposed by executive order under the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (IEEPA). these requirements must be shared with the Congress \nbefore imposing new sanctions. However, the bill allows the President \nto waive most of these requirements if he must act swiftly and if the \nchallenge we confront is an emergency. The requirements on the \nPresident are as rigorous as those on the congress.\n  FInally, my amendment establishes an inter-agency Sanctions Review \nCommittee to include all relevant agencies in the executive branch in \norder to coordinate U.S. policy on sanctions.\n  If unilateral sanctions are approved and implemented, the amendment \nrequires annual reporting on their economic costs and benefits to the \nUnited State and any progress they are having on achieving the stated \nforeign policy goals.\n  There would also be a sunset provision in each new sanction that \nwould terminate new sanctions after two years unless they are re-\nauthorized by the Congress or the President.\n  The agriculture provision merits special comment because it singles \nout American farmers and ranchers whose exports are especially \nvulnerable to retaliation and whose products are most easily \nsubstituted by foreign competitors. American agriculture is heavily \ndependent on exports. About a third of all of our sales from the farms \nof this country are in the export trade. Last year, American \nagriculture contributed a net $22 billion surplus to our balance of \ntrade, more than any other sector. Economic sanctions can have a \nserious long-term adverse impact on American agriculture. My amendment \nprovides authority to compensate for lost exports through agriculture \nexport assistance permitted under current statutes and agreements. No \nnew appropriations would be required.\n\n  To protect American agriculture, my amendment defines humanitarian \nassistance to include all food aid provided by the Department of \nAgriculture for the purchase or provision of food or other agricultural \ncommodities. As such they would be exempt from sanctions other than in \nresponse to national security threats, where multilateral sanctions are \nin place, or if we are engaged in an armed conflict.\n  I have focused many of my remarks on the economic and trade \nconsequences of unilateral sanctions because they are more easily \nmeasured. But, the use of sanctions also raises a fundamental question \nabout the effects of unilateral sanctions on the conduct of American \nforeign policy. Can we further our national interests and promote our \nvalues as a nation through the use of unilateral sanctions which \ndistance ourselves from the challenges we face, or can we better \naccomplish our purposes by staying engaged in the world and keeping our \noptions open to solutions? The answer is not always black and white \nbecause sanctions can sometimes be an appropriate foreign policy tool.\n  On balance, I believe American interests are better advanced through \nengagement and active leadership that afford us an opportunity to \ninfluence events that threaten our interests.\n  In some cases, unilateral sanctions restrict our ability to take \nadvantage of changes in other countries because trade embargoes impose \na heavy bias against dialogue and exchange. Unilateral sanctions may \ncreate tensions with friends and allies--including democratic \ncountries--that jeopardize cooperation in achieving other foreign \npolicy and priorities, including multilateral cooperation on the \nsanctions themselves.\n  U.S. leadership and American values are better promoted through our \npresence abroad, the knowledge we share and impart, and the contacts \nwe make and sustain. Many countries want to be exposed to our values \nand ideas if they are not imposed. The lessons of the free market and \ndemocratic values are learned more easily when they are experienced \nfirst hand, not as abstractions from a distance and not behind \nartificial barriers imposed by unilateral sanctions.\n\n  Let me suggest a number of fundamental principles that I believe \nshould shape our approach to unilateral economic sanctions: Unilateral \neconomic sanctions should not be the policy of first resort. To the \nextent possible, other means of persuasion and influence ought to be \nexhausted first;\n  If harm is to be done or is intended, we must follow the cardinal \nprinciple that we plan to harm our adversary more than we harm \nourselves; when possible, multilateral economic sanctions and \ninternational cooperation are preferable to unilateral sanctions and \nare more likely to succeed, even though they may be more difficult to \nobtain; we should secure the cooperation of the major trading and \ninvesting countries as well as the principal frontline states if \neconomic sanctions are to be successful; and we ought to avoid double \nstandards and be as consistent as possible in the application of our \nsanctions policy.\n  To the extent possible, we ought to avoid disproportionate harm to \nthe civilian population. We should avoid the use of food as a weapon of \nforeign policy and we should permit humanitarian assistance programs to \nfunction; our foreign policy goals ought to be clear, specific and \nachievable within a reasonable period of time; we ought to keep to a \nminimum the adverse affects of our sanctions on our friends and allies; \nwe should keep in mind that unilateral sanctions can cause adverse \nconsequences that may be more problematic than the actions that \nprompted the sanctions--a regime collapse, a humanitarian disaster, a \nmass exodus of people, or more repression and isolation in the target \ncountry, for example; we should explore options for solving problems \nthrough dialogue, public diplomacy, and positive inducements or \nrewards; and the President of the United States should always have \noptions that include both sticks and carrots that can be adjusted \naccording to circumstance and nuance; the Congress should be vigilant \nby insuring that his options are consistent with Congressional intent \nand the law.\n  In those cases where we cannot build multilateral cooperation and \nwhere our core interests or core values are at risk, we must, of \ncourse, consider acting unilaterally. Our actions must be part of an \noverall coherent and coordinated foreign policy that is coupled\n\n[[Page S8188]]\n\nwith diplomacy and consistent with our international obligations and \nobjectives. We should have a reasonable expectation that our unilateral \nactions will not cause more collateral damage to ourselves or to our \nfriends than the problem they are designed to correct.\n\n  Mr. President, the United States should never abandon its leadership \nrole in the world nor forsake the basic values we cherish in the \npursuit of our foreign policy. We must ask, however, whether we are \nalways able to change the actions of other countries whose behavior we \nfind disagreeable or threatening. If we are able to influence those \nactions, we need to ponder how best to proceed. In my judgment, \nunilateral economic sanctions will not always be the best answer. But, \nif they are the answer, they should be structured so that they do as \nlittle harm as possible to ourselves and to our overall global \ninterests. By improving upon our procedures and the quality and \ntimeliness of our information when considering new sanctions, I believe \nwe can make that possible. We should know about the cost and benefits \nof proposed new sanctions before we consider them. That is the intent \nof my amendment.\n  I ask that all Members look closely at my amendment and hope you will \nagree that it is good governance amendment that will help improve the \nquality and conduct of American foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by pointing out that a bipartisan \nsanctions task force has been appointed by the leadership of this body. \nThat task force has met. I look forward to making a contribution to the \nwork of that group.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier in the debate today, I visited \nwith the presidents of the 50 farm bureaus in our country. I visited \nwith them because they are concerned about the farm prices that we have \nbeen talking about, and I am concerned as well. Very clearly, the farm \norganizations of our country have a strong and clear agenda, to which I \nsubscribe. They believe that we must pass fast track authority for the \nPresident, that we need reform of the IMF and replenish those funds, \nand that we must have sanctions reform.\n  The American Farm Bureau has been a strong contributing member to the \nU.S.A. Engage movement, which now includes 675 American companies who \nare involved in exporting. The American Farm Bureau and these American \ncompanies are companies who say, first of all, that sanctions have to \nremain a part of our foreign policy apparatus; that unilateral \nsanctions, those imposed by ourselves, usually fail and usually cause \nmore harm upon us than upon the target countries; that on occasion we \nmay be so outraged that we may be prepared to accept that cost, \nunderstanding that the harm to our jobs and our income will be greater \nthan that which we have fostered. But, Mr. President, the farmers of \nAmerica and their organizations are crying out in this legislation for \nattention.\n  I argued on the last amendment that our best policy in this country \nwas to sell grain, to sell livestock--not to store it. I think that is \nthe issue, Mr. President. But if we are to be credible with regard to \nthe export side, farmers and farm groups are saying, ``You must reform. \nYou must do more.'' And I agree with that.\n  That is why I offered this amendment on the appropriations bill for \nagriculture, because it is a passionate cry by our farmers to take this \nconcrete action to give some hope that their concerns are being \naddressed, that, in fact, we are going to move exports, and are going \nto do so because we are beginning to think more carefully here in this \nbody about what we are doing.\n  To reiterate the bidding, Mr. President, before unilateral sanctions \nalone are imposed, there has to be a purpose stated for why we are \ndoing them. And criteria and benchmarks that would show the degree to \nwhich we have been successful in interim reports, and an assessment of \nthe cost to American jobs and the lost income. I mentioned $20 billion \nof lost income in a year and 150,000 jobs. These are not \ninconsequential. Debates occur on this floor frequently over 100 jobs \nor 1,000 jobs. I am asking that to consider very carefully these cost \nimplications before we adopt another unilateral sanction. And finally, \nI am saying that after 2 years there should be a sunset provision. The \nsanction ends at that point, unless it is authorized again by the \nCongress or by the President for valid foreign policy reasons. These \nsanctions go on forever. This amendment is prospective. It deals with \nthe future. I hope the sanctions task force set up by the leadership \nwill deal with the present and past sanctions.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask for careful consideration by this body of my \namendment. I am hopeful it will be a strong plank in this \nappropriations bill.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise in respectful opposition to some of the \nimplications of the amendment offered by my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar. Now, we all know that \nsanctions have come under assault of late. It is the politically \ncorrect thing to do amidst Senator Lugar's and my friends in the \nbusiness community. And I think neither Senator Lugar nor I has failed \nto stand up for the free enterprise system and the business community \nwhen the community deserved to be supported, which is most of the time.\n  Nevertheless, there are some powerful corporate interests in this \ntown which have launched a well-financed lobbying campaign against \nsanctions, all sanctions, in an obvious attempt to convince Congress \nthat all sorts of unreasonable sanction laws have been presented and \nthat these sanctions are something new and unusual and somehow \ndetrimental to the best interests of this country.\n  On that point I beg to differ. The fact is, as an effective and \nprincipled foreign policy tool economic sanctions are older than this \nRepublic itself. What did the American colonies do in response to \nBritain's imposition of the Stamp Act? The American colonies imposed \neconomic sanctions forcing its repeal as a matter of fact. What did the \nContinental Congress do when Britain imposed the Intolerable Acts? The \nContinental Congress imposed economic sanctions on Britain.\n  Why has Congress always authorized sanctions when needed? This is a \nquestion that is worth reviewing, and that is what I propose to do \nbriefly, if it may be possible. Amazingly, some in the business \ncommunity, and they have always been and will continue to be close \nfriends of mine, have jumped to the conclusion on the recent events in \nIndia and Pakistan to pursue their attacks on the U.S. bilateral \nsanctions. But it is precisely those events in India and Pakistan, the \ndecision by these governments to detonate a dozen separate nuclear \nweapons, that should heighten our resolve to enforce tough sanctions \nagainst governments that seek to destabilize the world.\n  The fact is, in that instance, Madam President, I believe, and I \nbelieve I can demonstrate, that India detonated its devices because of \nIndia's fear that the United States was coddling China and bidding \nfriendship for China that ought not to be a part of the foreign policy \nof this country.\n  Now, just weeks ago the Senate passed the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act by an overwhelming vote of 90 to 4. Why did we do that? \nIn order to place a cost on the specific companies for transferring \ndangerous missile technology to a terrorist regime in Iran which will \nuse that technology to destabilize the entire Persian Gulf region.\n  Now, we authorize the President to sanction states and foreign \ncompanies that threaten the safety of the American people by spreading \nnuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction. We \nauthorize sanctions on states, and when I say the word ``states,'' I \nmean governments, foreign governments, which provide training, weapons \nand political or financial and diplomatic support to terrorists who \nkidnap and murder American citizens. We authorize sanctions on \ngovernments involved in the smuggling and transshipment of illegal \ndrugs that poison our children. We authorize sanctions on governments \nthat commit acts of genocide and armed aggression against their \nneighbors and crimes against humanity.\n  The question must be faced: Are we unreasonable in doing this? Should \nwe\n\n[[Page S8189]]\n\nbe ashamed? I do not think so. Obviously, sanctions are not always the \nanswer. I do not contend that they are, but we cannot escape the fact \nthat sometimes they are the only answer.\n  I think we better face the facts. There are only three basic tools in \nforeign policy. There is diplomacy, sanctions, and war. Without \nsanctions, where would we be? Our options with the dictators and \nproliferators and terrorists of this world would be three: empty talk, \nsending in the Marines, or withdrawing into isolation. And I for one am \nnot willing to place such artificial limits on our foreign policy \noptions.\n  But this is exactly, I fear, what the pending amendment proposes to \ndo. Perhaps the Senator from Indiana can persuade me and the remainder, \nthe rest of the Senate that that is not intended and at least make some \nstatements for the Record that can be viewed in the future.\n  In practice, this amendment is not about sanctions reform as it \nstates. It is an obvious attempt by opponents of sanctions and the \nbusiness community to hamstring Congress' ability to authorize \nsanctions. The proposed amendment would tie Congress' hands with \nmandatory waiting periods for the implementation of all sanctions, \nrequire mandatory sunsets on all future sanctions laws and define a \nwide range of congressional actions known or referred to as \n``sanctions'' when they are nothing of the sort.\n  This amendment, I fear, would impose a mandatory 2-year time limit on \nall U.S. sanctions law. I'm afraid that would be opening a Pandora's \nbox. Imagine if this was the law of the land when the United States \nenacted the Arms Export Control Act which prohibits the sale of \nsophisticated weapons to nations that the State Department determines \nannually support terrorism--governments like Syria, Iran, Iraq, Libya \nand North Korea. Would we have wanted those sanctions to be eliminated \nunder an arbitrary 2-year timetable? I think not.\n  Further, what exactly is meant by the term ``sanctions''? The pending \namendment, it seems to me, breaks new ground on what henceforth would \nbe considered a ``sanction.'' Under this amendment, it seems to me, the \ndenial of U.S. foreign aid would be deemed a sanction. Any \nconditionality on U.S. funding to the World Bank or the IMF would be a \n``sanction'' on a foreign government. And let me remind Senators that \nsince it was created in 1945, American taxpayers have anted up billions \nof dollars for the World Bank and now the antisanctions crowd tells us \nthat we can't place any conditions on the expenditures of those funds.\n  According to a recent report by the USIA, the conditions placed by \nCongress on U.S. foreign aid to the Palestinian Liberation Organization \nare a ``sanction.'' Really? Conditioning U.S. foreign aid to the PLO--\nan organization whose modus operandi for most of its existence has been \nkilling innocent civilians--is now deemed a sanction?\n  What this amendment, I fear, proposes to do is to enshrine U.S. \nforeign aid giveaways as an entitlement, an entitlement to foreign \ncountries.\n  Wait one moment before jumping to conclusions. While this amendment \nexpands the definition of sanctions to absurd proportions, it doesn't \ncover all sanctions. Oh, no. You see, our friends in the business \ncommunity--and they are my friends, and they are Senator Lugar's \nfriends--and their lobbyists who helped write this amendment have \nquietly carved out an exemption for bilateral sanctions they like--\nsanctions that directly benefit them. The same folks who are busy \ntelling us that sanctions don't work and should be scrapped, have \nensured that certain retaliatory trade sanctions are exempt from the \nrestrictions of this legislation.\n  The way some in the business community have influenced the crafting \nof this amendment, Congress would be hamstrung in implementing \nsanctions against any nation that poses a threat to the safety of the \nAmerican people, even if a government proliferates dangerous weapons of \nmass destruction, commits genocide, or supports terrorists responsible \nfor murdering American citizens. But, if they flood the American market \nwith cheap television sets--whoa, that is a different proposition. We \ncan throw the book at them.\n  Under this amendment, the President would be prohibited from \nimplementing sanctions against any country for at least 45 days, \nsupposedly under the guise of a ``cooling off'' period. On the surface, \nthat sounds pretty reasonable. But in practice, a 2-month lapse is not \nonly foolish, it can be downright dangerous.\n  One example--after the Libyan terrorists blew up Pan Am flight 103, \nmurdering 263 innocent citizens in cold blood, the United Nations spent \nmonths and months debating appropriate actions against Libya. \nMeanwhile, Libya divested itself of most reachable assets in order to \navoid the impact of sanctions. So the pending amendment would \nessentially afford other terrorist states the same courtesy. While the \nUnited States ``cools off'' for 45 days, the terrorists, the \nproliferators, the genocidal dictators, would have 2 months to quietly \ndivest their finances and conceal the evidence and provide safe haven \nfor fugitives. That strikes me as being something short of reform.\n  The pending amendment would not place these requirements on \nmultilateral sanctions. Of course, multilateral sanctions are more \neffective than bilateral sanctions. But, should the United States be \nhandcuffed to the will, or more likely the lack of will, of the so-\ncalled international community? Should we tie our hands to the whims of \nour European ``allies''--and I put quotation marks around allies \nbecause their slumping welfare state economies are driving them to \nemploy increasingly mercantilist foreign policies.\n  Right now the United States is waging a lonely battle at the United \nNations to stop our allies from caving in and lifting U.N. sanctions on \nIraq. If it were up to the French and the Russians, international \nbusiness would be rushing headlong into Baghdad to renew commercial \nties with Saddam Hussein, notwithstanding his continued defiance of \nU.N. weapons inspectors. Yet, we should give these people a veto over \nour national security policy that was won through the sacrifice and \ncourage and blood of American men and women just 7 years ago?\n  I believe we need sanctions reform. One reform we might consider is \nrequiring that the sanctions which Congress passes would be actually \nimplemented. Not long ago, Congress passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions \nAct--a targeted law much of whose language, I might add, was drafted by \nthe Clinton administration itself. Live on CNN, the President signed it \ninto law with great pomp and circumstance. But then, when the time came \nto implement that law, the President lost his nerve and the U.S. \nforeign policy suffered yet another devastating loss of credibility.\n  The distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, and the Senate minority \nleader, Mr. Daschle, have established a bipartisan ``sanctions reform \ntask force'' to determine if, as critics have complained, Congress has \ngone ``sanctions mad.'' This, in my view, is a wise plan, and I serve \non that task force; the Senator from Indiana serves on it, as does \nSenator Glenn and other interested Senators from both parties. The \nfirst question we are seeking to answer is, What is a sanction? In \nfact, we are having a hearing planned for July 31 to study this and \nother questions.\n  In conclusion, Madam President, instead of rushing forward with any \nsort of ill-considered amendment--and I say that as respectfully as \npossible--the ramifications of which are unknown to most Senators, we \nshould let that task force do its work and consider ways Congress can \nstrengthen its consideration of proposed sanctions laws.\n  Those who are prone to criticize the ``impulsive'' actions of the \nU.S. Senate, actions which I happen to believe are motivated by a \ndevotion to the security of this country and its people, should \nthemselves be wary of impulsive ``one-size-fits-all'' solutions such as \nthis amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. HELMS. I certainly will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I will be very brief. I commend my \ncolleague from Indiana for his sponsorship of this amendment to the \nagriculture appropriations bill. In my view, it is long overdue that \nthis Senate develops\n\n[[Page S8190]]\n\na more thoughtful, more deliberative, a more analytical approach to our \nsanctions strategy on the part of the United States.\n  An observer noted during this discussion last week that Congress is \nin general opposed to sanctions, but in specific supports each one of \nthem that comes along--all too often, sanctions that are contradictory, \nthat are counterproductive, that do not, in fact, carry out the goals \nof the sanctions themselves. So I think the framework that Senator \nLugar of Indiana has developed, which would cause us to approach this \nin a much more analytical perspective--to see to it that we have a \ncost-effectiveness that results from our sanctions, or even if it \ndoesn't, that we deal with the sanction from that perspective--I think \nmakes all the sense in the world.\n  It is true that sanctions most often are effective when they are \nmultinational in nature. There is nothing, as I understand Senator \nLugar's amendment, that says we can only engage in multinational \nsanctions. We can engage in unilateral sanctions if we so choose. We \ncan engage in sanctions that may not be cost-effective, if we so \nchoose. But we ought to be fully cognizant of the nature of the \nsanctions and their consequences if, in fact, we are going to go down \nthose roads. It is not tying our hands, it is not tying the hands of \nAmerican foreign policy or trade policy or economic policy, to know \nwith certainty what it is we are doing and to approach it in the kind \nof thoughtful manner that Senator Lugar suggests.\n  There is nothing in this amendment, as I see it, that constitutes the \ndevelopment of an entitlement for foreign aid or anything of that \nnature. I think that is a gross misreading, not only of the intent, but \nthe actual effect of this amendment. There is nothing that would \nrestrict the ability of the American Government to impose sanctions as \na response to terrorism or genocide or the development of weapons of \nmass destruction. It does not tie our hands in that regard.\n  I want to say that I think we made a step in the right direction this \npast week with the handling of the sanctions that were about to be \nimposed on Pakistan in terms of agricultural sales. I think it is \nappropriate that this amendment be brought up in the context of this \nparticular bill.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Indiana for a great deal of work, a \ngreat deal of thought and care that has gone into this. The foreign \npolicy of the United States and oversight that this body, the U.S. \nSenate, can exercise will be enhanced and not detracted from by the \nadoption of this amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I, too, rise and commend our colleague \nfrom Indiana for this amendment. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the \namendment, along with a number of my colleagues. To use the language in \nanother situation, this is indeed a very modest proposal. This is \nprospective. It affects none of the sanctions that are presently in \nplace.\n  As the Senator from Indiana has rightly pointed out, sanctions are a \nvery effective and useful tool when applied well. I think the threat of \nsanctions may have an even greater impact in utility. I certainly agree \nwith him on that.\n  What he is merely asking us to support today is that when a proposed \nsanction is being suggested by the executive branch--by the way, I wish \nwe were applying this to ourselves because too often, when the Congress \nof the United States offers sanctions legislation, which is oftentimes \nwhere these bills originate, we should also be asking the question of \nwhat is the cost-benefit effect of this proposal. It doesn't say don't \nimpose the sanction. In fact, there may be situations that arise when, \nin fact, the outrage is so egregious that is the subject of the \nsanction that we would be more than willing to pay the economic price \nto impose it. This amendment does not preclude that result. It merely \nsuggests that we have some ability to make an analysis of what that \nrelationship would be and to ask for a few days to allow for objective \nanalysis of what the sanction cost might be. I hope this will enjoy \nstrong, unanimous, bipartisan support.\n  We have heard eloquent statements made on the floor of this Chamber, \nMadam President, over the last several weeks, as I think all of us have \nbegun to focus on sanctions policies as a result of the tragic events \nin India and Pakistan with the detonation of nuclear weaponry. That was \na very sad occasion, still a very worrisome occasion in terms of what \nit means and the implications for us in the near term and longer term.\n  If there has been any silver lining, if you will, in these clouds, to \ndraw an even tighter analogy, it is that I think everyone in this \nChamber has stepped back a little bit and said,\n\n       What are these sanctions policies and how do they work? \n     What is going on here? Are we really achieving the desired \n     results that are the subject of our rhetoric in speeches? Are \n     we causing policies to be changed in countries on whom we \n     impose sanctions? Are the political elite of these nations \n     affected by our policies? Are they in some way being impacted \n     by these decisions? What damage do we do to ourselves in the \n     process as a result of sanctions being imposed? Are average \n     people in these countries, who have nothing to do with \n     setting policies, being affected in some way? What does that \n     do in terms of eroding support for our country and our \n     policies where public support in foreign countries can be \n     pivotal in unpopular decisions that may have been made by \n     allies of ours around the world? What sort of corrosive \n     effect do sanctions have on those decisions?\n\n  I think these are good questions that deserve answers. What the \nSenator from Indiana has suggested is that, at least in one aspect of \nthese, that we know and understand what the cost-benefit relationship \nis.\n  Madam President, at a later point in this debate, I will offer \nanother amendment dealing with food and medicine, to merely just take \nfood, medicine, and agricultural products off the table as a tool of \nsanctions, for the primary reason that I don't think it has any impact \non trying to modify the behavior of nations on whom we have a \nsubstantial or less-than-substantial agreement. I will wait for the \nappropriate time to do it when this debate is concluded.\n  I also have authored, along with my friend, whom I see on this floor, \nwho has cosponsored that amendment, Senator Hagel from Nebraska, \nSenator Roberts from Kansas, Senator Warner from Virginia, Senator \nBurns from Montana, Senator Dorgan from North Dakota, proposals that \nwill deal with a broader issue of how sanctions ought to be dealt with. \nBut I will save that debate for a later day. It is a broader question \nand one for which we have a task force taking a look at some of these \nissues. I certainly want to make sure we are heading in the right \ndirection.\n  On the food and medicine and agricultural products, I think that \nmakes a lot of sense, and I will offer that at the appropriate time.\n  I conclude by urging my colleagues to be supportive of the Lugar \nproposal. It is a significant step in the right direction and one that \nI think deserves broad-based support as we try to sort out how best to \nadvance our foreign policy interests while not unnecessarily doing \ndamage to our own Nation and to innocent people around the world, \nparticularly in the unilateral application of these sanctions.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I rise to support Senator Lugar's amendment. I am an original \ncosponsor of that amendment. I am an original cosponsor of the Lugar \namendment because I believe the Lugar amendment applies some common \nsense and some relevancy to the issue of sanctions.\n  I know that we have a bipartisan task force on sanctions. I think \nmost of this body supports the efforts of that task force, but I don't \nsee any conflict in what Senator Lugar is proposing today, and what \nSenator Dodd and others will propose later, with the task force \nassignment.\n  It is interesting to note that since 1993 we have imposed 65 \nunilateral sanctions on 35 nations. We have some responsibility to give \nsome focus and some understanding to our trade policy, which is part of \nour foreign policy, which is connected to our national security, which \nis connected to our economy and jobs and growth and productivity.\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\n  I fail to appreciate why this is not relevant, why this is not \nimportant. This is not getting in the way of the task force. The task \nforce, as I understand it, is to help frame up this issue.\n  This amendment would not undo any existing sanctions. This amendment \nwould establish a process for a more rational consideration of future \nuse of sanctions. Sanctions surely must remain a tool of foreign \npolicy, but sanctions are not foreign policy. Sanctions are only \neffective when they are multilateral. The world is dynamic. The world \nis changing. Trade is spherical. It moves. It will move right over the \ntop of us unless we attempt to manage the movement.\n  Every great event in history has produced new opportunities, new \nchallenges, new threats, new uncertainties, and the collapse of the \nSoviet empire has given the world great new opportunities and hope. \nOnly one nation on Earth can help lead the nations of the world to that \nhope and opportunity, and trade surely must be a major part of that.\n  Why in the world would we continue to impose unworkable, \nunachievable, outdated, irrelevant policy rather than looking forward, \ngetting us into the next century, with the promise that only this \ncountry can give?\n  Does anybody really believe, in this body, that any nation on Earth \ncannot get any service, any commodity, any product if they want it from \nsome other nation? Of course not. This is a new world. Both the \nPresident and the Congress want some control of the issue of sanctions. \nWe want some definition of what this is about. The Congress of the \nUnited States owes this Nation some leadership on this issue. The \nPresident must lead on this issue.\n  Senator Lugar has described his amendment in detail. It would sunset \nnew sanctions after 2 years. The way it is now, Madam President, we go \non and on with sanctions. This amendment starts to clean up sanctions. \nDo we need them? Are they relevant? Does the world change? I fail to \nsee that that is a threat to our foreign policy and to those who wish \nus ill.\n  It would require cost-benefit studies. My goodness, imagine that. \nWhat a terrible thing--a cost-benefit study. It would require an \neffort, first, to make sanctions multilateral. It would require an \nevaluation of whether a sanction is likely to achieve its policy goal. \nAgain--again--what a questionable objective. My goodness, actually \nfocusing on an action and figuring out, if you can, if there are \nconsequences, if it is workable.\n  I know some in this body care occasionally about a headline, about a \npress release.\n  A CRS study, January 22, 1998--this year--listed 97, total, \nunilateral sanctions now in place. Since that report came out, we have \nadded sanctions against India and Pakistan, for a total of at least 99 \nsanctions now in place. We dealt with some of that a little earlier.\n  A study by the National Association of Manufacturers found that from \n1993 to 1996 we imposed, as I mentioned, another 61 sanctions. These 35 \nnations--these 35 nations--where we have imposed these sanctions make \nup 42 percent of the world population. Almost half of the 5.5 billion \npeople on the Earth are included in these sanctions and 19 percent of \nthe world's export market--$800 billion.\n  Who are we kidding here? Who are we hurting? We are not isolating \nanybody except ourselves. We are isolating our producers, our farmers, \nour ranchers, our manufacturers. We are isolating ourselves. And for \nwhat end? Bring a little sanity and common sense to this? I think so. I \nthink so.\n  I might add, is there something really wrong about business actually \nstepping into this debate? Is there something really wrong about having \nbusiness say, ``Gee, we're being hurt''? Is that a special interest? Is \nAmerican business a special interest? Is industry a special interest, \npeople who work in business and the industry, produce jobs, create \nwealth, pay taxes? Be careful of that special interest. Be careful of \nthat special interest. That is America. That is why we are the most \npowerful, dominant, free nation on Earth.\n  A new study by the International Institute of Economics estimates \nthat, in 1995 alone, unilateral sanctions cost Americans $20 billion in \nlost exports, losing 200,000 jobs. That does not include, Madam \nPresident, what is referred to as the ``downstream loss.'' The \ndownstream loss, when you lose markets--it means the suppliers and the \njobs and the adjunct jobs--no way to really calculate that.\n  The National Foreign Trade Council has identified 41 separate \nlegislative studies on the books that either require or authorize the \nimposition of unilateral sanctions.\n  Well, it goes on and on. The fact is, Madam President, what Senator \nLugar is doing is important. It is really relevant to today. It is more \nrelevant to our future. It is relevant to our place in the world. What \nis the U.S. interest in the world? It is relevant to our children, and \nit is relevant to everything we are and who we are. That is why I \nstrongly support this, why I was an original cosponsor, and why I urge \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Madam President, thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me applaud the Senator from Nebraska \nfor a statement that I think was eloquent and filled with good sense. \nAnd I certainly want to associate myself with the remarks he has just \nmade. And even though we were on different sides of the previous \namendment, let me say, as I did previously, the Senator from Indiana is \na very respected Senator, someone for whom I have great respect on \nforeign policy issues.\n  I am pleased to be here to speak as a cosponsor of the amendment that \nhe has offered. It makes good sense to me. And I say, I think, as the \nSenator from Nebraska said, I would only go further than this. I \ncertainly support this. I think it is a step in the right direction, \nbut there is even more that we can do.\n  The question that is required to be asked now is, When we impose \nsanctions around the world, for various purposes, many of them \nimportant purposes that deal with national security and other issues, \nshould those sanctions include the shipment of food and the shipment of \nmedicine?\n  Frankly, I wonder if anyone believes that Saddam Hussein has ever \nmissed a meal because of sanctions imposed by this country. Does \nanybody believe that Saddam Hussein has missed a meal? I do not think \nso. We cut off food shipments to Iraq. And if Saddam Hussein is making \nall of his meals, guess who misses their meals? It is almost always the \npoor and the hungry who are injured when you cut off shipments of food.\n  Does anybody believe that Fidel Castro does not eat well nearly every \nmeal when he chooses to have what he wants to eat? But when we cut off \nfood shipments to Cuba, we know that it will be the poor and the hungry \nwho will be injured by that.\n  Our country, for very legitimate reasons, says we are very concerned \nabout what is happening in Iraq, Iran, Libya, Cuba, and more. For \nlegitimate reasons we say that. I am sure the Senator from Indiana, at \ngreater length than any others of us, could recite the foreign policy \nissues and the national security issues that attend to those countries \nand their relationship with us and others in the world.\n  But the question before us is not, Should we be concerned about those \ncountries? Of course we should. The question is, When we impose \nsanctions, what should those sanctions contain? Is it in our interest \nand in the interest of the hungry and the poor around the world to \ninclude in those sanctions the withdrawal of shipments of grain and the \nwithdrawal of shipments of medicine?\n  I have clearly an interest here on behalf of family farmers. I \nrepresent one of the most agricultural States in the Nation. And nearly \n10 percent of the market for wheat is out of limits or off limits to \nour family farmers because we have decided to impose sanctions and \ntherefore take those markets off limits to our farmers. Does that cost \nfarmers money? You bet. It takes money right out of their pockets. They \nare, in effect, told by these sanctions, ``You, Mr. And Mrs. Farmer, \nyou pay the cost of these sanctions. You pay the cost as a result of \nlost income.''\n  Where I would go further is, I would support and am a cosponsor of an \namendment that will be offered by Senator Dodd, and I think cosponsored \nby Senator Hagel, saying, let us not include food and medicine in \nfuture sanctions. That is not appropriate as part\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\nof sanctions. I am a cosponsor of that amendment to be offered. I would \ngo further to say, this country ought to decide, if it is to impose \nsanctions in the future, or for sanctions that now exist, it ought to \nreimburse farmers for the cost of those sanctions. Why should this \ncountry simply say, ``Here is our desired effect, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer. \nYou pay the cost of it''? If it is for national security, let it come \nout, then, of the national security accounts from which we pay for many \nother matters, and say to family farmers, ``We'll reimburse you for \nthose lost markets.'' That is an amendment I am thinking of offering to \nthis as well. We will see what results from that.\n  But it is required, I think, to say, as we discuss this issue, as I \nsaid earlier today, there is some horrible disconnection in this world.\n  Halfway around the world there are people in Sudan, we are told, old \nwomen, climbing trees to forage for leaves to eat, leaves because they \nare on the abyss of starvation; a million to a million and a quarter of \nthem are on the edge of starvation because they don't have enough to \neat.\n  Turn the globe another halfway around and you will find America's \nfarmers, who are the economic all-stars, produce food in abundant \nquantity, and they are told in our system that when they take that \ngrain which represents that food to market, that their product doesn't \nhave value, doesn't have worth. There is something that is terribly \ndisconnected about that.\n  I have been in many parts of the world. What I remember most about \nthe desperate poverty and hunger that exists, for example, is in the \ndesperate slum called Cite Soleil, on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, \nHaiti. You see poverty as bad and conditions as desperate as anywhere \nelse in the world. I leaned over a crib where a young child was dying \nof starvation in one of the worst slums you can imagine. This child had \nno one. The child had lost most of its hair; what hair was left was \nturning red as a result of severe malnutrition and starvation. This \nchild, the doctor told me, was dying.\n  I thought to myself, there is such a terrible, terrible, \ndisconnection here because we produce food in abundant quantity. How on \nEarth can moving food around the world to all parts of the world that \nneed our food in a way that connects our interests to the interests of \nthose who need it, how on Earth could that ever threaten our national \nsecurity? It does not and it could not.\n  The Senator from Indiana offers an amendment on the issue of \nsanctions. It is very simple. It describes sanctions in the future. We \nought to deal with sanctions that now exist, as well. It describes \nconditions for the imposition of those sanctions that deal with \nunilateral sanctions. It says the Secretary of Agriculture should use \nexport assistance under various programs to offset any damage or likely \ndamage to producers and so on.\n  I fully support that and I am pleased to be a cosponsor, but I say \nagain we have much, much more to do. Hubert Humphrey, many years ago, \nused to say, ``Send them anything they can't shoot back.'' What he \nmeant by that is it will never injure our national security interests \nto send American food around the world, to sell it in markets where we \ncan sell it, and to move it to other markets under title II and III \nunder Food for Peace, and in some cases, title I, in other markets \nwhere they cannot afford to purchase it. It is always in our best \ninterest. Is it in the best interest of farmers? Of course, but it also \nhappens to run parallel to the national interests of our country.\n  Let me finish where I began and say I am pleased to vote for this \namendment, pleased to be a cosponsor, and will cosponsor an amendment \nthat will go further, that Senator Dodd will offer, and may offer one \nmyself, that deals with present sanctions and reimbursement to farmers \nfor those sanctions, saying that the Government ought to not force them \nto bear the full burden of the cost of sanctions.\n  But I thank the Senator from Indiana for offering this amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not intend to delay matters at all. Whenever the \nchairman is ready to go, I certainly won't be on my feet. I want to \nrise and congratulate Senator Lugar and those who helped put his \namendment together. I am a cosponsor, but I don't take credit for any \nof the innovation and thoroughness of this work.\n  I just want to say on a very personal note that every now and then \nwhen you see things out in our country or in the world sort of mixed \nup, and you see mixed signals, you wonder just what is our country \ndoing, and somebody like Dick Lugar comes along and makes sense out of \nsomething that appears to be just a mess.\n  There can be no question, whatever support there is in this body for \nsanctions--and clearly they must be an instrument, a tool--whatever \nsupport there is for that concept does not mean our country ought to be \nliving under a ``quilt'' of sanctions, many of which are just bilateral \nbetween us and some country, when we already know that many of them \ndon't work or they work to our detriment.\n  Here we sit today with an emerging crisis in agriculture, probably \nmostly from the Asian flu; that is, from the failure in the Asian \nmarkets because of their banking systems falling apart, and those \npeople can't buy the products they were buying. Nonetheless, when we \nadded Pakistan for something they did, which we were all worried about, \nand they depended upon our grain and that kind of product to feed their \npeople, obviously American agriculture is hurting.\n  Now, there are some who would like to make it that the new \nlegislation creating an open market at some time in the future, a \ntotally free and open market, is the cause of the problem. That is not \nthe cause. The cause is that America's trading in foodstuffs and \nproducts from our farms is not working as well as it should because we \nhave done something that is harming it, or failed to do some things \nthat would cause it to work better.\n\n  Let me repeat one more time, why in the world are we still holding up \nIMF? If we want to reform it, why don't we reform it and pass it? There \nis hardly anybody in agriculture or American industry that hires our \npeople that doesn't think we ought to do that.\n  Now, Senator Lugar would like to do that. That isn't what he is doing \nhere today. He is doing the next best thing. If that isn't a \nprescriptive manner, postmanner, trying to get rid of some of the \nnonsense of the unilateral, bilateral and multilateral situations that \nwe have where we say we can't sell countries our product. Why don't we \nget on with fast track? If you want to talk about what would help our \nfarmers, that is what would help. Get America's trade markets open so \nthey can sell their products.\n  Obviously, what we are doing here today is a very rational, sensible \napproach to a very, very, confused set of policies which are not \nworking to America's benefits, which we can pass and then sit back and \nsay we did something. Isn't that great; we did something. We never \nmeasured it. I gather the new guidelines will ask us to at least \nmeasure before we do it; is that correct, Senator Lugar?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At least measure before we do it.\n  I commend you again, Senator Lugar. You have done it a number of \ntimes before. We have been here a long time together. I regret, even \nthough the color of your hair might indicate to the contrary, I have \nbeen here longer than you. Nonetheless, we have been here a long time \ntogether. I do compliment you because every now and then when things \nare confused, you make up for that and come up with something like \nthis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I would like to join the chorus of \nwell-deserved accolades--common-sense, I guess, accolades for the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, the outstanding chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has summed it up very well. I am not \ngoing to take the Senate's time to repeat what has already been said in \nregard to this debate. Senator Lugar has already done that. Others have \ndone that.\n  I do have a statement that involves obvious ``golden words of truth'' \nin regard to this issue that I will simply insert for the record, but I \ndo want to say\n\n[[Page S8193]]\n\nagain that the use of sanctions as a foreign policy tool have \nskyrocketed since the conclusion of World War II. The last 4 years, as \nhas been said on the floor, 61 new U.S. laws or executive actions were \nenacted authorizing the unilateral sanctions against 35 countries, and \nin all, over 70 foreign nations representing 75 percent of the world's \npopulation are currently subjected to a unilateral sanction by the \nUnited States.\n  These are easy perceptions, I guess, actions that people take. I \nthink in earlier days we used to call it gunboat diplomacy. Maybe we \nsent a gunboat over to a nation to demonstrate our unhappiness with a \nforeign nation and their policy. But there have been terrible \nrepercussions in regard to these sanctions. They do not achieve their \npolicy goals. They are very counterproductive, and as has been \nindicated by some across the aisle, and others, we shoot ourselves in \nthe foot. So the distinguished chairman has, for a considerable amount \nof time, taken a look at the overall objective of sanctions and what \nhas happened in a counterproductive way, not only to U.S. agriculture, \nbut the entire U.S. economy and the global marketplace. He has come up \nwith a comprehensive, thoughtful approach, and it is commensurate with \nthe debate that will take place and the discussion that will take place \nin this body with regard to sanctions reform overall.\n\n  There are those of us--Senator Dodd, Senator Hagel, Senator Biden, as \nwell as Senator Lugar and myself--who want to take a look at all of the \nsanctions that we have in place. And that is appropriate. We have taken \naction in a 98-0 vote last week regarding the GSM program and the \npossibility of selling wheat to Pakistan. The chairman was a real \nleader in that effort. We have taken action now by unanimous consent on \nthe India/Pakistan situation, which will give the administration \nflexibility to deal with that issue. The next logical step is to \nconsider, and I think favorably pass, the Lugar reform initiative. So I \nstand in solid support of the chairman for what he is trying to do.\n  Madam President, U.S. influence, prestige and resolve in foreign \naffairs currently rests at a cross-roads. The United States, which has \nprided itself on providing international leadership through strength \nand by example, has increasingly turned away from that legacy by \nembracing ambivalence and sanctions instead of engagement and respect. \nNowhere is this more clear than in the area of unilateral economic \nsanctions.\n  The United States in recent years has developed a seemingly \nuncontrollable desire to show our displeasure over a specific action, \nbehavior or belief in a foreign country by punishing that country \nthrough the imposition of unilateral sanctions. Regardless of whether a \nRepublican or Democrat was President, regardless of whether Republicans \nor Democrats ran the Congress, the use of sanctions as a foreign policy \ntool has literally sky-rocketed since the conclusion of the Second \nWorld War. In fact, in just the last four years, 61 new U.S. laws or \nexecutive actions were enacted authorizing unilateral economic \nsanctions against 35 countries. All in all, over 70 foreign states \nrepresenting nearly 75 percent of the world's population are currently \nsubjected to unilateral sanctions by the United States.\n  Unfortunately, with few exceptions, sanctions very rarely work. In \norder for sanctions to be successful, the United States must--\nabsolutely must--convince the entire rest of the world to join our \nboycott. Unless this occurs, the sanctioned country simply gets what it \nneeds--food, financing, etc.--from the other countries that chose not \nto join the Sanctions Circle.\n  There are two serious repercussions when this happens. First, the \nsanctions hurt us instead of their intended targert. Yes, that's right, \nwhen U.S. businesses lose access to markets for their products, U.S. \nworkers lose job opportunities. So instead of joining us in professing \noutrage about some particularly repugnant act, foreign governments \nsimply feign indignation while they quietly slip in to take away \nbusiness from U.S. companies. And if you don't think that's true, just \nask a foreign businessman or government official whether they support \nor oppose the American penchant for unilateral sanctions. They love it \nand they hope it continues.\n  Yes, this is the second repercussion. Foreign governments--even our \nallies--have figured out that by refusing to join the United States in \nimposing sanctions, their countries actually benefit. What a bonus! \nThey can stick it to the United States and create new markets for their \nbusinesses at the same time! As a result of this revelation throughout \nthe world, it has become nearly impossible for the United States to \nbuild a unanimous case for sanctions against anyone.\n  Just look at Iraq. If ever a case could be made for sanctions, Saddam \nHussein is the poster child. After all, armed aggression against a \npeaceful neighbor and use of weapons of mass destruction on one's own \ncitizens are truly reprehensible offenses, right? Surely Iraq deserved \ntougher sanctions when Saddam refused to accept U.N. weapons inspectors \njust a few months ago, right? Wrong. When Saddam pulled his latest \nstunt, the vast majority of the world flatly refused to support further \nsanctions. If we can't build a case for sanctions with Saddam Hussein \nas our target given the utter disregard he has shown for the United \nStates and the rest of the world, will we ever be able to? I wonder.\n  Where do sanctions come from anyway? They usually are issued by the \nPresident under the authority of at least twelve different laws \ngoverning international affairs. Again, in recent years, sanctions have \nbeen used far more frequently than ever before in U.S. history. This \nisn't an indictment of the current administration or any previous \nadministrations; it is simply an assessment of how U.S. foreign policy \nis changing. Instead of using our influence and diplomacy to encourage \ngood behavior, we attempt to use our power to punish bad behavior. And \nas I've just discussed, whether used as a threat to try and prevent \nunwanted actions or imposed as a punishment for undesirable actions, \nsanctions rarely work.\n  Although most sanctions are imposed directly by the President, \nunilateral sanctions can be particularly damaging when they are imposed \nby Congress. The President of the United States is the Commander in \nChief of our country. He is charged with implementing our foreign \npolicy. While the Congress can and should be involved in the \nconstruction of that policy, the President is ultimately responsible \nfor implementing it. When the Congress forces the President to impose \nsanctions on a country for a given action or behavior, it takes away \nthe flexibility the President needs to address distinctly different \nforeign policy problem that may arise. The Congress basically says, \n``we don't know or care what caused the action or behavior; however, we \ninsist that you impose these sanctions regardless of what the \nramifications may be.'' That is a dangerous and irresponsible manner in \nwhich to conduct U.S. foreign policy.\n  Let me make one other point regarding the perception of the United \nStates abroad. Foreign countries and their citizens do not distinguish \nbetween U.S. military/diplomatic policy and U.S. trade policy. To them, \nthey are the same thing. To them, it's just plain, old-fashioned U.S. \nforeign policy. When the United States imposes unilateral economic \nsanctions, when we fail to pass fast track negotiating authority, when \nwe fail to renew IMF funding and when we threaten to withhold regular \ntrading status with China, the prestige and authority of the United \nStates in foreign affairs is greatly and permanently diminished.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would like to speak to this amendment and \nexpress a contrary view to that expressed by my colleague who has just \nspoken. With all due respect to the Senator from Indiana, who has put a \nlot of work into this, and who has offered the amendment, and while \nagreeing with much of what is in the amendment and much of what he \nproposes to try to do, I have to object for two reasons to the \nconsideration of the amendment at this time.\n  First of all, it is in reaction to--at least partially, although he \nhas been at this for a long time, and understanding that we do need to \nmake some\n\n[[Page S8194]]\n\nchanges--what has occurred with the sanctions placed on India and \nPakistan. We just resolved the issue with India and Pakistan primarily \nbecause of the amendment we just passed, which eliminates the \nagricultural component, broadly defined, of the India/Pakistan \nsanctions. Therefore, to the extent that my colleague, Senator Roberts, \nwas just speaking, and others who have talked about the impact on our \nfarmers as a result of the imposition of those sanctions, we have \nsolved that situation.\n  As a matter of fact, if you analyze the other sanctions imposed as a \nresult of their nuclear tests, it gets down to a very narrow issue of \nsome Eximbank loans or World Bank loans primarily and, therefore, I \nurge us not to rush into a consideration of this amendment on this \nparticular appropriations bill because of the need to fix something \nthat was not done with respect to India and Pakistan, when we have \nalready begun to solve that problem.\n  Secondly, because of the fact that sanctions have not always worked \nas we have desired them, and because of the obvious deficiencies with \nthe sanctions imposed on India and Pakistan, the majority leader has \nappointed a bipartisan task force, consisting of Members of both \nparties, with different backgrounds, to deal with this question. We had \na meeting yesterday.\n  I am somewhat shocked that the Senator from Indiana would offer this \namendment today, because yesterday he said that he wanted to preserve \nthe option of proposing this amendment at some time in the future. But \nhe seemed to agree with the majority opinion expressed there--in fact, \nall but one of the Members, in one way or another, expressed a view \nthat a September 1 deadline was somewhat unrealistic in trying to deal \nwith this problem. The Senator did preserve his option to offer an \namendment at a future date, but I am shocked that it is offered today \nbecause the task force has not had an opportunity to review this matter \nin any depth.\n  Madam President, I would like to now discuss some of the things that \nwe talked about yesterday, which I think will illustrate the fact that \nthis amendment is prematurely offered at this time. Again, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the goals behind it--to review broadly \nour sanctions policy and some of the specifics about it, and to be more \ncareful about how we impose sanctions--are both worthwhile and, in many \nrespects, something we can all agree on, one of the things we can't \nagree on is a definition of what a sanction is. There is a broad \ndefinition, according to the Senator from Indiana. I wonder whether we \nare really ready to apply the limitations and the tests that are called \nfor in this amendment to foreign aid reductions, because as I read the \nproposal, one of the sanctions would be a reduction or elimination of \nforeign aid.\n\n  U.S. aid is not an entitlement. We are going to make different \ndecisions every year about how much foreign aid we may want to give to \na country. Should that be subject to the limitations imposed in this \namendment? How about export controls on sensitive U.S. technology?\n  We just came from a very highly classified briefing of a committee \nthat was specially appointed to examine the missile threat to the \nUnited States. That report is, I must say, extraordinarily concerning, \nI am sure, to everybody who received it. On some of the countries that \npose this threat to us, we have imposed stringent export controls with \nrespect to sensitive technology going to those countries, which could \nassist them in the development of their ballistic missile technology \nprograms. Are we going to impede the President's ability and Congress' \nability to impose those kinds of limitations on the sensitive export of \ntechnology to countries that we don't want to have that technology? As \nI read the amendment of the Senator from Indiana, that is all covered.\n  We need to have a common definition of what a sanction is in order to \napply these kinds of limitations. And there should not be a 45- or 60-\nday--I think it is now reduced to 45 days--waiting period. There are \nall kinds of things that would cause either the President or Congress \nto want to impose sanctions right away and not wait 45 days.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am not sure I ought not to propound \nthis question to the Senator from Indiana.\n  It is my understanding that this morning the President announced \nsanctions and trade reductions, under the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, against certain Russian companies. Is it the \nunderstanding of the Senator from Arizona that that is the kind of \nsanction that might not be allowed under the Lugar amendment?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I will give the Senator my understanding of \nit, but I would be pleased, also, to refer that question to the Senator \nfrom Indiana. As I read it, that kind of sanction would, of course, be \ncontrolled by the 45-day limit, and the rules of the Senate that would \napply, and so on. I think the Senator from Indiana should defend his \nown proposal.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then I pose the question to him.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Clearly, the President, in the case of an emergency, has a \nright to impose whatever sanction he wants. There is no prohibition. \nObviously, when national security is involved--and the national \nsecurity situation is explicitly mentioned--I think that is important. \nBut I ask the President to tidy things up. In other words, after \nimposing the sanction, he should state, if he has not already, the \nobjectives and benchmarks and the cost to the American people of jobs \nand income. Some administration people have objected to the President \nplaying by the same rules as the Congress. Nevertheless, the amendment \nis evenhanded. He has to fill it in. But he has emergency powers, of \ncourse.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So, if I can follow up with the Senator from Indiana, \nis that the 614 national security waiver? Does that sort of override \neverything? Is that some sort of override?\n  Mr. LUGAR. If that is the correct text of the national security \nwaiver, yes.\n  Mr. KYL. We will get back to that because I am not sure--if that is \nthe intent of the Senator, I will have to see whether or not, in fact, \nit is effectuated.\n  Let me get to another national security issue. We have, I think, come \nto the conclusion--most of us, but not all in this body--that it would \nbe a mistake to put an explicit time limit, for example, on our \npresence in Bosnia, or an explicit time limit on certain other kinds of \nmilitary activities or threatening national security activities \nbecause, of course, what that does is enable the party against whom the \naction is being taken to simply ride it out and to understand if they \ncan just get by the next 60 days or 6 months, then they will not have \nto worry about that. So we have always taken the position that when it \ncomes to this kind of thing--national security--our actions should be \nsomewhat open-ended to ensure that the other party begins acting in the \nway that we would like to have that party act.\n  Obviously, when you have a 2-year sunset on these kinds of sanctions, \nyou eliminate that flexibility. I think that is one of the reasons why \nmost of us have tended to want to support the kind of review and \nanalysis about which the Senator from Indiana is talking. Clearly, that \nkind of thing should be done. But there should be a mechanism for the \nCongress and the President to, in effect, pull the plug on a sanction \nwhose time has run rather than to have an arbitrary time limit for its \nimposition.\n  If the Senator from Indiana would like to respond, I am happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, to answer the question posed, both the \nPresident and the Congress can reauthorize the action after two years. \nAdditionally, they are constrained simply to explain how successful \nthings have been and what their objectives were to begin with. But the \nlaw--at least my amendment--explicitly gives them the ability to \nreauthorize. They have to take that affirmative action.\n  Mr. KYL. If I could, Madam President, go to another point; that is, \nthe failure to discriminate among or between different kinds of \nsanctions.\n  The amendment, as I read it, treats all sanctions alike. It does not \ndifferentiate between sanctions imposed for the transfer of nuclear \ntechnology, for example, or the exploding of nuclear devices in \nviolation of treaties, and\n\n[[Page S8195]]\n\nsanctions imposed for less dangerous activities, for example. In a \nsense, when one reads it, it appears to condone sanctions which have as \ntheir goal the promoting of trade but severely restricts sanctions for \nother purposes.\n  I understand that the Senators from farm States have been very \nconcerned about limitations on exports of agricultural products.\n  As I say, I think we are all pleased to support the amendment which \nenables India and Pakistan to import American agricultural products. \nBut I think we ought to examine this in a balanced way and understand \nthat many of the sanctions are imposed for national security reasons. I \nthink most of us understand that national security has to take a front \nseat to other considerations of a lesser degree of priority, if, in \nfact, it has gotten to the point that the country, either the President \nor the Congress, thinks it is in our national interest to impose \nsanctions. Yet, under the sweeping definition of a sanction here to \nmean literally ``any restriction or condition on economic activity,'' \nit appears there is no differentiation to account for the differences \nin reasons why we impose sanctions.\n  For example, as I said before, we may have a reason to sanction a \nparticular country, or a particular kind of trade activity, because of \nthe national security implications of that. With respect to China, for \nexample, we require a special waiver for certain kinds of technology \ntransfers, or the launching of satellites, just to cite one example. It \nseems to me that is an entirely different kind of sanction than the \ntypical kind of trade sanction on imports or quotas that we might apply \nfor some other reason.\n  I think it is very important for us to try to come to some agreement \non a definition of just exactly what is a sanction before we begin \napplying across the board a set of rules that would automatically \nsunset sanctions after 2 years; that would require a 45-day time period \nbefore sanctions could be implemented; that would change the rules of \nthe Congress, in effect, after first stating that it is our policy that \nthese things should be done, and changing the rules of the Senate to \nensure that policy is affected.\n  It seems to me that we have time to deal with this now since we have \ndealt with the immediate emergency. The leader has appointed a task \nforce, and we have identified this as one of the things that we need to \ndo in this task force so that we are clear about the differentiation \nbetween the different kinds of sanctions before we begin identifying \nwhat kind of limitations should be placed upon each of them, and, \ntherefore, that consideration of this amendment at this time is \npremature notwithstanding the fact that many of the ideas in the \nSenator's amendment might well be the kinds of things that we would \nadopt for certain kinds of sanctions when we end up actually adopting \nlegislation.\n  But, clearly, this is not something in which there is an easy one-\nsize-fits-all solution. I fear that is what we are doing by trying to \nrush this matter.\n  I will be happy to yield the floor at this time. I will have other \nthings to say, but I know the Senator from Kentucky, who chairs the \ntask force, wants to speak to the issue as well.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, as a follow-on to my good friend from \nArizona, let me say first I am a farm State Senator. I have been on the \nAgriculture Committee for 14 years. I am a supporter of GATT, NAFTA, \nfast track, and replenishment of the IMF, which we handle in our \nsubcommittee of appropriations for foreign ops. So put me down as a \nfree trader. Also, put me down as a principal sponsor of the amendment \nlast week to lift the agricultural sanctions on India and Pakistan. We \ndid sort of a partial job on that last week, and then, as the Senator \nfrom Arizona pointed out, sort of finished the job today.\n  Also, put me down as a great admirer of the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee and his distinguished work over the years in \nforeign policy, and on trade matters as well.\n  The majority leader asked me to chair the task force on sanctions. \nThe Democratic leader asked Senator Biden to do that. As the Senator \nfrom Arizona just pointed out, we have had an opportunity to only have \none meeting. It was yesterday.\n  I say to my good friend from Indiana, by September I might well be \nsupporting this bill. But I am, frankly, among those in the Senate--and \nI expect this is almost everyone in this body--who has not been exactly \nconsistent on the subject of sanctions over the years. Having supported \nMFN to China, I have also advocated certain kinds of sanctions against \nBurma. My guess is that there is hardly anybody in this room who has \nbeen entirely consistent on this subject.\n  What the distinguished Senator from Indiana tried to do here is to \nenact a broad piece of legislation that may well be justified. But let \nme say I am just not yet comfortable in taking that step. Maybe by \nSeptember I will be comforted that this is what we ought to do. But I \nwant to echo the observations of the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nthat I am just not sure we are ready, as a body, to wipe the slate \nclean.\n  Reading from Senator Lugar's bill, unless I am missing something \nhere, it says, ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nPresident may not implement any new unilateral economic sanction under \nany provision of law with respect to a foreign country, or foreign \nentity, unless at least 45 days in advance of such implementation the \nPresident publishes notice in the Federal Register of his intent to \nimplement such sanctions.''\n  It is my understanding that just today the President announced \nsanctions and trade restrictions under the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act against certain Russian countries. I am concerned, \nfor example, whether under this bill the President could have taken \nthat step. Maybe he should not have. Maybe that is the point of the \nbill.\n  But let me just say, Madam President, that I am queasy about taking \nsuch a broad, comprehensive step, even though it is only prospective, \nbefore we have even had a chance to work our way through it. I confess \nthat many of us have not spent the amount of time the Senator from \nIndiana has already spent on it. He is undoubtedly one of the experts \nin the Senate on this subject.\n  But, since all of us are called upon to vote, let me appeal to those \nin the Senate who may not yet have the level of expertise on the \nsanctions issue that the distinguished chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee has, and ask the question, Are we ready to enact on this \nappropriations bill a broad, sweeping sanctions policy at this time?\n  Let me repeat. The Senator from Indiana may be entirely correct that \nthis is the way to go. But I will suggest to the Senate that we give \nthis a little more time and think it through a little further. I am not \nsure the work of the task force, on which many of us serve, including \nthe Senator from Indiana and the Senator from Arizona, is going to shed \na whole lot of light on this. But we are going to try. We are going to \ntry to shed some light on it by having a hearing on July 30. We are \ngoing to try very hard to meet the majority leader's deadline of having \nat least a report by September 1. That may or may not enlighten a whole \nlot of Members of the Senate.\n  But for those of us who have not spent as much time on this as the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana maybe, that report will be helpful \nto us. Maybe we will get a chance, as the Senator from Arizona pointed \nout, to kind of start out with what a sanction is. I am not even sure I \nknow, frankly, at this point exactly what is and what isn't a sanction. \nIs a restriction in a foreign aid bill a sanction? Do we make a \ndistinction between transfers of military significance? I think most \nSenators would argue that you should make that kind of distinction on \nthings like agricultural products, food and medicine, and the like.\n  So I commend the Senator from Indiana for a very important piece of \nlegislation and just suggest that maybe this isn't the best time for \nmost of us to be going forward on this, and I hope we can shed some \nlight through the task force over the next few weeks on this whole \nsubject.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to join with my colleagues from Arizona and Kentucky, who have \njust\n\n[[Page S8196]]\n\nspoken, with a certain sense of reluctance about opposing the amendment \nof the Senator from Indiana because of the respect I have for him, \nbecause of the thoughtful way in which he goes about matters generally \nand particularly matters of foreign policy. But to echo what has just \nbeen said, this is a very complicated and controversial subject, an \nimportant exercise of one of the major options that the United States \nhas in carrying out its foreign policy.\n  The bipartisan Senate leadership has created a task force that has \nbeen referred to. As has been said, we only had an opportunity to hold \nour first meeting yesterday. So I think for us to act on this quite \ncomprehensive piece of legislation, which will dramatically alter the \nlandscape in which the United States, Congress, can impose economic \nsanctions, is a rush to judgment before we have had a chance to hear \nfrom all sides, as the task force will do--a public hearing is going to \noccur--to reason together and then to come up with a proposal.\n  As the Senator from Kentucky said, the end proposal may contain major \nparts of the amendment offered by the Senator from Indiana. But I think \nwe would do much better and serve our national interest better if we \nworked this out over a period of time. There is no emergency now that I \ncan think of, that I know of, that requires us to adopt this wholesale \nchange in what has been a fundamental part of our foreign policy for a \nlong time now, deriving, incidentally, from a constitutional premise of \nthe ability, Congress' ability, to regulate commerce with other nations \nof the world.\n  So I think this is premature, though probably thoughtful. But I say \n``probably'' because this is a detailed amendment which I, frankly, \nhave not been able to absorb in the time it has been in the Chamber, to \nmake a reasoned judgment, even if there was not a task force that had \nbeen appointed on this very subject.\n  I hear the Senator from Indiana; his intention is for its effect to \nbe prospective, not to affect any sanctions that are in law now, and \nyet there are sections of this that begin ``notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law'' and impose procedural requirements that make me \nwonder whether they would affect, for instance, the President's ability \nto impose sanctions in an emergency situation which, if we adopted this \namendment, he might be limited from doing.\n  So there are questions. And I think we should step back, acknowledge \nthat there is a chorus that has risen rather rapidly in the last period \nof months questioning the extent to which we have applied sanctions, \nthe manner in which we have done it, and listen to that chorus but not \nrush to act in response to it before we have had a chance, each of us, \nto deliberate and do what is right.\n  Now, I want to offer one other set of thoughts here, Mr. President. \nWhy is this so important? Well, let's all begin with the fact that most \nof us acknowledge, as the Senator from Kentucky said, we have not, most \nof us, been consistent in our votes on these matters. It is hard to be \nconsistent in our votes on matters of sanctions, that they have been \nused too much. I think most of us in this Chamber would say that. That \nis why the leadership created the bipartisan task force, to begin to \nset some guidelines. But in all the criticism that we are heaping on \nourselves, I think it is important not to lose sight of the value of \nsanctions. They are, roughly speaking, one of three options that a \ngovernment has to protect its strategic interests and uphold its \nideals--diplomatic, economic, and military.\n  If I may say so--and I know people sometimes say that we are foolish \nto do this, that it is self-defeating--we have to consider the impact \nsome of the sanctions have had not just on farm States. I can tell you, \nsome of the sanctions regimes have had an effect on manufacturing, high \ntech and industrial, from my State. And I am not reaching judgment on \nthe net effect.\n  Let's just say a word for the fact that there is a part of our \nnational character that, as Americans, is prepared to say we care so \nmuch about what is happening in another country, about the way that \ncountry is suppressing its people, or the threat that that country \nrepresents to our security because they are threatening their \nneighbors, who are our allies, or they are building missiles, that we \nare prepared, if our allies will not go along with us, to impose \neconomic sanctions on them to affect their behavior. In an age when a \nlot of people question, well, all we care about is materialism, I am \nspeaking respectfully of the impact of sanctions on people. This is in \nits way an expression of American idealism and principle and values. \nAnd while we may have overused it, we should not diminish its utility \nand its substance.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there is a very important question to ask: \nHave they worked? I think the record is mixed, but that is something I \nwould like to have our task force study and, at least as one Member, \nlearn more about. I don't know enough about it.\n  I know most people cite South Africa as a case where sanctions \nworked. Those were multilateral. More recently, sanctions we imposed on \nColombia did work to alter the fundamental policy of the Government on \nan issue that matters to us. We have sanctions against Iraq and Libya. \nWell, I note that the heads of those regimes worked mightily in \ninternational diplomatic circles to get the sanctions off, so they must \nbe having an effect on them. The same is true about the opposition of \nthe Chinese to sanctions that we consider, and the Russians with regard \nto supplying components of missile parts to Iran.\n  I know that Senator Lugar is not speaking against sanctions \ngenerally, and I appreciate that, and I share that view with him. We \nshare that view because we understand, I hope all of us, that sanctions \nhave value and have had effect. We are using them too much, but I think \nit requires more thought than we have had the opportunity to give \nbefore we vote on this amendment to change the ground rules so \ndramatically. So I intend to vote against the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote against tabling the Lugar \namendment. It is a useful starting point in bringing some \nrationalization to our sanctions policy.\n  I have been in the Senate for over 25 years. Over that time, I have \nsupported many sanctions laws, and even authored a few. But I am now \nre-examining my approach to sanctions policy. I do so not because I \noppose sanctions--sanctions are an important part of our foreign policy \narsenal.\n  But I believe we need to rethink our overall approach. Statutory \nsanctions, once imposed, are difficult to repeal, and they therefore do \nnot provide the President the flexibility that I believe he needs to \nconduct foreign policy. As we all know, it is easier to block \nlegislation than to pass it; accordingly, lifting a sanction to meet \nchanged circumstances is difficult, and sometimes impossible. I \nbelieve, therefore, that we have to start building into our sanctions \npolicy the necessary flexibility for the President to waive, modify, or \nterminate sanctions with the ability of the Congress to respond to his \nactions.\n  The Lugar bill is not perfect. It has a few provisions that I believe \nshould be changed or modified. For example, I do not believe it is wise \nto provide, as the amendment does in Section 806(c), for a point of \norder against legislation in cases where the Senate has not received \nrequired reports from the Executive Branch. This provision would \nconceivably permit the President to prevent consideration of a bill \nsimply by withholding the required report. In addition, I believe the \nbill should clearly exclude from the definition of ``sanction'' those \nmeasures taken to enforce criminal laws and those measures taken \npursuant to the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration to ban \nforeign airlines from flying to the United States which do not satisfy \nour safety standards. Finally, I believe the contract sanctity \nprovision is too broad, for two reasons. First, there may be cases \nwhere a multi-year option contract would render the sanction--at least \nas to that contract--a nullity. Second, there may be cases--a \nproliferation sanction comes to mind--where it may be in our national \nsecurity interest to stop the flow of technology immediately.\n  Despite these concerns about the Lugar amendment, I will vote against \nthe tabling motion. The bill is a good framework upon which we can \nbegin to construct a more rational sanctions policy, and I believe the \nSenate should continue to consider it further on this\n\n[[Page S8197]]\n\nbill. I did not offer amendments to perfect the amendment because it \nwas obvious that it was not going to be adopted and if it was it could \nbe perfected in conference. We will surely revisit this issue at which \ntime I'll have more to say.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nshare my views on the amendment of the Senator from Indiana which was \nvoted upon earlier this evening. I agree with those of my colleagues \nwho have argued that we have too many unilateral sanctions in place, \nmany of them mandated by Congress, and that often these sanctions fail \nto achieve the stated foreign policy objectives while hurting American \nbusiness and competitiveness. I support the overall objective of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Indiana--to provide a rational \nframework for the imposition of sanctions by both the Congress and the \nPresident. However, some aspects of this legislation concern me, in \nparticular the broad definition of the term ``unilateral economic \nsanction'' and the extensive process which is to be exhausted before \nsanctions are imposed.\n  I have always believed that sanctions are most effective when they \nare multilateral not unilateral, but I also recognize that there may be \ncircumstances in which we need the option of imposing sanctions \nunilaterally, for example to send a message of disapproval of a given \nregime as we did with respect to the military junta in Burma, or to \nrespond to a horrific event such as the use of force against those \nprotesting for democracy in Tiananmen Square in 1989. I recognize that \nthe legislation of the Senator from Indiana does not prevent us from \nimposing sanctions in these cases but I fear that the process in the \nbill would make it more difficult to do so expeditiously. In light of \nthese concerns and the fact that the Senate Task Force on Sanctions, of \nwhich I am a member, is trying to address the question of unilateral \nsanctions and is going to begin hearings later this month, I voted to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Indiana at this time. However, \nI believe there is much of worth in this legislation, and I would like \nto work with him and others who believe, as I do, that we must reign in \nthe tendency to address every foreign policy problem with a sanction.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say, at the rate we are \ngoing, we should be able to finish this bill by Saturday night a week \naround midnight. We have 64 amendments left. We have spent about 2\\1/2\\ \nhours on this one. A lot of the people on this side are going to the \nWhite House at 4:30, and I hoped we could get a vote on it before they \nhad to depart. I am always reluctant to suggest to anybody they cut \ntheir remarks short, and I guess we have already missed the 4:30 \ndeadline. I see two Senators who are just chomping to speak, so there \nis no point in asking for a time agreement at this point. But I just \nwant to make the Members aware, and I know I am joined by my \ndistinguished chairman in saying, we are going to have to do something \nto speed this process up or we are not going to get out before December \n1.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think the Senator from Arizona wants to propose a \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Alaska.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that John Rood be admitted to the floor \nduring the pendency of this amendment and other amendments on which he \nmay desire to be present under my supervision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will try to be brief. I recognize the \ntimeframe.\n  I think it is fair to recognize another thing though: That two-thirds \nof the world's population, or thereabouts, are under some type of \nsanctions or threatened sanction by the United States. I think the \nquestion we have to ask ourselves is, As we address the justification \nof sanctions, are we really helping the people we want to help?\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Lugar, for bringing this \nmatter up, because we can continue to debate it, we can continue to \nevaluate it, but the reality is, it is time to address the \neffectiveness of these sanctions. And, as a consequence, I rise to \nsupport the amendment of the Senator from Indiana on sanctions.\n  I think he is offering the amendment for one reason, which is because \nsanctions are now a popular choice to promote our agenda and, of \ncourse, legitimately protect our national interests. There is nothing \nwrong with this reasoning except many times sanctions simply do not \nwork in the manner that we have intended. They are one tool that we can \nuse against rogue nations--granted. The question is, How effective are \nsanctions? In what cases should they be used? Unfortunately, as I have \nindicated, the tool of choice is sanctions. Some suggest it is a hammer \nfor brain surgery.\n  In any event, it is time to take stock in whether this amendment by \nthe Senator from Indiana passes now or later. I think it is fair to say \nwe should take up this matter and resolve it and examine, if you will, \nthe posture of our policies.\n  Let me conclude with one reference that is in the amendment of the \nSenator from Indiana; that is, he sets guidelines before imposing \nsanctions. That is important, in his amendment. The amendment will \nrequire a check and balance. It will require information on the goals \nof the sanctions, the economic costs to the United States, the effect \non achieving other foreign policy goals, and whether other policy \noptions have been explored. It is kind of a cost-benefit risk analysis. \nI wish we could apply it to some of our environmental measures. That is \nwhat we are proposing here, and that is why I support the amendment of \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n  This amendment will require careful thought before imposing \nsanctions. It does not prohibit sanctions. Dozens of sanctions are now \npending before Congress. Sanctions, because they are the easy way out, \nhave become a knee jerk reaction.\n  Between 1914 and 1990 we imposed unilateral sanctions 116 times. \nBetween 1993 and 1996 alone we imposed unilateral sanctions 61 times on \n35 nations. In 1995 alone, it is estimated that sanctions cost the \nUnited States $20 billion in exports.\n  The President has declared a national emergency 16 times during his \nterm. In the case of Burma, the President invoked unilateral powers \nreserved to ``deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat.''\n  Is Burma an ``unusual and extraordinary threat'' to the national \nsecurity of the United States? I will go out on a limb and say perhaps \nno.\n  But that is the problem. The choice to use unilateral sanctions is \neasy. It is a choice made for the short term to appease special \ninterest groups. No thought is given to the chances of success or \npossible alternatives.\n  Will unilateral sanctions work in Burma--probably not! Will they hurt \nthe people we are trying to help--definitely so!\n  We must look to the long term.\n  I think a perfect example of this is Vietnam. Restoration of \ndiplomatic relations and the lifting of the trade embargo on U.S. \nexports led to progress on the MIA issue and greater economic freedoms \nin Vietnam.\n  The old saying that a rising tide lifts all boats is true.\n  When we decide on appropriate action to take against rogue countries, \nwe must make decisions based on what are the most persuasive actions \nrather than the easy way out.\n  I do not condone the policies of Iran, or Libya, or North Korea. All \nthese countries clearly pursue policies contrary to our national \ninterests.\n  But I believe it has come to the point where U.S. unilateral \nsanctions run the risk of being completely counterproductive because \nthey get in the way of more effective multilateral steps that could be \npursued.\n  Unilateral sanctions should be a tool of last resort and only used \nafter careful thought about the consequences, the costs, and the \nchances of success. I urge my colleagues to support Senator\n\n[[Page S8198]]\n\nLugar. Implementing sanctions should not be based on emotion but on a \nrational process. This is what this amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will also keep my statement very short.\n  Mr. President, I also strongly support Senator Lugar's amendment to \ninclude the Enhancement of Trade, Security and Human Rights through \nSanctions Reform Act to the agriculture appropriations. Consistent with \nour commitment yesterday to help American farmers, I believe this is \nthe appropriate time to consider this important amendment that will \nhelp us think about the consequences of unilateral sanctions before \nthey are imposed, either by the Congress or by the President.\n  As you have heard, this amendment does not prohibit the Congress or \nthe administration from imposing Unilateral sanctions, but it forces us \nto think before we act. It is easy to look like we are combatting \nvarious problems such as human rights abuses, religious persecution, \nnuclear proliferation, child labor, etcetera, by imposing unilateral \nsanctions. But it is not so easy to determine the negative effect they \nwill have. It is my opinion that unilateral sanctions do not work. They \ndo not force countries to adopt our policies, or our standards. \nTherefore, they wind up doing nothing but hurting our American farmers \nand workers who lose export opportunities to the affected nations.\n  Senator Lugar's amendment, which I have also cosponsored in its bill \nform, establishes procedures by which we can analyze the impact of the \nsanctions--first, whether they----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. GRAMS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to notify the Senate that at \n6 o'clock I shall seek the floor to move to table the Lugar amendment. \nI think it is a vote that must be taken to see where the votes are on \nthis amendment. If it is not tabled, then it will still be open to \namendment, but hopefully we might be able to work something out to see \nin what shape we would agree to take the Lugar amendment to conference \nand have a vote on whatever the Senator wants. But I do expect to make \na motion to table the Lugar amendment at 6 o'clock. I ask cloakrooms \nnotify their respective sides of that.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Just to briefly finish my statement today, I believe the \nLugar amendment will help to establish procedures by which we can \nanalyze the impact of these sanctions. That is first by whether \nthey will accomplish the intended purpose, and second, the impact they \nhave on U.S. international competitiveness and other foreign policy \ngoals.\n\n  This amendment is also flexible. The President can waive the \nprovisions of this amendment in an emergency, and the amendment does \nnot affect existing sanctions. It also does not apply to multilateral \nsanctions.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this, to support this \namendment which will help us determine whether a particular unilateral \nsanction will work or whether we should pursue the problem in another \nway. If unilateral sanctions are imposed, we need to ensure they will \nwork and they are initiated only as a last resort, and only after \nmultilateral sanctions are pursued.\n  Again, I thank Senator Lugar for his leadership on this important \nissue. For those of us concerned about the growing trend toward \nunilateral sanctions without analyzing whether they will work or how \nthey will affect our farmers and workers, I think this is a no-brainer. \nThis is an amendment that should have no opposition from this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am sure when my colleague just referred to \na ``no-brainer,'' that no one would be in opposition to it, he wasn't \nsuggesting there is not a logical, reasonable argument in opposition to \nthe amendment, and I would like to again try to make that and urge my \ncolleague, if he would like, to engage in any kind of colloquy he would \nlike to clarify what I have to say, to at least assure him that there \nis a reasonable argument on the other side.\n  I want to begin by commending Senator Lugar for identifying many of \nthe things which ought to be done with respect to the imposition of \nsanctions in his amendment. He has a lot of good material in this \namendment. I know he has given it a lot of thought. I think, at the end \nof the day, we will be able to accept a lot of that.\n  Mr. President, I also believe there are some things that are not \nadequately thought out here. I would like to focus on a few of those. \nOne of the things I am pleased with is a very broad definition of \nnational emergency, which would permit the President to essentially \nwaive the requirements of the legislation in the event of a national \nemergency, which is very, very broadly defined here. In one sense, that \nis good. But in another sense, all of the good that we are trying to \nachieve here could be easily undone, simply because the President \ndecided to go forward and waive in the interests of national security. \nIf the national security definition were a little tighter, then what we \nare seeking to accomplish here could probably be done, and the \nPresident would not be able to undo it easily through the invocation of \na national emergency waiver.\n  So I want to begin this part of the debate by acknowledging that some \nof what the Senator from Indiana is seeking to do clearly is going to \ngain wide acceptance here. In some cases, we are not going to want to \nlet the President easily get out from underneath these requirements, \nwhich the definition of national emergency, in my view, would allow him \nto do.\n  I also want to begin by making a point that one of my colleagues \nmade, and that is to establish bona fides with respect to this. I have \nbeen getting a lot of calls from commercial associations seeking \nsupport for this, in the name of free trade. I have always supported \nfast track and do to this day, and I hope we will take fast track up \nagain this year and pass it. I have supported GATT. I have supported \nNAFTA. I will proudly call myself a free trader, too. So my comments \nare not made from the perspective of someone who has not supported \ntrade. In terms of business support, I certainly provided that.\n  But we also have a national security obligation as Members of the \nSenate, and what I do not see adequately addressed in this amendment is \nthe careful balancing between support for economic considerations on \nthe one hand, and national security on the other. Those interests have \nto be very carefully calibrated. I think, with some additional work on \nthe amendment of the Senator, we might be able to help achieve that \ncalibration, but not if we have to vote on that today.\n  Third, I mentioned the definitions problems, and I would like to get \ninto that in detail now. I would like to read from the amendment of the \nSenator, the very first definition of what we are talking about when we \ntalk about a unilateral economic sanction. Here is the definition. I am \nquoting:\n\n       The term ``unilateral economic sanction'' means any \n     prohibition, restriction or condition on economic activity, \n     including economic assistance, with respect to a foreign \n     country or foreign entity. . .\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n  That means foreign aid, for example. So before we do a foreign aid \nbill here, are we going to have to go through the requirements of this \nlegislation? Before we reduce a country's foreign aid, is the President \ngoing to have to give the Federal Register notice for 45 days? Is the \nCongress going to have to wait for 45 days before we can reduce that \naid? Is that reduction going to be in force only 2 years and then we \nwould have to revisit it? Something as simple as foreign aid--we raise \nand lower a country's foreign aid every year for lots of different \nreasons.\n  We may apply a little more money to the foreign aid budget and be \nable to increase aid, or we may reduce it and have to increase aid. It \nhas nothing to do with whether we are trying to sanction somebody or \npunish somebody or prohibit trade. Yet, that would be implicated \nbecause of the breadth of the definition of ``economic sanction'' \ncontained in the legislation.\n  What about some of the other actions that we may take? I mentioned \nbefore export controls on sensitive U.S. technology. I think it is \nabsolutely incredible that restrictions of U.S. trade,\n\n[[Page S8199]]\n\ntechnical assistance, or any other way in which the United States would \nprovide assistance to another country with respect to sensitive matters \nwould be deemed subject to the requirements of this legislation.\n  This legislation may well be appropriate for the kind of sanctions \nthat we would apply against a country that doesn't agree with us on a \nparticular human rights policy, for example, or something of that sort \nor perhaps with whom we have a trade dispute. But it certainly should \nnot apply to the limitations that this country imposes upon U.S. \nbusinesses wanting to transfer technology to another country. There are \ngood and sufficient reasons we have an entire regime of export controls \nin place.\n  To show just exactly how far this legislation goes--and I think this \nis critical before Senators vote in favor of this amendment--they had \nbetter understand the following: We have just had exposed a tremendous \ntechnology transfer to the country of China that occurred because a \ncouple of U.S. companies may--may; they are under investigation for \nit--allegedly have violated U.S. law with respect to technology \ntransfer.\n  When a missile blew up and destroyed a satellite, information was \nprovided to the country of China. That may have been in violation of \nU.S. law. It may well have compromised our national security. Yet, the \nkind of things that we impose upon companies that are going to do \nbusiness with a country like China to limit the transfer of that highly \nsensitive technology would be implicated because of the breadth of the \ndefinition of this legislation.\n  Would we be able to limit the kind of technology transfer that has \ngone on to China that we are trying to stem?\n  Would we be able to require defense monitors to accompany this \nequipment?\n  Would we be able to preclude reports being issued to the Chinese \nGovernment on what went wrong with a particular launch?\n  Would we be able to require an export license for the kind of \nsatellites being exported here or the kind of technology that is being \ntransferred in aid of the launch of U.S. satellites to make sure the \nrockets themselves don't blow up?\n  Would we be precluded from putting those kind of technology transfers \non a munitions list?\n  Would we be precluded from requiring reviews by the Justice \nDepartment?\n  This morning I talked with the Attorney General in a hearing of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and I said, ``Even though you had this \nmatter under direct investigation, pending investigation, and Sandy \nBerger, the National Security Adviser, was advised that it could \nsignificantly adversely impact the judicial process of the prosecution \nof people who would be indicted for having possibly violated the law, \nfor the President to grant a subsequent waiver, notwithstanding that \nthe President granted the waiver,'' and I asked the Attorney General, \n``did you object to that in any formal way?''\n  She said, ``No, there is nothing in the law today that permits or \nrequires that, and there is not even any procedure for that.''\n  I said, ``Do you think there should be?''\n  Her answer was, ``We are working right now on recommendations that \nwould get the Justice Department into the loop here.''\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is that with regard to the transfer \nof highly sensitive technology that could jeopardize the national \nsecurity of the United States, we do impose limitations, and as I read \nthe definition of ``unilateral economic sanction,'' many of the kind of \nactivities in which we engage here would be implicated by this \ndefinition.\n  I know, or at least I firmly believe, that the Senator from Indiana \nwould not want to jeopardize our national security and that it would \nnot be his intention to have that kind of technology transfer limited, \nor the limitations on that kind of technology transfer limited by his \namendment. Yet, as I read his amendment, that is exactly what occurs, \nbecause, again, the definition is:\n\n       Any prohibition, restriction or condition on economic \n     activity.\n\n  Clearly, all of the things that we imposed on Loral and on Hughes are \nrestrictions and conditions on their economic activity with China, and \nfor a good reason: to prevent the transfer of technology that we think \nmight harm our national security.\n  Are we saying today, are we willing to vote for an amendment that \nessentially says, with respect to that kind of condition, we are going \nto treat that as a sanction and we are going to put all kind of \nlimitations on whether or not it can be done?\n\n  One of the answers is, ``Well, there's a section in here that permits \nthe President to waive any of this if there is a national security \ninterest involved in that case.''\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that we simply ought to make an initial \ndetermination that there are certain kind of things that we do not deem \nto be economic unilateral sanctions and they ought to be excluded in \nthe legislation in the first instance, because otherwise we are going \nto have an extraordinarily cumbersome procedure where thousands of \nthings that this Government does, in either the executive or the \nlegislative branch, from foreign aid decisions of the Congress to \nhighly sensitive national security technology transfer limitations, are \ngoing to be deemed to be sanctions that have to go through the \nprocesses of review and delay and sunset, and so on, of this \nlegislation, or else be exempted by a waiver that the President would \nthen have to specifically invoke with respect to each one of those \nparticular actions.\n  That doesn't make sense. That is why I say this one-size-fits-all \nkind of approach is not the right approach. The kind of things the \nSenator from Indiana should be dealing with are a fairly narrow range \nof economic activities and limitations on those activities that either \nthe President or the Congress has imposed in the past but that don't \nhave anything to do with foreign aid, that don't have anything to do \nwith national security technical assistance limitations and the like.\n  That is the third point I want to make.\n  I should also note that there are other things that could be deemed \nconditions or restrictions on economic activity, like denials of visas, \ncuts in taxpayer-funded export credits such as from OPIC or Eximbank. \nAre those things implicated by this? I think clearly they are. Is that \nthe intent of the Senator from Indiana? And, if so, how are we going to \nget around those with a national security waiver? There are some things \nthat I don't think we want this to apply to for which the national \nsecurity waiver isn't going to be available. There, again, the one-\nsize-fits-all approach to this just isn't going to work.\n  I will conclude this third point by reiterating what I said before. \nOne of the things the Senator from Indiana is trying to do here is to \nbe sure, before we invoke sanctions, we think it through, we analyze \nthe impact, and we have a set of standards by which to measure whether \nit is effective or not and we have a mechanism for ending the sanction \nthat forces us to, in effect, focus on whether or not it has been \neffective and we want to continue it or not.\n  All of those are valid propositions. My guess is, before we are done \nwith this, that kind of approach will be adopted by the Senate. I am \nnot arguing against those things, but what I am doing is reiterating \nthe argument of the Senator from Connecticut, the Senator from \nKentucky, and expanding on a point that I made earlier, and that is \nthat just as we are getting into this issue with the first meeting of \nthe sanctions task force--a bipartisan task force--yesterday to \nidentify exactly what we want to cover by the kind of reforms and \nothers that the Senator from Indiana is proposing, just as we are \nbeginning this process, we have placed on the desk an amendment that is \ngoing to do it all and do it with a definition that is so broad that it \nwould cover virtually any condition or limitation on economic activity. \nThat is not, I think, what the sanctions task force views as the proper \napproach.\n  I urge my colleagues to slow this process down just a little bit. We \ndon't have to have this amendment on this appropriations bill today. I \nam sure that if the Senator from Indiana will work with us, if there is \ndeemed to be a necessity to put something in place fairly soon, and \ncertainly before the end of this legislative year, we can come up with \na good set of criteria,\n\n[[Page S8200]]\n\nsuch as those the Senator has in his bill, for imposing sanctions--a \ngood review process, some mechanisms for revisiting the sanctions after \na point in time to ensure we still want them in place. All of those \nthings that Senator Lugar's amendment goes to I think we can include in \na piece of legislation. But I also think we are going to want to take a \nlook at these definitions carefully and modify them to some extent so \nin one case it does not go too far and embrace just too many things, \nand in another case it perhaps does not go far enough.\n\n  Finally, I will close with this point, Mr. President. Sanctions--and \nbecause of the breadth of the definition of sanctions here, I think we \nare literally talking about any kind of action the United States might \ntake--can be in response to all kinds of different things.\n  We have the Jackson-Vanik sanctions that were imposed upon the Soviet \nUnion when it would not allow the immigration of Jews from the Soviet \nUnion. We have sanctions that were imposed on South Africa to try to \nchange that country's behavior. We have sanctions that were imposed \nupon the Soviet Union after it invaded Afghanistan. We have sanctions \nin aid of various treaties or agreements that are hard to enforce \nunless you can impose some kind of sanction. The NPT, Non-Proliferation \nTreaty, and other kinds of treaties that we have signed, some \nbilateral, some multilateral, have to provide some kind of enforcement.\n  As Senator Lieberman pointed out, you do not want to have to turn to \nthe military option right off. So all you have are economic or \ndiplomatic activities. Now, diplomatic activities sometimes work; \nsometimes they do not. They more frequently work if you have some other \nkind of hammer behind it, like a military or economic card to play. \nWhat it boils down to is that an economic limitation can sometimes be \nvery important. But I do not think we ought to blame sanctions \nnecessarily when things do not go right.\n  The best example of a failed policy is one which we have all dealt \nwith here very recently, and that is the automatic sanctions that were \nimposed upon India and Pakistan--for doing what?--for nuclear testing.\n  Mr. President, I submit that the problem here is not sanctions per \nse. The problem is that the policy that was put in place was a failed \npolicy to begin with, and to attach sanctions as the only way to \nrespond to that was simply wrong. Congress was in error for doing that. \nWe are now rushing to correct that error. But we are doing it in the \nwrong way.\n  Let us understand that the problem with the sanctions on India and \nPakistan go back to the fact that as a nation we should have recognized \nthat, just like China, Russia, and France, these nations are going to \ndo what they think is in their best national interest, which may \ninclude testing nuclear weapons, and that they are going to do that \nirrespective of world opinion or economic sanctions. Their own internal \ncountry opinion was more important to them.\n  In both cases, they were willing to suffer the consequences \neconomically that might result from sanctions being imposed. In fact, I \nthink in both countries there was a certain sense of pride that they \ndid this and that they could stand up to the rest of the world. So for \nus to have had to impose economic sanctions was folly. It was never \ngoing to work. These countries were going to do what they felt was in \ntheir best interest, and we were not going to be able to stop them with \neconomic sanctions.\n  All we did was hurt a couple of countries that have been friendly to \nthe United States--in the case of Pakistan, a country that is really \nhurting economically. And the last thing I think we really wanted to do \nis hurt the people of Pakistan with these sanctions; nor did we want to \nhurt our own country's agricultural interests. The problem was not \nsanctions per se. The problem was in ever thinking that we could, by \nthe use of something like sanctions, prevent them from doing what \ninevitably they were going to do.\n  Let us not blame sanctions; let us blame a failed policy embraced by \nthe U.S. Congress. Sanctions sometimes do work; and, as Senator \nMcConnell said, sometimes they do not work. Our record has been \ninconsistent in this regard. I know that is one of the things that \nSenator Lugar is trying to address here. But that should animate our \nthinking here--not that sanctions are per se wrong and, therefore, they \nhave to be used only in very, very limited situations, and so on, as \nsome of the language in this amendment suggests. I agree with that as a \ngeneral proposition.\n  We ought to be careful how we use sanctions because in some cases \nthey are never going to be effective because the underlying policy is \nnot a valid policy. But by the same token, in the interest of \nsatisfying our commercial constituents, I do not think we should rush \nto judgment here and literally throw out the baby with the bathwater by \nmaking it very difficult to impose or retain sanctions in the future \nwhen, in point of fact, there are certain areas, like national \nsecurity, for example, where we very definitely want to have conditions \nor limitations on economic activity--the definition in the bill--that \nhave nothing to do with the ordinary understanding of sanctions.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleague from Indiana to withhold for a \nfew days or a few hours or some point in time where we can sit down and \ntry to rework the definitions and rework some of the other language so \nthat we are not applying a one-size-fits-all solution to what is, as \nSenator Lieberman pointed out, a very complex situation.\n\n  We were going to address this through the task force and take quite a \nbit of time to do it. If there is any reason to rush to judgment here, \nlet us at least take enough time to narrow what we are doing and try to \nmake it apply in a fairly restricted way to achieve whatever short-\nrange objective we have here until we have time to think it through \nmore thoroughly to impose a policy that would cover all of the \ndifferent kinds of limitations that, as a country, we may wish to \nimpose.\n  Mr. President, I urge that this amendment not be supported, that if a \nmotion is made by Senator Stevens, that we support that motion, and \nthat we not consider the amendment at this time. I certainly, as a \nmember of the sanctions task force, will work with Senator Lugar to try \nto take many of the good ideas he has in this legislation and pull them \ninto a bill I think all of us can support at the appropriate time.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, may I inquire as to the parliamentary \nsituation on the floor? The intention of the Senator from Nevada is to \noffer an amendment, of which I have alerted the manager. If there is a \npending amendment, if I could be so advised, I will make the necessary \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a pending amendment to be laid aside.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I see the chairman of the committee is rising. I would \ncertainly yield to him.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I ask the Senator a question. If it is just a \nparliamentary procedure, I have no objection if it is a \nnoncontroversial amendment, because I would like to help the bill \nproceed. But I want us to move toward the conclusion of the debate on \nmy amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Responding to the inquiry of my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Indiana, I wish I could represent to the Senator that this was \nnoncontroversial. In this Senator's judgment, it ought to be. But \nfairness requires me to say, this is an amendment which has been before \nthe Senate on many occasions dealing with the Market Access Program. It \nis controversial. I was under the impression that we could lay the \npending amendment aside and consider it, but if the chairman has a \nconcern about that, it is not my purpose to interrupt the orderly flow \nof the processing of this appropriations bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8201]]\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, Senator Lugar desires to make further \nremarks in support of his amendment, and we hope the Chair will \nrecognize him for that purpose. Any other Senators who want to speak on \nthat amendment should do so now, because there is the plan that has \npreviously been announced that Senator Stevens will move to table the \nLugar amendment at 6 o'clock. We will have a vote on that motion to \ntable. But if Senators have completed their remarks on the Lugar \namendment, then we could set that amendment aside, if the 6 o'clock \nhour has not yet arrived, and have other amendments debated. That would \nbe our hope.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, during this debate on the pending \namendment, three arguments have been made. I want to respond to them \nbriefly. One came about through Senators suggesting that the President \nof the United States, who just today proposed sanctions on certain \nfirms in Russia and pertaining to Iranian missile transfers, would not \nhave had the ability to impose those sanctions if the amendment that we \nare debating had been the law of the land.\n  Later, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, after a careful \nreading of the legislation, noted that on page 30 of the amendment--\nthis is the language: ``The President may waive any of the requirements \nof subsections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e)''--and so forth--in the event \nthat the President determines there exists a national emergency that \nrequires the exercise of the waiver.\n  I made that point in an earlier presentation, but I simply wanted to \nreiterate there are emergency situations regarding the national \nsecurity of this country. The President must have the ability to act. \nOur legislation expressly gives him that waiver ability.\n  Then the distinguished Senator from Arizona raised the question as to \nwhether, in fact, that waiver might be too broad. Perhaps. But, you \ncannot have it both ways. If on one hand you argue that the President \nof the United States is constricted in terms of what he may do, but \nthen you find out he has full ability to do it, I suppose you could \nthen argue that you do not want to have full ability at that point.\n  Let me just offer a moment of reassurance. On the same page 30 of the \namendment, there is a section setting up a Sanctions Review Committee \nin the executive branch. It reads:\n\n       There is established within the executive branch of \n     Government an inter-agency committee, which shall be known as \n     the Sanctions Review Committee, which shall have the \n     responsibility of coordinating United States policy regarding \n     unilateral economic sanctions and of providing appropriate \n     recommendations to the President prior to any decision \n     regarding the implementation of a unilateral economic \n     sanction.\n\n  Now, that committee is composed of the Secretaries of State, \nTreasury, Defense, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, and so forth.\n  The point being that the President of the United States should be \nwell advised before he decides on a unilateral waiver for even national \nemergency purposes.\n  I suspect that this could be perfected further, but during the course \nof the debate on this legislation I simply note that many Members--and \nthis is understandable--say this is very complex matter and we need \nmore time to walk around it, try to think through the national security \nimplications, the ability of the players to deal with this \nsuccessfully.\n  I point out, respectfully, that my original legislation on which this \nis based was introduced last October. This has been widely discussed in \nthis city for many months. It is supported by 37 Senators explicitly \nwho have thought through all the implications of this and have studied \nit at some length.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I respond to the argument that the India and \nPakistan incidents are the reason we are discussing this. As I recall, \nthe distinguished Senator from Arizona pointed out we have resolved \nsome of those problems and, therefore, it may be premature to move on \nto other problems. But, in fact, India and Pakistan had not gone \nthrough their nuclear testing regimes last October.\n  The problem that has to come back to this body is that of the \nAmerican farmers--the gist of the overall agriculture appropriation \nbill--need some hope that this body understands the effect of economic \nsanctions on agriculture. The USA*Engage group, composed of some 675 \nbusinesses, including the American Farm Bureau, have strongly \nencouraged this body to understand the problems faced by American \nbusiness.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, \nstated it well: American business is not a special interest. It is not \na nefarious group of people with whom we should have no contact as we \ntalk about national security or economic security. American business \nand American farmers provide the money that gives us the ability to \nprovide security to this Nation. These are the people who actually are \nout there working and providing jobs. They are saying to us: You folks \nwith all of your sanctions are creating unemployment for 200,000 \nAmericans. That number of people are losing their jobs because of what \nis occurring in the sanctions regime.\n  Of course, we have to be considerate of each and every aspect of \nmaking certain that national security is not compromised. It would be a \nstretch to think of many of these sanctions that have had a substantial \nnational security implication to begin with.\n  I suspect, finally, there has to be a balancing of interests in our \ncountry. Even as we are deeply concerned about democratic procedures in \nother countries, about religious procedures in other countries, about \neconomic procedures in other countries, we ought to weigh and we ought \nto have a procedure in which we say we are going to impose a sanction \non some country and take the time to state why, and then take time to \nsay, ``What would be considered a success? How would we know we have \nvictory? What are the benchmarks of our success?'' At least once a \nyear, we should think about what the sanction did. Did it make any \ndifference? Did it make a difference in American jobs and income that \nwas totally disproportionate to whatever the impact might have been, in \nthe target country?\n  Now, that is what my amendment calls for--however you weave the \nargument around it, the need to state the purpose of what we are doing, \nthe benchmarks of success, to examine periodically whether we have hit \nthe mark even remotely, and, in any event, to estimate the cost of \nsanctions to Americans. It really is time to think about Americans, \npeople in this country, farmers, producers, even as we are spinning \nwheels of economic sanctions for whatever economic purpose we might \nthink of.\n  From the beginning--and I think everyone has heard this clearly--we \nare talking about sanctions in the future, prospective sanctions. I \nhope Senators understand that. But that is the case.\n  Secondly, we are talking about unilateral sanctions which we do \nourselves that hurt us, that have no cooperation from others, with \nevery other country grabbing our markets, entering in to eat our lunch. \nWe have prescribed any number of ways in which people in this Congress \nand the administration have to think about it, and at the same time \ngiving the President, as our Commander in Chief, the ability in terms \nof our security, to act if he must.\n  Finally, we have said after 2 years the sanction comes to an end \nunless the Congress reauthorizes it. That is, take some more time to \nthink about what has occurred, what the implications and the costs for \nAmericans have been.\n  I am hopeful this amendment will not be tabled. I regret that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee feels he must do \nthat at 6 o'clock, but I understand the expeditious procedure of this \nbill, and it is an important bill, has to go on. I hope Senators will \nvote against tabling the amendment when that time comes, about an hour \nfrom now, because I think that a vote against tabling sends a signal of \nhope to American farmers that we care, and we had better send that \nsignal.\n  I hope Senators understand that we have a difficult situation in \nAmerican agriculture, not because of the farm bill but because demand \nfrom Asia is down and demand from other countries will be coming down \nas their income is constricted. We will need all of our\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\nweapons of trade in order to meet that, and the same eventually will \noccur to other industries.\n  I stress agriculture today, Mr. President, because that is the first \nwave. That is where the first implications of economic downturn have \ncome, with raw materials and food. But it will spread unless we are \nsuccessful in adopting a new trade strategy that must surely include \ngreater thoughtfulness about sanctions.\n  Therefore, I call for a new regime of thoughtfulness--not a \nprohibition of sanctions, not a breach of international or national \nsecurity, but a thoughtful approach, giving full latitude to the \nCommander in Chief and, hopefully, better latitude to us, to think \nthrough what we are doing and to do it more correctly and positively.\n  I conclude by saying, as I recall, the distinguished Senator from \nArizona was asking a hypothetical situation whether as to whether the \nPresident could act or not, I think I have answered the question that \nhe could have acted on today's sanction. But let's say that the \nPresident acts, or the Congress acts; how do we know in advance that \nthis is going to have any particular effect? The answer is that we \ndon't. As a matter of fact, in most cases, the effect has been dismal, \ninappropriate, and costly to the United States and to our citizens.\n  So I say that the President of the United States has the full ability \nto act, but whether he will act appropriately is another question. And \nthat is why even the President is asked to consult with his Cabinet, \nand why we are asked to consult with each other--in the hope that if we \ndo adopt a sanction, it will do some good, that it will have some \nwisdom behind it, some rationale and some procedure that the American \npeople can follow. I submit, Mr. President, that many of the sanctions \nwe have adopted have not had that wisdom, that procedure, and they have \nnot had a very good effect.\n  It is for this reason that I ask the support of Senators for this \namendment and the support, particularly, on the vote to table. I am \nhopeful that that tabling motion will not be adopted when that moment \ncomes.\n  Mr. President, I thank all Senators for allowing us to have this full \ndebate. I appreciate that there are many other issues that should come \nbefore the body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the premise of the amendment proposed by \nthe distinguished Senator from Indiana is that--as President Clinton \nrecently put it--the United States has gone ``sanctions happy.'' We've \nall heard the statistics, repeated without question by the media, that \nthe United States has enacted sanctions 61 times in just 4 years, \nthereby placing 42% of the world's population under the oppressive yoke \nof U.S. sanctions.\n  Well, it just ain't so.\n  I've examined these so-called statistics. And I've found that they \nare fabricated. The ``61-sanctions'' figure, which came from a study by \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, and circulate widely by an \nanti-sanctions business coalition calling itself ``USA Engage.''\n  The NAM claims that, over a 4 year period (1993 through 1996) ``61 \nU.S. laws and executive actions were enacted authorizing unilateral \neconomic sanctions for foreign policy purposes.'' According to NAM, \nthese sanctions have targeted 35 countries, over 2.3 billion people \n(42% of the world's population) and $790 billion--19% of the world's \ntotal--in export markets.\n  NAM lists a catalogue of 20 new laws passed by Congress and 41 \nExecutive Branch actions for a total of 61 new sanctions in just 4 \nyears.\n  The ``61 sanctions'' figure cries out for examination. I asked the \nCongressional Research Service to analyze the NAM claim. After \nexamining the NAM study, CRS reported to me, ``We could not defensibly \nsubdivide or catagorize the entries in the (NAM) catalogue so that they \nadd up to 61.''\n  How did NAM come up with this 61-sanctions claim? Here's how:\n  The National Association of Manufacturers includes as examples of \n``unilateral economic sanctions'' every time the U.S. complied with \nU.N. Security Council sanctions--which are, by definition, multilateral \nsanctions;\n  The NAM used double-, triple- and quadruple-counts certain sanctions;\n  They included as a so-called ``sanction'' any executive branch or \nCongressional actions denying, limiting or even conditioning U.S. \nforeign aid. (Since when, I ask, did foreign aid become an \nentitlement?)\n  The NAM lists as sanctions instances where no sanctions were actually \nimposed, cases sanctions were actually lifted, and cases where \nsanctions were imposed briefly and then lifted.\n  The NAM piled into their ``sanctions'' list any decision to bar the \nsale of lethal military equipment to terrorist states, and various \nactions which affect just a single corporate entity or individuals--not \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, this is not what most of us have in mind when we think \nof ``sanctions.'' We think of trade bans and embargoes on states--not \nseizing the assets of Colombian drug traffickers, blocking imports from \na single factory in southern China which is using prison labor, or \nbanning the sale of lethal equipment to states which arm and train \nterrorists.\n  The fact is, there is no credible way to argue that the U.S. has \nimposed 61 sanctions in just four years, or that anywhere near 42% of \nthe world's population has been targeted by U.S. sanctions. In other \nwords, there is no basis for the claim that we in Congress have gone \n``sanctions happy'' or for the problem that the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Indiana proposes to fix.\n  But don't take my word for it. The staff of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations has prepared a document which analyzes the NAM study and \nexposes its failings. I now ask uninanimous consent that this analysis \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       The NAM study charges that Congress enacted 20 new \n     sanctions laws between 1993 and 1996. This is a deliberate \n     falsehood.\n       In reality, three-quarters of this total (15) were denials, \n     restrictions or conditions on U.S. foreign aid, included as \n     part of normal Foreign Operations and Defense Appropriations \n     legislation.\n       What were these so-called sanctions? One so-called sanction \n     is a prohibition on aid to foreign governments that export \n     lethal military equipment to countries supporting \n     international terrorism. Another barred U.S. assistance for \n     military or police training in Haiti to those involved in \n     drug trafficking and human rights violations. Another placed \n     conditions on assistance for the Palestinian Liberation \n     Organization. Another prohibited Defense Department aid to \n     any country designated as supporting international terrorism.\n       Another withheld foreign aid and directed U.S. to vote \n     ``no'' on loans in international financial institutions for \n     countries knowingly granting sanctuary to persons indicted by \n     the international war crimes tribunals for the former \n     Yugoslavia and Rwanda, for the purpose of evading \n     prosecution.\n       Are these the kinds of ``objectionable'' and \n     ``irresponsible'' actions Congress needs to reign in? I think \n     not. Indeed, of the 20 congressional actions listed by NAM, \n     in reality only 5 can really be called ``sanctions laws.'' \n     These are: The Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act (April \n     30, 1994); the LIBERTAD (Helms-Burton) Law (March 12, 1996); \n     the Anti-Terrorism & Effective Death Penalty Act (April 24, \n     1996); the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (August 5, 1996); and the \n     Burma Sanctions (September 30, 1996--part of FY97 Foreign \n     Operations Appropriations Act).\n       The fact is, Congress has passed a handful of carefully \n     crafted, highly-targeted sanctions in recent years--most of \n     which passed the Senate by comfortable margins.\n\n\n                         executive actions (41)\n\n       And what about NAM's claim of 41 ``Executive Actions'' \n     implementing sanctions in just four years? This list is also \n     deceiving. Consider the following breakdown of the NAM list:\n\n\n               multiple counting of the same sanctions: 7\n\n       The NAM study double-, triple- and quadruple-counts the \n     same sanctions over and over again on seven different \n     occasions.\n       Cuba--Same Sanctions Counted 2 Times. (NAM counts the \n     LIBERTAD (Helms-Burton) law as two separate sanctions, once \n     on the date it was enacted by Congress (in Table I) and a \n     second time when the President took measures to implement \n     Title III of the act.)\n       Sudan--Same Sanctions Counted 5 Times.

Then I \nwill move to table the Bryan amendment and we will have a vote on that. \nThat is the plan of action.\n  With that, and if there is no objection, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Lugar amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8204]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 60, strike lines 4 through 11 and insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 717. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to provide assistance under, or to pay the salaries \n     of personnel who carry out, a market promotion or market \n     access program pursuant to section 203 of the Agricultural \n     Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5623).\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to make some general observations. \nThis is an area that I have had an interest in for a number of years. \nWe have debated it many times on the floor, and I say to my friends \nfrom the agricultural heartland of America that I am not unmindful that \nin some of the agricultural regions of our country, there is real \neconomic crisis out there, particularly in the plains States.\n  I am not unsympathetic to the concerns of farmers. Indeed, I intend \nto be supportive of many of the amendments that will be offered to \nprovide assistance to farmers who face real economic crises for a \nvariety of reasons, many of which I suggest have probably been debated \non the floor during the course of this appropriations bill.\n  Having said that, I want to talk about a program that, in my \njudgment, provides no real help to America's farmers or agricultural \nproducers and, instead, continues to subsidize some of the largest \ncorporations in America in terms of their advertising dollars. I \nbelieve this is a wholly inappropriate use of taxpayer dollars. As I \nwill point out during the course of this discussion, the analysis of \nthe Market Access Program by the General Accounting Office, just \nreleased, is a definitive analysis of the efficacy of this program.\n  Notwithstanding those who have advocated on its behalf and those who \ncontinue to defend it, the GAO report reveals that in spite of repeated \nattempts to make this program accountable, no credible evidence could \nbe found to support the claims that the Market Access Program benefits \nthe economy. That is why a broad range of organizations have been \njoined in opposition. These are groups that cover the political \nspectrum, from right to left. Among them are: Americans for Tax Reform, \nCapital Watch, the Cato Institute, Citizens Against Government Waste, \nCitizens for a Sound Economy, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, \nFriends of the Earth, the National Taxpayers Union, Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. All of these \norganizations have called for the elimination of this program. Many of \nthese organizations have joined together in a ``stop corporate \nwelfare'' effort that named the Market Access Program among a select \ngroup of the most blatant of Federal handouts.\n  The Green Scissors report, which recommends cutting programs that \nhurt both taxpayers and the environment, has also cited the Market \nAccess Program as a waste of money.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list I have be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       LIST OF COMPANIES IN BRANDED BUDGETED DOLLAR ORDER FOR 1997      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Participant                                    Budget 1997 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nE. & J.

Mr. President, it is just not outside groups that are \ncalling for the elimination of this program. The Market Access Program \nwas specifically targeted for elimination in the fiscal year 1999 \nRepublican budget resolution. This provision was included in the \nlegislation passed on the Senate floor by a vote of 57-41 on April 2 of \nthis year.\n  Unfortunately, however, like Lazarus, this program seems to rise from \nthe dead every year and is currently authorized to receive some $90 \nmillion in fiscal year 1999.\n  The Foreign Agricultural Service, FAS, is a branch of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, and it distributes this $90 million that has \npreviously been authorized in three different categories. One is a \ndirect contribution to private companies. Two is a contribution that is \nmade to industry associations which, in turn, makes grants to members \nwithin that association. And the third category is cooperatives. These \nmoneys are frequently used for the promotion of brand-name products, \nspecifically identified household names in America, as well as generic \ncommodities overseas.\n  So we have private companies that receive money directly from the \nfunding source--industry associations and cooperatives.\n  In spite of numerous reforms that we have debated and enacted in \nrecent years in efforts to limit the aid provided to giant \ncorporations, millions of dollars continue to flow to large, well-\nestablished producers, agribusinesses to subsidize their advertising \nbudget.\n  Let me again make the point.\n  As part of the ongoing debate that we have had annually on this \nprogram, we have been able to persuade the Congress that with respect \nto the direct contributions made to private companies that are \nproviding some of the largest organizations and companies in the world \nwith money to supplement their advertising accounts, it simply cannot \nbe defended and is an outrageous use of taxpayer dollars. So we created \na small business category that is eligible to receive the private \ncompany distributions. That is currently part of the law.\n  But that only tells part of the story, because as you will see, the \ntop recipients of the Market Access Program--this is the specific brand \nof the product that you can see here--continue to be some of the \nlargest companies in America: Sunkist Growers, $2,594,000; Blue Diamond \nNuts, $4,419,000; Welch's Foods, $707,000; Sunsweet, $616,000; Ernest & \nJulio Gallo, $598,000; Tyson Foods, $440,000; and Ocean Spray, \n$320,000.\n  The way that they have been able to effectively circumvent the \nlimitation that this money should be made available only to small \nbusinesses is that industry associations and cooperatives that receive \nthe money directly from the Foreign Agricultural Service can in turn \nmake grants to members of the association or to the cooperative members \nthemselves. So that is how we continue to see these substantial amounts \nof money that continue to flow into these large companies.\n  Proponents of the program will justify this corporate giveaway by \npointing to various studies that exalt the benefits reaped by these \nadvertising campaigns, but none of the studies cited, nor the benefits \nthat are assigned to this program, can be authenticated.\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\n  Mr. President, in the course of the debate on this floor over the \nyears, we have seen near magical benefits attributed to this program--\nclaims that each dollar of spending through the Market Access Program \nyields about $16 in new agricultural exports in addition to thousands \nand thousands of jobs. Those have been the arguments essentially that \nhave been used to oppose the elimination of this program.\n  First of all, if this analysis were correct, perhaps what we ought to \ndo is put more money into this program and in effect have our Head \nStart youngsters participate in this program in order to achieve these \ndramatic ``multiplier affects'' that the advocates and defenders of \nthis program have asserted for it.\n  I want to make a further point: The figure that is used for these \nmultiplier numbers is data taken from a 1995 inagency study of the \nMarket Access Program that has drawn much criticism from GAO.\n  The GAO found that the analysis on which this and other fanciful \nclaims are based is flawed and does not follow standard cost-benefit \nguidelines--guidelines that are recommended by the Office of Management \nand Budget.\n  The GAO's September report--this is the report that was released in \nSeptember of this last year--has found that the data that has been used \nand the methodology does not support the conclusions that advocates of \nthis program attribute to this Market Access Program.\n\n  This report, which was completed at the request of the Budget \nCommittee in the House and its chairman, could not authenticate any of \nthese claims that have been made. Here is just a brief summary of what \nthe GAO concluded.\n  First, the GAO said there is no credible evidence that the Market \nAccess Program has expanded employment and output, or reduced the trade \nand budget deficits.\n  Second, it goes on to say that increases in farm employment and \nincome cannot be attributed to Market Access Program spending.\n  Finally, that the Market Access Program is not an effective \ncounterweight for the export programs of other nations.\n  That is another argument that I am sure that we will hear--that other \ncountries are helping to subsidize their agricultural industry in \nproviding a number of export subsidies to assist those.\n  But, as the GAO has reported, this program has not been an effective \ncounterweight to the export programs designed by other countries.\n  I must say that this hardly is a ringing endorsement for continued \nexpenditures for this program. That is, putting aside the philosophical \nobjections for a moment, there is really no evidence that the money \nthat we are spending--$90 million--accomplishes a thing.\n  Let me suggest that the Market Access Program has another \nquestionable aspect to it; that is, what is the justification for \ncontinuing to subsidize promotional efforts for well-known brand-name \nproducts that do not receive Federal assistance? These companies that I \nhave cited, Sunkist, Blue Diamond Nuts, Welch's Foods, Tyson Foods, and \nOcean Spray, are fine companies, are highly successful companies and \nare huge companies in terms of their size. What justification is there \nto use taxpayer dollars to support in effect augmenting or increasing \nthe kinds of advertising dollars that these companies clearly have the \nability on their own to do? They know how to make a judgment as to how \ntheir advertising budgets should be spent. That is a private sector \ndetermination. The Government has no business, in my judgment, taking \nhard-earned taxpayer dollars and saying to each of these companies we \nare going to give you an additional $2.5 million or $1.5 million to add \nto your budget. I have an objection to that philosophically.\n  Moreover, when the GAO concluded that these dollars that we have \nspent over the years really have not accomplished anything, I think it \nis just totally indefensible.\n  It is true, Mr. President, as I indicated earlier, that some positive \nchanges have been implemented in the program in an effort to focus more \neffort on small business and new-to-export producers. However, one-\nthird of all MAP promotions are still brand names. They are product-\nspecific promotions identifying a particular company, and not a generic \nproduct that is being exported abroad.\n  I think when you look at how the money is actually spent, \nnotwithstanding the well-intentioned efforts to focus this program on \nsmaller companies, that we have really failed in that objective.\n  The top 10 brand-name promotion grants awarded by USDA, the United \nStates Department of Agriculture, in fiscal year 1997 includes some of \nthe well-known products that most Americans probably recognize from \nU.S.-based advertising.\n  These are the companies.\n  My feeling is that I think it is very hard--I think it is \nimpossible--to justify spending taxpayer dollars. Sunkist, for example, \na company that employs between 500 and 900 people, and posted sales of \nover $1 billion, received $5 million in Federal advertising assistance \nin 1996 and 1997.\n  What in heaven's world are the taxpayers doing subsidizing the \nadvertising budget of a company with sales exceeding $1 billion \nannually? You simply can't justify that.\n  Welch's Foods, another fine product, with over 1,000 employees, rang \nup more than $550 million in sales, yet was awarded over $1.5 million \nover the past 2 years as part of this program.\n  These examples illustrate what I have been saying for a number of \nyears--that this program is a waste of money and public funds should \nnot be used to underwrite private corporate activity.\n  Proponents of this program will point out accurately that in the last \nfew years, the largest number of awards have gone to small businesses \nand cooperatives. Much of this is due to the changes to the program \nthat were passed--with the support of the ranking member of the \nAgricultural Appropriations Committee on the Senate floor--that gave \npreference to small and nonprofit applicants.\n  However, it is important to note that the other types of MAP \nrecipients, the cooperatives and the industry associations, as we \npointed out, do not limit the contributions that they make to their \nmembers based upon size. That is how we have these rather large \ncompanies receiving a staggering amount of public assistance. That is \nwhy you will not see these names on MAP's award list. Large companies \nstill receive funds through their associations. In fiscal year 1997, \nthe Chocolate Manufacturers Association, the Kentucky Distillers' \nAssociation and the Mid-America International Agri-Trade Council passed \nthrough funds to M/Mars, Maker's Mark Distillery, and General Mills, \nInc., respectively, to conduct name brand promotions overseas.\n  Finally, let me note in this context that we take a look at the names \nof the top 10 awards for brand name promotions--the top 10 for brand \nname promotions. It is interesting to note that small businesses \nreceived only $825,000 of the $7,816,000 that went to these 10 \napplicants. In contrast, the top two name brand recipients, Sunkist and \nBlue Diamond, received more than $4 million, more than half of that \n$7.8 million total.\n  We have attempted to tighten the program, with limited funding, to \nchange the definition of preferred participants, but the same large and \nwell-known recipients show up on the MAP award list year after year.\n  Many of the problems we discussed 5 and 6 years ago continue to go \nunresolved, and this recent report by the GAO still cannot verify the \nclaims made by the USDA to justify MAP.\n  The distribution, Mr. President, of millions of dollars of public \nfunds to private businesses for self-promotion does not win any \ncommonsense awards, but continued spending on such a program without \nconfirmation of the program's competitiveness is an unforgivable abuse \nof public funds.\n  Before I close my comments, I want to put this program in some \nperspective, because I expect many of my colleagues will come to the \nfloor to defend this program that takes $90 million of taxpayer dollars \nand uses it for foreign advertising.\n  Mr. President, the MAP cannot offset foreign competitors' export \nsubsidies, because it does not make U.S. products more affordable. It \nis an advertising subsidy, not an export subsidy. We need to ensure \nthat our agricultural programs provide real and measurable\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\nbenefits to U.S. farmers and consumers, especially as farmers are \nfacing falling prices, and MAP's benefits do not in any way meet this \ntest.\n  Perhaps a little history on this program is in order to give some \nperspective:\n  The Targeted Export Assistance (TEA) program was authorized as part \nof the 1985 Food Security Act to reverse the decline in U.S. \nagricultural exports and specifically to counter the unfair trade \npractices of foreign competitors.\n  Unlike products promoted under MAP, only commodities adversely \naffected by unfair foreign trade practices were eligible for funding \nunder TEA. This restriction continued until 1994, but was eliminated as \npart of the implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round trade \nagreements. So, while a link between USDA export promotion aid and \nforeign trade practices once existed, it is no longer a requirement for \nMAP participants.\n  Even when the program was still targeted at unfair trade practices, \nit was prone to wasteful spending on behalf of huge corporations such \nas McDonalds, Campbell Soup and a host of others. After a critical \naudit by GAO, the program's name was changed to the Market Promotion \nProgram as part of the 1990 farm bill.\n  Then, after two more reports critical of the program, its name was \nagain changed in 1996, this time to the Market Access Program. At that \ntime, Congress was under extreme pressure to end the corporate handout, \nand some positive and significant changes to the program's management \nwere proposed and adopted:\n  USDA was directed to stop awarding funds to foreign companies; \nParticipation was restricted to small businesses, cooperatives, and \ntrade associations; and companies were required to certify that funds \nwere not merely substituting for private marketing funds that were \nalready being spent.\n  I wish that I could say that these changes have ensured that the \nprogram provides a fair return to the American people. Unfortunately, \neven with these restrictions written into law, millions continue to \nflow to large corporations through associations and cooperatives with \nno real assurance that the funds are not used to replace private \nadvertising dollars.\n  These criticisms were restated by the GAO in the report released last \nfall following yet another GAO investigation, requested by \nRepresentative John Kasich, into the effectiveness of the Market Access \nProgram and the claims made about its success.\n  In this key report, the GAO discredits the analysis used by the USDA \nin reports that claimed that MAP has a significant impact on the \neconomy, the agricultural sector, and U.S. trade efforts. The GAO audit \nfound fault with each of these conclusions because each was based on \nthe agency's use of flawed methodology and incomplete evaluations of \nthe program's costs and benefits.\n  The GAO leveled additional changes at the program's management, \npointing out enduring problems that Congress has tried to fix in the \npast. For example, in spite of the requirement that companies use MAP \nfunds to supplement, not supplant, their own advertising spending, GAO \nfound no way to confirm that MAP funds were indeed being used for \nunique expenditures. The 1993 reconciliation bill required applicants \nto verify that MAP funds would not replace their own advertising \ndollars, but this requirement is largely unconfirmed by USDA officials \nand verification is left up to MAP applicants.\n  It is also difficult to establish that MAP's stated goal of \nintroducing firms to new markets is being met. Major questions remain \nunanswered, such as: when have companies or associations had ``enough'' \nassistance? Some firms will have been participating in the program for \n13 years before the 5-year ``graduation'' requirements (instituted in \n1994) will begin to take effect. The USDA currently does not have a \nstandard method for deciding when their own program goals are reached, \nso business interests or associations can stay in the program without \nregard to their NEED for funds to open new markets.\n  At the center of the GAO's criticisms of MAP's effectiveness is the \nfaulty economic analysis used by USDA to make its case for the program. \nGAO reported that USDA's flawed evaluations made it extremely difficult \nto analyze MAP's contributions to the economy, because the program \nanalysis for MAP does not conform with the Office of Management and \nBudget's (OMB) agency guidelines for cost-benefit analysis. These \nguidelines are used by agencies to construct a uniform standard for \nevaluating programs' performance as required under the Government \nPerformance and Results Act (GPRA). Without using a standard method of \nevaluating various government programs, it would be nearly impossible \nto judge any program's effectiveness.\n  OMB instructs agencies, when analyzing the impact of any program, to \nassume that resources are ``fully employed'' [``Guidelines and Discount \nRates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,'' OMB Circular No. \nA-94, sec 6b(3) (Oct. 29, 1992)]. These guidelines are in place to \nensure that, in keeping with the implementation of the Government \nPerformance and Results Act, each agency follows a uniform framework \nwhen evaluating costs and benefits of its programs. This framework \nincludes the assumption of fully employed resources.\n  However, in its 1995 analysis of the Market Access Program, USDA did \nnot adhere to the OMB cost-benefit guidelines and assumed that program \nresources would otherwise be unemployed. Clearly, it is not accurate, \nin today's economy, to assume that the funds designated for MAP, or any \nprogram, would have no benefit, no alternate use, if otherwise deployed \nin the economy.\n  Put another way, USDA took the untenable postion that the resources \nthat went into MAP could not yield benefits to the economy through \nother uses, such as tax breaks for American families, investment in \neducation, or paying down the debt.\n  USDA also assumes that MAP-promoted agricultural products would not \nbe exported at all in the absence of this program, which implies that \nthe private sector would not pursue these export opportunities without \nMAP assistance. This premise holds that on the one hand, these markets \nwould be unprofitable without help from the federal government, but on \nthe other hand, these same markets bring in high returns on promotion \nexpenditures. If the returns on investment are indeed as great as the \nagency holds, why would the private sector not undertake its own \npromotional activities?\n  For a recipient like Sunkist, whose homepage on the Internet boasts \nthat ``Sunkist is the 43rd most recognized name brand in the United \nStates and the 47th most recognized in the world,'' it becomes clear \nthat this program is wasting scarce federal dollars subsidizing an \nalready highly-successful company's advertising budget.\n  Finally, in its 1995 report USDA also assumes that all of the workers \nand farmers whose labor and output is associated with MAP-promoted \nexports would be completely unemployed were it not for the MAP program. \nUnder this premise, USDA calculates these workers' employment and \nincome as benefits generated by MAP, crediting the program with \neconomic expansion and increased tax revenues.\n  Mr. President, any federal program evaluated under this same set of \nassumptions would appear to generate income. This type of accounting is \nnot permitted for other programs, and should not be permitted to stand \nhere. The result is that USDA's analysis of MAP includes exaggerated \nestimates of the program's worth that are misleading but are \nnonetheless often quoted by proponents of the program.\n  Let me give you some examples of the overblown gains attributed to \nMAP as a result of the department's faulty analysis. According to \ninformation included in the USDA's 1999 Performance Plan and the \nForeign Agriculture Service's five-year strategic plan, the $90 million \nannual allocation for MAP, through a multiplier effect, results in $5 \nbillion in agricultural exports, expands the national economy by $12 \nbillion, and creates 86,500 jobs. And that is jsut the 1997 impact.\n  It sounds too good to be true, and it is.\n  These incredible returns are the result of USDA's ``free lunch'' \nanalysis--\n\n[[Page S8207]]\n\nan irrational conclusion that MAP benefits the economy, based on faulty \nassumptions that federal and private resources have no alternate use or \nimpact on the economy.\n  Another major claim made in support of MAP is that these funds are \nneeded to counteract the export assistance of our foreign competitors. \nThe GAO report finds this claim, like the others, unreliable because of \nthe lack of verifiable information about foreign competitors' export \nassistance activities.\n  We often hear about the large amounts of money that foreign \ncompetitors pump into export subsidies, and how important it is to make \nU.S. crops competitive in foreign markets or risk being locked out of \nthese markets altogether. This argument is irrelevant to any discussion \nabout MAP, however, because unlike USDA's export subsidy programs which \nlower the prices of U.S. crops abroad, the Market Access Program is not \nan export subsidy, it is a promotion subsidy, and does not lower prices \nof U.S. goods in foreign markets.\n  Furthermore, while it is true that MAP's focus at its creation was \ncountering unfair trading practices employed by our competitors in \noverseas markets, this is no longer the case. As I mentioned earlier, \nMAP's focus on matching competitors' moves was removed when the \nimplementing legislation for the Uruguay Round agreements was approved \nin 1994, allowing MAP funds to be used for general export promotion \npurposes as the Foreign Agricultural Service sees fit. This change, \ncombined with a lack of firsthand knowledge about foreign export \nactivities, led the GAO to conclude that claims about MAP's \neffectiveness in countering other nations' export assistance cannot be \nverified.\n  Another question that has been raised about this program is whether \nits export promotion subsidies are undertaken by other programs at \nUSDA. The Congressional Research Service, in a February 1997 report, \nraises this question in relation to the Foreign Market Development \nProgram (FMD), which has been around since 1954. The FMD program is \nmuch like the MAP except that it is focused on developing foreign \nmarkets for U.S. commodities, as opposed to name-brand and processed \nexports. Therefore, its jointly-funded activities are aimed more at \ntechnical assistance and market research rather than advertising and \nother consumer-oriented promotions. However, unlike MAP, funding levels \nfor FMD have remained under $50 million annually, and activities have \nnot grown to include brand-name promotions.\n  While these two programs take a similar approach to different \nmarkets, there has been very little analysis of which type of promotion \nis more effective. It would be helpful to be able to compare MAP's \ntrack record with the results attributed to FMD, but this information \nhas not been compiled by the USDA. Nor has there been a study to simply \nevaluate whether generic or branded promotions are more successful in \npromoting exports, and where these efforts are most successful.\n  Mr. President, there is just not enough evidence out there which \nbacks up the claims we have all heard about the Market Access Program. \nI can think of no other federal program that we allow to receive funds \nwithout a rigorous examination of the costs and benefits associated \nwith the government's investment. We demand this kind of analysis even \nfor D programs which often have uncertain future outcomes and \nbenefits that are difficult to forecast.\n  We must ask ourselves, if a policy of underwriting the advertising \nexpenses of large producers and corporate interests makes sense when we \nare cutting back on funding for domestic food security and important \nresearch initiatives. We cannot justify spending one more dime on this \nunproven program, and this view is shared by a long list of government \nwatchdog and consumers groups representing a broad range of beliefs: \nAmericans for Tax Reform, Capitol Watch, the CATO Institute, Citizens \nAgainst Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, Competitive \nEnterprise Institute, Friends of the Earth, National Taxpayers Union, \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, and the U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup.\n  I urge all of you to take a long, hard look at this program's track \nrecord and vote to end the waste of taxpayer dollars on foreign \nadvertising and promotion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think it is very clear from the \nunanimous vote we had on the resolution with which we started the \ndebate on this legislation that all Senators agree our agriculture \nsector is under tremendous pressure and the Congress and the President \nought to take immediate action to respond to these needs in the \nagriculture sector because of low prices in some areas, because of \nadverse weather conditions in other areas, because of a decline in \ndemand resulting from the Asian economic crisis. Some of our strongest \ncustomers and markets are in that area of the world.\n  So I think we have all gone on record as agreeing we need to use our \nbest efforts, we need to mobilize our agencies of Government to take on \nthe responsibility of helping to develop access to new markets, to try \nto help expand old markets so that we can sell what we are producing \nand create a better prospect for profit in agriculture in the \nproduction sector.\n  So I don't think we have seen a situation in the last several years \nwhen there was any more reason to have a Market Access Program and to \ninvest in an effort to expand these markets and make them more \naccessible to U.S. agriculture exports.\n  The purpose of the Market Access Program, which we began in 1985, was \nto help expand foreign markets. Since then, agriculture exports have \ndoubled. Last year, agriculture exports amounted to $57.3 billion, \nwhich resulted in a $21.5 billion agriculture trade surplus, providing \njobs for approximately 1 million Americans.\n  When we had our hearings in our agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee this year, we had representatives from the administration \nbefore our committee talking about the Foreign Agricultural Service \nprograms. I am going to read the Senate something from the statement of \none of those officials.\n  He said:\n\n       The outlook for U.S. agricultural exports is heavily \n     influenced by competitive pressures that differ by commodity \n     and can affect price and/or quantity of sales. One of the \n     primary sources of this pressure is the rising value of the \n     U.S. dollar, especially against the currencies of our major \n     competitors. This has the effect of making U.S. exports more \n     expensive to our customers relative to those of our \n     competitors.\n\n  Then there is a discussion in another part of this witness' statement \nabout what some of the competitors are doing to try to enlarge their \nshare of the world market for their products:\n\n       We continue to face stiff competition in markets around the \n     globe. Our annual review of the export promotion activities \n     of the two countries that account for our major competition \n     found that, just like the United States, many of our \n     competitors have ambitious export goals. The EU and other \n     countries assist their producers and small businesses to \n     develop foreign markets through activities similar to our \n     Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program.\n\n  He goes on to say that in the EU countries, it is estimated that $400 \nmillion in 1995 and 1996 would be spent for market promotion:\n\n       In Australia, Canada and New Zealand, those governments \n     have strong governmental promotion agencies and rely heavily \n     on their statutory marketing boards to carry out market \n     development activities for producers of specific agricultural \n     products.\n\n  With this information and with the understanding of the success of \nmany of these countries that are competing with us for market access \nand market goals, it would be the height of folly, in my judgment, to \nabandon one of the most successful programs that we have had to assist \nour agriculture producers in finding new markets and expanding those \nmarkets. We have had almost every year since I have been managing this \nagriculture appropriations bill an effort to either reduce the amount \nof money we were spending on market access promotion or to eliminate \nthe program entirely.\n  In the writing of the 1996 farm bill to try to deal with some of the \ncriticism that had been directed toward this program, it was reformed \nand changed so that this year for the first time only small businesses \nand farm cooperatives will be eligible to have the benefits of\n\n[[Page S8208]]\n\nthis Market Access Program. There had been criticism that only the big, \nwealthy companies were benefiting, only brand names were being \nadvertised. It was a way for big companies to avoid having to pay their \nown advertising costs.\n\n  Let me explain that. Because of the reforms that have been made and \nthe experiences that many have had in the program, the evidence is very \ncompelling that this program has been working by attracting attention \nto the fact that American-made products do have high quality. Not only \nthe raw agriculture commodities that are sold, but those that are \nprocessed and manufactured--some of those qualify and are eligible for \nparticipation in this program. Let me just give one example.\n  The U.S. cotton industry, through the Cotton Council International \norganization, working under the Department of Agriculture's oversight, \nretains control over the expenditure of funds that are made available \nfor the cotton industry. These Market Access Program funds are applied \nonly to Cotton Council International advertisements that are produced \nto communicate the benefits of U.S.-grown cotton and establish consumer \npreference for products that bear the name ``Cotton USA.'' This is a \ntrademark. It is registered. It represents all of U.S. cotton and \nmanufactured cotton products in export promotion. These funds are used \nto advertise ``Cotton USA,'' and it associates that brand name with \nqualified manufacturers. The funds are not used to subsidize the \nadvertising of private companies but, rather, all U.S.-grown cotton.\n  Let me tell you what the results are. In 1997 alone, the Market \nAccess Program helped combat unfair trading practices of other \ncountries. It helped U.S. cotton producers get more income from the \nmarket as farm program payments declined. It helped generate $2.5 \nbillion in cotton fiber exports and $5 billion in manufactured cotton \nproduct exports. It helped expand jobs, with over 150,000 workers \ndepending directly on cotton and cotton product exports. That is one \nexample of an agriculture commodity that is very important in my State \nof Mississippi and throughout our country. It is one of our major \nagriculture exports from our State.\n  There are many others. The cooperatives that are involved in produce, \nthe fruit and vegetable business in California and elsewhere, have \nindicated how important this program is to them. As a matter of fact, \nthere is an entire list of organizations which have banded together and \ndescribed themselves as the Coalition to Promote U.S. Agricultural \nExports. They wrote me a letter dated June 22, 1998. The coalition \nmembership list is attached to this letter. It runs the gamut across \nthe country of various kinds of agricultural organizations and producer \ngroups. But I wanted to just read a couple of things from this letter, \nand then I will have the entire letter, and the list, printed in the \nRecord:\n\n       Reducing or eliminating [Market Access Program] funding in \n     the face of continued subsidized foreign competition, and \n     with another round of trade negotiations set to begin in \n     1999, would be nothing less than unilateral disarmament. Such \n     action would also violate the commitments made when Congress \n     approved the 1996 farm bill and [it would] jeopardize its \n     continued success.\n\n  The letter also points out that this amendment to reduce funding that \nthe Senator from Nevada is offering again this year was defeated last \nyear--the effort to eliminate the funding--by a vote here in the Senate \nof 59 to 40. I think the Senate has come to realize this is an \nimportant program, it deserves the support of the Senate, and it has \nbeen reformed and revised so that the eligibility standards, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture oversight, all make sure that the funds are \nspent wisely and that we get our money's worth as a result of this \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, there are also other specific groups that have \nbenefited from the Market Access Program. It has come to my attention, \nfor example, that the catfish industry--which is still a new industry \nthat has been growing enormously in our country--is dependent upon the \nexports that we have come to appreciate. And in the European market, \none example is Germany. Since 1991, catfish exports to Germany have \nincreased from 18 metric tons a year to 237,437 metric tons in 1996.\n  The Washington apple industry credits the Market Agriculture \nPromotion Program with fostering its dramatic apple export expansion to \nIndonesia. Here is a country that has had substantial economic problems \nrecently, but back in 1990 they had less than $800,000 worth of apples \nbeing sold into that market. But each year since then, in spite of \neconomic conditions there, sales have expanded, culminating in recent \nexports totaling $34 million.\n  Another example is the U.S. Meat Export Federation. It offers a \nBranded Product Promotion Program to help private companies, small \nbusinesses and cooperatives, promote their own labels in foreign \ncountries. This Branded Product Promotion Program has been instrumental \nin helping a small Ohio company called Certified Angus Beef introduce \nnew-to-market meat cuts overseas. The sales have risen from 6.2 million \npounds in 1990 to 37.3 million pounds in 1996. The association members \nthroughout the country have benefited from these export sales. The \nassociation has received $53,000 in funding from MAP over a 6-year \nperiod.\n  This is another specific example where we have targeted the MAP funds \nto small businesses, to associations, to cooperatives, and, for the \nfirst time in 1998, according to Secretary Glickman when he testified \nbefore our committee, this will be the first year when all of the funds \nwill go to such entities.\n  I think it is very clear from the evidence we have accumulated and \nthe testimony we have had, and our hearings, that for U.S. agriculture \nto remain competitive, we are going to have to continue the policies \nand programs that have been effective, and we are going to have to deal \nwith the reality of competition from others. The amendment proposed by \nthe distinguished Senator from Nevada would make us take a step \nbackwards. It would make us give up one of the most effective tools we \nhave to help American agriculture continue to prosper.\n  The promotion activities of the Department of Agriculture have \nestablished a foundation for future market growth and expansion. But it \nis more important now, with the world situation as it is and hardships \nin American agriculture that have been identified over the last day and \na half in discussions here on the floor, that the Department continue \nto work as hard as it can to use its resources to be a partner with the \nfarmers and the exporters of America to meet our expansion objectives \nfor American agriculture. Our exports are essential, not only to \nagriculture, but to the Nation's economic well-being as well.\n  Jobs are created in the producing and packaging industries, in \ntransportation--a wide range of economic activities are affected by \nagriculture. It is one of the strongest economic sectors we have. To \nkeep it that way, we are going to have to take care of it. We can't \njust let it shrivel. We can't let it be the victim of international \nconditions as exist in Asia today. We have to do our part. The Senate \nhas to do its part, too. American agriculture needs us, needs the \nprograms like the Market Access Program, in order to compete in this \nnew global environment.\n  I can't stress any more than I have tried to the importance of our \nrejecting this amendment. I urge all Senators to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to \nfrom the Coalition to Promote U.S. Agriculture Exports and list of \nmembers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              Coalition to Promote\n\n\n                                    U.S. Agricultural Exports,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to urge your continued \n     strong support for USDA's Market Access Program (MAP) when \n     the Senate considers the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations \n     bill (S. 2159). Such support is essential to help encourage \n     U.S. agriculture exports, counter subsidized foreign \n     competition, strengthen farm income and protect American \n     jobs. Last year with your leadership, the Senate rejected \n     efforts to eliminate funding for MAP by a vote of 59 to 40.\n       Both farm income and the economic well-being of agriculture \n     are heavily dependent on exports, which account for as much \n     as one-third or more of domestic production. This is \n     especially true since passage of the 1996 farm bill (FAIR \n     Act), which gradually reduces farm programs over a 7 year \n     transition period, while providing producers with\n\n[[Page S8209]]\n\n     greater planting flexibility to respond to the global \n     marketplace.\n       Much of the support for the 1996 farm bill was based on \n     assurances that programs encouraging U.S. agriculture exports \n     would remain a key component of U.S. policy. The global \n     marketplace continues to be characterized by subsidized \n     foreign competition. Last year, the European Union budgeted \n     $7.2 billion for export subsidies. Along with other foreign \n     competitors, it also spent nearly $500 million on market \n     promotion efforts. (This compares with $90 million authorized \n     for MAP.) The EU spends more on wine promotion than the U.S. \n     spends for all commodities combined.\n       While small compared to similar efforts by other countries, \n     MAP has been a tremendous success as a cost-share program in \n     helping encourage U.S. agriculture exports. Last year, such \n     exports amounted to $57.3 billion, resulting in a positive \n     $22 billion agricultural trade surplus. Without U.S. \n     agriculture exports, our nation's trade deficit would be even \n     worse. U.S. agriculture exports also provided jobs for nearly \n     one million Americans. Every additional billion dollars in \n     agriculture exports help create as many as 17,000 or more new \n     jobs.\n       Reducing or eliminating MAP funding in the face of \n     continued subsidized foreign competition, and with another \n     round of trade negotiations set to begin in 1999, would be \n     nothing less than unilateral disarmament. Such action would \n     also violate the commitments made when Congress approved the \n     1996 farm bill and jeopardize its continued success.\n       Again, we urge your continued support for this vitally \n     important program by opposing any amendments that would \n     either eliminate or reduce funding.\n           Sincerely.\n                                              Coalition to Promote\n                                          U.S. Agriculture Exports\n\n\n                       coalition membership--1998\n\n       Ag Processing, Inc.\n       Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute.\n       American Farm Bureau Federation.\n       American Forest & Paper Association.\n       American Meat Institute.\n       American Seed Trade Association.\n       American Sheep Industry Association.\n       American Soybean Association.\n       Blue Diamond Growers.\n       California Agricultural Export Council.\n       California Canning Peach Association.\n       California Kiwifruit Commission\n       California Pistachio Commission.\n       California Prune Board.\n       California Table Grape Commission.\n       California Tomato Board.\n       California Walnut Commission.\n       Cherry Marketing Institute, Inc.\n       Chocolate Manufacturers Association.\n       CoBank.\n       Diamond Walnut Growers.\n       Eastern Agricultural and Food Export Council Corp.\n       Farmland Industries.\n       Florida Citrus Mutual.\n       Florida Citrus Packers.\n       Florida Department of Citrus.\n       Froedtert Malt Corporation.\n       Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.\n       Hop Growers of America.\n       International American Supermarkets Corp.\n       International Dairy Foods Association.\n       Kentucky Distillers Association.\n       Mid-America International Agri-Trade Council.\n       National Association of State Departments of Agriculture.\n       National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n       National Confectioners Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Cotton Council.\n       National Council of Farmer Cooperatives.\n       National Dry Bean Council.\n       National Farmers Union.\n       National Grange.\n       National Hay Association.\n       National Grape Cooperative Association, Inc.\n       National Milk Producers Federation.\n       National Peanut Council of America.\n       National Pork Producers Council.\n       National Potato Council.\n       National Renderers Association.\n       National Sunflower Association.\n       NORPAC Foods, Inc.\n       Northwest Horticultural Council.\n       Pet Food Institute.\n       Produce Marketing Association.\n       Protein Grain Products International.\n       Sioux Honey Association.\n       Southern U.S. Trade Association.\n       Sun-Diamond Growers of California.\n       Sun Maid Raisin Growers of California.\n       Sunkist Growers.\n       Sunsweet Prune Growers.\n       The Catfish Institute.\n       The Farm Credit Council.\n       The Popcorn Institute.\n       Tree Fruit Reserve.\n       Tree Top, Inc.\n       Tri Valley Growers.\n       United Egg Association.\n       United Egg Producers.\n       United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association.\n       USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council.\n       USA Poultry & Egg Export Council.\n       USA Rice Federation.\n       U.S. Apple Association.\n       U.S. Feed Grains Council.\n       U.S. Livestock Genetics Export, Inc.\n       U.S. Meat Export Federation.\n       U.S. Rice Producers Association.\n       U.S. Wheat Associates.\n       Vinifera Wine Growers Association.\n       Vodka Producers of America.\n       Washington Apple Commission.\n       Western Pistachio Association.\n       Western U.S. Agricultural Trade Association.\n       Wine Institute.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, for the benefit of the record, I quoted \none of the witnesses who testified before our hearing. The person I \nquoted was Lon Hatimaya, who is Administrator of the Department of \nAgriculture's Foreign Agriculture Service.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, has the distinguished floor manager yielded \nthe floor? Apparently the answer is yes. Mr. President, if I might be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I find myself in agreement with at least \nthe concern that is expressed by the able chairman of the subcommittee. \nThere is no question that certain agricultural segments in America face \na real crisis. As I said at the outset of our discussion on this \namendment, I am not unmindful, I am not unsympathetic, of these \nconcerns and, indeed, I expect to support a number of proposals that \nwill be advanced to assist American agriculture as it moves through \nthis crisis period.\n  I do not deny that the decline has demanded, that the turmoil in Asia \nhas created a problem, that there are some weather-related phenomena, \nthat, indeed, there may be some competitive practices by those who \ncompete in the world's international agricultural markets that may be \ndecidedly unfair to American agriculture. I am concerned about that as \na citizen and am prepared to support measures that effectively deal \nwith that issue and help American farmers. I am for that.\n  I recognize that, as the myth of this program has taken on legendary \nproportions, it is an article of faith, unshaken by factual analysis, \nthat somehow the Market Access Program provides additional farm \nemployment, expands exports internationally, is a significant \ncontributor to the growth of the American economy, and somehow is an \neffective counterweight to some of the unfair competitive practices \nwhich American agriculture faces abroad.\n  Mr. President, the problem with that is that each of those arguments \nhas been analyzed in considerable detail, not by the Senator from \nNevada but by the GAO in its most recent report of September 1997.\n  Very simply, what the GAO report concludes is that none of the \nclaims, none of the assertions made, can be verified or authenticated--\nnone; none. The GAO report goes to the heart of the argument that, \nnotwithstanding this mythic epic that seems to have arisen that \nsuggests that this program is indispensable to American agriculture, \nthe GAO report says, ``Look, none of that, none of that can be \nverified.'' That is the basic premise here.\n  Yes, I want to be supportive and helpful to American agriculture in \nits time of crisis, but how can you support a program that in 10 years \nhas cost the American taxpayer $2.3 billion?\n  Let me make it clear--and this is not the subject of debate today, \nand the Senator from Nevada certainly will yield to the Senator from \nMississippi in terms of his expertise in agricultural programs--but so \nnone of my colleagues is somehow under the impression that this Market \nAccess Program which I seek to eliminate strikes at the core of what we \nare trying to do to help American agriculture, let me point out that in \nthis same 10-year period that we spent $2.3 billion on a program which \nthe GAO says does not do what it is intended that it does, or at least \nit cannot verify or authenticate it, we have spent $9 billion on export \nsubsidies, $7.8 billion on food aid, $53.1 billion in loan guarantees. \nWe have tried to deal with some of the issues which American \nagriculture faces in the international marketplace.\n  Point No. 1: If nothing else is taken out of this debate, the GAO \nsays this program, notwithstanding the intensity and the passion that \nits advocates share for it, simply doesn't do the things that the \nadvocates contend. Point No. 1.\n  The second point that I think needs to be raised, even if one \nconceded for the sake of argument--and I do not and the GAO does not--\nhow can you continue to justify paying $2.5 million to\n\n[[Page S8210]]\n\nthe good folks at Sunkist? How do we justify paying $1.5 million to the \ngood folks at Blue Diamond Nuts? These are sophisticated, highly \neffective American companies whose products are world class, and, \nnotwithstanding the fact that none of these products are grown in my \nState, I think as Americans we take great pride in their success, and \nthe fact these products are found in the storefronts in the markets of \nthe world, that is wonderful, but how do we justify subsidizing with \ntaxpayer dollars? These companies have advertising budgets of tens of \nmillions of dollars--probably much more than that. So the American \ntaxpayer is asked to write a check to subsidize these advertising \naccounts.\n  This program is not an export subsidy, it is an advertising subsidy. \nThe point I make in response to the point of my able colleague from \nMississippi is, No. 1, the GAO says it doesn't accomplish what it says \nit is designed to accomplish; and, No. 2, the philosophical point, \nnotwithstanding all of our attempts to reform this program that it \nought to be confined--I don't think it ought to be in existence--to \nsmall companies, still when you look at the top 10 companies that \nreceive these dollars, small businesses receive only $825,000 of the \n$7,816,000 that went to these top 10 applicants.\n  Notwithstanding what we attempted to do in previous years, in effect, \nlarge companies continue to be the beneficiaries of a substantial \namount of taxpayers' dollars to supplement their advertising accounts.\n  My good friend and I have an honest difference of opinion. I think \nthat is wrong. I am willing to work with and to support Members from \nagricultural States in trying to do something that makes sense, that \nworks, that can be helpful, but at this point the GAO has concluded \nthat none of the claims has any validity. I think it is very difficult \nto continue as we have for the last decade where we spent $2.3 billion \non this program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3157\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Bryan, in my opinion, is a meritorious amendment. He and I \nfought this battle. I fought it for maybe 3 or 4 years alone, and then \nSenator Bryan came to the Senate, and we have labored in the venue of \ntrying to do away with what was then the Market Promotion Program and \nnow called the Market Access Program.\n  I have absolutely no quarrel with trying to assist people who really \nneed help. The Export Enhancement Program isn't being used. It is a big \nprogram, but it isn't being used. When I started on this, the Market \nPromotion Program included the biggest companies in America, and that \nis the source of my objection.\n  I am talking about some of the biggest corporations in America. And I \nsee my good friend, Tyson Foods, is on the list still. I am sure they \nwelcome getting $440,000 a year. Tyson Foods does over $5 billion a \nyear, and I certainly do not want to pick on a company in my home \nState, particularly one that has so many of my close friends in it. But \nthat is precisely the reason I have always objected to this program. I \nknow that it does some good.\n  I heard the chairman, Senator Cochran, talking a while ago about some \nof the benefits of it, and who has benefited, and how much, and so \non. I just think it is welfare for the rich. That is the reason I have \nalways opposed it.\n\n  Senator Cochran and I disagree. I guess this is about the only \nthing--maybe one or two things--we will disagree on in this entire \nbill. We get along famously in the committee, but this is one that I \nsimply could not let my dear friend, Senator Bryan, take on alone. I \njust wanted to get my 2 cents' worth in and to state that I will vote \nwith Senator Bryan on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Market \nAccess Program. This program continues to be a vital and important part \nof U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining and expanding U.S. \nagricultural exports, countering subsidized foreign competition, \nstrengthening farm income and protecting American jobs.\n  The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success by any \nmeasure. Since the program was established, U.S. agricultural exports \nhave doubled. In Fiscal Year 1997, U.S. agricultural exports amounted \nto $57.3 billion, resulting in a positive agricultural trade surplus of \napproximately $22 billion and contributing billions of dollars more in \nincreased economic activity and additional tax revenues.\n  For example, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture received \n$125,000 of Market Access Program funds during the past year. These \nfunds were used to promote Idaho and Western United States agricultural \nproducts in the international markets of China, Taiwan, Brazil, Mexico, \nGuatemala, and Costa Rica. One particular activity, the promotion of \nwestern U.S. onions in Central America, required $15,000 of MAP funds \nand generated inquiries for onions valued at $150,000.\n  Demand for U.S. agricultural products is growing 4 times greater in \ninternational markets than domestic markets. MAP has been an enormously \nsuccessful program by any measure in supporting this growth. Since the \nprogram began in 1985, U.S. agricultural exports have more than \ndoubled--reaching a record of nearly $60 billion dollars in 1996; \ncontributing to a record agricultural trade surplus of $30 million; and \nproviding jobs to over 1 million Americans.\n  MAP is a key element in the 1996 Farm Bill, which gradually reduces \ndirect income support over 7 years. Accordingly, farm income is now \nmore dependent than ever on exports and maintaining access to foreign \nmarkets.\n  Two years ago, European Union (EU) export subsidies amounted to \napproximately $10 billion in U.S. dollars. The EU and other foreign \ncompetitors also spent nearly $500 million on market promotion. The EU \nspends more on wine promotion than the U.S. spends for all its \ncommodities combined.\n  Mr. President, the Market Access Program should be fully maintained \nas authorized and aggressively utilized by the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to encourage U.S. agricultural exports, strengthen farm \nincome, counter subsidized foreign competition and protect American \njobs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the National Taxpayers Union, the \nFriends of the Earth, Citizens Against Government Waste and other pro-\nconsumer government watchdog groups in supporting Senator Bryan's \namendment to terminate the Market Access Program. Throughout the years, \nthis wasteful program has sometimes carelessly used taxpayer money to \nhelp those who can afford to help themselves--instead of this country's \nstruggling small farmers.\n  Mr. President, over the last ten years, the USDA has shelled out $1.4 \nbillion for the Market Access Program (MAP), which is intended to \npromote U.S. products abroad. MAP has been roundly criticized for \ngiving away millions of taxpayer dollars to agribusiness giants in the \nname of trade, but the program has managed some unusual feats, \nincluding scaring off foreign consumers. As we face the already \nchallenging task of reducing the deficit and preserving Social \nSecurity, MAP is a program that the federal budget, and the taxpayer, \ncan do without.\n  I do not need to remind members of the millions of dollars wasted on \nMAP and the programs preceding it. In 1989, we had the Japan/California \nraisin fiasco. The California Raisin Board ran untranslated ads to \npromote their raisins in a market where raisins were rare. Baffled at \nthe sight of these strange dancing blobs, many Japanese children were \nfrightened. Mr. President, it's safe to say that if the California \nRaisin Board had done any market research, they would not have wasted \n$3 million on those commercials. They wouldn't have been so careless.\n  MAP is the kind of program most taxpayers know little or nothing \nabout, but we are paying dearly for it. Though the program has \nundergone some changes over the last nine years, it continues to dole \nout money to some of the largest agriculture companies in the country \nwith funds that could instead be used to help small farmers.\n  Some of the companies receiving MAP funds in fiscal year 1998 include \nSunkist Growers and Blue Diamond Growers. Both are big companies that \ncan afford to market their own products abroad without spending tax \ndollars. The list includes a host of other beneficiaries of MAP's 1998 \n$90 million dollar budget, including the California Pistachio \nCommission, the Mohair\n\n[[Page S8211]]\n\nCouncil of America, Kentucky Distiller's Association and the Wine \nInstitute.\n  Mr. President, it is true that MAP was changed in the 1996 Farm bill \nto direct funds to cooperatives and trade associations instead of \ncorporations, but a loophole still allows the companies that belong to \nthose trade associations to continue to receive and spend taxpayer \nfunds.\n  Mr. President, I believe in supporting and strengthening America's \nposition in foreign markets, but when we allocate precious tax dollars \nto be used toward that end, we must spend them on concrete efforts to \nget American products on to the shelves in those markets, instead of \nsubsidizing advertising campaigns for major corporations.\n  The USDA's own estimates put U.S. agricultural exports in 1998 down \nmore than two billion dollars from the previous year. More than ever, \nWisconsin farmers need the USDA to promote and place U.S. agricultural \nproducts in foreign markets through more successful export programs, \nnot to line the pockets of big agribusiness and Madison Avenue.\n  I urge support of the Bryan amendment and yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no other Senators who want to \ndebate this amendment.\n  Let me just state for the information of all Senators the plan, as I \nunderstand it, that most who are involved have agreed upon, and that is \nto have a vote on a motion to table the Lugar amendment, which will be \nmade by Senator Stevens at 6 o'clock, and following that, a vote on a \nmotion to table the Bryan amendment, which I intend to make. We will \nhave the yeas and nays on both of those amendments.\n  It is the suggestion of the managers that if the Lugar amendment is \nnot tabled, that that be the pending business following the vote on the \nmotion to table the Bryan amendment. I don't want to speculate on how \nthe vote on the motion to table the Bryan amendment will come out. The \nlast time we voted, it was 59 to 40 in favor of tabling the amendment. \nThat vote occurred on July 23, 1997, and it was an amendment to reduce \nthe Market Access Program by $20 million. The vote No. was 199.\n  So I am making that as an announcement to the Senate. If anyone has \nany comments to the contrary or observations to make about it, we will \nbe glad to consider those comments and observations.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator from Mississippi will yield for a moment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BRYAN. The procedure that he outlined is certainly agreeable to \nthe Senator from Nevada. He correctly recites the vote, which I greatly \nregret, a year ago. I simply say, this is a time for redemption for \nSenators tonight. Tonight they have an opportunity to exercise that \nredemption. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3156\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Lugar \nand others in offering this amendment today. The proposal seeks to \nestablish a more balanced, deliberative U.S. policy as regards \ninternational sanctions.\n  Today, nations throughout the world look to the United States for \nleadership. The end of the cold war has clearly left the United States \nas the sole remaining superpower. We are sought after for many reasons: \nFinancial assistance, military might, political leadership, and the \nadvocacy of democratic ideals.\n  When the world looks to us for leadership on international sanctions, \nI am afraid that the administration and Congress have taken steps that \nincreasingly have undermined our Government's reputation and influence \nabroad. The tendency--and it is particularly true with regard to \nCongress--to impose sweeping unilateral--that is, we do it alone--\neconomic sanctions against nations whose behavior we disapprove of, I \nbelieve, is detrimental to our national interest and certainly has not \nsucceeded in producing the results that we seek.\n  Let us look at several recent examples. We have heard much about the \nsituation with respect to Pakistan, in which the threat of tough, \nmandatory U.S. sanctions did nothing to dissuade the Pakistanis from \ntesting nuclear weapons. The 30-year embargo on Cuba, has done nothing \nto hasten the end of the Castro regime or ease the suffering of the \nCuban people. And just this year, we passed legislation to impose \nsanctions on entities suspected of assisting Iran's missile program.\n  Moreover, when our sanctions have been structured to punish countries \nwho continue to deal with the rogue nation we are trying to isolate, \nthe outcome has been even murkier. All that these secondary sanctions \nend up doing is generating bad feeling among our allies about \n``American imperiousness,'' and precipitating complaints from our \ntrading partners to the World Trade Organization. As a result, the \nworld's attention turns away from the rogue nation in question, and \ninstead focuses on the United States and its actions.\n  Mr. President, if Congress continues this habit of imposing, on an ad \nhoc basis, unilateral sanctions against any nation because of a form of \nbehavior we find objectionable, our influence in the world will be \ndiminished. While sanctions laws may feel good and bolster our sense of \nrighteous indignation, sanctions imposed under these laws far too often \ndo nothing more than antagonize nations and their peoples, and get us \ninto trouble with our trading partners. Moreover, sanctions mean that \nour influence on the region in question drops sharply. And less U.S. \ninfluence means that the values we hold dear--democratic government, \nmarket economics and respect for human rights--will not be promoted \nworldwide. There must be a better way.\n  I am an original cosponsor of S. 1413, the original Lugar bill to \nmake wide-ranging reforms of our laws on unilateral sanctions. The \namendment before us today, which is based on that legislation, would \nestablish procedural guidelines and informational requirements before \nany further unilateral sanctions are imposed. It also provides for \nenhanced consultation between the executive and legislative branches of \ngovernment prior to the imposition of sanctions. Finally, it mandates a \ntwo-year sunset for such sanctions, unless Congress specifically \nchooses to renew them.\n  This amendment does not preclude Congress or the President from \ntaking action necessary to achieve vital national security and trade \nobjectives. However, it does ensure that such measures first will be \nconsidered in a thoughtful and responsible manner, and that we at least \nwill have some idea as to whether these policies may actually achieve \ntheir intended goals. Thus, I urge my colleagues to support the Lugar \namendment.\n  I do want to stress that I think it is a great mistake for us to \nembark on these unilateral sanctions as freely as we do. This \namendment, I believe, is a good one. Furthermore, it says that if we do \nimpose sanctions, that there is to be a sunset provision. That sunset \nprovision goes into effect after 2 years, unless, of course, Congress \nchooses to renew the sanctions.\n  This amendment does not preclude Congress or the United States from \ntaking action necessary to achieve vital national security or trade \nobjectives, but it does assure that such measures are, first, very \ncarefully considered in a responsible manner and that we at least have \nsome idea as to whether the policies may actually achieve their stated \ngoal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am saddened to have to attempt this, \nbut I want to state to the Senate that it is to me a watershed issue \nnow for this year. This bill really is going to go into serious \ngyrations if the Lugar amendment is adopted. In the first place, if it \ngoes to the House with this amendment, it means an entirely different \ncommittee will have to review this amendment and it will make \nconferencing this bill very difficult.\n  I find myself in the position where I probably support a lot of what \nis in the amendment of the Senator from Indiana. I understand it is a \nbill that was\n\n[[Page S8212]]\n\nintroduced and has not moved forward as he would like. We do have a \ntask force that was appointed by the leader to look into the problem of \nsanctions; the whole approach of Senator Lugar is under review by that \ntask force. We are hopeful we will have a proposal to act on that, we \nwill have bipartisan support. Broad support in the Senate would be \nnecessary to pass it.\n  The Senate, last week, passed legislation that was suggested by a \ngroup here in the Senate and it has been considered by the House. It \nhas been modified and sent to the President to deal with one part of \nthe sanctions program. I congratulate the current occupant of the Chair \nfor his part in that effort. I think it is an effort that must be made.\n  As chairman of this committee, I want to tell the Senate that we are \napproaching the time when we will lose the first week of the August \nrecess. We will probably have to come back the first week of September \nand we still won't finish by September 30, if we add to appropriations \nbills full bills that deserve the consideration of the Senate. That \nwill add to the time it takes to get the appropriations bills through \nthis process.\n  I hope that the majority leader will assist in trying to convince \nMembers of the Senate, let's not do this this year. There are \nlegitimate riders. There are legitimate limitations on expenditures. \nThere are legitimate concepts in terms of dealing with the \nappropriations process that we will have to fight out here on the \nfloor, but we should not have to fight out here on the floor amendments \nthat will require the bill, when it goes to the House, be subject to \nconference by another full committee in the House. It is not right to \ndo that, and I hope the Senate will agree with me.\n  I move to table the amendment of the Senator from Indiana, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment No. 3156. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 201 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Campbell\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Landrieu\n     Lugar\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Glenn\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3156) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate for \nrecognizing the process we have to follow now to limit the \nconsideration of issues that are extraneous to the basic appropriations \nbills so we can get them through.\n  I apologize to my friend from Indiana. I do support his effort. But \nwe had to take that action.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3157\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is now my intention to move to table \nthe Bryan amendment. Before doing so, the Senator from California has \nasked for 1 minute to speak in opposition to the Bryan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  I hope the Senate will vote to table the Bryan amendment for four \nreasons: One, we reformed the program and the proceeds do not any \nlonger go to big business; they go to small businesses and \ncooperatives; two, we have cut this program down from a high of $300 \nmillion to about $90 million; three, other countries spend billions of \ndollars promoting their exports; this is the least we can do; and, \nfour, for every $1 that we put into this Market Access Program, we get \nback $12 in increased exports. So I hope you will join me in voting to \ntable the Bryan amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that the sponsor of the \namendment, Senator Bryan, be given 1 minute to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would simply make the point that all of \nthe assertions and claims that have been made by the advocates for the \nMarket Access Program have been considered by the GAO in a report \nreleased last September. They have rejected all of them. We have spent \n$2.3 billion in the last 10 years and the GAO concludes that they \ncannot establish any benefit of the program. Unfortunately, our attempt \nto reform the program does not prevent the largest businesses in \nAmerica from continuing to have their advertising budgets supplemented \nto the tune of millions and millions of dollars--$5 million subsidizing \nthe advertising budget of one of these large companies.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize that this is a program that \nsimply does not work and support the Bryan amendment by voting against \nthe motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the Bryan amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment to Ban Egg Repackaging\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Cochran and \nSenator Bumpers for accepting the amendment I offered to ban egg \nrepackaging as part of the Agriculture Appropriations Bill. This \namendment is a first step in continuing to ensure the safety of the \nnation's egg supply.\n  On April 17, 1998, the Secretary of Agriculture announced a \nprohibition on the repackaging of eggs packed under the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture's (USDA) voluntary grading program. This \namendment codifies Secretary Glickman's prohibition which took effect \non April 27, and affects eggs packed in cartons that bear the USDA \ngrade shield.\n  A recent ``Dateline NBC'' program focused public attention on the \nrepackaging of shell eggs by egg packers, and raised concerns about \nthis practice. This amendment will prohibit shell eggs that have left \nthe packing plant, and been shipped for sale, from being returned to \nthe packing plant for repackaging into USDA shielded cartons. This \namendment affects the approximately 30% of shell eggs voluntarily \ngraded by USDA.\n  The amendment also directs that not later than 90 days after the date \nof its enactment, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services shall jointly submit a status report to the \nCommittees on Appropriations of the House of Representatives and the \nSenate. This report is intended to provide the status of actions taken \nto enhance the safety of shell eggs and egg products. The report also \nwill provide the status of the prohibition on the repackaging of USDA \ngraded eggs, and provide an assessment of the feasibility and \ndesirability of applying to all shell eggs, not just USDA graded eggs, \nthe prohibition on repackaging in order to enhance food safety, \nconsumer information, and consumer awareness.\n  The safety of our egg supply is a primary example of the confusing \narray of laws, regulations, and voluntary programs which divides \nregulation among four federal agencies and the states. The legislation \nI have introduced with Senator Torricelli--The Safe Food Act (S.1465)--\nfocuses attention on the problems of having multiple federal agencies \nwith jurisdiction over various food safety laws, and how fragmentation \nand duplication cause waste and confusion. Jurisdiction over eggs is a \ngood example of how confusion, overlap, and the lack of coordination \nleave the American public subject to food poisoning outbreaks.\n  The health of American families is at risk if we do not work to \nensure that only safe eggs reach America's store shelves. USDA recently \nreported that each year over 660,000 persons in the United States \nbecome sick from eating eggs contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis \n(SE). Illnesses from SE can be fatal to the elderly, children, and \nthose with weakened immune systems. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, the SE bacteria caused more reported \ndeaths between 1988 and 1992 than any other foodborne pathogen. The \nCenter for Science in the Public Interest estimated an annual cost of \nillness from SE at $118 million to $767 million.\n  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with the safest and \nmost abundant food supply in the world. However, we can do better. This \namendment to ban egg repackaging will help advance the federal \ngovernment's commitment to continue providing Americans with the safest \nfood supply.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the managers for the work they have \nbeen doing, the progress they have made and the two votes we just had. \nWe have been working with Senators on both sides of the aisle to \nidentify what amendments we can do tonight. Senator Daschle has been \nworking with me on this. So I announce the proposed lineup for the next \nfew amendments to be considered tonight. I think it is important we \nkeep working so we can complete this very important legislation for the \nAgriculture Department and the farmers of America.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be the next first-degree amendments in order and limited to \nrelevant second-degree amendments: Senator Kerrey of Nebraska regarding \nlivestock; Senator Johnson regarding meat labeling; Senator Dodd \nregarding sanctions; Senator Graham regarding disaster assistance; and \nSenator Torricelli regarding sanctions.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that if debate is concluded and a \nrollcall vote is requested that the amendment or amendments be laid \naside to recur in the order in which they were debated, and the votes \noccur beginning at 8:45 with 2 minutes of debate equally divided before \neach vote begins.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and it is \nonly for clarification and one suggestion, I ask the majority leader \nwhether the order could be Dodd, Torricelli, Johnson and Kerrey?\n  Mr. LOTT. I guess we did say in that order, but that order can be \nrearranged, unless the manager has a problem.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. For clarification, the 8:45 time that the majority \nleader indicated for the vote will be this evening rather than in the \nmorning?\n  Mr. LOTT. At 8:45 p.m. tonight. That will give Senators a chance to \nhave a meal that they might have agreed to have and also give the \nmanagers time to work through these amendments, but lock in their \nconclusion, and then that will be it for tonight after that block of \nvotes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I also ask if the majority leader will \nobject to dividing the time for the four amendments equally between now \nand 8:45?\n  Mr. LOTT. Is the Senator suggesting each amendment get the same \namount of time? Mr. President, I do want to amend my unanimous consent \nrequest to comply with the lineup that Senator Daschle asked for. Will \nthe Senator repeat that? What order?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I was going to suggest Senator Dodd, Senator Torricelli, \nSenator Johnson, Senator Graham and Senator Kerrey.\n  Mr. LOTT. Unless the managers have an objection, I amend my unanimous \nconsent request to that extent.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the leader clarify for me the time in opposition \nto Senator Dodd, who will be controlling time?\n  Mr. LOTT. It will be controlled by Senator Cochran, the opponent of \nthe amendment, but I am sure he will be very fair in the disposition of \nthat time so that others can speak against that amendment.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. His disposition looks very fair, so I withdraw the \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3158\n\n   (Purpose: To exempt agricultural products, medicines and medical \n                equipment from U.S. economic sanctions)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Grams and Mr. \n     Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 3158.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is the Senator from Kansas \nobjecting?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I want, Mr. President, to offer an amendment in the \nsecond degree.\n\n[[Page S8214]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the dispensing with the \nreading of the amendment?

This section shall take effect one day \n     after the date of enactment of this section into law.''.\n\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment and the second-degree \namendment, which fills out the tree on behalf of myself, Senator \nWarner, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, Senator Dorgan, Senator Grams \nand Senator Harkin.\n  Very simply, what this amendment does is codify what Members have \nexpressed over the last several days that they would like to see \naccomplished worldwide. We eliminated last week the use of food and \nmedicine to people as a sanction in the case of Pakistan and India. We \nfelt that was an unwise use of the sanctions; that average people, poor \npeople should not suffer at the hands of our Nation despite the \ndecisions made by the power elite in their own nations.\n  What my colleagues and I who have offered this amendment today are \nsuggesting is that same principle ought to be applied worldwide. It is \ncounter to everything we stand for as a people--everything we stand \nfor. To deny people anywhere in the world food and medicine--basic food \nand medicine--runs contrary to the moral values that we embrace as a \npeople.\n  Whatever anger we may feel and properly focus on the leadership of \nnations, we should not cause the innocent people of those nations to \nsuffer as a result of our policies. For far too long, we have allowed \nthe use of food and medicine to be used. There are only two or three \ncountries in the world that today allow their food and their medicine \nto be used as a tool in foreign policy or as part of a sanctions \npolicy.\n  Tonight we have an opportunity to change that law, to say that with \nregard to any sanctions policy, whatever other tools we may want to use \ndepriving countries of certain economic issues, technical equipment, \nmilitary hardware, availability of our lending institutions--whatever \nelse we may want to use--that food and medicine will not be a part of \nthat mix.\n  I hope no one has any illusion that in the case of a Saddam Hussein \nor a Fidel Castro or the leaders of North Korea, the leaders of Iran, I \nguarantee you tonight that they are eating well. I promise you that if \nthey get sick, they get medicine and they see doctors.\n  Too often, we have allowed our foreign policy to also work against \nthe innocent people who live in these regimes, in these terrorist \ncountries. If this amendment is adopted, I am told that there will be \nan amendment offered immediately thereafter which will say that this \nprovision should not apply to terrorist countries. None of us want \nanything to do with terrorist countries, but does anyone in this \nChamber or America believe that the average Iraqi citizen, that the \naverage citizen in Iran, that the average citizen in Cuba or North \nKorea, despite the leadership of their nation, should suffer because \ntheir leaders may engage in activities which are cruel or support \nterrorist activities?\n  I happen to believe that ought not to be the case; that the use of \nfood and medicine ought not to be a vehicle in the conduct of our \nforeign policy.\n  Mr. President, it was noted earlier today that we have become \nextremely generous in the application of the sanctions policy. Since \nWorld War II, there have been 100 occasions where the United States has \nimposed sanctions. More than 60 percent of those sanctions have \noccurred since 1993.\n  And 61 U.S. laws and Executive orders have been enacted authorizing \nvarious types of unilateral economic sanctions against 35 countries in \nthe name of foreign policy. The sanctioned countries comprise 42 \npercent of the world's population. Roughly 2.3 billion people--\npotential customers of U.S. goods and services--are being affected.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that to deprive these people of foodstuffs--\nI hear that one of the reasons that our farmers are not doing well in \nthis country is because of the difficulty in foreign sales. Aside from \nthe legitimate concern about seeing to it that innocent people are not \ngoing to be deprived of food and medicine, here is an opportunity to be \nable to sell some products that can actually benefit the people in \nthese countries.\n  Why not take an argument away from those terrorist leaders, those \ndictators, who constantly want to point to us, the United States, as \nthe reason their economies are in trouble? Why not say this evening \nthat: You can no longer point an accusing finger at America when it \ncomes to the issue of your children, your innocent women,\n\n[[Page S8215]]\n\nyour innocent civilians, from getting food or medicine? We no longer \nuse that tool in our foreign policy. If your people are suffering, it \nis not because the United States is banning the exportation of food and \nmedicine. It is because of the economic policies of your own \nleadership.\n  Tonight, no matter how angry and legitimate that anger may be at a \ndictator or a terrorist leader of a country, let us not say to the poor \npeople who have to live under those dictators and terrorists that the \nUnited States, as a result of our own policies, will deny you the \nopportunity to get decent food and decent medicine.\n  Let us not be a part of only two or three other nations--Third World \ncountries--that I can find who use that kind of a vehicle in the \nconduct of their foreign policy. There is not a single member of the \nindustrialized world, the civilized world, that utilizes food and \nmedicine. We are the only example of it.\n  Tonight we have an opportunity, across the board, to eliminate the \nuse of food and medicine as a part of our sanctions policy--still have \nsanctions, still deprive them, if you will, of the advantage of our \nengineering, our technology, our military hardware, but we are not \ngoing to say that food ought to be a part of that.\n  Let us join the rest of the world in eliminating that. We, the United \nStates of America, we, the nation who embraces, with great legitimacy, \nthe issue of human rights where innocents are involved, where the meals \nand the food they need and the medicine they require are involved, we \nare not going to be the nation that deprives them of the opportunity to \nuse some of the best products in the world.\n  Mr. President, the world looks to us, particularly in the area of \nmedical devices and medicines. And to deprive poor people of an \nopportunity to get some of those medicines, to get some of the food--\nthe best grown in the world--I think would be a tragedy. Mr. President, \nI urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I note my colleagues are here from Nebraska and Kansas and may want \nto be heard on this issue. I yield the floor and request how much time \nmay remain.\n  We don't have time agreements, do we? No time agreements?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). There is no time agreement on the \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in regard to the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, this institution should take \nsome pause. This is some moment. Thirty years of American foreign \npolicy by Democrats and Republicans are about to be put aside. The \nconsequences of what Senator Dodd suggests that we do here are \nenormous. Consider the moment.\n  These are not isolated humanitarian items. This would open trade for \nthe United States of America with the greatest rogue regimes in the \nworld, where Presidents of the United States, through 3 decades, have \ndrawn the line and said that we will not do business with these \ngovernments unless and until they take specific actions to free their \npeople, allow basic human rights, or make basic concessions in their \nrelations with the United States. We are about to clear the table and \ntell them all is forgotten and all is forgiven.\n  Consider the actions, Mr. President, through the years about what \nwould be changed. In my State, perhaps more than most in this country, \ntonight every Member of this Senate would have to address the families \nof the victims of Pan Am 103. It has been clear to Mr. Qadhafi, until \nhe brings those to justice who were responsible for destroying that \naircraft and the lives of all of those families, there will not be \ntrade with the United States on a bilateral basis.\n  With the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, the war of wills \nin which we have been engaged with Mr. Qadhafi, even now while he is \ndiscussing bringing those murderers to justice--we proceed. The line \nthat was drawn those years ago is now erased.\n  With the Sudan--another terrorist state to which now we would sell \nfood and medicines, engage in normal commerce; it harbors Hezbollah \nguerrillas, the assassins who attempted to kill President Mubarak of \nEgypt; we were so brave in those days, the United States was so \nforthcoming in drawing this line--all is forgotten and forgiven.\n  In North Korea--just when we have succeeded in getting the North \nKoreans to come to the table and enter into an agreement to stop the \ndevelopment of atomic weapons and try to get some responsible \nbehavior--no need for the negotiations, we are now going to engage in \ncommerce.\n  With Syria--its harboring of terrorism against Israel; its occupation \nin Lebanon--we will now engage in commerce.\n  And Iraq--at the moment, sanctions against Iraq are multinational.\n  But every Member of this Senate knows that the day is fast \napproaching when America could stand alone. Inspectors would be barred, \nour military would be barred from the skies. And the United States \nwould have to have its own sanctions. And this amendment--even though \nSaddam Hussein has been identified again as a terrorist regime and \nAmerica could be alone in its sanctions --here we would engage in \ncommerce.\n  It has been contended to the Senate that we do this as a decent \npeople because the real victims here are the poor of all these nations. \nThat indeed is not fair, Mr. President, to this country or this \nGovernment, because, indeed, while we maintain sanctions on each of \nthese terrorist States, for good and sound reasons that I have \noutlined, this Government has gone to every length to protect the poor \nof the poor.\n  In North Korea, the shipment of 800,000 tons of food, only on the \ncondition that we know who is getting the food and that it is not going \nto the North Korean military. But it is not fair that the poor of the \npoor of North Korea are victimized because of our embargo--800,000 tons \nof food distributed to the poor.\n  And the Sudan, one of the poorest nations in the world--Senator Dodd \nis right, the poor of the poor should not be victimized because that \nGovernment harbors terrorists and assassinates foreign leaders. And so \nwe have approved $76 million in food assistance, only on the condition \nthat we know that it gets to the poor of the poor.\n  And in Iraq, $2.8 billion worth of food and medicine, only on the \ncondition that it not go to Saddam Hussein, that it not go to the \nelite, that it not support the Iraqi military--just that it go to the \npoor of the poor under U.N. inspections.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut, if indeed we at one \npoint predictably stand alone against Saddam Hussein, our food sales \nwill not just go to the poor of the poor, they will go to the entire \nIraqi establishment.\n  As the author of the modern Cuban embargo, I make no apologies in \nthis case, either. The United States provides more food and medicine \nper capita to Cuba than any nation in the world provides to any other \nnation of the world, bar none. No Member of this Senate has any \napologies to make for American support of the poor of the poor in Cuba. \nIn the last 12 months alone, there were 123 licenses to ship food and \nmedicine to Cuba, worth $2.5 billion. I challenge any Member of the \nSenate to find any country more generous than the United States of \nAmerica, giving to any adversary, more generously than we have to the \npeople of Cuba.\n  We have a license program and we have a license program for a reason, \nrather than unrestricted sales of food and medicine, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut suggests. The reason is because we found when those \nfood and medicines are not licensed, Mr. Castro has resold them or used \nthem to support his own military establishment, like Saddam Hussein. \nThere is no denial of food and medicine. We simply are requiring that \nit be done properly.\n  Senator Helms and I, with other colleagues, have joined in this \nCongress in an alternative to Senator Dodd's proposal. Humanitarian \nshipments go to Cuba through the church and are licensed, on an \nunrestricted basis--simply that we know who is distributing them, the \nchurch, humanitarian organizations, not the Communist Party\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\nand not Fidel Castro. It is a question of control.\n  It is argued, finally, that these sanctions, this restriction on \ncommerce with terrorist regimes should be lifted because they don't \nsucceed. On the contrary. The record is otherwise. Sanctions on South \nAfrica to end apartheid, to the Jackson-Vanik amendment to allow Soviet \nJews to leave Russia, to restrictions on Vietnam until they cooperated \nwith POWs, the record is that, while imprecise, while offering no \nguarantees, economic sanctions, including the leverage on our greatest, \nmost successful export products, foods and pharmaceutical products, can \nand do yield results. No one should assume, no one should believe that \nthey work in every case or work quickly. But the historic record is \nthat they are an alternative to military action.\n  Where would Ronald Reagan--or George Bush--have been when Pan Am 103 \nwas shot down, if he did not have the opportunity to have economic \nsanctions and this leverage? There would be nothing available but \nmilitary action. Where would we have been after the shoot down of an \nAmerican aircraft 2 years ago in the Straits over Cuba, if the \nPresident could not have tightened economic sanctions?\n  No, they are not perfect, but they give the President added authority \nand weight to change policy. Every one of the countries most impacted \nby Senator Dodd's amendment in the course of the last year and every \nyear for the last 5 years has been identified by the State Department \nas a source of terrorism against the international community, every \ncountry I have mentioned on this floor tonight.\n  Is it really the intention of this Senate, after all these years of \nclaiming that we had the will to fight this war on terrorism, we were \nas resolved as Qadhafi and Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro, after all \nthese years, now we are to say to them we have lost our will, we \nchanged our minds? If that is the intention of the Senate, at least \nhave the intellectual honesty to come to the floor, repeal the \nterrorism list, repeal sanctions entirely, because that is the effect \nof this statement. We will identify you as a terrorist, we will claim \nyou are killing our citizens, harboring assassins, but we are glad to \ntrade with you.\n\n  I recognize that sometimes it is necessary, unfortunately, that the \nUnited States stand alone. Only Britain and the United States are still \nremembering the victims of Lockerbie; only the United States, the \npeople who are jailed in Cuba. Only the United States may have the \nresolve to see it through with Saddam Hussein. That is too bad. But if \nthe end result is the United States has to stand alone against these \nterrorist regimes, then we never stood in better company. We can be \nproud that we alone remember the victims and we alone are going to \nimpose a price for those who violate international law and victimize \npeople.\n  But let it not be said, however, the Members may vote on this \namendment, that any of us were a party to the poorest of the poor, and \nthe hungry being victimized by our foreign policy, because those \nsimply, my colleagues, are not the facts--from the tons of wheat that \ngoes to North Korea to the pharmaceutical products licensed and \ndistributed in Cuba.\n  My colleagues, consider carefully this amendment. This is not a \nquestion of the Clinton administration. It is policies and embargoes \nthat go back as far as John F. Kennedy. It is not just a question of a \ncouple of governments. It is virtually every nation on the terrorist \nlist. It is not simply a question of taking the stand because of an \nisolated incident, like Pan Am 103 or a disagreement with Saddam \nHussein. They are issues as serious as preventing another Persian Gulf \nwar by using our leverage and continuing leverage on North Korea to \ncooperate on a missile regime and on atomic weapons.\n  This is, indeed, a serious matter. I hope if an amendment is offered \nto table Senator Dodd's amendment, as I am informed may happen, \nDemocrat and Republicans, on a bipartisan basis, will not only vote to \ntable the amendment by the Senator from Connecticut, but it will do so \nin an expression of true and strong resolve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am very pleased to join my colleague, Senator Dodd as a coauthor of \nthis legislation, along with Senator Hagel and Senator Biden, and many \nother Senators. As has been stated, it does provide a broad exclusion \nfor all food and medical products in regard to unilateral sanctions.\n  Now, I want to emphasize that right away--unilateral sanctions, not \nmultilateral sanctions. You would hope that if you are going to put any \nsanction on a country that works, that is effective, or the pragmatic \nresult results in some kind of policy change that is in the best \ninterest of our national security, that would have the support of your \nallies. It is only when you have unilateral sanctions that this bill \napplies.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to add, it is unilateral economic \nsanctions, so it is even more narrow. This does not apply to sanctions \nacross the board but unilateral economic sanctions. If on a national \nsecurity basis some of the advisors and the President want to impose \nthe sanction, he would be allowed to. Only when we impose unilateral \neconomic sanctions is this tool taken off the table.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator and the author of the bill for that \nexplanation. I hope that would take away some of the concern as \nexpressed by the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  This amendment recognizes that until the United States is literally \nat war or we have a national security problem with another country--and \ncertainly terrorism fits into that category--there is no positive \nbenefit in denying the most meager necessities of life, food and \nmedicine, to the people of this world. Certainly it doesn't benefit the \nsick and hungry, Mr. President.\n  In regard to the people of Africa and Asia, and blocking the sale of \nfood and medicine, it does severely damage, I think, America's image in \nthe eyes of people across the globe. As a matter of fact, as a member \nof the Transatlantic Partnership, which is an organization dedicated to \nbetter understanding between the peoples and the parliamentarians of \nEurope and the United States, this subject comes up again and again and \nagain. Why are you basically hurting the people who are most \ndisadvantaged in any kind of a unilateral sanction that makes no sense \nin terms of any policy change?\n  So I think the world must know that the U.S. Government and the \nAmerican people care about what goes on outside our borders, and the \nworld must also know that the United States stands ready to provide \nfood and medicine--on commercial terms--to anybody, any time, any \nplace, unless there is national security involved, and unless we have a \nsituation like the Senator from New Jersey pointed out with regard to \nterrorist activities or exporting terrorism. This amendment represents \none very critical component of what is becoming a sweeping debate on \nthe use of acting unilaterally--and I emphasize unilateral--all by \nourselves, in U.S. foreign policy. Unilateral sanctions serve no \npurpose other than to hurt the U.S. businesses and workers and to \ndiminish U.S. strength and prestige.\n\n  I firmly believe that the Congress and the administration must \ncontinue to work together on a broad-based effort to reassess all \ninstances of unilateral sanctions. This amendment would represent an \nexcellent step in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, with a few add-ons, those are my prepared remarks. I \nwant to respond to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. The \nSenator from New Jersey indicated that for the last three decades the \nPresidents of the United States have reaffirmed in each and every case \nunilateral sanctions, including the use of food and medicine. To a \ncertain degree, I think that is true, because it was in 1980, when \nPresident Carter was President, that this issue really hit a flash \npoint. President Carter, thinking of the terrible tragedy when the \nformer Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, decided we would cancel out of \nthe Olympics. He also decided he would put on a grain embargo. I know \nthat the President intended on sending a strong message to the former \nSoviet Union. I know President Carter hoped that the perception in the \nworld community would be such that somehow the Russians would change \ntheir policy. And they did not.\n\n[[Page S8217]]\n\n  I will tell you who was hurt in that particular instance by the \nCarter grain embargo--and I am not trying to perjure it; I am saying \nthis happened in terms of a pragmatic effect. It was like shattered \nglass and it headed us toward the farm crisis of the 1980s, in some \nways, and it took us years to get back contract sanctity to the point \nthat our exports made anything. We had an excellent Olympics; I think \nit was in L.A. Americans won a great many battles and medals. But I can \ntell you that, in terms of perception, it didn't do a thing. No Russian \ntroop ever left Afghanistan.\n  Now, that was a terrible tragedy. Again, we were using unilateral \nsanctions, and we were using the farmer and rancher with regard to that \nprice. I submit to you that if you want to put sanctions on people, all \nAmerican taxpayers should pay for it, not just farmers and ranchers. \nThat is called an embargo. I can tell you that you can spell embargo S-\nA-N-C-T-I-O-N-S. No country that has sanctions put on them \nunilaterally, regardless of what progress we are making in terms of \nwhatever objective we are trying to achieve, will buy from us as long \nas that is available from other countries. That is precisely what is \nhappening regarding the countries where we have the unilateral \nsanctions.\n  Look at Pakistan. Thank goodness, we acted on this 98-0 this week in \nthe Senate. They have a wheat tender. Guess who was standing in line. \nThere was the French. They were going to buy the wheat from the French. \nThey may anyway. We acted wisely and we said, ``This isn't going to \nwork. Why are we hurting the American farmer or rancher or, for that \nmatter, anybody in the business community when the sanctions \ndon't work?'' Yes, it has been 30 years of a broad policy, trying to \nlook at sanctions to see if they are going to work. But the fact is \nthat was started with the Carter embargo. I must say that it took \nPresident Reagan 2 years to get around to getting contract sanctity. In \nthe meantime, we suffered great harm in terms of farm country.\n\n  So I say to my distinguished friend from New Jersey, you are darn \nright, it has been a 30-year policy and, for the most part, it hasn't \nworked. Now, in terms of terrorism, I personally agree. Libya? I would \nhope that we would have multilateral sanctions. I would hope the world \ncommunity would understand that Mr. Qadhafi and Libya have, in the \npast, exported terrorism. I might add that one of the reasons it has \nbeen so successful in terms of keeping him under wraps is that the \nadministration at the time sent a strong message to Mr. Qadhafi. He \nwoke up one morning to find that part of the place where he spent most \nof his time to watch television and do other matters was no longer \nthere. All of a sudden, he got the message. He probably scratched his \nhead and said, ``Had I been sitting there, it might have been a little \ndifferent.'' And then he calmed down right away. Have we gotten to the \nbottom of all of the tragedies that he has inspired? No. Are we ready \nto sell him product, i.e., Kansas wheat, or any other product? No, \nbecause his behavior is such that we feel it is in our national \nsecurity interest not to do that.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Jersey with regard to food \nproducts. They are fungible. What happens is, if you are able to \narrange a sale, or for a humanitarian purpose you provide food, \nobviously, they have the ability in a totalitarian state to simply use \nthat for other purposes, and they can continue whatever practices they \nmay have. But in the end result, the people who are at the lowest \nlevels are the people who get hurt--the women, children, all of the \npeople mentioned by Senator Dodd.\n  So while it is fungible, I think, with regard to agriculture and \nmedicine, the basic question you have to figure out here is, are we \nusing agriculture as a tool for peace? Or are we using agriculture as a \nforeign policy weapon? I can tell you that, for too many years now, we \nhave used agriculture as a foreign policy weapon--to the detriment of \nfarmers and ranchers, for no apparent reason, with no pragmatic result, \nwith the nations that we are now talking about.\n  I might add that there are some moderating forces that are now at \nwork in Iran. And I might add that when I went to Saudi Arabia with \nChairman Stevens and six other Senators, we asked the Saudis--we made \nindirect inquiries, and we were working with the Secretary of State to \nmake further indirect inquiries: Could we help the forces of moderation \nin Iran by offering agriculture as a tool for peace? Would that work? \nCould they increase their diet, basic protein diet, so they are better \noff, and become, hopefully, more dependent on the United States with \nregard to their basic needs and their food supplies?\n  Think what could happen if we would use agriculture as a tool for \npeace, as opposed to a weapon, on a selective basis. The Senator from \nNew Jersey mentioned Iraq and Saddam Hussein. I think it is \ndisingenuous to say that the people who support this amendment somehow \nsupport Saddam Hussein. We are now allowing Iraq and Saddam Hussein to \nexport as much oil as they did prior to the gulf war. They, in turn, \nused the cash that we allowed them to expend regarding oil sales to buy \nwheat in regard to the French. Hello. Why does that make any sense? If \nwe are going to sanction Iraq under a banner of, well, everything \nexcept something that is humanitarian, and we say you can sell this oil \nto achieve humanitarian needs, food and medicine, i.e., food products, \nagriculture products, and they buy from our competitors, that doesn't \nmake any sense. If you have sanctions, it seems to me you ought to make \nthem across the board. We didn't do that. We backed off of that. There \nis a whole history as to where we are with Iraq and the United Nations \nand plans by the administration to have a limited armed conflict and \nwhere we are with that. I am not going to second guess that. But let's \ndon't say that since we support this amendment, we support Saddam \nHussein.\n  North Korea--if there ever was a totalitarian regime that is rather \nbizarre in its nature, it is North Korea. I have been in North Korea. I \nwent to Pyongyang to meet with the North Koreans, along with Senator \nStevens, Senator Inouye, and others. We met with representatives of the \nNorth Korean Government. We were trying to arrange a grain sale by a \nthird-party country so they could somehow get an experience of trading \nwith other nations--moderate, a little. That is a tough chore, I will \ntell you--what is happening in North Korea. We saw children who are 16 \nand 17 whose growth and whose stature really represents somebody who is \n11 or 12. We saw young people marching out into the fields to plant \nsome kind of crops and to hunt for grubs. We saw no animals whatsoever, \nnot even a pigeon, not a dog, not a cow, not any kind of a farm \nanimal. Bark on the trees was taken off up to that height.\n\n  Do you know who is helping the North Koreans? It is the World Food \ngroup led by Catherine Bertini.\n  So the United States, what we do under a humanitarian banner is we \nsay, All right. We will contribute X amount of dollars. We will give it \nto the World Food organization. They, in turn, will buy grain on the \nopen market. They will give the grain, then, to the North Koreans. Is \nthere any real guarantee that they are going to use it for that? No. \nBut under the circumstances the situation was so dire that I think that \nhappened, to some degree.\n  So here we are expending money to the World Food group who, in turn, \nuses it to provide the humanitarian aid. I am not in a position to say \nthat we are going to say to North Korea that we are going to enter into \nany kind of trade negotiations. That is a very oppressive regime. It is \nprobably the most Stalinist, if I can use that word, I guess, regime in \nthe entire country. And Kim Chong-il, ``The Dear Leader,'' has no \nillusions otherwise. Now, however, we have the South Koreans making \novertures that if the North Koreans will finally behave themselves, \nthere might be a glimmer of change in North Korea. Could it well be \nthat we could use agriculture once again as a tool for peace? I do not \nknow. But the bottom line is that the President under this bill --under \nthe Dodd-Roberts bill, under the Dodd-Roberts-Hagel-Biden bill--has the \nauthority to come in and say, if this is in our national security--if, \nin fact, the export of terrorism is such that this is really something \nthat is not in our national interest, he can do so.\n\n[[Page S8218]]\n\n  Why on Earth on unilateral sanctions we continue to shoot ourselves \nin the foot and make agriculture and farmers and ranchers pay for this \nwhen the fact is it is not working is beyond me.\n  Again, I say this is not an effort by Senators in some kind of \ndisingenuous fashion to encourage terrorism, or to encourage rogue \nstates or pariah states. Nobody wants to do that. But when you have an \nopportunity to use agriculture again as a tool for peace, I think we \nought to do it.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to take this time. I thank my \ncolleagues for their indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I wonder if the \nSenator from Connecticut would yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Connecticut, it appears the \noperative language in the amendment--I hope this is the most current \nversion--says, ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nPresident shall not restrict or otherwise prohibit any exports \n(including financing) of food, other agricultural products (including \nfertilizer), medicines or medical equipment as part of any policy of \nexisting or future unilateral economic sanctions imposed against a \nforeign government.''\n  That is really the most operative paragraph of this amendment, is it \nnot?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in response to my colleague's question, that \nis correct. That is the language of the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The reason I raise that question is that during the \ncourse of the debate there have been some questions raised about \nwhether we are restricting the power of the United States to deal with \nquestions of terrorism and national security.\n  I want to ask the lead sponsor of this amendment to explain, if he \nwill, what he means in using the term ``unilateral economic \nsanctions.'' Do we, in fact, preclude this President, or any future \nPresident, if we adopt this amendment, from imposing sanctions for \npurposes of national security or national defense?\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely not, Mr. President; none whatsoever. To \ncharacterize the amendment as such is completely misleading, or as not \nto have read it at all. It only applies to unilateral economic \nsanctions. For instance, this amendment does nothing with regard to the \nmultilateral sanctions on Iraq. Those are not unilateral sanctions. \nThose are multilateral sanctions that apply to that country. So it only \napplies there. If the President, this President, or any future \nPresident, wants to apply sanctions on some basis other than economic, \nthey may utilize this tool. We are merely removing it from the \nunilateral economic sanctions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I could ask the Senator to give me a little more \ninformation, should this President, or any future President, decide \nthat another nation is guilty of terrorism against the citizens of the \nUnited States, and he seeks to apply sanctions against that country, \nwould that President be precluded from including in those sanctions a \nprohibition against shipping food and medicine?\n  Mr. DODD. None whatsoever, I say to my colleague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for making that \npoint clear, because I would like to join him and the Senator from \nKansas, as he says, in making a very clear record hear that none of us \nintend to in any way restrict the power of the President--this one, or \nany future President--to fight terrorism, or to stand firmly in \nopposition to nuclear proliferation or anything that might in any way \nassault the integrity of the United States or the integrity of any \nAmerican citizen.\n  I rise in support of this amendment that has been offered by Senator \nDodd, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, and Senator Biden in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  The seat that I usually occupy over here is a desk once occupied by \nSenator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. Senator Humphrey of Minnesota was \nfrom an agricultural State, and said in the darkest days of the cold \nwar when the United States was engaged in massive troop commitments in \nEurope to protect against the possible encroachment of communism, when \nwe were fixated in our foreign policy of the possibility of Soviet \nexpansionism, said that we should be willing to trade anything they \ncan't shoot back at us, and on that basis promoted the idea of \nagricultural trade.\n  You may remember visits by Nikita Khrushchev to the United States to \nfarms in Iowa during the midst of the cold war and the suggestions that \nwe should still engage in trade involving food with a nation that was, \nin fact, our mortal enemy, the U.S.S.R. A lot of us in the Farm Belt \nfelt that this was a reasonable means to provide some exchange not only \nof goods but of ideas. We felt that it also said to the average Soviet \ncitizen that the United States of America represented people who not \nonly had a bounty to share but were willing to do it despite our clear \npolitical differences.\n  Senator Humphrey inspired a policy which was followed by Democrats \nand Republicans for years. Soviet grain sales was a major source of \ndiscussion, even during the height of the cold war. I guess when \nPresident Reagan announced that the Soviet Union was the ``Evil \nEmpire,'' we were still dealing in grain. We believed we could deal in \nfood and still have a serious difference in terms of political \nphilosophy.\n  Does it make a difference? Are we kidding ourselves to believe that \nif American food products should be sent to another country it has any \nimpact? I think it does.\n  Eight years ago I went to India. Outside of Calcutta in a dusty \nlittle village I visited a site where some of America's agricultural \nproducts were being sent. It was a little facility where children--tiny \nlittle emaciated children--were being brought in for what, in effect, \nwas their best meal of the day. I looked, and was somewhat amused to \nfind that the bag of grain came from Peoria, IL. Imagine my pride that \nwhat we had grown in Peoria--the corn, soybeans, and wheat that was \nbrought in--was a food product being fed in a small village outside \nCalcutta. What we provided these children looked like some mass of \ndough. It was just these basic grains mixed with water and a little \nsugar. They ate it like they were on a trip to Baskin-Robbins. It was \nthe biggest treat of their lives. But before they ate the food from the \nUnited States, an interesting thing occurred. The person who was \nsupervising the feeding of these small children in this nutrition \ncenter asked the children to pause for a moment and bow their heads and \nsay a Hindu prayer of thanks to the United States for sending this \ngrain.\n  Does it make a difference? Would it make a difference in Libya, or in \nNorth Korea, for children and their parents to know that the people of \nthe United States were involved in either humanitarian aid or the sale \nof food? I think it does. I think it says something about us as a \nNation.\n  Look at the situation in North Korea. The Senator from Kansas has \nbeen there. I have not. But it had to be absolutely frightening to see \nthat sort of deprivation and famine in that struggle to survive.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is telling us in this amendment that the \nUnited States should establish standards when we push for our political \npolicies which define us to the world. I believe, as he does, that the \nexport of food and medicine should be above the political agenda. We \nare talking about the survival of children, of pregnant women, and of \ntheir families. As much as we may abhor that form of government that \nrules over those families, we should never be in a position where the \nUnited States has denied its bounty, its excess, to those who are in \nneed.\n  As I have traveled, I have noticed the need for medicine in some \ncountries around the world. Even those that have been liberated from \nthe Soviet Union--now new democracies--really have medical care which \nis at the lowest level. Many times the basic medicines which we have in \nsuch great supply in the United States could make a world of difference \nin terms of disease like cholera, diphtheria, and other problems that \nchildren suffer from around the world. And so I think what the \namendment seeks to do is to say that we will not deny to the children, \nin a country led by some dictator whom we might\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\ndisagree with, the basic protection of medicine.\n\n  This amendment really speaks to our values. This amendment draws a \nline in defining America to the world. This amendment says that we will \nnot show our hatred at the expense of innocent children. This amendment \nsays that when we apply unilateral economic sanctions, we have enough \nmuscle in so many other areas to make our political point that we need \nnot take it out on the most helpless in countries around the world.\n  I am happy to stand in support of this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to strongly oppose this amendment, and I believe that the \namendment has been mischaracterized, or at least the most reasonable \nreading of this amendment is different from the interpretation it has \nbeen given. If in fact it is the intention to have this amendment not \napply to applications for national security purposes or purposes of \npunishing those who have engaged in terrorist activities or other \nevents which were directed against the citizens or the society of the \nUnited States of America, then the amendment should be clarified, \nbecause the plain reading of the amendment on page 1 beginning at line \n14 states:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the President \n     shall not restrict or otherwise prohibit any exports \n     (including financing) of food, other agricultural products \n     (including fertilizer), medicines or medical equipment as \n     part of any policy of existing or future unilateral economic \n     sanctions imposed against a foreign government.\n\n  Now, the sanctions are the remedy for the action that has led us to \nbe in a state of opposition to that foreign government. The cause of \nthat might be that they were encouraging terrorism or they were engaged \nin activities that were considered to be a threat to our national \nsecurity.\n  The means of achieving that retaliation against a foreign government \nis a sanction, in this case an economic sanction. The economic sanction \nis not the reason that we are imposing; it is the means of the \nimposition. And so this language does not speak to the causation of why \nwe are imposing the sanction; it just says that whatever the cause, \nwhether it is terrorism, national security, or whatever reason, the \nPresident is prohibited from having as one of his arrows in the quiver \nof remedies an economic sanction that includes all of those items which \nare listed in this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my good friend and colleague yield on that point?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will yield for a question, yes.\n  Mr. DODD. It is a question.\n  Mr. President, the authors and I could not be more clear. This is \nunilateral economic sanctions, and clearly in the case of some \ncountries where we have applied that, food and medicine come off. Now, \nif the President wants to apply sanctions on some basis other than \neconomic sanctions, he has all the freedom to do so.\n  A wonderful example of that we have just debated over the last 2 \nweeks. Here India and Pakistan detonate two nuclear weapons. I do not \nknow what you could argue may be more threatening to the long-term \nsecurity of the United States than two nations detonating nuclear \nweapons. We voted 98 to nothing to take off food and medicine as a part \nof the sanctions policy there.\n\n  All I and my colleagues are saying here in this case is that if the \nPresident wants to impose sanctions on the basis of something other \nthan unilateral economic sanctions, he can do that without any \nrestriction of this amendment. But when he only goes to impose, or we \ngo to impose, Members of Congress--and we are far more guilty of this, \nby the way. Let's face it, we are talking about ourselves to some \ndegree, and we all know what goes on here. We have a proliferation of \nthese amendments. We all draft and issue the press releases to satisfy \nconstituencies in this country. That is what happens. And we apply \nunilateral economic sanctions and deny people food and medicine, and we \nthink that ought to stop, but not if you want to impose sanctions on \nbases other than economic and unilateral sanctions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't know what the question was.\n  Mr. DODD. That was a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. But clearly, the plain interpretation of the sentence \nthat I just read is that the remedy against whatever the cause might \nbe, whether it is nuclear proliferation, support of terrorists, attack \nagainst our national security, harboring drug traffickers, or whatever \nthe cause may be, we are just saying that, notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, we have denied from the President of the United \nStates as one of the remedies against that causation the use of \nunilateral economic sanctions when those sanctions include food, \nagricultural products, medicines, and medical equipment.\n  If that is not the intention, then I think the sponsors of this \namendment should offer a modification--and I believe that is now within \ntheir power to do so--to clearly state it is not intended that the use \nof food, agricultural products, medicines, and medical equipment not be \na restriction on the President's ability to use those products where \nthe causation is terrorism, causation is an attack against national \nsecurity, or some other cause. And then we could have a reasoned debate \non just what would be the reach of this amendment.\n  I might also say, I am concerned about the language of this amendment \nin that we have been focusing on food--wheat, corn, other products of \nhuman nutrition. But the language goes on to say ``other agricultural \nproducts (including fertilizer).''\n  Now, with that parenthetical, it seems to me that we are not to \nsanction not only food but other agricultural products, including those \nproducts which are used by that country in the production of its own \nindigenous agricultural food and fiber. That obviously would be the \nonly reason to specifically exempt fertilizer. What about seed? Would \nthat be an agricultural product against which the President could not \nimpose a sanction? Would tractors, combines, other of the mechanics and \nequipment of agricultural production be similarly excluded from the \nPresident's range of sanctions that could be used?\n  I believe the very fact that those questions are raised goes to one \nof the reasons that it is imprudent, at 7:50 p.m. on this Wednesday \nevening, for us to be considering this amendment. This amendment has \nbeen introduced as freestanding legislation. I assume it is before some \ncommittee of the Senate. The normal manner in which we would consider \nan issue of this importance would be to have a hearing, to have the \nlanguage subjected to close scrutiny, not just the kind of scrutiny \nthat can be provided here on the Senate floor by those of us who have \nan interest in and some knowledge of this matter, and a genuine public \ndebate. After the idea has withstood that kind of inquiry, then it is \nmature to come to the Senate for consideration, for adoption, adoption \nthat would reverse three to four decades of powers which the President \nof the United States has been granted by this Congress in order to \nachieve important U.S. national objectives.\n\n  It is also ironic that we are doing this at this time, when we have \nrecently established a separate task force whose purpose will be to \nreview our current sanctions policy and to bring to us their reasoned \njudgments as to what we should do. It seems to me that prudence would \nindicate that the appropriate thing to do would be to at least wait \nuntil that group that we have just established has an opportunity to \ncomplete its work and give us the benefit of its recommendation, as to \nwhat our policy should be in this area.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield, yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The Senator has indicated we are rushing to judgment \nhere. I would only point out that in 30 years every agricultural group, \nevery farm group, every commodity organization, everybody connected \nwith every hunger organization has been pointing out the insensitivity \nand the counterproductivity of unilateral sanctions with food and \nmedicine.\n  I have some figures here from 1995. I don't have them yet for 1996, \nbut they are very similar. U.S. sanctions cost an estimated $15 to $20 \nbillion of lost exports. One way or other, I guess my question to the \nSenator would be: Would you support a sanction indemnity payments for \nthose industries or\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\nthose businesses who have suffered the losses, through no fault of \ntheir own, more especially agriculture?\n  I don't know how we fund--I know how we fund it. We do it. We could \ndeclare it an emergency. As a matter of fact, that is one of the \nproposals that was being talked about, in terms of the package put \ntogether by the folks across the aisle, and some of us over here, on \ndown the road.\n  We can't go on like this. I hope, after 30 years of this debate, I \nwould hope the wheat growers, the corn growers, the barley growers, the \ncattlemen, the pork producers--the Senator's State of Florida is a \ntremendous State in regard to agriculture output. I hope these farm \ngroups have met with the Senator.\n  Would the Senator be in a position to help us support some kind of \nsanction indemnity payment, given the situation?\n  I am not even talking about the humanitarian aspects of this. But we \nhave sanctions now on 75 percent of the world's population. We just \ncan't go on like this. So, consequently, I think this is a step in the \nright direction. Rather than do it piecemeal, each country by country--\nas the Senator from Connecticut so aptly pointed out, 98 to 0, and we \njust had a UC bill pass here in regards to India and Pakistan because \nthey were counterproductive.\n  I think the Senator is obviously concerned about an island not too \nfar from his State and I am concerned about that.\n  I would just pose the question. Would he support sanction indemnity \npayments?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I say to the Senator, that is one of many of the kinds of \nquestions that I would assume this bipartisan commission, which is just \ncommencing its review of our current sanctions policy, will be looking \nat.\n  I am not prepared tonight, nor do I feel myself competent tonight, to \nrespond to the Senator's question as to whether we should have an \naddendum to our policy that relates to indemnification. But I am \ncertain tonight that we also do not know enough to say that we ought to \nchange 40 years of U.S. policy by adopting this amendment which has not \nbeen subjected, to my knowledge, to the first hour of serious Senate \nhearing consideration.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. One more question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I appreciate the indulgence of my friend and colleague. \nI just want to point out that after every sanction, after every \nembargo, after every hindrance to every export program that we have \nhad, we have had hearing after hearing after hearing in the House \nAgriculture Committee. I was privileged to be the chairman of that \ncommittee for 2 years. I have attended more hearings, more discussions, \nmore farm meetings, been to more farm organization resolution meetings \nin State after State, to do something about a clear, comprehensive \nexport policy that wards off these very counterproductive embargoes--\nand is simply misdirected. We have ample, ample evidence that this does \nnot work.\n  I am on the sanctions task force. I went to the first meeting. We \nhave taken some rifleshot reforms here that are sorely needed right \nnow. It doesn't take away from the sanctions task force and their \noverall approach, to see if Senator Lugar's bill is appropriate, or \nSenator Dodd's bill, Senator Biden, Senator Hagel, myself--to look back \non sanctions. That is the appropriate agenda in regard to the task \nforce. But I can assure the Senator, in terms of voluminous hearings ad \nnauseum, because of the hurt it has caused in farm  country that we \nhave had ample hearings.\n\n  I didn't ask the Senator a question, except to say I truly appreciate \nhim yielding. I will cease and desist at this point.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am sorry that we didn't have a question, but the \nSenator has moved me to point 2 of my remarks, which is the \nundercurrent of much of this debate, where we focus on the poor, \nparticularly the hungry children. Everyone is moved by those emotions. \nThere is a natural humanitarian concern about people, particularly \ninnocent people, being denied access to the basic necessities of life.\n  What offends me is the assumption that it is the U.S. embargo policy, \nwhether it is against Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Cuba, or whatever rogue \nstate, that is the cause of that impoverishment. This is a return to \nthat classic ``Let's blame America first'' argument. Let's find out \nwhat is wrong with the world and then let's blame the United States of \nAmerica for being responsible.\n  The person who is responsible for the economic conditions in Cuba is \nnot sitting in this room and is not residing at 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue. The person who is responsible for Cuba's impoverishment is \nnamed Fidel Castro and he lives in Havana. Whether we do or do not \nadopt this amendment tonight, he still is going to be living in Havana \nand he still is going to be following discredited economic policies. He \nis still going to be following a personal attitude of disrespect to his \nown people. He still is going to be following authoritarian dictates--\nbecause he wants to stay in power.\n  So, Mr. President, the idea that we have to blame America first and \nfind ourselves to be at fault for the poverty and the misery of the \npoor, particularly the young and the halt and the elderly, in these \nrogue nations, I reject and I find to be offensive personally, I find \nto be offensive to the values of the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, let me move to the third point, if I could, and that \nis I do want to speak specifically.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask for one short question. I know I am \nbatting, now, for the third time. If the Senator would indulge me?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is going to be a question at the end of this \nstatement?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I can promise the Senator there will be a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I look forward to the question.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It is a question I know the Senator will respond to in \nan affirmative way because it makes so much sense.\n  What would happen if we added a new section to the second-degree \namendment that is pending at the desk, stating something like this:\n  ``The President may retain or impose sanctions covered by this bill, \nsections (B) and (C), if he determines that retaining or imposing such \nsanctions would further U.S. national security interests.''\n  I had thought about listing some of the concerns that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey and the Senator from Florida have indicated, but I \nthought better of that, and put a blanket situation here--U.S. national \nsecurity interests. Obviously, the export of terrorism would be \nincluded. Obviously, I think, some of the concerns that have been \nraised by the Senator from Florida would be included.\n  Would the Senator be amenable to considering something like that?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think the Senator's question makes the first point I \nmade, and that is the inappropriateness of trying to write a piece of \nlegislation that is as nuanced and delicate as this on the floor. I \npointed out what I thought was clearly an interpretation that said that \nwhatever the cause, we were going to be denying as a remedy the use of \nunilateral economic sanctions which included this prescribed list of \nfood, agricultural products, medicine and medical equipment. Now the \nSenator is suggesting that he doesn't really want to go as far as this \nlanguage and would like to say, at least in the area of national \nsecurity, that we don't have to deal with our enemies.\n  I think, personally, that is too narrow a construction. I think there \nare a variety of types of activities that the President of the United \nStates, with the authorization of Congress, ought to be able to \nsanction in the most severe possible way, including denying them the \nproducts that are listed in this legislation.\n  I don't think we ought to try to write that on the Senate floor at \nnow 8 o'clock at night. This is exactly the type of considered judgment \nthat we would say in this great deliberative body ought to be \ndeliberated in an appropriate committee with appropriate public input.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I take it the Senator's answer is no.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think my answer would be no, and my reason would be \npoint 1 of my remarks. I am now about to move to point 3 of my remarks.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Then this gift horse will ride back into the sunset and \nwithdraw the offer.\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would be very happy if this amendment would ride into \nthe sunset as long as it didn't return.\n  Point 3 does relate specifically to Cuba which is an object case of \nthe point 2, which is that the reason that Cuba is in its desperate \neconomic circumstances is not to be blamed on the United States and our \npolicy, it is to be blamed on Fidel Castro. The reason it didn't happen \n20 or 30 years earlier is because as long as there was a Soviet Union, \nthe Soviet Union was subsidizing Cuba to the extent of 20 to 30 percent \nof its gross domestic product. When the Soviet Union collapsed in the \nlate eighties, its ability to continue to provide that kind of subsidy \nto Cuba also collapsed and all of the underlying inadequacies of a \nstatist, Communist economic policy surfaced.\n  For us to say that we are responsible for the impoverishment of the \nCuban people because we have denied them access to food, agricultural \nproducts, medicine and medical equipment, I think, is, frankly, absurd \nand an affront to the people of the United States of America. It is \nFidel Castro who has placed his people in that condition, not the \npeople of the United States.\n  Maybe the most dramatic example of that, just a few years ago when \nour colleague and visionary, the Senator from New Jersey, was a Member \nof the House of Representatives, he sponsored legislation which \nestablished the modern U.S. embargo policy relative to Cuba. I am \npleased to say that I was honored to be the Senate sponsor of that \nlegislation.\n  In that legislation, medicine was excluded from the commercial \nsanction against Cuba. There is a license policy required in order for \na Cuban entity to purchase medicines from the United States, but that \nis available.\n  Do you know what has happened in the intervening now some 5 years \nsince that access to commercial purchases of U.S. medicines by Cuba has \nbeen in effect? What has happened is zero has happened, because Cuba \nhas not availed itself of this opportunity it had. Why hasn't it \navailed itself? I suggest primarily because Fidel Castro has some \nhigher priorities in terms of his use of Cuban resources, like \ncontinuing to fund one of the most oppressive state police in the \nworld, continuing to try to maintain what is left of a military \ncapability. Those have all had higher priorities and, therefore, there \nwere little resources left to use the special access through license \npolicy for U.S. medicines.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Will the Senator from Florida yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senator from Florida makes a valuable point that \nsomehow the responsibility for the economic ailments of failing Marxist \ngovernments incredibly is being placed on the U.S. Senate. The reason \nthat there is hunger in Cuba and North Korea is because their systems \nhave failed.\n  I recognize that in the great farm belts of America, there is \ntremendous frustration and suffering because of the farm crisis. But it \nis not frank, it is not fair to the American farmer to suggest that if \nthe United States abandons its human rights policies and its economic \nembargoes on these terrorist governments, that is the salvation for the \nAmerican farmer.\n  As my friend and colleague from Florida stated, the per capita income \nof Cuba is $300. Cuba has 7 days' worth of foreign exchange. Just how \nmuch wheat or corn does the Senator from Kansas believe Fidel Castro \nwill be buying? North Korea has no foreign exchange at all. Nothing. \nThe Sudan has a per capita income of $100 per year. These are not \ncountries that are markets for American farm products.\n  I share the concern of our colleagues from the Midwest of the plight \nof the American farmer, but believing that we can compromise our \npolicies on terrorism or for human rights by offering sales to nations \nthat have no resources is a false promise and, what is more, simply \ncontradicts the facts.\n  The Senator from Florida has said it right. There is blame for these \nfailing economies and the fact the poor are suffering, but it is not \nhere. The Senator from Florida was my cosponsor in offering in the \nSenate the Cuban Democracy Act which is the foundation for the current \nembargo against Cuba. He should be proud of everything that he did \nbecause, indeed, as is now the case with the Sudan and with North Korea \nand with Iraq and with Cuba, we have assured that the poor, on a \nhumanitarian basis, will get food even though they can't buy it.\n  That policy now will be undermined by offering to sell these products \nto people who can't buy it. I think the Senator from Florida has made \nthe case persuasively. Thank you for yielding.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you. I appreciate those kind remarks, and no one is \nmore dedicated to the freedom of the people of Cuba than is our friend \nand colleague from New Jersey. He has demonstrated that dedication time \nand time again.\n  As he said in his earlier remarks, not only are we not the source of \nthe blame of the impoverishment of the people of Cuba, in fact, the \nUnited States, both governmentally but primarily through the generosity \nof its people, has provided through donations more humanitarian \nassistance to Cuba in the last 4 years than the foreign aid of all \nother governments in the world combined. Now to say blame America \nfirst, make us the object and the source of Cuba's poverty is an \naffront.\n  My final point is that by adopting this policy, we will also be \nmissing the opportunity to adopt a policy that has the potential of \nmaking a significant difference in terms of the U.S. national interest, \nbut more importantly the human interest of the people living in Cuba.\n  What is that policy? It is also one to which the Senator from New \nJersey alluded in his opening remarks, and that is a policy that says: \nLet us increase the opportunities for the people of the United States \nwith modest Government assistance to join that philanthropy to provide \nhumanitarian needs to the people of Cuba. But instead of being done on \na commercial basis, which means that Fidel Castro will be in control of \nwhat is purchased and how it is distributed and how it is used to \neither reward or punish activities which the state considers to be \nbeneficial, let us use the nongovernmental organizations, such as the \nreligious organizations in Cuba, to be the means of distributing the \nhumanitarian products. Let us use that as a means of assuring that this \nhumanitarian effort will not be perverted for political goals.\n  Let us use it as a means of increasing the strength of those \nnongovernmental organizations, because they will play a critical role \ntoday in the life of the people of Cuba, attempting to lift some of the \nburden which Fidel Castro has imposed upon those people. Those same \nnongovernmental organizations will play a critical role during the \nperiod of transition in Cuba.\n  One of the key questions for the United States is not whether there \nwill be change in Cuba. Of course there will be change. No one can tell \nyou exactly the hour and the date of that change, but that it will come \nis assured. What we do not know is whether that change will be more \nlike Czechoslovakia, a ``velvet revolution,'' relatively without \nbloodshed or conflict, or whether it will be more like the nation whose \nhead of state spoke to us earlier today, Romania, where thousands of \npeople were injured or killed during the course of the transition from \nan authoritarian to a democratic government.\n  I believe the nongovernmental organizations in Cuba will play a \ncritical role in facilitating a peaceful transition and that by using \nthem rather than, as this amendment would propose to do, the Government \nof Cuba, as the instrument for the distribution of humanitarian \nassistance, we have the opportunity to strengthen and elevate those \nnongovernmental organizations.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. For a question.\n  Mr. DODD. I think I have a question at the end of this one.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from Florida is very familiar with \nCardinal Ortega, who is the leading Catholic figure on the island of \nCuba. I know he knows who he is, and is aware of the recent visit by \nHis Holiness, Pope John Paul II, when he was in Cuba in January. \nObviously, my colleague is well aware, as well, of the position of the \nU.S. Catholic Conference with regard to lifting the sanctions on food \nand medicine.\n  I say and raise the question, certainly we all, I think, would know--\nand my colleague, I presume, would agree--\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\nthat Castro, Fidel Castro, has no greater enemy on the island of Cuba, \nor anywhere, for that matter, than Cardinal Ortega, yet is it not the \nfact that Cardinal Ortega, the Catholic Conference, and in fact His \nHoliness, Pope John Paul II, has called for the lifting of restrictions \non food and medicine sales when it comes to Cuba?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I believe it is even more broad. I believe they have \nadvocated a total lifting of the U.S. embargo.\n  Mr. DODD. I am only referring to this particular proposal.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. They would not be constrained to the items included in \nthis amendment. They would advocate a total lifting of the embargo \nagainst Cuba.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, is the answer to the question, regarding \nfood and medicine, Cardinal Ortega has called for the lifting of the \nban on food and medicine?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. As well as every other aspect of the embargo. And with \ngreat respect, I believe that the policy that says, rather than lift \nthe embargo, strengthen Fidel Castro, with no real prospects, with a \ncountry so impoverished as Cuba, that they are going to be able to \ncompete in the commercial market to buy agricultural products--why \naren't they buying medicines today? They have been authorized to do it \nfor 5 years, and yet they have not availed themselves.\n  The reason is probably that it is not a high enough priority of Fidel \nCastro to use his limited resources to buy antibiotics. He would rather \nbuy equipment that his military and secret police can use to suppress \nthe people. There is no expectation he is going to use any availability \nof the commercial purchase of foods to any greater extent that he has \nused his potential of commercial purchase of medicines.\n  What I think does offer hope is to encourage a policy of U.S. private \ncitizen, with limited Government support, philanthropy through \nnongovernmental organizations to the people of Cuba, both to meet and \nalleviate some of their current deprivations and build up some \ninstitutions that will help in the transition in Cuba.\n  Mr. President, for those four stated reasons, I believe this \namendment, well intended as it might be, is inappropriate for our \nconsideration at 8:14 p.m. on the evening of July the 15th. I hope that \nit will be the wisdom of the U.S. Senate, if we are given the \nopportunity, to set this aside through a motion to table, and that we \nwould see the wisdom of that opportunity and then would look to the \nbipartisan commission on sanctions as well as the standard traditional \nprocesses of deliberation in the Senate as a means to fully explore \nwhether we, in fact, want to change a 40-year policy of the use of \neconomic sanctions against some of the most rapacious or rogue states \non this planet.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  I rise this evening to strongly support the amendment by Senators \nDodd, Warner, Roberts, Hagel, and myself, which would exclude food and \nmedicine sales from existing trade sanctions.\n  As one who has growing concern about the use of unilateral sanctions \nto accomplish various foreign policy and other goals, I am very pleased \ntonight that we are considering this very important measure. Food and \nmedicine should not be used as a weapon in our disputes with leaders of \nother countries. As we have seen repeatedly, and as we have heard \nrepeatedly on the floor of the Senate here tonight, withholding food \nand medicine does nothing but hurt the people whom we are trying to \nhelp in these countries.\n  The leaders, such as Fidel Castro, are always going to have access to \nthese necessities. They are going to get the food, the shelter, the \nmedicine, the care that they need. But inclusion of food and medicine \nin embargoes or in sanctions only makes the choices fewer for the \nresidents of those countries and the prices higher for the average \ncitizen.\n  I simply do not believe that anyone in this body can tell me this is \na prudent policy in any country of the world. As just referred to here \na few moments ago, somehow we are blaming the U.S. Senate or the United \nStates for the problems in countries such as Cuba. We do not blame the \nUnited States for the bad economy. We know that that is Cuba's problem. \nThat is Fidel Castro's making and his problem. But we are here tonight \ntrying only to address the needs of the peoples of those countries and \ndo it in a very humanitarian way, and not to use food and medicine as a \nweapon in our foreign policy arsenal.\n  It was also said by the Senator from Florida just a few moments ago--\nhe said that we should have held hearings on a bill like this, that we \nshould not be writing this kind of an amendment on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate tonight.\n  But I think he knows very well that Senator Dodd and I, for many \nweeks, tried to schedule hearings. I am the subcommittee chairman of \nthe subcommittee of jurisdiction in the Banking Committee over this \nbill. We requested numerous times--we held meetings with opponents of \nthis legislation trying to get a time when we could hold the hearing to \nbring out the concerns and to help write legislation and bring it out \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  Those who are opponents of this bill are not only opposed to it \ntonight, but they have been opposed to it and would not allow us--now, \nI do not know how often that happens, but the opportunity to even hold \na hearing was blocked. There have been many, many, many other attempts \nand meetings to try to hold a hearing on this very bill, this very \namendment, and to try to work out the differences that we might have.\n  But for those who will say that food and medicine can still be \ndonated as well under these embargoes, I respond by stating that the \nlicensing process that donators have to go through is so time-consuming \nand it is so cumbersome that it simply is a process that does not work. \nWhat has resulted is fewer donations. Improving the distribution system \nis not going to work as well. We need the certainty of free market \nsales, unencumbered by Government regulations or dictation and \ndirection.\n  Certainly, we do not need the Congress to be involved in implementing \nfood and medicine distribution in any countries, as has been suggested \nhere in the past. We need to help our farmers and medical supply \ncompanies preserve their excellent reputations globally. Why earn them \nthe reputation again of being an unreliable supplier by continuing to \ninclude them in our sanctions? American farmers are still suffering \nfrom the effects of the Russian grain embargo from the late 1970s. As \nwe heard, they got the reputation of being unreliable suppliers. And it \nhurt the farm economy for many, many years following that.\n  You have heard the statistic often in the past few days--over 60 \nsanctions have been imposed by this Congress and by this \nadministration. They are based on the laws that we have passed. They \ntarget some 70 countries, and the numbers affect from one-third to two-\nthirds of the world's population. It is no wonder that our agricultural \nproducers and most of the business community have united to oppose \nthese unilateral sanctions. Why would other countries consider us \nreliable suppliers in the future if we continue to have this kind of a \nrecord, to hurt ourselves, to hurt our economy, to hurt our jobs, and \nnot to accomplish the goals we have?\n  If these sanctions, or these unilateral sanctions, could produce the \nvery type of reforms that we were asking or that we thought should be \nmade, I think everybody in this Senate would line up behind it and vote \nfor it tonight. But over 30 years we have seen that these types of \nsanctions and embargoes just do not work. All they do is have the exact \nopposite effect of hurting our farmers, our businesses, our jobs, our \neconomy, and they also do not provide the type of health and \nhumanitarian relief to the people of these countries suffering under \nthese types of regimes.\n  Why would other countries consider us reliable suppliers in the \nfuture if we continue this kind of record? Right now we have pending, \njust pending, 26 unilateral sanctions--unilateral, just the United \nStates, nobody else coming into this. When we talk about the Iraq \nsanctions and how we have lifted and allowed them to sell oil to meet \nsome of their needs with food and medicine, that was a world community \neffort\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\nthat put pressure to allow this to happen. We cannot get our allies to \nsupport this type of sanctions or embargo. The world community doesn't \nsupport it. Many in the Senate do not support it.\n  There are 11 other bills that could target an unlimited number of \ncountries, as well. One is the pending religious persecution sanctions \nbill which alone targets over another 100 countries.\n  Now, in my judgment, sanctions will only accomplish their intended \ngoal if they are applied, again, multilaterally. Anything short of that \nis bound to fail. The only result, then, again, is that our farmers, \nour workers, are going to suffer, not the leaders. Fidel Castro is not \ngoing to suffer. Fidel Castro is not going to move out of that office \none day sooner because of these sanctions. In fact, he has probably \nstayed in office much too long because of this type of action.\n  This is an important amendment which follows the commitment that we \nmade yesterday, and that is to try to help our farmers and other \nbusinesses expand markets abroad. I urge my colleagues to strongly \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this evening to strongly support \nthis amendment. We have heard a number of dynamics--issues, good \nquestions, relevant questions--about what is being attempted in this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, we are not talking about some revolutionary change in \nour foreign policy here. What we are talking about is what works. We \nare talking about common sense, relevance. There has been much talk \ntonight about humanitarian issues, human rights, trade, foreign policy, \nnational security, all wrapped up into this debate.\n  But my goodness, Mr. President, as we are about to embark on a new \ncentury, a new millennium, the greatest power on the Earth, the \ngreatest power the world has ever seen, are we to rely on embargoing \nmedicine and food to leverage and implement our policy and our position \nin the word? I don't think so. We are better than that.\n  We have heard much conversation tonight about unilateral sanctions, \nmultilateral sanctions. The world has changed, shifted. There is no \nnation on Earth today that can't get medicine and food, commodities, \nservices, products, somewhere else. They don't need to go through the \nUnited States. So, in fact, what are we doing? Are we isolating some \nother country? Are we isolating a leader? No; we are isolating \nourselves. We are isolating our farmers. We are isolating our ranchers, \nour producers, our people, our future, our growth. And for what? We are \nnot compromising our national security when we talk about these issues \nof medicine and food. We are not exchanging trade for security. We have \ngotten a little off focus here this evening in some of this debate, a \nlittle bit off focus.\n  Foreign policy is about dynamic change, about a world of great \nchange, a world of hope and opportunity. It is about our role in the \nworld and how we best position ourselves in the world to make our \npoint.\n  The question always comes back to, How best do we do that? How best \ndo we leverage what we have? What works? Does withholding food and \nmedicine work? Well, look around; look around. This is not some fly-by-\nnight quick deal that we are talking about here. We have debated these \nissues.\n  My colleagues have talked about efforts, which I have been part of, \nto get hearings. Again, I go back to one point of reality here: This is \nnot a revolutionary shift in policy. And if, in fact, we are to enlist \nmore allies and do what America has always done--defend and enhance \nmore liberty for more people--we come back to the question of how we do \nthat. Does trade and commerce improve people's lives? Does it open \nsocieties? I think history has answered that rather clearly.\n  Yes, I am from a Midwestern State. I am from a large agriculture \nexporting State. That is important. Those interests are important. But \nthere is not a farmer in Nebraska who is saying, ``I would trade \nAmerica's national interests in the world'' --or even entertaining that \nbargain--``for selling more corn or beef.'' So let's not mislead anyone \nhere tonight that that is the trade. That is not the trade here. That \nis not what we are talking about. We are talking about what works and \nwho is really penalized here.\n  I can go through a list. You all know about what has happened when \nwheat embargoes have been put on. President Nixon in 1973 banned \nsoybean exports. What has that done? Well, it has made Brazil a very \nsignificant soybean producer, is what it has done. I have pages of \nthese things to talk about, specifically narrow, focused issues on \nagriculture and medicine. But in the interest of time and the interest \nof good judgment, so that my colleagues won't be completely offended by \nthis debate, suffice it to say that this is a debate about the totality \nand the completeness of what encompasses foreign policy, and trade is \npart of that--trade is part of it--and how we best work our way in to \nnations that don't have the same values and standards and morals and \nrespect for rights as we do.\n  I close by a point I made at the beginning of my remarks. A great \npower, the greatest power on Earth, this Nation that has done so much \nfor so many for so long, should not need to rely on embargoes for food \nand medicine to implement and further our policy.\n  I hope my colleagues look at this in the completeness of how we, who \nhave offered this, intend it to be viewed and would support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today as a strong supporter and \nprincipal cosponsor of this important amendment sponsored by my friend \nand colleague, Senator Dodd.\n  This amendment would exclude the export (including financing) of \nfood, other agricultural commodities, medicines and medical equipment \nfrom any unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States.\n  In recent weeks, we have heard over and over again here on the Senate \nfloor, on the weekend talk shows and in the editorial pages of numerous \nnewspapers how unilateral sanctions on the export of agricultural \ncommodities, medicine and medical equipment primarily hurts American \nproducers of those producers.\n  Also, in most cases, the prohibition or restriction on the sales of \nfood, medicine and medical equipment in order to punish a foreign \ngovernment harms the general population in the targeted country rather \nthan that country's leadership.\n  Gary Hufbauer--a renowned expert on the issue of sanctions--made that \nvery point in his recent article in the Washington Post. He stated:\n\n       . . . economic sanctions can inflict pain on innocent \n     people while at the same time increasing the grip of the \n     leaders we despise. When sanctions are applied broadside--as \n     against Haiti, Cuba and Iraq--the hardest hit are the most \n     vulnerable: the poor, the very young, the very old and the \n     sick. Left unharmed, and often strengthened, are the real \n     targets: the political military and economic elites.\n\n  Finally, unilateral sanctions on food and medicine rarely achieve the \ngoal of having the targeted nation alter its actions or policies. In \nlight of that, I believe it is time to stop using food and medicine as \na foreign policy weapon.\n  As a member of the recently established Sanctions Task Force, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the broader issue of reviewing \non the broader issue of reviewing the overall U.S. sanctions policy.\n  However, I believe that is appropriate at this time to proceed with \nthis amendment to exempt food and medicine--what I consider \nhumanitarian products--from unilateral U.S. economic sanctions.\n  Mr. President, Senator Dodd and I have been working towards this goal \nfor a considerable time. Our former colleague, Senator Wallop of \nWyoming, has been a valued resource for facts which compel this action. \nLikewise, a number of Cuban Americans have urged this goal. The time is \nnow.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this issue has now been debated at \ngreat length. And having listened to so many of my colleagues, for my \nown part, I wanted only to respond to several things that have been \nsaid and then leave the issue with the Senate.\n  It is being suggested that somehow the idea of economic sanctions is \nsome aberration of policy, inconsistent with our values, inappropriate \nin the final years of the 20th century. I want to remind my colleagues \nthat the American effort to impose economic sanctions\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nbegan with Woodrow Wilson, after the Great War, as an alternative to \nmilitary conflict. So many lives had been lost and the war was so \nsenseless that we began this 20th century with a commitment that this \nwas the better alternative. I don't believe that Members of this Senate \nhave been dissuaded from that view, given the outrageous conduct by \nterrorist states and facing the choice of military attack or expressing \nour outrage by separating them out of the international trading \ncommunity. Sanctions are the better choice.\n  Contrary to the statements of my friend, the Senator from Nebraska, \nthe record is replete that they do succeed. How many Soviet Jews would \nhave left Russia had it not been for Jackson-Vanik? What cooperation \nwould we have had from Vietnam in finding POW crash sites if it hadn't \nbeen for sanctions? Where would North Korea had been now in stopping \nthe development of atomic weapons if not for sanctions? Where would we \nbe in negotiating with Qadhafi for the killers of Pan Am 103 if not for \nsanctions? Indeed, would Fidel Castro have had the Pope in Havana if \nthere had not been sanctions? They are not always perfect, but they are \nthe better alternative to military action.\n  My friend Senator Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, asked the \nrhetorical question whether or not there would be an impact on national \nsecurity. What an easy vote to cast on this floor. But what a difficult \nthing it would be to face if tomorrow morning Castro, Saddam Hussein, \nand Qadhafi found that the sum and the substance of America's economic \nboycott on principle against their regime had been destroyed. Thirty \nyears of American foreign policy is on the line. Without a hearing, \nwithout the administration being heard, without an alternative being \noffered, the sum and substance of American foreign policy would be \ntaken off the books.\n  I suggested earlier in a colloquy with my friend from Florida, \nSenator Graham, that I know why it is being done. I understand the \nfrustration of our colleagues from the Middle West. But the suffering \nof American farmers is addressed by changing American farm policy, not \nchanging American foreign policy. These are the poorest nations in the \nworld. It is not fair to the American farmer to say that plummeting \nprices and failing farms are going to be answered by ending the embargo \non Cuba, where the average person makes $300 a year, or the Sudan, or \nNorth Korea. These are poor, small nations, without the ability to buy. \nIf they had the ability to buy farm products, they would be buying them \nfrom Argentina, Australia, or France, or other American competitors. \nBut they are buying from no one, because they have nothing.\n  Let's at least be honest about the debate. This will not add up to \none dime of American farm sales. It is a political answer for an \neconomic problem. I suspect that the numbers would bear me out that my \nState of New Jersey manufactures as much in the gross value of \npharmaceutical products as the State of Nebraska and the State of \nKansas produce in agricultural products. Every major pharmaceutical \ncompany in America is in my State. I have never heard one \npharmaceutical executive or one worker suggest that we should give in \nto Qadhafi on Pan Am 103, or the political prisoners in Cuba, or \nterrorism in Syria or Sudan because of a market opportunity--not one. \nAnd I don't believe that your farmers feel any differently than my \npharmaceutical executives.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a second? We are going to have \na vote in 10 minutes. I haven't had a chance yet. I made opening \nremarks, but I wanted to speak again.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I wanted to ask a question, if I could, and then I \nwill yield to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  In my reading of the Senator's amendment, not only would it be \nlifting these restrictions on food, but also on pharmaceutical \nproducts, including medical devices, and including the financing of \nfood; is that accurate?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Well, let me conclude, and then I will allow the \nSenator from Connecticut to end on his amendment, as is only right and \nappropriate.\n  I don't know how a Member of this Senate tomorrow morning could call \nthe families of the victims of Pan Am 103, who are now suing to get \nfinancial reimbursement for the loss of their loved ones from Qadhafi, \nand now suggest that we are going to be financing food exports to Libya \nor Cuba. Not only are we not selling, but we will be financing.\n  This brings us back to where we were with Saddam Hussein when the \ngulf war started. How could we explain to any American that, while \nAmerican soldiers were having to fight in Iraq, Iraqi soldiers were \neating food not only made in the United States but financed by American \ntaxpayers? That would be returned to. Senator Graham and I specifically \nprohibited medical devices because there was evidence that Fidel Castro \nwas using medical devices made in the United States to torture and \ninterrogate prisoners in Cuba. That is the sum and substance of what \nthe Senate faces.\n  I apologize to the Senator for consuming so much time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I yield to my colleague from \nKansas for a modification he wishes to make.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3159, As Modified\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification in the \nbest interests of the Senators who have expressed strong opposition to \nthis legislation. Obviously, they have some additional concerns that \nhave been expressed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment, and the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3159), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word in the pending amendment an \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       ``(A) Findings.--(1) Prohibiting or otherwise restricting \n     the donations or sales of food, other agricultural products, \n     medicines or medical equipment in order to sanction a foreign \n     government for actions or policies that the United States \n     finds objectionable unnecessarily harms innocent populations \n     in the targetted country and rarely causes the sanctioned \n     government to alter its actions or policies.\n       (2) For the United States as a matter of U.S. policy to \n     deny access to United States food, other agricultural \n     products, medicines and medical equipment by innocent men, \n     women and children in other countries weakens the \n     international leadership and moral authority of the United \n     States.\n       (3) Sanctions on the sale or donations of American food, \n     other agricultural products, medicine or medical equipment \n     needlessly harm American farmers and workers employed in \n     these sectors by foreclosing markets for these United States \n     products.\n       (B)(1) Exclusion From Sanctions.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the President shall not restrict or \n     otherwise prohibit any exports (including financing) of food, \n     other agricultural products (including fertilizer), medicines \n     or medical equipment as part of any policy of existing or \n     future unilateral economic sanctions imposed against a \n     foreign government.\n       (2) Exceptions.--Section (B)(1) of this section shall not \n     apply to any regulations or restrictions with respect to such \n     products for health or safety purposes or during periods of \n     domestic shortages of such products.\n       (C) The President may retain or impose sanctions covered \n     under (B)(1) if he determines that retaining or imposing such \n     sanctions would further U.S. national security interests.\n       (D) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect one day \n     after the date of enactment of this section into law.''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have sat here patiently listening to a lot \nof rhetoric associated with this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I hope that at some point someone will explain what that \nmodification is. But this question relates to a different issue.\n  One of the typical restraints that the United States has imposed on \nthe sale of food and medicine to suspect countries has been that there \nhas to be an independent source of distribution so that the food and \nmedicine will not be, as allegedly has occurred in North Korea, \ndiverted just to feed the soldiers and let the civilian population \nstarve.\n  In light of that, I am concerned with the language on line 15, where \nit states that ``the President shall not restrict or otherwise prohibit \nany exports,'' and then it lists the items.\n  Would this mean that the President could not impose a restriction, \nsuch as the requirement that, yes, we will provide food and medicine, \nbut in a manner that will assure that the people for whose good we \nintended it to be utilized will be fed, will be medicated, not\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\nthe elite or those elements of the society that are serving to oppress \nthe people? Would the President be prohibited from making those kinds \nof restrictions?\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague for the question. If I thought for a \nsingle second that anything I might offer in this amendment would win \nhis support, I would engage it with a higher degree of seriousness.\n  Obviously, I can be confident that any American President would want \nto make sure that any program we were endorsing on the sale of food and \nmedicine was going to maximize the potential for it to reach the \nintended consumer, and that is the innocent people in these \ncountries. But let me, if I can, come back to some points that have \nbeen made here over the last hour and a half or so.\n\n  First of all, we have heard about Lockerbie. I take a backseat to no \none in my sense of outrage, nor do any of my colleagues who support \nthis amendment, over the grotesque and violent shooting down of Pan Am \nFlight 103 that caused such a tremendous loss of life over Lockerbie, \nScotland.\n  But let me take Libya off the table. There are multilateral sanctions \nagainst Libya. There is nothing in this bill that affects Pan Am Flight \n103. And to suggest so is to not have read the amendment nor to \nunderstand the sanctions regimen against Libya. It is multilateral \nsanctions. This bill is unilateral sanctions only on economics.\n  So to raise the prospect of the tragedy over Lockerbie in the face of \nthis amendment is either not to understand what exists in Libya or not \nto understand what this amendment proposes. So Libya is not in play at \nall.\n  I point out that many of my colleagues over the last few days have \nindicated their own strong feelings on the subject of the use of food \nand medicine as a tool of our sanctions policy with unilateral economic \nsanctions. My colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, quoting him in his \nremarks of the day during the debate on Pakistan and India, and I \nquote: ``Cutting ourselves off through unilateral sanctions seldom \nbenefits us as a nation, and almost always hurts the producer. Food \nshould never be used as a tool of foreign policy.''\n  Our colleague from Montana, Senator Burns: ``Let me tell you a little \nbit about sanctions. I have never been convinced that sanctions on food \nreally worked.''\n  Our colleague from Kansas says, who is the Presiding Officer, if I \nmay in his presence quote him in that debate: ``Food being used as a \ntool of foreign policy should never ever occur.''\n  Senator Dorgan: ``We ought to decide as Congress right now that \nsanctions do not include food shipments.''\n  I can go on. Our colleagues, I think, across party lines, across the \ngreat spectrum of this country, have come to realize that, as my good \nfriend and colleague from Nebraska so eloquently pointed out, we are a \ngreat nation. We are the most powerful nation on the face of this Earth \neconomically, and militarily. We are the envy of the world politically. \nAnd for us on this evening to say that this great power still finds it \nnecessary in order to advance its foreign policy interests that food \nand medicine that would go into the mouths and bodies of innocent \npeople who live in these dreadful regimes may be the subject of \nunilateral economic sanctions, I think, is sad. I think it is sad.\n  We who sit here this evening and have full meals--those who oppose \nthese policies and never worry about whether or not their child can get \nan inoculation, or an immunization, whether or not they are ever going \nto have food on their table--look in the face of an innocent North \nKorean child, if you want to, or look in the face of an innocent Cuban \nchild who has to live under Fidel Castro--that child didn't make that \nchoice. That family didn't make that choice. Are we in this great power \nof ours, the United States of America, saying this evening that we will \nnot allow the sale of food or medicine to help out that child of those \ncountries? I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I think we are \nbigger, I think we are better than that.\n  I think this debate on sanctions has been healthy. It is beginning to \nrecognize the awakening in America that, as our colleague from the farm \nStates and others have pointed out, we need to have policies that \nwork--not that make us feel good. This is not about press releases. It \nis not about satisfying constituencies here at home. It is about doing \nsomething that advances our legitimate foreign policy interests. Do we \ndo that by causing injury to our own people and causing injury to \ninnocent people in these countries while the elite economically and \npolitically grow fat on their own dictatorships at the expense of their \nown people, and we in our own unwitting way assist them in that \nprocess?\n  Mr. President, I hope as our colleagues come over here--this is not \nabout endorsing terrorism or excusing Libya in Flight 103, or any other \ndreadful atrocity that a dictator has imposed. It says that with regard \nto unilateral economic sanctions the United States of America, at the \nclose of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, that we take \nfood and medicine with regard to unilateral sanctions off the table--we \ntake it off the table--and we will advance our cause by building \nsupport on the suggestion in the minds and hearts of innocent people in \nthese countries that they overthrow these very dictators, and we let \nthem know this evening that we are not going to allow our wealth and \nour technology, which has produced the largest abundance of food and \nthe best medicines in the world--that if we can get them to these \npeople, we want to see that it happens and that we stand for that.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment which has been \noffered by a bipartisan group of us--from the East, in the Midwest, the \nfar West--this evening, and that it be supported by our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Kerrey \namendment we will have a vote on.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield, \nit is our hope, given the fact that only one amendment really has been \ndebated--and that is the Dodd amendment up to the point of 8:45 under \nthe order--that a vote will occur on a motion to table the Dodd \namendment, which will be made by the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. That will take with it, if it is agreed to, \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas in the second degree. \nThen, that would be the only vote ordered to occur right now. We still \nhave four other amendments that have been cited as in order to come up \ntonight: The Torricelli amendment, the Johnson amendment, the Graham \namendment, and the Kerrey amendment. If the Dodd amendment is tabled, \nthere won't be a need for the Torricelli amendment, as I understand it, \nand that would be withdrawn.\n  Then we think we can work out an agreement to accept the Johnson \namendment, which is the third amendment, and the Graham amendment on \ndisaster assistance. But we would have to have a vote on the Kerrey \namendment. That could occur tonight, or tomorrow, whatever the pleasure \nof the leadership is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I want the Senate to know that when the Leaders arrive, \nwe will have to discuss the arrangement on whether or not that vote \nwill occur tonight. And it will be my hope that it will occur tonight, \nMr. President.\n  But, under the circumstances of the situation now, again in order to \nfacilitate the management of this bill, I move to table the Dodd \namendment, which, as I understand, would also carry with it the second-\ndegree Roberts amendment. I reluctantly make that motion, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Alaska to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) and the \nSenator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\n  The result was announced--yeas 38, nays 60, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 203 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--38\n\n     Ashcroft\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Reid\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n\n                                NAYS--60\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Leahy\n     Lugar\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Bingaman\n     Glenn\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3158) was rejected.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Chair will \nput the question on the Roberts amendment to the Dodd amendment. I \npresume that will be accepted by a voice vote. Then we will go to the \nTorricelli second-degree amendment, with 2 minutes for him to describe \nhis amendment, 2 minutes for Senator Dodd in opposition, and then a \nvote on that.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will the leader yield?\n  I say, Mr. President, that is not a second-degree amendment. It is a \nfreestanding amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Freestanding amendment then.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. If the leader would yield, it is my understanding, \nfrom our conversation, that the Roberts amendment would be accepted; \nand I will, in turn, have a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. That was my understanding.\n  Mr. DODD. If the leader would yield, the Roberts amendment is a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If it is dealt with, that clears the tree.\n  Mr. LOTT. So after 4 minutes of debate, equally divided, we could go \nto a recorded vote on the Torricelli amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that we then go to--\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, of course.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad, of course, to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I apologize to the leader for interrupting him.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is certainly all right, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  Mr. LOTT. On the Torricelli amendment? I do not believe they have.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then the leader did not mean to include in his unanimous \nconsent request that it would be a recorded vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to ask for the \nyeas and nays on the Torricelli amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wonder \nif, since everybody is here, whether we could limit the vote on the \nTorricelli amendment to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is an excellent request.\n  And I ask unanimous consent that that vote be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe then we are ready to put the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 3159, the Roberts amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3159) as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to make one more unanimous consent request. I \nask unanimous consent that the vote on the Kerrey amendment--if \nordered, and we get the yeas and nays on that--be also limited to 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 3160 to Amendment No. 3158, As Amended\n\n   (Purpose: To exclude the application of the amendment to certain \n                               countries)\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, Members of the Senate, we are about to \ncast a vote that we will remember for many years. I know the issue of \nthe day is the farm crisis in the Midwest. The answer to that problem \nis in this market, in this Senate, not by changing a fundamental of \nAmerican foreign policy. The issue today may be the farm crisis, but \nlast year and the years before that, it has been the war against \nterrorism.\n  My amendment is simple. We have lifted the American embargo against \nselling food and medicine unless--unless--you are from a country that \nis engaged in terrorism against the United States of America.\n  Mr. Qadhafi does not deserve, tomorrow morning, to wake up and find \nout we forgot about Pan Am 103; or Castro, with his political \nprisoners; nor should we end with North Korea our actions just when we \nare negotiating the control of atomic weapons.\n  I know the frustration of my colleagues from the Midwest, but these \nnations, with per capita incomes of $100, $200, $300, they are not \nbuying agricultural products from anyone in the world, so they are not \ngoing buy them from us, because they have no money, because they are \nfailing Marxist regimes.\n  For 30 years, this country has held the line that on human rights and \non actions of terrorism against our country we would not deal with \nthem. Things are so close, the handful of Marxist regimes that are \nleft--the handful--do not throw them a lifeline.\n  Can you imagine the frustration tomorrow morning of activists in Cuba \nwho are fighting for freedom to find out we have taken the heart out of \nthis embargo? Make no mistake, this is the heart. These countries, from \nLibya to North Korea, to those that are harboring assassins in the \nSudan, the Hezbollah in Syria, these terrorist nations, they are not \nseeking to buy airplanes or high technology. This is all they would \nhave if they had the resources.\n  This is not a message you want to send. Today it may be the farm \ncrisis. But terrorism is not gone from this Earth. The State Department \nhas told us that there are these nations, these six nations, engaged in \nterrorism against our people. They do not deserve an exception. The \nSenate has done its will. It has lifted food and medicine. Just keep \nthis exception on these few terrorist states.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, in the rush to end sanctions, I find it \nincredible that some of our colleagues appear\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\nwilling to forgive and forget the conduct of regimes like those in \nIran, Iraq, Libya, Cuba, Sudan, and North Korea.\n  The inescapable impression is that they are willing--I hope \nunwittingly--to cast aside U.S. laws designed to ensure that U.S. \ntaxpayers' money will not be sent to regimes that proliferate weapons \nof mass destruction, or smuggle drugs over our borders, or promote acts \nof terrorism around the world.\n  More disheartening is an apparent willingness to abandon the Cuban \npeople to the brutality of Fidel Castro.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Majority Leader has taken the \ninitiative to create the Sanctions Task Force, of which I am a member. \nThat bipartisan group has been tasked with studying sanctions in a \ndeliberate process and produce recommendations for the consideration of \nthe Senate.\n  Rather than wait for that careful review, Senator Dodd has offered an \namendment today that would have the effect of undermining existing \nsanctions on rogue states.\n  Mr. President, there should be no mistake about Senator Dodd's \nseeking to undermine the U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's regime. So \neager is the Senator to achieve this end, that he is willing to blow a \nhole in all other U.S.-supported embargoes as well. That is what the \nSenator's amendment would do.\n  The Senator's amendment is based on the mistaken notion that people \nin Cuba go without food and medicine due to U.S. sanctions. The facts \npaint a very different picture. Cubans have been impoverished by a \nfailed Communist economy. Moreover, Castro denies his own people such \nnecessities as a means of keeping them under his thumb. But, he makes \nstate-of-the-art medical care available to Communist party cronies and \nforeign tourists who provide hard currency to his regime.\n  Mr. President, U.S. and multilateral sanctions routinely contemplate \nhumanitarian needs of the people in these countries. In the case of \nCuba, U.S. law currently permits the sale of medicines and the donation \nof food and other humanitarian necessities. Indeed, just since 1992, \nAmericans have provided about $2.3 billion in aid directly to the Cuban \npeople.\n  The comprehensive trade embargo on Iran allows for humanitarian \ndonations to be sent. Even with North Korea, the U.S. has been able to \naccommodate humanitarian needs without loosening the restrictions in \nother areas.\n  In Iraq, the food-for-oil agreement allows humanitarian aid to flow. \nOur Treasury Department also licenses the donation and sale of these \nitems.\n  The bottom-line is that the Dodd amendment is not good for the Cuban \npeople or any other country--including our own. Therefore it is \nimperative that the Torricelli second degree amendment be approved by \nthe Senate.\n  In Cuba, as with other countries, there are reasonable, pro-active \nsteps that we can take to promote the liberation of the people and, in \nthe mean time, provide humanitarian assistance. But, we should do this \nwithout letting up the pressure on the tyrants who torment their own \npeople.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I am persuaded that it is not and never \nwill be in the interest of the United States of America to relax \npressure on governments that promote terrorism, destabilize regions \nwith their aggression, proliferate nuclear weapons technology, and \nenslave their own people. Therefore, I urge that the pending Torricelli \nsecond degree amendment be approved overwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3160 to amendment No. 3158, as amended.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of its amendment add the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     section B(2) shall read as follows:\n       (2) Exceptions.--Section (B)(1) of this section shall not \n     apply to any country that--\n       (1) repeatedly provided support for acts of international \n     terrorism, within the meaning of section 6(j)(1)(A) of the \n     Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. \n     2405(j)(1)(A)); or\n       (2) systematically denies access to food, medicine, or \n     medical care to persons on the basis of political beliefs or \n     as a means of coercion or punishment; or to\n       (3)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate has just expressed its will on \nthis issue. My colleagues, Senator Roberts, Senator Hagel, Senator \nWarner, Senator Grams, and Senator Dorgan and I offered the amendment \nand, in fact, included language by Senator Roberts which very \nspecifically allows the President to retain or impose any of the above \nsanctions if he determines such sanctions to be in the national \ninterest of the United States.\n  Our underlying amendment only deals with unilateral economic \nsanctions. On any nation where there are multilateral sanctions, such \nas Libya and Iraq, this amendment would not apply. It is only in those \ncountries where there are unilateral sanctions being imposed.\n  Now, it should come as no great surprise to my colleagues that the \nnations on whom we impose unilateral sanctions are the very nations \nthat my colleague from New Jersey would now like to exempt. What we \nhave been suggesting here this evening is that this great Nation, as my \ncolleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, so eloquently said--this great \nNation, with its great economic and military power, we ought to be able \nto take food and medicine out of the arsenal of sanctions we use for \nthe very economic elite and political elite of these terrorist \ncountries. They do not suffer for lack of food. They do not suffer for \nlack of medicine. It is the innocents who live under these regimes who \npay the price, and also the very farmers of this country who grow the \nproducts who are suffering today as a result of a farm crisis, denied \nthe opportunity where there are nations who can afford to buy these \nproducts who pay the price. And we do not change policy in these \ncountries.\n  With all due respect to my good friend from New Jersey and those who \nwould support this amendment, we have provided for language here that \nwould allow for an exception should that occasion arise. But let us not \nundo the will that the Senate just expressed on the underlying \namendment to take food and medicine off the table. Use whatever other \nsanctions we will or we might, but food and medicine ought not to be a \npart of the unilateral economic sanctions regime that this country \nwould seek to impose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the financial \ncrisis growing in our rural economy and to send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Nebraska's farmers and farm communities are confronting a series of \nevents--most of them completely out of their control--that will lead \nmost of them to lose money this year and may drive a fair share out of \nbusiness. I have been meeting with groups of farmers for as long as I \nhave been in the Senate, and the message I hear resounding across \nNebraska is that the situation is very grim.\n  This is a clear case of a situation in which families won't have a \nshot at the American dream if we don't put the law on their side.\n  These events are a good reminder of why agriculture is such a \nprecarious business to be in. Farmers are entrepreneurs who operate \nsmall businesses that manufacture their product outdoors. And on top of \nthe always risky proposition of dealing with mother nature, this year \nour farmers are dealing with grain and livestock prices at their lowest \nlevels in more than a decade, land rental prices that have increased by \nan average of 37%, a cost of living--particularly for health \ninsurance--that keeps going up, even when commodity prices keep \nfalling, and a rail transportation problem that will almost certainly \nleave record bushels of grain on the ground across middle America again \nthis year.\n  And I haven't even mentioned the event over which farmers have the \nleast control--the economies of foreign countries. Nebraska sends a \nthird of its agricultural exports to Asia. Or rather, we used to. With \nmore than 60 million people now living on less than a dollar a day in \nIndonesia, those markets in Asia are gone.\n  Many ``experts'' suggest that the key to a profitable farming \noperation is diversification. But when every major sector of production \nagriculture is operating at a loss--from corn to cattle to wheat to \nhogs--my farmers find that diversification is simply a decision of what \nto grow that will lose the least.\n  What is most troubling to me about the financial crisis in rural \nAmerica is that it comes at a time of unprecedented economic success \nfor the rest of the country. But make no mistake: trouble in rural \nAmerica will not stay confined to the farm. When Nebraska farmers lose \nmoney, Omaha laborers find themselves with less work and it will happen \non a nationwide scale, too. Though less so now than in the past, the \nUnited States remains an agriculture-based economy. Agriculture is our \nonly sector that runs a trade surplus. In Nebraska, it accounts for one \nof every four jobs.\n  So I come to the floor today to issue a wake up call to the Senate. \nIt doesn't matter what you call it--a crisis, a disaster, or just plain \nmisfortune--family based agriculture in America is in grave danger. And \nthere is no one who can act to preserve family based agriculture but \nus. The Secretary of Agriculture cannot do it and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative cannot do it. If we believe in the value of family based \nagriculture, this Congress must act to preserve it ourselves.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Daschle, we are bringing a number of \namendments to the floor that will help farmers regain a measure of \nprofitability this year. These amendments are reasonable and I believe \nthat the Senate will recognize that they strengthen the existing farm \nlaw, rather than weaken it. And I hope that in a spirit of \nbipartisanship, we can agree that if we add these amendments to the \nfarm bill we can make it work for our farmers.\n\n  I am sending one of those amendments to the desk now. This amendment \nwould try to improve market conditions in the livestock industry by \nmandating reporting requirements.\n  We have price spreads between retail beef prices and the price paid \nto producers that are at record levels. We all know what happens when \nthe price of crude oil goes down--we pay less for gas at the pump. But \nalthough the price of cattle has dropped precipitously, beef is still \nthe same price if not higher at the supermarket. That defies logic and \nit says to me that something does not work in the cattle market. We \nhave an amendment that would address that.\n  This amendment will restore transparency to livestock markets by \nmandating the price reporting of live cattle and boxed beef.\n  The cattle feeding industry is in an extended period of sharply \nnegative feeding margins, with losses of about $100 per head.\n  Earlier this year, hog prices sank to a 26-year low.\n  But at the same time, consumer prices at the retail level remain \nunchanged.\n  Producers are concerned that there is not enough information to \ndetermine fair market prices for livestock, and this price reporting \namendment will change that.\n  Common sense tells us that complete price information is vital to an \nefficient market. But the majority of cattle are now sold under secret \npricing deals, and those transactions are not recorded in the cash \nmarket.\n  The lack of transparency in the market creates the potential for \nexploitation, and we must act to stop that. My democratic colleagues \nsupport this approach and I am optimistic that Republicans can support \nthis amendment, as well.\n  So I hope that we will come together in a bipartisan way this week \nand pass these measures to help alleviate the financial crisis \noccurring in rural America. For we have a great deal at stake here, and \nit is more than just a partisan quibble over whether or not to make \nchanges in a law.\n  At stake is the preservation of family based agriculture and whether \nor not Congress has the good sense and the courage to step in while \nthere is still time. For all of our sakes, I hope we do.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment that authorizes the \nSecretary of Agriculture to conduct a 3-year pilot program in mandatory \nprice reporting so that we can get a true market in the cattle \nindustry. It has been long debated by the Agriculture Committee. I \nthink most Members have pretty well made up their minds on it.\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the amendment allows the head of the \nstockyards division to look into a way to set up mandatory price \nreporting. Right now, we only have one segment of the chain in the \ncattle market that is doing any price discovery at all; that is at the \nauction market. When cattle changes hands in feedlots and packing \nhouses, these prices are not reported, or they go unreported for a \nweek. We cannot make marketing decisions if you are producing \nreplacement cattle while doing business like that. I suggest the \nadoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska and the Senator from Montana for this amendment.\n  We have a very serious situation with regard to price transparency. \nCan you imagine going into a store and not knowing the price? Can you \nimagine a retailer going into the market and not knowing what the \nprevailing price is?\n  What these two Senators are doing is simply asking that we have a \npilot project to be able to decide if there is a way by which to better \ndescribe prices and a way to bring about price transparencies so \nproducers and retailers or anybody has a better understanding of what \nthe market is.\n  If you really believe in a free market, you will support this pilot \nproject because it simply allows the free market to do its work.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disturbed by the number of small to \nmedium-sized producers going out of business in our states, and by \nmounting evidence that anti-competitive forces within the livestock \nmarket are contributing to this trend of shrinking income.\n  This amendment offered by Senator Kerrey will help end the secret \nlivestock deals that are driving small to medium-sized producers out of \nbusiness in our states, by requiring that they report the prices they \npay for live cattle.\n  This in turn will assure that the market price accurately reflects \nthe real value of livestock, in other words increases market \ntransparency.\n  In South Dakota, smaller livestock producers are leaving the industry \nliterally by the hundreds.\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\n  According to South Dakota State University, in the past five years \nSouth Dakota has lost over 1,000 of our smaller cow/calf operators, and \nover 800 small feedlots.\n  Not only do these losses cripple rural communities, they threaten the \nvitality of the agriculture industry itself.\n  Small business plays an essential role in any market; it is small \nbusiness that can respond most rapidly to changing consumer demand, and \nsmall business that is most likely to innovate and meet the preferences \nof niche markets.\n  As packers and feedlots continue to merge, as smaller operations go \nout of business, and as producers face progressively fewer markets for \ntheir production, we lose an important segment of the industry.\n  The result will be a less diverse, less responsive marketplace.\n  Increasing market transparency is essential to ensuring our producers \nat least have a chance to compete.\n  I appreciate that USDA publishes voluntarily reported price \ninformation, but we need to do more.\n  The contract prices that currently are not reported may have market \ndistorting effects because reported cash prices do not reflect true \nmarket conditions.\n  Formula pricing, captive supplies, and vertical integration all \ncontribute to transactions off of the cash market, and severely impede \nmany producers' ability to compete.\n  This amendment would ensure, on a test basis, that all livestock \nprices are reported.\n  This means producers and feedlots will know that the market price \naccurately reflects the prices being paid in private transactions.\n  This is the way the free market is supposed to work.\n  The majority of producers who talk to me about conditions in the \nindustry today simply say they want a fair shake.\n  They want a chance to work hard to produce a high quality product and \nto sell it for a fair price.\n  We expect our foreign markets to be open and fair so that we can \ncompete abroad. Producers absolutely should be able to expect the same \nof our domestic markets.\n  Producers and farm organizations have been saying for some time that \nas prices and terms of trade become increasingly limited, there isn't \nenough information available to determine the fair market price for \nlivestock.\n  I continue to hear that not only is complete price information vital \nto an efficient market, but also that it may reduce the potential for \nexploitative relationships in the industry.\n  This is an important, reasonable step to take on behalf of our small \nlivestock producers.\n  If we care about small business, if we care about the rural \ncommunities they serve, if we care about having a fair and open \nmarketplace in agriculture, we will pass Senator Kerrey's amendment.\n  I hope that on a bipartisan basis we can support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, with some reluctance, I oppose the \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. I do so \nbecause the industry is not for this amendment. The National \nCattlemen's Beef Association has written a letter in opposition to the \namendment. And just one word of that letter says the following. They \nrefer to the Daschle amendment. This is the same amendment dealing with \nmandatory live cattle price reporting:\n\n       These amendments are not fair and equitable to beef \n     producers, and many of these provisions are counter to our \n     producers' policies.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the total letter from the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Cattlemen's\n\n\n                                             Beef Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Larry E. Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: S. 2159, the Agricultural \n     Appropriations bill, will soon be considered on the Senate \n     floor. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association strongly \n     supports increasing funding for essential programs such as \n     food safety research and cooperative extension, emerging \n     animal disease research, the Market Access Program and the \n     Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative.\n       In addition to these priorities, there are a number of the \n     proposed amendments to this bill that have the potential to \n     affect America's cattle producers. The National Cattlemen's \n     Beef Association supports the following amendments to S. \n     2159:\n       Johnson (D-SD)/Craig (R-ID) amendment would require \n     labeling of retail meat as either U.S. product or imported \n     product. This provision addresses frustrations among U.S. \n     producer who question why livestock imported into the U.S. \n     for immediate slaughter are marketed as U.S. product. The \n     proposed language is consistent with U.S. responsibilities \n     and commitments to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n     and the North American Free Trade Agreement. Consumers demand \n     quality and consistency, and producers are continually \n     working to meet consumer demands. Import labeling will help \n     differentiate products in the retail meat case and increase \n     competition among product lines. With labeling, consumers \n     will have the ability to make more informed purchases.\n       Hatch (R-UT) amendment would allow for the interstate \n     shipment and sale of state inspected meat provided that the \n     state inspection process meets or exceeds federal inspection \n     standards. State-inspected beef, pork and poultry are the \n     only food products banned from interstate distribution. This \n     provision also provides an additional incentive for state \n     inspected meat plants to implement Hazard Analysis and \n     Critical Control Point (HACCP) methods. The time is right for \n     Congress to address this unjust policy that discriminates \n     against thousands of small business owners.\n       Lugar (R-IN) amendment and the Roberts (R-KS)/Robb (D-VA) \n     amendment would require thorough evaluation of international \n     trade sanction. International trade sanctions are stifling to \n     beef export sales and the entire U.S. economy. While \n     sanctions are sometimes necessary, these measures should \n     undergo thorough scrutiny to ensure they are meeting their \n     intended goals.\n       The nation's cattle industry opposes the following proposed \n     amendments to S. 2159:\n       Daschle (D-SD) amendment dealing with mandatory live cattle \n     price reporting, packer concentration, and nonemergency \n     haying and grazing on Conservation Reserve Program acreage. \n     These amendments are not fair and equitable to beef producers \n     and many of these provisions are counter to our producers' \n     policy.\n       Bryan/Reid (D-NV) amendment would eliminate funding for the \n     $90 million Market Access Program (MAP). MAP is crucial to \n     maintaining, developing and expanding agricultural export \n     markets. Eliminating this program would be a huge step back \n     for American agriculture.\n       Brownback (R-KS) amendment would seriously restrict the \n     Agriculture Census. Data provided by the Agriculture Census \n     is crucial to farmers and ranchers who need the best \n     information available to make timely, informed decisions.\n       Leahy (D-VT)/Santorum (R-PA) amendment would cap the amount \n     of money available to the Wetlands Reserve Program and \n     earmark this savings for the Farmland Protection Program.\n       Daschle (D-SD) loan rate amendment, Baucus (D-MT) loan rate \n     amendment and the Conrad/Dorgan (D-ND) indemnity payment \n     amendment changes farm bill policies. The National \n     Cattlemen's Beef Association strongly opposes any amendment \n     that would significantly change ``Freedom to Farm'' policy.\n       Bennett (R-UT) amendment would prohibit the Commodities \n     Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) ability to regulate over-\n     the-counter trades and derivatives. CFTC's ability to ensure \n     open and accurate price discovery is paramount to beef \n     producers.\n       On behalf of over one million beef producers from across \n     the country, we appreciate your consideration of these issues \n     that are crucial to America's cattle industry. If you have \n     questions or you would like to discuss any of these issues \n     further, please contact our office at (202) 347-0228.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            G. Chandler Keys, III,\n                                    Vice President, Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the American Meat Institute points out in \na letter to me that this amendment is not a good idea in a free \neconomy, and you don't need a pilot program to learn that. It does not \nadd information so much as it burdens industry and compromises \nlegitimate business interests.\n  In the Department of Agriculture, there is opposition to the \namendment. They say that it reports already 75 percent or more of the \n40 to 50 percent of boxed beef sales that comply with the reporting \ncriteria. The Department estimates that more than two-thirds of the \nlive negotiated cattle sales are reported.\n  I might conclude by pointing out that no other segment of agriculture \nhas to undergo mandatory reporting of all private business \ntransactions. This\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\npilot program will only add more burden on the industry and it \ncompromises legitimate business interests.\n  I suggest that the amendment should be defeated.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is my intention to move to table, but I will withhold \nthe motion to table the Kerrey amendment and to ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just so there is no mistake in here, the \nadministration, the Department of Agriculture, strongly supports this \namendment.\n  Again, let me remind my colleagues that this is a pilot project. It \nis an opportunity to see whether it works. We want to see the \nopportunity for price transparency. Let us know what the market price \nproduces. Let's see what the prices are going to be to give and take \nbetween processors and producers. That is what this study is all about.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senate is not in order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the manager will withhold for a minute, \nthis will be the last vote of the night. We hope to take up the \nGrassley amendment the first thing in the morning, with the first vote \nhopefully occurring at 10:30, although that has not been worked out. \nThis will be the last vote of the night.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe letter from the American Meat Institute, the letter that I referred \nto, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      American Meat Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Thad Cochran: Some Members who are concerned about \n     USDA-reported market prices for meat may offer an amendment \n     to the pending Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \n     Administration Appropriations Bill that would establish a \n     pilot program on mandatory price reporting. AMI strongly \n     opposes such a program. I respectfully request that you raise \n     a point of order opposing any attempt to amend the bill with \n     a pilot price-reporting program.\n       As I testified in the June 10 Senate Agriculture Committee \n     hearing, voluntary reporting by industry currently captures a \n     significant share of what is happening in today's market. On \n     the boxed beef side; for instance, USDA estimates it reports \n     75 percent or more of all boxed beef sales that comply with \n     the department's reporting criteria. A similar reporting \n     situation exists on the live cattle side, where USDA \n     estimates it captures and reports on more than two-thirds of \n     all negotiated sales.\n       Mandatory reporting of all private business transactions \n     between parties does not exist in any other segment of \n     agriculture. It is not a good idea in a free economy, and you \n     don't need a pilot program to learn that. It does not add \n     information so much as it burdens industry and compromises \n     legitimate business interests. As you know, USDA reporting \n     criteria are designed to enhance the reporting of information \n     that is meaningful to the market.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 J. Patrick Boyle,\n                                                   President, CEO.\n\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, while it is true that the packers and many \nof the processing industry do not like the idea of having to disclose \nprices and bidding, you would be hard-pressed to find a single rancher \nor cattle feeder in the United States of America who opposes this \namendment. This is a pilot program. It will make the market work \nbetter. There are only three packers in America controlling \napproximately 80 percent of the market today. That is why this \namendment is needed.\n  I say to colleagues who want the free market to work and like the \nmarketplace, go talk to your feeders. Go talk to the people who are out \nthere ranching right now. They want to know what the prices are in \norder to get full price discovery so that they are able to know whether \nor not they are getting the best price for their product. It is true \nthat the packing industry and many processors do not like this \nrequirement. But, as I said, again you would be hard-pressed to find a \nsingle feed lot operator or rancher in America who will not support \nthis change in law.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the first letter that I read an excerpt \nfrom was from the American Cattlemen's Association. They represent all \nthe beef cattlemen, many of them, throughout the country.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, that letter comes on behalf of people who \nare in the packing industry. I just tell colleagues that if you have \nranchers or feed lot operators in your State, they support the change. \nThere is a division in this particular association that comes as a \nconsequence of packers being a part of this association. I don't object \nto the packers at all. I believe this change will enable them to be \nprofitable. It doesn't shut them down at all. It merely says they have \nno surprise when they bid on the cattle in the marketplace.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, could we have order. This is a very \nimportant issue for people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will have order in the body.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association \ndoes not represent the feeders. It represents the rank and file \nrancher, large and small, across our Nation. This letter says they \noppose the amendment. It is very clearly, very clearly stated.\n  We developed a futures market not only to look at current but future \nprices. Most of the livestock industry today effectively operates off \nof that and the market trends.\n  Would I like to see more transparency? We all would like to see it. \nDoes a government system and new government regulations dictating it \ncause it? The marketplace causes it. But this is a pilot program. Like \nit or not, it is new regulations in the process.\n  As a former rancher, as a former cattle feeder, I will tell you this \nis a new set of Government regulations that may resolve the question \nfor a very small number of operators. But for the industry itself--\nlarge, small, packer, feeder, producer, cow-calf operator--this is not \nfor what they are asking. I don't believe it is the effective way to do \nit. I hope you would support a motion to table.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I was going to move to table, but I understand the \nSenator from Montana wishes to speak.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I just want to make one point. You have \nthree packers that are handling 85 percent of the national cattle that \nare killed today. And they don't want to report the prices so that the \npeople who produce calves and replacement cattle and feed cattle in the \nfeed lots, the individual producers, or a small packer, can compete \nwith them. It doesn't make sense. We have always reported those prices. \nAnd now, with a lot of packer-owned cattle moving in there, we get no \ninformation at all.\n  Let's look at this pilot program. Let's work with the postmarketing \nsurveillance. We can come up with some way to report these prices so \nthat we know what these cattle are worth all the way back to the ranch.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I want to say amen to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded. Is there a sufficient \nsecond?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from Mississippi to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Nebraska. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, members of the Senate, today I join my \ncolleague, Senator Mack, in offering an amendment to the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill that will provide much needed relief to agriculture \nin the State of Florida in the wake of the extreme drought and severe \nwildfires that have plagued our State in the last two months.\n  The fire crisis is the latest example of our State's meteorological \nreversal of fortune in 1998. Florida's hot summer temperatures are \ntypically accompanied by afternoon thunderstorms and tropical weather. \nThis year's heat and drought, and the lush undergrowth and foliage that \nsprung up in the wake of Florida's unusually wet winter, combine to \nfuel the fires that have put the State under a cloud of smoke and \nchased nearly 112,000 residents from their homes, 2,000 of them into \nemergency shelters.\n  These fires have had severe consequences. More than 220 homes, \nbusinesses, or buildings have been destroyed or heavily damaged. Nearly \n100 individuals, mostly brave firefighters battling the blazes, have \nbeen injured. A 140-mile stretch of Interstate 95 was closed for \nseveral days. 458,000 acres of land have burned.\n  Florida has sustained almost $300 million in damage. In a step never \nbefore taken in Florida's long history with violent weath, every one of \nthe 45,000 residents of Flagler County--a coastal area between \nJacksonville and Daytona Beach--had to be evacuated from their homes \nover the Independence Day weekend.\n  On June 19, 1998, President Clinton declared all 67 Florida counties \nas a major disaster area and made them eligible for immediate federal \nfinancial assistance. In the weeks that followed that declaration, FEMA \nofficials skillfully coordinated relief efforts and worked hard to \nchannel additional aid to the hardest hit areas.\n  Both the fires and their original cause, the extreme drought \nthroughout the state, have contributed to a drastic impact on Florida \nagriculture, particularly in the North and West areas of the State. \n600,000 acres of summer crops were destroyed or severely damaged by the \ndrought conditions. Hardest hit has been corn which has suffered a 100 \npercent low on about 80,000 acres and 50 percent yield loss on another \n20,000 acres. Value of the lost corn crops as of June 22, 1998, was \nidentified to be $20 million. Cotton, peanuts, soybeans, and \nwatermelons have suffered 25 to 30 percent losses.\n  At the end of June, virtually none of the $60 million hay crop was \nharvested, causing the potential for a major shortage of winter feed \neven when the drought subsides.\n  In the Panhandle area, many of the 7,000 farmers are facing their \nthird straight year of destructive weather conditions after tropical \nstorms and hurricanes in 1996 and 1997. In this region alone, farmers \nhave invested more than $100 million in borrowed money to plant this \nyear's crop, only to find themselves with no prospect of harvest at \nthis time.\n  In response to this dire situation, on July 9, 1998, Secretary \nGlickman declared the state of Florida to be an Agriculture Disaster \narea, making agriculture in Florida eligible for federal financial \nassistance.\n  This declaration makes Florida agriculture eligible for several \nDepartment of Agriculture programs including:\n  (1) the Emergency Loan Program which provides assistance to family \nfarmers, ranchers, and aquaculture operators with loans to cover losses \nresulting from natural disasters.\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\n  (2) the Non-Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) which \nprovides assistance to eligible owners of non-insured crops when a \nnatural disaster causes a catastrophic loss of production; and\n  (3) the Emergency Conservation Program which provides assistance to \nfarmers fro the purpose of performing emergency conservation measures \nto control wind erosion, to rehabilitate farmlands damaged by natural \ndisasters, and to carry out emergency water conservation measures.\n  These programs will provide vital assistance to the Florida \nagriculture community. However, there are some needs of Florida in the \nwake of this disaster that are not addressed by existing programs.\n  First, in the area of forestry, we currently have almost 500,000 \nacres that were completely destroyed. To provide assistance for \nreforestation in this type of situation, the Department of Agriculture \nhas created the Forestry Incentive Program which authorizes USDA to \nshare up to 65% of the costs of tree planting, timber stand \nimprovements, and related practices on nonindustrial private forest \nlands. In the state of Florida, there are over 7 million acres in this \nownership class equal to 49% of our state's timberland. To support this \nneed, Senator Mack and I have proposed an emergency appropriation of $9 \nmillion to be expended over the next 3 years to spur the rebirth of the \nFlorida forests.\n  Second, in the area of livestock, the state of Florida is suffering \nin two ways. We have had a small number of livestock deaths and are \nexperiencing a widespread food shortage due to drought and fire. To \ncompensate livestock owners for livestock deaths attributable to the \nnatural disaster, my colleague and I are requesting an emergency \nappropriation of $300,000 for the Livestock Indemnity Program. Many of \nyou are familiar with this program as it has provided support for \nlivestock casualties in many of your states. This program will provide \nbenefits in the state of Florida to beef and dairy cattle, swine, \ngoats, poultry, equine animals used for the production of food, and \nostrich.\n  The need for livestock feed is a long-term issue that is affecting 32 \ncounties with approximately 1,073,000 head of cattle, with severe \nproblems with approximately 750,000 head. In the state of Florida, the \nmajority of dairy and beef producers grow their own hay on individual \nfarms for future use as cattle feed. The majority of these hays are \nseasonal, with a growing season spanning approximately 7 to 8 months. \nDuring the 2-3 months of severe flooding followed by severe drought and \nsubsequent fire, approximately 1.5 million acres of pastureland has \nbeen completely destroyed, leaving approximately 1.1 million cattle \nwith the threat of malnutrition leading to decreased dairy production \nand substandard beef production. Extension specialists estimate a need \nfor 30 million pounds of roughage a day for Florida cows with only 15 \nmillion pounds per day available from current pasture production even \nwith welcomed rains on part of the state. These producers desperately \nneed assistance in order to provide adequate feed grain for their \nlivestock.\n\n  The state of Florida is fortunate to have received approximately 170 \ntruckloads of feed that have been donated from Oregon, Kentucky, \nIllinois, Virginia, Delaware and Maryland, although only 82 tons have \nbeen delivered to producers from South Carolina, Tennessee, and North \nCarolina due to lack of transportation. While this feed would provide a \nstarting point for renourishment of livestock, there are no funds \navailable to transport it.\n  To combat this situation, Senator Mack and I are introducing in this \namendment a request for $10,000,000 for the Disaster Relief Assistance \nProgram to be used in support of a livestock feed program providing \nreimbursement for feed purchase or transport for over 1.1 million head \nof cattle. Prior to 1996, the Emergency Feed Assistance Program was the \nprimary user of the DRAP, providing 25,716,113 bushels between 1984 and \n1996. This program was suspended by the 1996 Farm Bill.\n  Finally, we are requesting an additional $2,000,000 for the Emergency \nConservation Program (ECP) in support specifically of conservation. For \nexample, in the state, there are currently approximately 390 miles of \ndestroyed fences in just 3 counties from fires resulting in potentially \n12,000 cows roaming outside of home pasturelands.\n  Mr. President, and fellow members of Congress: I ask that you give \nfull consideration to this amendment and the dire needs of agriculture \nin the state of Florida as we seek to recover from the devastating \neffects of this year's drought and fire.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, the Nation and the world are aware of \nthe very severe circumstances through which Florida has recently \nsuffered and continues, fortunately in a less degree, to suffer, as a \nresult of drought and severe wildfires. The purpose of this amendment \nis to restore various accounts within the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture that are intended to provide disaster assistance and makes \nthat assistance available to those areas which have been designated, as \nof July 15, 1998, to be agricultural disaster areas.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague, Senator Mack.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Department of Agriculture advises us \nthat they cannot at this time verify whether available disaster money \nhas been depleted. I understand this has been a devastating disaster \nfor Florida and that other areas of the country have also been affected \nby various disasters. We will work with the administration and the \nHouse conferees to address the needs of the areas affected by these \nrecent disasters and to determine whether these needs are being met \nthrough available funds.\n  It is my hope that the Department of Agriculture and the Office of \nManagement and Budget are assessing the need for additional funding to \nmeet the needs resulting from these most recent disasters and that the \nPresident will soon submit to the Congress requests for supplemental \nfunds which are determined to be required.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3162) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3163 Through 3170, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas and I have \nreviewed a number of amendments and have agreed to recommend the Senate \naccept them. I now ask unanimous consent the following amendments be \nconsidered en bloc, agreed to en bloc, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table: An amendment of the Senator from Georgia, Mr. \nCoverdell, on food safety research and E. coli; Senators DeWine and \nHutchison, a sense of the Senate on inhalants; Senators Harkin and \nGrassley on APHIS biocontainment facilities; Senator Cochran, a \ntechnical correction on conservation operations; Senators Kempthorne \nand Baucus and others, secondary agriculture education, with a \nKempthorne statement for the Record; an amendment for Senator Bryan \ndealing with the Market Access Program report; another amendment in \nbehalf of Senator Graham of Florida and Senator Mack on the \nMediterranean fruit fly; an amendment for Senator Johnson on meat \nlabeling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \nclerk will report the amendments by number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes \n     amendments Nos. 3163 through 3170, en bloc.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of my colleagues have come to \nthis floor today to talk about the state of American agriculture. \nSimply put, we are in a state of emergency.\n  Whether it be low commodity prices, lack of export markets or too \nmany government restrictions, farmers are facing catastrophes from \nevery angle. If we are truly going to take steps to fix this problem, \nand not just use short-term fixes, we must to examine and correct the \nalarming rate at which children are leaving the family farm in pursuit \nof other occupations.\n  Wilder, Idaho, is a small town in Idaho known for its fertile soil \nand exceptional growing conditions. Wilder is also the hometown of \nIdaho's distinguished governor, Phil Batt. In fact, Phil still lists \nhis occupation as a farmer and can still be seen driving his pickup \naround the farm periodically. Wilder is also the home of the Churches--\nTom and his son Mike. When Mike Church turned 18, he left for one of \nthe most prestigious agriculture universities in the nation, Texas A, \nwith the intention of getting his degree in agriculture economics and \neventually returning to the land that his family has farmed for \ngenerations. Something happened to Mike while at A, he decided that \nhe could not follow in his father's footsteps as a farmer. While \nstudying agriculture balance sheets, Mike realized it was becoming more \nand more difficult for farmers across the country to break even, much \nless make a profit on their family farm.\n  It's not that Mike didn't want to farm, the fact is he had worked on \nthe farm since he was a young boy. Mike felt that the future was bleak \nin farming and had witnessed the struggles that Idaho farmers faced \nevery day on the family farm. It was based on these realizations that \nMike decided there was more of a future in speculating the paper \ncommodities as a stockbroker than growing the actual commodities as a \nfarmer. Twenty or thirty years ago it was understood that a son, or \nsometimes a daughter, would take over the family farm. This is no \nlonger the case.\n  If we are going to save the American family farm, we must start with \nthe children who live on it. We must inspire the young people in our \nrural communities, like Wilder, to continue in the field of \nagriculture. Agriculture is not just about judging the weather anymore; \nthe science of agriculture has become the cutting edge as we continue \nto compete against farmers in countries around the globe.\n  This amendment provides much needed funding to an area that can and \nwill inspire those young people to continue in farming. The Agriculture \nEducation Competitive Grants Program would fund a competitive grants \nprogram for school-based agricultural education at the high school and \njunior college levels of instruction. The program was authorized in the \n1996 Farm Bill. Competitive grants targeted to school-based \nagricultural education would be used to enhance curricula, increase \nteacher competencies, promote the incorporation of agriscience and \nagribusiness education into other subject matter, like science and \nmathematics, and facilitate joint initiatives between secondary \nschools, 2-year postsecondary schools, and 4-year universities.\n  Most importantly, the program would encourage young people to pursue \nhigher education in the food and agricultural sciences--something in \nwhich this country is currently making a failing grade.\n  Mr. President, we must find a way to keep talented young people like \nMike Church in the classroom and on the farm. The agriculture \ncompetitive grants program is the first step in that direction. This a \nbipartisan effort. Senator Craig, Senator Baucus, Senator Johnson, \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Thomas, and Senator Faircloth have all lent \ntheir cosponsorship to this amendment. It is through this bipartisan \nspirit that we can begin to bring the next generation of farmers back \nto the farm I thank my colleagues for joining in supporting my \namendment to fund the Agricultural Education Competitive Grants \nProgram.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3168\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to submit to Congress \n             a report concerning the market access program)\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7.

Mr. President, this amendment will increase by $2 million \nthe funds available to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service \nin their battle against the Mediterranean Fruit Fly, or medfly. I am, \nunfortunately, all too familiar with the devastation caused by these \ntiny pests, and I am particularly concerned this year, because Florida \nhas experienced an unusual number of medfly infestations.\n  In the past, medflies have caused significant damage to Florida fruit \nand vegetable crops. This year's infestation is particularly troubling, \nbecause it has occurred in the heart of Florida's citrus and tomato \ngrowing country. In Lake County, over 1,300 medflies have been detected \nsince the end of April. In Manatee County, over 550 medflies have been \ndetected since the first find in mid-May. In fact, just last week, a \nmedfly was discovered in Highlands County, and as of today, over 100 \nnew flies have been detected in this area.\n  Unless fully eradicated, the medfly has the potential to cause \nhundreds of millions of dollars in damage to Florida fruit and \nvegetable crops. In addition, medfly infestation provides our trading \npartners with a convenient reason to deny the entry of Florida fresh \nfruits and vegetables into their country. Florida's growers have spent \na considerable amount of time and money in their efforts to gain access \nto important markets, like Mexico. Each time medflies are discovered in \nFlorida, growers are forced to take a giant step backwards in their \nmarkets access efforts.\n  The eradication efforts themselves, through ground or aerial spraying \nand the release of sterile medflies, are also expensive, costing the \nState of Florida and the federal government over $20 million last year.\n  The funds provided by this amendment will enhance APHIS's efforts to \nexclude and detect the medfly. Funds will be utilized to increase \ntrapping and detection activities, particularly in urban areas and near \nports-of-entry, where the introduction of this pest is most likely. \nIncreasing funds for this program will also help to reassure our \ntrading partners that the U.S. is committed to medfly control, and will \ndeter them from restricting the entry of citrus products and other \nimportant agricultural exports.\n  In conclusion, I would like to make it very clear that this is only \nthe first step in a more comprensive strategy to address this critical \nproblem. Because medflies commonly enter the United States via larval-\ninfested fruit carried through ports-of-entry by travelers or by \ncommercial fruit smugglers, I have asked the Department of Agriculture \nto undertake an immediate review of their inspection procedures at \nFlorida ports-of-entry, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the \ninspection process. The Department of Agriculture has indicated that \nthis review will be completed within the next three to four months. The \nresults of the review will provide us with a roadmap for future \nactions, including the appropriate funding levels for a fully effective \ninspection program. I look forward to working closely with the Chairman \nand Ranking member to find a more permanent solution to this critical \nproblem.\n       On page 67, after line 23 add the following:\n                       TITLE VIII--MEAT LABELING\n\n     SEC. 801.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as I am sure my distinguished colleague, \nthe Chairman of the Subcommittee, is aware, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization Act (FDAMA) included a significant \nprovision related to FDA's review and approval of indirect food \nadditives. For the benefit of my colleagues, these are products that \nare used for containers, wrappings and packaging of food products.\n  To ensure the safety of indirect food additives, these materials that \ntouch or contain food, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must \nreceive safety data submitted by the manufacturer. Often, FDA's process \nof evaluating these data has been extremely lengthy and has worked to \ndelay the market availability of new and improved products. As a \nresult, many companies have chosen simply not to bring new products to \nmarket, thus depriving the public of improvements in products and \ntechnology.\n  In order to address this concern, a provision was included in FDAMA \nwhich requires the FDA to establish a new and expedited new product \nnotification and review process that will substantially improve the \nsituation for manufacturers of indirect food additives and thus the \nconsumers of packaged food products. However, under section 309 of \nFDAMA, the provision will only become effective if the FDA receives an \nappropriation of $1.5 million for FY 1999. Subject to this new \nappropriation, FDA would be required to set the program in motion by \nApril 1, 1999.\n  I am aware that the House mark does include funding for the indirect \nfood additive pre-market notification program, but at a level of \n$500,000. While this certainly indicates the intention and willingness \nof the House to fund the program, unfortunately the amount is not \nsufficient to meet the specific requirements of FDAMA.\n  I am extremely mindful of the tight allocation under which S. 2159 \nwas crafted, and I recognize that it was not an easy task to bring this \nbill forward today. I am very grateful for the Subcommittee's efforts \nunder the leadership of Chairman Cochran. At the same time, I hope the \nChairman will agree with me that funding of this important FDA reform \nis critically important and that the conferees will try to work this \nout so that the new program can be implemented next year.\n  Mr. COCHRAN: The Committee was mindful of this problem, and, in fact, \nincluded report language indicating its awareness of the need to \nimplement the premarket notification provisions in order to spur \ninnovation of new and improved food packaging materials. As you said, \nwe are operating under a very tight allocation, but we will do our best \nto try to work this out.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise to commend the continuing efforts of \nAmerica's computer industry to find a technical solution to the \nencryption issue. On Monday, July 13, a consortium of thirteen high-\ntech companies announced an alternative to the Administration's \nproposed key escrow/third party access system. As you will recall, many \ncomputer and security exports have stated that key escrow would be an \ninvasion of privacy, technically unworkable, and cost prohibitive.\n  Unlike the key recovery system advocated by the Administration, \nindustry's ``private doorbells'' approach would not require sensitive \nencryption keys to be escrowed with third parties in order for law \nenforcement to gain access to computer messages. Instead, the FBI and \nother federal, state, and local agencies would be able to combat crime \nby being provided with court approved, real-time access to communiques \nat the point where they are sent or at the point where the message is \nreceived. Clearly, high-tech executives have not been sitting on the \nsidelines as the encryption debate continues. As this announcement \nindicates, the computer industry is working hard to find a balanced \nsolution that ensures the needs of our law enforcement and national \nsecurity communities while maintaining privacy protections for all U.S. \ncitizens. We owe it to them, and to all Americans, to find a balanced \nlegislative solution to encryption.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would also like to applaud the computer \nindustry's efforts to find alternative technical solutions to help law \nenforcement with the challenge of encrypted data and communications \nwithout the need to establish a government-mandated key escrow or key \nrecovery scheme. With the appropriate privacy safeguards in place, as \noutlined in the E-PRIVACY bill, S.2067, the solution that the companies \nare proposing appears encouraging. American companies are desperate for \na common sense approach to our export policy on encryption. As you are \nwell aware, the Administration, starting with Clipper Chip, has been \nwedded to key escrow schemes to ensure that the FBI can get access to \nplaintext, or unscrambled electronic data. This path has been pursued \ndespite the serious questions that experts have raised about the costs, \nprivacy risks and lack of consumer interest in such schemes. As\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\nU.S. companies watch their market share for computer hardware and \nsoftware products erode because of our country's outdated export \ncontrols on encryption, it is imperative that the Administration direct \nthe FBI to consider creative alternatives to key escrow.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The recent announcement by several leading companies in \nthe computer industry makes it clear that, in addressing both economic \nand law enforcement concerns, it is important to find a balance between \nthe two. We must create legislation that addresses consumer demand for \nencrypted products while also meeting the needs of law enforcement--\nlegislation that fosters a global marketplace dominated by U.S. \nencryption products. Those products, of course, will be a great benefit \nto our national security.\n  Mr. BURNS. Industry's plan to allow law enforcement access to the \nplaintext of some encrypted communications demonstrates that market \nsolutions can truly address many areas of law enforcement's concerns \nwith encryption. At the same time, we should not forget that there is a \ncontinuing need for legislative privacy protections governing how and \nwhen law enforcement should have access to encrypted data.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I agree, the announcement by the high-tech companies of \nalternative means of access to plaintext to encrypted data demonstrates \nindustry's commitment to find solutions that accommodate law \nenforcement interests. It also reiterates the need for privacy \nprotection legislation to ensure that law enforcement only gets such \naccess with a proper court order. The E-PRIVACY bill, S. 2067, which I \nhave sponsored with Senator Ashcroft, and others, would provide that \nprivacy protection.\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes, these recent developments continue to highlight the \ndesperate need for a change in U.S. encryption policy. Last week the \nAdministration announced it would make exceptions in encryption export \npolicy allowing banks and certain financial institutions to export \nstrong encryption, without vulnerable key recovery systems, to their \nsubsidiaries in a select group of 40 countries. This is a welcome \ndevelopment for those companies that will qualify for this narrow \nexception but it does not provide the same protection of online privacy \nfor everyday Americans.\n  Mr. LOTT. Americans want and need strong encryption to protect their \nmost sensitive data and communications from unauthorized access. Yet \nthe Administration continues to pursue an encryption policy that limits \nexports, requires key recovery backdoors for law enforcement, and \nultimately stifles American innovation. Instead of keeping technology \nout of the hands of criminals, continuing export controls will only \nensure that U.S. citizens have less protection than other computer \nusers throughout the globe. The financial institutions announcement \nconfirms what many in Congress have been saying for some time: users of \nelectronic commerce will be best served by providing relief from \ncurrent export control regulations. Allowing advanced encryption to be \nexported ensures that sensitive data is protected while helping \nAmerican companies compete globally. Individual consumers, as well as \nmultinational financial institutions, will not buy and will not use \nencryption systems when government mandated recovery keys for these \nproducts are provided to third parties. This system, as many experts \nhave reported, creates a host of security risks, making our online \ncommunications vulnerable to attack by thieves, hackers and other \ncriminals.\n  Mr. CRAIG. From an economic standpoint, foreign companies are winning \nan increasing number of contracts because consumers are unwilling to \nbuy products that ensure third party access or require that keys be \nstored with government certified or operated facilities. This is \nparticularly true since they can buy stronger encryption overseas from \neither foreign-owned companies or American owned companies on foreign \nsoil. We must act quickly and prudently in addressing this problem.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, for several years we have debated, \nargued and discussed the real economic impact of continuing to follow \nthe Administration's wrong-headed policy on encryption. In addition to \nthe Administration, several members of Congress on both sides of the \naisle have refused to consider many of the facts of encryption \ntechnology and the importance of the technology sector to our robust \neconomy. After all these years, we have an historical opportunity to \ndebate encryption on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I agree. With the rapid expansion of the ``super highway'' \nand Internet commerce, it is crucial we bring encryption legislation to \nthe forefront. A secure, private and trusted national global \ninformation infrastructure is essential to promote citizens' privacy \nand economic growth.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Encryption technology is not only a critical tool for \nprotecting the confidentiality of our online communications and the \nprivacy of our stored electronic information, it is also the building \nblock for digital signatures. The future of electronic commerce \nrequires that parties conducting business online be able to trust the \nauthenticity of the contracts they enter and that the parties with whom \nthey are dealing are who they say they are. In fact, a number of \nStates, including my own State of Vermont, are making progress on \ncrafting the rules for digital signatures and online commercial \ntransactions.\n  Mr. BURNS. Encryption is also an essential part of new ``digital \nsignature'' techniques used to identify parties and authenticate \ntransactions online. These techniques are widely viewed as an essential \nfeature of electronic commerce. The use of digital signatures raises \ncomplex business and privacy issues, but these issues are completely \nseparate from the questions raised by encryption used for \nconfidentiality. There is a great deal of ongoing activity in the \nprivate sector and at the state level attempting to sort out these \ncomplex issues of business use and consumer protection. Federal digital \nsignature legislation is clearly needed, but should be dealt with \nseparately from encryption reform legislation.\n  Mr. ASCHROFT. As in everything regarding the topic of encryption, we \nface some decisions and difficulties. Some would like to weigh down the \nalready contentious issue of encryption with other unrelated issues, \nsuch as digital signatures. Now, at first blush, many may believe that \nthese two issues are fundamentally tied, or that one necessarily raises \nthe other. However, this is not true. While digital signature products \nmay use some sort of encryption, they are not encryption. The potential \ndebate on federal level digital signature legislation is a worthy \ndebate, the nuances of what potential legislation may look like are \nmany, and the differences in arguments regarding digital signatures and \nencryption are great.\n  Mr. LEAHY. These are important issues that can and should be \naddressed separately from the immediate need for encryption legislation \nthat protects privacy and confidentiality.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have heard that some object to even allowing for \nencryption and digital signature legislation to reside in different \npieces of legislation, even if both were brought to the floor. They \nexpress their concern that without the inclusion of digital signatures \nthat public networks cannot be adequately secure. This argument gives \nme great pause, mainly because it demonstrates a fundamental \nmisconception of a digital signature. A digital signature does not \nsecure the network but rather secures the signature. Applying the same \nlogic to the analog world would dictate that contracts could not be \nwritten until we could adequately solve for the potential of forgeries. \nObviously, we have not taken this approach yet individuals enter into \nmillions of contracts every year.\n  Mr. LEAHY. While digital signature legislation at the Federal level \nmay help encourage the development of online commercial transaction \nrules, we must be careful not to stifle the development of efficient \nand inexpensive digital signature services by prematurely regulating --\nor granting Federal agencies unfettered authority to regulate--in this \narea. We must particularly avoid creating a federal system for digital \nsignatures that will become the national i.d. card for cyberspace. The \nAdministration in its ``Framework for Global Electronic Commerce'' got \nit right when it said that ``participants in the marketplace--including \nconsumers, business,\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nfinancial institutions, and on-line service providers--should define \nand articulate most of the rules that will govern electronic \ncommerce.''\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. All that said, encryption and digital signatures do not \nand should not be joined in the same legislation. The opportunity we \nhave before us is to bring the encryption debate into the open and to \npass legislation that adequately addresses the concerns of law \nenforcement, national security, privacy, and system security.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. At the same time, we have the opportunity to affect real \ngrowth in digital signature technologies by addressing digital \nsignature as a separate piece of legislation during this Congress. We \nshould not allow differences in encryption policy to stifle innovation \nand improvements in this exciting technology. Digital signature is \ncrucial to ensuring the continued dynamic growth of electronic commerce \nin this country. Many in Congress recognize this, industry recognizes \nthis, and the Administration agrees.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In order to pass legislation in a timely manner it is \nimportant that it be in a clean bill with only the most essential \nlanguage related to encryption; language that seeks to protect \nindividual privacy, while at the same time addressing national security \nand law enforcement concerns.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise because I have concerns about \nefforts to ease or remove export restrictions on certain hardware and \nsoftware encryption products. Export controls on encryption and on \nother products serve a clearly defined purpose--to protect our nation's \nsecurity. The Intelligence Committee believes that the effects on U.S. \nnational security must be the paramount concern when considering any \nproposed change to encryption export policy, and the Committee will \nseek referral of any legislation regarding encryption export policy \nunder its jurisdiction established under Senate Resolution 400. With \nour on-going investigation into the possible technology transfers to \nChina, the Vice Chairman and I are also concerned that any effort to \nchange U.S. export policy on encryption be consistent with the export \npolicy review included in our investigation.\n  Export restrictions on encryption products assist the Intelligence \nCommunity in its signals intelligence mission. By collecting and \nanalyzing signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies seek to \nunderstand the policies, intentions, and plans of foreign state and \nnonstate actors. Signals intelligence plays an important role in the \nformation of American foreign and defense policy. It is also a \nsignificant factor in the U.S. efforts to protect its citizens and \narmed forces against terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, narcotics trafficking, international crime and other \nthreats to our nation's security.\n  While the Committee recognizes the commercial interest in easing or \nremoving export restrictions, it believes the safety of our citizens \nand armed forces should be the predominant concern when considering \nU.S. policy towards the export of any product. The Committee supports \nthe continued control of encryption products, and believes that a \ncomprehensive strategy on encryption export policy can be developed \nthat addresses national security concerns as well as the promotion of \nAmerican commercial interests abroad.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Lott and others as legislation \nmoves through the Senate.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The bottom line to all of this is that we can move \nencryption legislation in this Congress, with the support of the \nmajority leader. To hold up this progress works against national \nsecurity, works against support of our law enforcement and erodes \nindividual's privacy protections. We should all diligently work to \ncraft an encryption bill that can come to the floor this session.\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree with my colleagues. While I strongly support the \npassage of legislation on both encryption and on digital signatures, I \nam convinced that the best approach during this session is to deal with \nthese matters in separate bills. Let me say again, that in order to \npass legislation on both of these issues during this Congress, we must \nrecognize that there are significant differences between these \nimportant and complex policy issues. Digital signature and certificate \nauthority have appeared in various proposals in association with \nencryption. However, these matters need to be considered separately \nbecause they raise different questions and complications.\n  A digital signature is a technical method for authenticating the \nidentity of a sender or author.\n  As its name implies, it is a digital version of a person's written \nsignature. Encryption is a means to ensure confidentiality. It is a set \nof algorithms used to scramble and unscramble text in order to keep \nunauthorized person's from reading your computer data and messages. It \nis a technology that protects medical, business, and individual files \nfrom invasion. Again, encryption for confidentiality, and digital \nsignatures for authentication and related certificate authorities, are \nnot the same issue. Dealing with encryption and digital signatures in \none piece of legislation could lead to the demise of such a weighted \nbill. Consequently, I am prepared and committed to moving separate \nbills dealing with these issues during this session. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this dual track approach as my colleagues have \nrecommended. I share the belief that this is the best chance for \nlegislation to be passed in both of these areas during the 105th \nCongress.\n  Congress needs to stop debating these issues and enact balanced \nlegislation that will ensure the privacy rights of individuals while \nprotecting America's public safety, economic, and national security \ninterests.\n  Mr. BURNS. I commend the Majority Leader and Senators Leahy, Craig, \nAshcroft, Abraham, and Shelby for their continuing hard work and vision \non these difficult but critical issues. I hope we will be able to move \nforward legislatively on both encryption reform and digital signatures \nthis session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8236-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8238-S8239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX FISHER\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am always reluctant to add another \nnational holiday to our calendar, but were we to do so, then July 15 \nwould be a good bet. For today is Max Fisher's birthday.\n  In fact, it is his 90th birthday. But longevity, important as it is, \nis the least of his accomplishments.\n  Many of our colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, know Max very \nwell. He has long been one of the most prominent and influential \nleaders in the American Jewish community.\n  He has advised every Republican President since Richard Nixon. He has \nadvised every Israeli Prime Minister since Golda Meir. He was a \ncritical force behind the airlift that helped save Israel in the \ndarkest days of the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\n  The great work of his life has been building bridges between Israel \nand the United States. But that is only one of many reasons to honor \nhim.\n  Max is one of our Nation's greatest philanthropists. He played a \nvital role in his home city of Detroit after the tragic riots of 1967 \nby promoting reconciliation and economic opportunity. He continues in \nthat effort today.\n  No one will ever know how many people have benefited from his quiet \ngenerosity.\n  Max, of course, would prefer the term social responsibility. Whatever \nthe words, the meaning is the same, and so is the inspiration. As the \nBook of Proverbs teaches, ``He who is gracious to the poor lends to the \nLord.''\n  Ten years ago, when Max celebrated his eightieth birthday, accolades \ncame in from around the world. President Reagan called him ``a \nlegend.''\n  Today, ten years later, the legend continues to build. He still works \nquietly, behind the scenes.\n  It is no coincidence that his biography is entitled, ``The Quiet \nDiplomat.'' That book documents what all of his friends and admirers \nknow so well: His dedication to the cause of peace, his energy in the \ncause of justice, his wisdom and effectiveness in working for a better \nworld.\n  At some point, with a man like Max, we run out of accolades. He has \nheard them all--and probably been impressed by none of them.\n  His eye is always on the future: What remains to be done, what is \nstill to be built, what has not yet been set right.\n  In that spirit, on behalf of the Senate of the United States, I want \nto wish\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\nhim yet another Happy Birthday, in the full realization that these \nninety years have been as much a blessing to us and to the Nation as \nthey have been to him and to his family.\n  To Max from America: Mazel tov, and God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8238-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DESERT CHORALE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Las Vegas \ninstitution. No, I am not referring to the ``Strip'' and the neon \nlights, but to a cultural organization that has provided Las Vegans \nmany years of enjoyment, the Desert Chorale. I have had the pleasure of \nlistening to their incredible range of talent for the past 16 years. \nThis spectacular choir made up of volunteers has provided Nevada music \nlovers countless hours of enjoyment. While Las Vegas and Southern \nNevada may be known for big head-liners like Siegfried and Roy, \nLiberace and Elvis, I can personally attest that thousands of Nevadans \nhave flocked the Desert Chorale's concerts over the years. From the \npatriotic to the spiritually uplifting, the sheer beauty of the music \nthey make touches and inspires their audiences.\n  Now, this great choir from the Silver State will be sharing their \ntalent with a slice of the world audience. The Desert Chorale has been \nrecognized for their musical achievements and have been invited to \nparticipate in the Boris Brott Music Festival in Canada. The festival \nis entering into it's twelfth year and their contributions to Canada's \nand the world's cultural scene has been highly praised. Not only does \nthe choir have the honor of being invited to this festival, but they \nwere also chosen as the first musical organization of its kind to \nrepresent the Western United States. I stand here on behalf of the \ngreat state of Nevada, as that state's senior senator, and the United \nStates of America, to congratulate the Desert Chorale on taking part in \nthis prestigious tradition. The Desert Chorale will be an excellent \naddition to the festival. I am confident from the previous performances \nI have attended, that they will do a superb job in representing the \ngreat heritage of both the state of Nevada and the United States of \nAmerica.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A joint resolution adopted by Legislature of the \n     State of California; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 51\n\n       Whereas, the 1998-99 Governor's budget includes $85 \n     million, beginning with the 1998-99 fiscal year, that is \n     predicated on the assumption that the United States Congress \n     will act to establish a program under which the Internal \n     Revenue Service and the United States Treasury Department may \n     offset or withhold a federal tax refund to satisfy legally \n     enforceable, past due state income tax obligations; and\n       Whereas, there are currently 31 states, including \n     California, and the District of Columbia, that offset state \n     income tax refunds to satisfy delinquent federal tax \n     obligations under a cooperative arrangement between the state \n     tax agency and the Internal Revenue Service; and\n       Whereas, California has been participating in the state \n     offset arrangement since January 1991 and collected $27.5 \n     million during the 1995-96 fiscal year and $28 million during \n     the 1996-97 fiscal year and will collect $29 million during \n     the 1997-98 fiscal year for the federal government; and\n       Whereas, permitting federal refunds to be offset for state \n     income tax debts would further existing cooperative efforts \n     between the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing \n     agencies and would be an effective method of collecting \n     delinquent debts owed to the states; and\n       Whereas, according to the Federation of Tax Administrators, \n     a reciprocal tax program at the federal level would increase \n     state receipts by an estimated $200 million annually in the \n     early years of implementation. Of this amount, it is \n     estimated that California would receive revenue in the range \n     of $85 million annually; and\n       Whereas, a reciprocal program could also benefit federal \n     receipts because it would likely lead the remaining 10 income \n     tax states to participate in the program; and\n       Whereas, H.R. No. 1730, a measure authored by Congresswoman \n     Nancy Johnson (D-Connecticut), is currently being considered \n     by Congress; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of \n     California respectfully memorializes the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to establish a program to \n     offset or withhold federal tax refunds to satisfy legally \n     enforceable, past due state income tax obligations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States, to the \n     Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service; and to \n     the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8239-6", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. SHELBY, from the Committee on Appropriations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 2307.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprohibit transfers or discharges of residents of nursing facilities as \na result of a voluntary withdrawal from participation in the Medicaid \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  NURSING HOME PATIENT PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Chafee, \nJohnson, Grassley, Harkin, Hollings, and Inouye to introduce the \nNursing Home Patient Protection Act--legislation to protect our \nnation's seniors from indiscriminate patient dumping. This bill \nmodifies the original legislation to include several simple changes to \nalleviate the concerns of the nursing home industry and senior citizen \nadvocates. It is with their support that we encourage the Senate to \ntake action on this important piece of legislation. I have also \nincluded the following letters of support from the American Home Care \nAssociation and the National Seniors Law Center.\n  A few months ago, it looked like 93-year old Adela Mongiovi might \nhave to spend her 61st Mother's Day away from the assisted living \nfacility that she has called home for the last four years.\n  At least that's what son Nelson and daughter-in-law Gina feared when \nofficials at the Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center of Tampa told \nthem that their Alzheimer's Disease-afflicted mother would have to be \nrelocated so that the nursing home could complete ``renovations.''\n  As the Mongiovis told me when I met with them and visited their \nmother in Tampa last March, the real story far exceeded their worst \nfears. The supposedly temporary relocation was actually a permanent \neviction of all 52 residents whose housing and care were paid for by \nthe Medicaid program.\n  The nursing home chain which owns the Tampa facility and several \nothers across the United States wanted to purge its nursing homes of \nMedicaid residents, ostensibly to take more private insurance payers \nand Medicare beneficiaries which pay more per resident.\n  This may have been a good financial decision in the short run, \nhowever, its effects on our nation's senior citizens, if practiced on a \nwidespread basis, would be even more disastrous.\n  In an April 7, 1998 Wall Street Journal article, several nursing home \nexecutives argued that state governments and Congress are to blame for \nthese evictions because they have set Medicaid reimbursement rates too \nlow.\n  While Medicaid payments to nursing homes may need to be revised, \nplaying Russian roulette with elderly patients' lives is hardly the way \nto send that message to Congress. And while I am willing to engage in a \ndiscussion as to the equity of nursing home reimbursement rates, I and \nmy colleagues are not willing to allow nursing facilities to dump \npatients indiscriminately.\n  The fact that some nursing home companies are willing to sacrifice \nelderly Americans for the sake of their bottom-line is bad enough. \nWhat's even worse is their attempt to evade blame for Medicaid \nevictions.\n  The starkest evidence of this shirking of responsibility is found in \nthe shell game many companies play to justify evictions. Current law \nallows nursing homes to discharge patients for inability to pay.\n  If a facility decreases its number of Medicaid beds, the state and \nfederal governments are no longer allowed to pay the affected \nresidents' bills. They can then be conveniently and unceremoniously \ndumped for--you guessed it--their inability to pay.\n  Evictions of nursing home residents have a devastating effect on the \nhealth and well-being of some of society's most vulnerable members.\n  A recent University of Southern California study indicated that those \nwho are uprooted from their homes undergo a phenomenon known as \n``transfer trauma.'' For these seniors, the consequences are stark. The \ndeath rate among these seniors is two to three times higher than that \nfor individuals who receive continuous care.\n  Those of us who believe that our mothers, fathers, and grandparents \nare safe because Medicaid affects only low-income Americans, we need to \nthink again.\n  A three-year stay in a nursing home can cost upwards of $125,000. As \na result, nearly half of all nursing home residents who enter as \nprivately-paying patients exhaust their personal savings and lose \nhealth insurance coverage during their stay. Medicaid becomes many \nretirees' last refuge of financial support.\n  On April 10, the Florida Medicaid Bureau responded to evidence of \nMedicaid dumping in Tampa by levying a steep, $260,000 fine against the \nTampa nursing home. That was a strong and appropriate action, but it \nwas only a partial solution. Medicaid funding is a shared \nresponsibility of states and the federal government.\n  And while the most egregious incident occurred in Florida, Medicaid \ndumping is not just a Florida problem. While nursing homes were once \nlocally-run and family-owned, they are increasingly administered by \nmulti-state, multi-facility corporations that have the power to affect \nseniors across the United States.\n  Mr. President, let me also point out that the large majority of \nnursing homes in America treat their residents well and are responsible \ncommunity citizens. Our bill is designed solely to prevent potential \nfuture abuses by bad actors.\n  And this new bill is better, simple and fair. It would prohibit \ncurrent Medicaid beneficiaries or those who ``spend down'' to Medicaid \nfrom being evicted from their homes. And that is a crucial point, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Adela Mongiovi is not just a ``beneficiary.'' She is also a mother \nand grandmother. And to Adela Mongiovi, the Rehabilitation and Health \nCare Center of Tampa is not an ``assisted living facility.'' To Adela \nMongiovi--this is home.\n  This is the place where she wants--and deserves--like all seniors--to \nlive the rest of her life with the security of knowing that she will \nnot be evicted. And through passage of this bill, Mr. President, we can \nprovide that security to Adela Mongiovi and all of our nation's \nseniors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters in support of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             American Health Care Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing to lend the support of \n     the American Health Care Association to your legislation \n     which helps to ensure a secure environment for residents of \n     nursing facilities which withdraw from the Medicaid program. \n     Understand you will be filing this legislation in the next \n     few days.\n       We know firsthand that a nursing facility is one's home, \n     and we strive to make sure residents are healthy and secure \n     in their home. We strongly support the clarifications your \n     bill will provide to both current and future nursing facility \n     residents, and do not\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\n     believe residents should be discharged because of \n     inadequacies in the Medicaid program.\n       This bill addresses a troubling symptom of what could be a \n     much larger problem. The desire to end participation in the \n     Medicaid program is a result of the unwillingness of some \n     states to adequately fund the quality of care that residents \n     expect and deserve. Thus, some providers may opt out of the \n     program to maintain a higher level of quality than is \n     possible when relying on inadequate Medicaid rates. Nursing \n     home residents should not be the victims of the inadequacies \n     of their state's Medicaid program.\n       In 1996, the Congress voted to retain all standards for \n     nursing facilities. We support those standards. In 1997, \n     Congress voted separately to eliminate requirements that \n     states pay for those standards. These two issues are \n     inextricably linked, and must be considered together. \n     Importantly, your legislation mandates the Department of \n     Health and Human Services study the link between payment and \n     the ability to provide quality care. We welcome the \n     opportunity to have this debate as Congress moves forward on \n     this issue.\n       Again, we appreciate the chance to work with you to provide \n     our residents with quality care in a home-like setting that \n     is safe and secure. We also feel that it would be most \n     effective when considered in the context of the relationship \n     between payment and quality and access to care.\n       Finally, we greatly appreciate the inclusive manner in \n     which this legislation was crafted, and strengthened. When \n     the views of consumers, providers, and regulators are \n     considered together, the result, as with your bill, is \n     intelligent public policy.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Dr. Paul R.

The abrupt, involuntary transfer of large numbers of \n     Medicaid residents followed. Although Vencor reversed its \n     policy, in light of Congressional concern, state agency \n     action, and adverse publicity, the situation highlighted an \n     issue in need of a federal legislative solution--what happens \n     to Medicaid residents when a nursing facility voluntarily \n     ceases to participate in the federal payment program.\n       I have read the draft bill that your staff has written to \n     address this issue. The bill protects residents who were \n     admitted at a time when their facility participated in \n     Medicaid by prohibiting the facility from involuntarily \n     transferring them later when it decides to discontinue its \n     participation. As you know, many people in nursing facilities \n     begin their residency paying privately for their care and \n     choose the facility because of promises that they can stay \n     when they exhaust their private funds and become eligible for \n     Medicaid. In essence, the bill requires the facility to honor \n     the promises it made to these residents at admission. It \n     continues to allow facilities to withdraw from the Medicaid \n     program, but any withdrawal is prospective only.\n       This bill gives peace of mind to older people and their \n     families by affirming that their Medicaid-participating \n     facility cannot abandon them if it later chooses to end its \n     participation in Medicaid.\n       The National Senior Citizens Law Center supports this \n     legislation. We look forward to working with your staff on \n     this legislation and on other bills to protect the rights and \n     interests of nursing facility residents and other older \n     people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Toby S. Edelman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 2309. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto an agreement for the construction and operation of the Gateway \nVisitor Center at Independence National Historical Park; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            gateway visitor center authorization act of 1998\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nauthorize the Interior Department to enter into an agreement with the \nnonprofit Gateway Visitor Center Corporation for the construction and \noperation of the Gateway Visitor Center in Independence National \nHistorical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n  This legislation is needed because the Visitor Center will provide \nsome services which are beyond the scope of existing National Park \nService statutory authority at the Park. As a result, I am advised that \nconstruction may not begin until this bill is enacted. I have worked \nwith the National Park Service and the Gateway Visitor Center \nCorporation to develop this bill and note that similar legislation has \nbeen introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Jon Fox \nand Robert Borski. The bill also has the strong support of Philadelphia \nMayor Edward Rendell.\n  The Gateway Visitor Center is part of the revitalization of \nIndependence Mall and is critical to creating an outstanding visitor \nexperience. It will serve as the gateway into the Park and will orient \nvisitors as to the rich history of the National Historical Park, the \ncity of Philadelphia, and the region as a whole. I was pleased to \nassist in obtaining funds in the TEA-21 Act for the road and \ninfrastructure improvements necessary for the redevelopment of the \nIndependence Mall and would note that the Senate FY99 Interior \nAppropriations bill also includes funding for this project.\n  The legislation is necessary because, in addition to its role as the \nPark's primary visitor center, the Gateway Visitor Center will be \npermitted to charge fees, conduct events, and sell merchandise, \ntickets, and food to visitors to the Center. These activities will \nallow the Gateway Visitor Center to meet its park-wide, city-wide and \nregional missions while defraying the operating and management expenses \nof the Center.\n  The Gateway Visitor Center holds enormous potential for Independence \nNational Historical Park and the greater Philadelphia region as a \nwhole, and I urge my colleague to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 2310. A bill to designate the United States Post Office located at \n297 Larkfield Road in East Northport, New York, as the ``Jerome Anthony \nAmbro, Jr. Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n       jerome anthony ambro, jr. post office building legislation\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator D'Amato, to introduce a bill to designate the East \nNorthport, New York Post Office as the ``Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post \nOffice Building.''\n  Jerry Ambro's life was one dedicated to serving the people of New \nYork. A Brooklyn native, he was educated in the New York City public \nschools and was graduated from New York University. After a two-year \nstint in the United States Army, he began working for the Town of \nHuntington, New York. He went on to serve on the Suffolk County Board \nof Supervisors and was elected Town Supervisor of Huntington for four \nterms.\n  First elected to Congress in 1974, in the wake of President Nixon's \nresignation, Jerry Ambro was a leader among leaders. He served as the \nchairman of the 82-member New Members Caucus, a reform-minded group \nthat instituted campaign finance reform and new procedures for \nselecting committee chairmen. The Caucus aided in deposing three \ncommittee and subcommittee chairmen.\n  As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Natural Resources and the \nEnvironment, he fought to protect the environment. He prevented the \nLong Island Lighting Company from converting from oil to coal and he \npreserved wetlands in Massapequa. As Town Supervisor, he enacted one of \nthe first municipal bans on DDT.\n  Following his years in Congress, he went on to serve ably as the \nWashington lobbyist for then-Governor Hugh L. Carey. He died in 1993 \nfrom complications from diabetes.\n  I am pleased to introduce this bill today to name a post office after \nsuch a distinguished New Yorker. Congressman Gary L. Ackerman has \nintroduced a similar measure in the House. That it has the support of \nthe entire New York delegation demonstrates how widely admired Jerry \nAmbro was. I urge the swift passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2310\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       The United States Post Office located at 297 Larkfield Road \n     in East Northport, New York, shall be known and designated as \n     the ``Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post Office Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, in introducing this bill that will designate that the U.S. \nPost Office located at 297 Larkfield Road in East Northport, New York, \nas the ``Jerome Anthony Ambro, Jr. Post Office Building.''\n  The designation will be a tribute to the life and legacy of a strong \nand able local and federal representative and I am proud to be a co-\nsponsor of this bill. In doing so, we join the entire New York \ndelegation in supporting this bill.\n  The designation will be a tribute to the life and legacy of a strong \nand able local and federal representative and I am proud to be a co-\nsponsor of this bill. In doing so, we join the entire New York \ndelegation in supporting this bill.\n  Anthony Ambro was a full fledge New Yorker. He had his own ideas and \nhis own means of accomplishing his goals--and those goals greatly \nassisted his constituency. He was a great man from a different \npolitical persuasion. But one thing is certain, he put people ahead of \npolitics.\n  Born in Brooklyn, he attended New York University where he received \nhis Bachelor's degree. He served in the United States Army, Military \nPolice before he began his career in public service. He was budget \nofficer, purchasing and personnel director for the Town of Huntington, \nserved on Suffolk County Board of Supervisors and was elected to four \nterms as Supervisor of the Town of Huntington. In addition, he was \npresident of the freeholders of the Town of Huntington and co-founder \nof the New York State Coalition of Suburban Towns.\n  To reward him for the tremendous accomplishments for the people of \nSuffolk County, he was elected to the House of Representatives \nbeginning in 1975, for three terms. Beginning in 1981, he operated a \nconsulting business bringing his own brand of humor and sagacity to \nbear on behalf of hundreds of New Yorkers as they struggled to make \nsense of Washington's labyrinth.\n  During his tenure he served as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on \nNatural Resources and the Environment, working on environmental issues, \nincluding the prohibiting the dumping of dredged material in Long \nIsland Sound. As a local official, he supported housing projects for \nthe elderly. He was a free-thinking man whose primary purpose was to \nrepresent the needs of his constituency and whose tenacity was driven \nby his beliefs.\n  I counted him as a friend and advisor who made many a lunch-time meal \nat the Monocle a pleasure as well as an education.\n  Anthony Ambro passed away in March, 1993 from diabetes complications. \nI am sure he is missed terribly by his wife Antoinette Salatto Ambro, \nand his children, step children and grandchildren. His qualities \nendeared him to the people of New York and I hope these sentiments will \nbe reflected in the passage of this measure. I thank the senior Senator \nfrom New York and urge its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 2311. A bill to amend section 201 of title 18, United States Code, \nto increase prosecutorial effectiveness and enhance public safety, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          effective prosecution and public safety act of 1998\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, Senator Sessions and I today are \nintroducing a bill that guarantees prosecutors can exercise their full \npower to keep criminals off our streets. The ``Effective Prosecution \nand Public Safety Act of 1998'' makes clear that prosecutors can offer \nplea bargains to accomplices in exchange for their testimony--a long-\nstanding, accepted and necessary practice--without tainting a \nconviction resulting from such testimony. This measure puts to rest any \nconcerns raised by an overwhelmingly disputed decision issued recently \nby a panel of three appellate court judges. And it makes it less likely \nthat courts could overturn convictions of dangerous criminals like \nOklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.\n  Until a court decision two weeks ago, there was no doubt that \nprosecutors could build criminal cases by offering leniency to \naccomplices in exchange for their testimony at trial. But in U.S. \nversus Singleton, a Tenth Circuit panel held that a federal anti-\nbribery statute, which had been on the books for over 35 years, barred \nthese kinds of leniency deals. This unprecedented decision has been \ncriticized virtually unanimously. Subsequently, the full Tenth Circuit \nput the decision on hold, pending a full court rehearing scheduled for \nNovember.\n  There is little doubt that the Tenth Circuit's decision is just plain \nwrong. Nothing in the legislative history suggests that Congress ever \nintended to take away a prosecutor's ability to make deals for \ntestimony. And it is no surprise that in 35 years no court ever found \nthe anti-bribery statute to apply to this reasonable exercise of \nprosecutorial discretion. This decision is simply a case of Scalia-ism \ntaken to the extreme, beyond the bounds of common sense and in the face \nof established practices. I cannot believe that even Justice Scalia, \nthe high priest of literalism, would agree with this result.\n  As wrong as this decision is, it still cannot be taken lightly. \nProsecutors make deals with cooperating witnesses all the time. So this \ndecision puts tens of thousands of convictions in jeopardy. For an \nexample, we need look no further than the conviction of Timothy \nMcVeigh, which was based in large part on the testimony of Michael \nFortier, who was allowed to plea to lesser charges in exchange for his \ntestimony. And McVeigh's conviction is on appeal in the same Tenth \nCircuit--could that be the next conviction it will try to overturn?\n  In my view, the risks posed by this decision are too great to leave \nthis issue to the courts--even though I am confident that in the end \nthey would do the right thing. Indeed, until this issue works its way \nto the Supreme Court, the potential dangers are serious. Prosecutors \nmay feel the need to hold back on cutting deals with potential \nwitnesses, making it tougher to convict dangerous criminals. And \ncriminals behind bars will have a better chance than ever at \noverturning their convictions. Already, jailhouse lawyers are probably \nfoaming at the mouth anticipating making this argument in courts all \nover the nation.\n  Congress can act now to put this issue behind us, to guarantee that \nprosecutors are not hampered in their efforts to put criminals behind \nbars, and to make sure that is where criminals stay. This bill is \nsimple and effective. It amends the anti-bribery statute to exempt \ndeals for leniency made by prosecutors in exchange for testimony. And \nit applies to past as well as future deals, so that no criminal--\nincluding the Oklahoma City bomber--can try to use this awful decision \nas a ``get out of jail card'' at the expense of the safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, let me make clear what this proposal does and what it \ndoes not do. All it does is reinforce what Congress always intended--to \nallow plea bargains in exchange for testimony. It does not permit \nprosecutors to ``buy'' testimony with cash payoffs. That is still \nillegal. It does not allow prosecutors to knowingly elicit false \ntestimony. That is obstruction of justice. And it does not prevent a \ndefense attorney from raising a deal at trial to try to cast doubt on \nthe credibility of a witness. That is what cross-examination is all \nabout.\n  Mr. President, prosecutors will be most effective and the public will \nbe safest if we set the Record straight now and correct the Tenth \nCircuit's outrageous decision. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of this bill. And I offer for the Record the following two \narticles--an editorial from the Washington Post criticizing the \ndecision and a piece from Legal Times explaining its impact and recent \ndevelopments, and ask unanimous consent that these articles be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [The Washington Post, Wed., July 8, 1998]\n\n                            Judicial Trouble\n\n       Every now and then, a federal appeals court issues a ruling \n     that is, at once, so wrongheaded and so sweeping that it \n     results in a brief period of uncertainty in the legal world \n     before being reversed. The decision last week by the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\n     the 10th Circuit in the case of U.S. v. Singleton is one such \n     bombshell. A unanimous three-judge panel threw out the drug \n     conspiracy and money laundering conviction of a woman named \n     Sonya Singleton, finding that the government had violated a \n     criminal anti-gratuity statute by promising leniency to a \n     witness in exchange for his testimony.\n       On its face, the decision seems faintly reasonable. There \n     is, after all, a federal law that holds criminally liable \n     anyone who, ``directly or indirectly, gives, offers or \n     promises anything of value to any person, for or because of \n     the testimony under oath or affirmation given . . . by such \n     person as a witness.'' This law contains no explicit \n     exception for the government, and leniency in sentencing is \n     certainly of value to a person who is facing jail. Hence, the \n     court held, the government violated the law by using bought \n     testimony, and Ms. Singleton's conviction must be thrown out.\n       Logical, perhaps, but dead wrong. What the government \n     actually promised the witness was, in fact, a standard plea \n     agreement of a sort prosecutors rely on every day. Oklahoma \n     City bomber Timothy McVeigh was convicted based, in \n     substantial part, on testimony by Michael Fortier--who was \n     allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges. Many, if not most, \n     significant investigations rely on witnesses who are \n     ``flipped'' by prosecutors in exchange for some sort of \n     special treatment, almost all of which could be considered \n     ``of value.''\n       This practice can be--self-evidently--corrupting. A witness \n     who knows that his cooperation will get him a cut sentence \n     has a strong incentive to say what prosecutors want to hear. \n     But the traditional remedy is the cross examination of the \n     witness by defense lawyers, and no court has previously \n     deemed a run-of-the-mill plea agreement to be a felony by a \n     prosecutor.\n       Though the law does not explicitly exempt the government, \n     this appears to reflect only the fact that members of \n     Congress never considered the possibility that they were \n     criminalizing normal prosecutorial practice. In fact, \n     Congress has adjusted the law in question without balking at \n     the behavior of prosecutors. And the Supreme Court, in Giglio \n     v. U.S., held that when the government makes a deal with a \n     witness, that a deal must be disclosed to the defense as \n     exculpatory evidence--a holding that seems to concede that \n     the deal-making itself is legitimate. The 10th Circuit's \n     decision is at odds both with assumed prosecutorial practice \n     and--by the judges' own admission--with the other judicial \n     authorities in the books.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Legal Times, Week of July 13, 1998]\n\n       Federal Court Watch--Appeals Panel Retracts Snitch Ruling\n\n                          (By Robert Schmidt)\n\n       It was a revolutionary federal appeals court decision--a \n     unanimous ruling by three judges that the time-honored \n     prosecutorial tactic of offering witnesses leniency in \n     exchange for their testimony is illegal--and it sent \n     prosecutors and defense lawyers into a frenzy.\n       The ruling's sweeping implications also apparently caught \n     the very judges who issued it off guard.\n       In a highly unusual move late last week, the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the 10th Circuit, acting on its own motion, \n     vacated the July 1 opinion in United States v. Singleton so \n     it could address the issue en banc.\n       The decision stunned defense lawyers across the nation, \n     some of whom had already filed motions in other federal \n     courts based on the precedent. The 10th Circuit's reversal, \n     however, pleased prosecutors--especially officials at Main \n     Justice, who have been scrambling to develop for U.S. \n     attorneys' offices legal guidelines that take Singleton into \n     account.\n       On July 9, Justice announced it was planning on asking the \n     10th Circuit to hear the case en banc, but it had not yet \n     filed the motion when the court acted on its own.\n       ``This does not seem like the kind of case where they would \n     grant en banc sua sponte because they felt that [the \n     decision] was right,'' says a Justice official working on the \n     matters. ``This is a hopeful sign.''\n       John ``Val'' Wachtel, the Wichita, Kan., lawyer who \n     initially triumphed before the three-judge panel, says he is \n     disappointed but eager to argue before the entire court.\n       ``We plan to write our brief and go out and argue and win \n     this case,'' says Wachtel, a partner of Wichita's Klenda, \n     Mitchell, Austerman & Zuercher. ``The decision of the panel \n     is right.''\n       The court's unusual move followed a firestorm in federal \n     courts across the six Western states that make up the 10th \n     Circuit. Although the panel noted that its ruling would not \n     ``drastically alter'' prosecutors' tactics, no one else \n     seemed to agree.\n       Trial lawyers of all stripes predicted that if the \n     opinion's holding stood, it would dramatically change the way \n     prosecutors investigate and try many types of criminal cases, \n     including major conspiracies involving drug trafficking, \n     money laundering, and fraud.\n       And last week, those predictions were already coming true \n     in the 10th Circuit.\n       According to press accounts and lawyers who practice in the \n     circuit, ongoing federal criminal cases there were virtually \n     paralyzed as lawyers and even judges tried to decide what to \n     do.\n       Stephen Saltzburg, a former Justice official who now \n     teaches at George Washington University Law School, says that \n     this type of paralysis plus the widespread media attention \n     likely prompted the 10th Circuit to issue its order late last \n     week.\n       ``They may not have paid careful attention to this when it \n     was lurking,'' posits Saltzburg. ``Once they had the uproar, \n     and focused on it, they realized that every criminal case \n     that went to trial is now at risk.''\n       Indeed, the court did see that as a potential problem. In \n     its July 10 order, signed by 11 of the 12 judges, the court \n     asked attorneys for both sides to file briefs that ``address \n     whether any opinion reversing the district court would have \n     prospective or retrospective application.''\n       The Circuit ordered that the briefs be submitted in August \n     and said it would hear oral argument in November.\n       While criminal law experts like Saltzburg almost all \n     predict that the entire court will reverse Singleton, defense \n     lawyers say they are confident the opinion will be affirmed.\n       The underlying case involved Sonya Singleton, who was \n     convicted of one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine \n     and seven counts of money-laundering. The main evidence \n     against Singleton was the testimony of Napoleon Douglas, a \n     fellow alleged conspirator who cut a plea deal with the \n     government.\n       Singleton's lawyer, Wachtel, argued that Douglas' testimony \n     should be suppressed, claiming that 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 201(c)(2)--the law governing bribery of public officials \n     and witnesses--applies to prosecutors just as it applies to \n     everyone else.\n       The section reads: ``Whoever . . . directly or indirectly, \n     gives, offers or promises anything of value to any person, \n     for or because of the testimony under oath or affirmation \n     given or to be given by such person as a witness upon a \n     trial, hearing or other proceeding, before any court . . . \n     shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned for not more \n     than two years, or both.''\n       The panel did not suggest that prosecutors should go to \n     jail or be fined for violating the law. But it did determine \n     that the statute was broad enough to include federal \n     prosecutors.\n       The court then noted that Douglas' plea agreement, which \n     incorporated standard boilerplate language used by U.S. \n     attorneys' offices nationwide, made three specific promises \n     to Douglas in exchange for his testimony.\n       Those promises--not to prosecute him for any other crimes \n     stemming from the investigation and to tell both the \n     sentencing court and his parole board about the extent of his \n     cooperation--constituted ``something of value,'' the court \n     reasoned. Thus, they amounted to an illegal gratuity.\n       ``The obvious purpose of the government's promised actions \n     was to reduce his jail time,'' wrote U.S. Circuit Judge Paul \n     Kelly Jr., ``and it is difficult to imagine anything more \n     valuable than personal physical freedom.''\n       Despite the 10th Circuit's decision last week, local \n     defense lawyers say they are eager to raise the issue in \n     Washington's federal court.\n       ``I guess, given the attention it received, [the 10th \n     Circuit's action] is not all that surprising, but it is \n     definitely disappointing,'' says L. Barrett Boss, an \n     assistant federal public defender in Washington. ``The \n     argument that is made, that testimony in exchange for \n     leniency violated the bribery statute, is rock solid, so \n     we're definitely going to be pursuing that issue at every \n     opportunity.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Robb, \n        Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 2313. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for individual security accounts funded by employee and \nemployer Social Security payroll deductions, to extend the solvency of \nthe old-age, survivors, and disability insurance program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY RETIREMENT ACT\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today I introduce--I believe I can \nsay without exaggeration--a landmark piece of legislation, the Twenty-\nFirst Century Retirement Act.\n  Joining me as principal co-sponsor of this legislation is Senator \nJohn Breaux, with whom I served as co-chair of the National Commission \non Retirement Policy during the last year. Also this week, the same \nlegislation will be introduced by our House colleagues, Congressmen Jim \nKolbe and Charles Stenholm.\n  With many pieces of legislation, naming the cosponsors upon \nintroduction is merely a perfunctory exercise. With this one, it is \nsignificant. Also as original cosponsors of this legislation, we have \nSenators Fred Thompson, Chuck Robb, Craig Thomas, and Dan Coats. \nSeveral cosponsors from both sides of the aisle are also joining on the \nHouse bill.\n  This in and of itself is almost an unprecedented accomplishment. This \nsimply does not happen with Social Security, long considered the \n``third rail'' of American politics. We are turning this\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\n``third rail'' into a passenger train--a bipartisan, bicameral process \nfor reform.\n  Two months ago, the National Commission on Retirement Policy voted \n24-0 to approve the recommendations that this legislation would \nimplement. Today we are introducing it with several cosponsors from \nboth sides of the aisle. Given the difficulty that most experts see \nwith restoring the Social Security system to balance, our proposal has \nset a modern record for the most support attracted to any proposal to \nplace Social Security on sound long-term footing.\n  For several years, we have seen numerous Commissions divide among \nthemselves, breaking into factions, issuing separate minority opinions \ninstead of coming to agreement. We have seen various--many of them \nvisionary and constructive--individual legislators introduce reform \nproposals that could attract little support beyond the original co-\nsponsors. But today we stand here with a proposal that has received \nendorsements that have not been given to other Social Security \nproposals in recent years.\n  What have we done that has enabled us to build such support?\n  The first thing we did was to take careful note of what Social \nSecurity has meant to Americans, and what they insist that it mean in \nthe future. Social Security has long been the principal government \nprogram lifting senior citizens out of poverty. In addition to \nproviding a basic level of protection against poverty, the program has \nalso been sold to Americans as not a welfare program, but rather a \nprogram under which benefits paid will bear a reasonable relationship \nto the contributions that people have put in.\n  So we set about to ensure that this remained the case. We wanted to \nhave a system that, in the end, would do an even better job of lifting \nAmericans out of poverty--and would, at the same time, ensure that \npeople received a fair deal for the investment that they made in the \nprogram.\n  Let me step back a bit, Mr. President, and review why action is \nnecessary to achieve this purpose. This requires me to review the \nprojections for Social Security under current law.\n  It is often said that Social Security faces an actuarial problem. It \nis said that the program is solvent only through the year 2032. That is \ntrue. But it does not begin to describe all of the problems with the \nprogram.\n  Even an actuarially sound Social Security program would face enormous \nfinancing problems under its current structure. It is a ``pay as you \ngo'' system. Any surplus assets it holds are invested in the federal \ngovernment--which then has to pay it back at some date in the future. \nSo, even if the books were balanced--and they are trillions of dollars \nout of balance--the general taxpayer would still face the problem of \npaying off more than $4 trillion in Trust Fund assets. This would be \nneeded above and beyond payroll taxes (!) in order to pay the benefits \nthat have been promised to the baby boom generation of retirees.\n  So what would that mean? It would mean raising taxes on future \ngenerations of Americans. The payroll tax would ultimately have to go \nup by almost 50%! That is because the net cost of the system would \nultimately top 18% of payroll, as opposed to today's 12.4% tax rate.\n  Raising the FICA tax today, immediately, by 2.2% of payroll, would \nnot solve this problem. It would just mean that future taxpayers would \nhave a larger Trust Fund to pay off later on, and that the 50% payroll \ntax increase would be borne indirectly, through general taxation.\n  But there would be another dire effect of such a change. Under \ncurrent law, rates of return under Social Security are dropping. If you \nare a single male, the chances are very good that you will never get \nback the value of the contributions that you put in. The situation is \ncomparably grim for single females--and for two-earner couples.\n  If we were to raise taxes to restore the system to solvency--or, for \nthat matter, if we simply and mindlessly cut benefits--that situation \nwould grow far worse. More and more Americans would be losing money \nthrough the program. Ultimately, its political support would be \nimperiled. The basic societal consensus in favor of Social Security--\nbased on the premise that it treats everyone fairly--would be \nundermined.\n  So we must find another way to restore Social Security to health--and \nto enable it to provide the kind of retirement income that Americans \nhave a right to expect from the program.\n  I believe that it is imperative that we begin to ``pre-fund'' the \nfuture liabilities of Social Security. A ``pay as you go'' system is \nnot built for a demographic shift on the order of the baby boom \ngeneration. A ``pay as you go'' system assumes that there is always a \ndemographic pyramid--that each generation coming through at the bottom \nis more numerous than the generation that they are supporting above \nthem.\n  But with the baby boomers coming through in such great numbers--and \nhaving comparatively fewer kids--the pyramid looks more like a \nrectangle. And the individuals at the bottom will bear a crushing \nburden unless we reduce some of it by putting additional funding aside \nnow.\n  Fortunately, we have an opportunity to do this. We have projections \nof near-term budget surpluses--and we already have short-term Social \nSecurity surpluses. We are collecting money that the government does \nnot need to meet current operations, and we are collecting it through \nthe Social Security system.\n  The very first thing we should do is to give this extra money \ndirectly back to taxpayers, allow them to own it once again, and to \nfund a portion of their future retirement benefits through those \npersonally-owned retirement accounts.\n  Our legislation would do that. It would refund 2% of the current \npayroll tax back to individual Americans, to be used to directly \nfinance some of their future Social Security benefits. We will move \nthat portion of the benefit--and of future unfunded liabilities--off of \nthe federal ledger.\n  We would set up these personal accounts on the model of the Thrift \nSavings Plan currently provided to federal employees. We do this \nbecause it is an obvious way to reduce administrative costs. We also do \nit to avoid new mandates on employers. Employers would continue to pay \nthe payroll tax just as they do now, and individuals would decide in \nwhich fund they want 2% of the current 12.4% payroll tax to be \ninvested.\n  The Thrift Savings Plan is a tested, workable way of generating \ninvestment wealth for beneficiaries. It strikes a reasonable balance \nbetween providing good investment opportunities and limiting individual \nrisk. Perhaps most importantly, all Americans would have the \nopportunity to save for retirement on a payroll deduction basis--not \njust those who have pension plans, or who have gone through the trouble \nof setting up IRAs. This will do a tremendous amount to provide \ninvestment wealth to the millions of Americans who have not thus far \nhad the opportunity to share in that wealth.\n  Our legislation would also permit individuals to make $2,000 in extra \nvoluntary contributions--above the 2% automatically redirected for \nthem--to these personal savings accounts. This means that we have \ncreated a vehicle through which net national savings should increase. \nThe more that individuals contribute to their personal accounts--the \nmore retirement income they will have--and the greater the chances that \nthey will be able to retire early, just as is the case with other \nretirement saving.\n  This proposal is the most comprehensive one developed to date. It has \nbeen scored by the Social Security actuaries as achieving solvency \nthrough the next century. Perhaps even more importantly, it eliminates \nthe enormous financing gap under current law. If we enact this \nlegislation, we will remove the need for taxpayers to pony up hundreds \nof billions of dollars, above payroll taxes, in order to pay current \nbenefits. Each year, the cash flow for the system will be smooth and \nmanageable, and there will be a much closer balance between payroll tax \nrevenue and the benefits that must be paid from it.\n  Moreover, we have compared the results of our plan with a plan that \nwould simply balance the current system within the existing 12.4% tax \nrate. In general, beneficiaries will receive much more income from our \nplan than they would from a plan that simply balanced the old system \nwithout personal accounts.\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\n  We have also compared the benefits that our plan would provide to \nbeneficiaries relative to current law, presuming that current benefits \nwere made whole with tax increases. A 2.2% payroll tax hike to make the \ncurrent system actuarially sound was compared with the income that \nindividuals would receive if they made 2.2% voluntary contributions to \nour personal accounts. Virtually across the board, individuals would do \nmuch, much better under our plan.\n  These are among the reasons why a personal account system is so vital \nfor Social Security reform. Not only will they remove some of the \nunfunded liabilities of the federal government, but they will provide \ngreater income to individual beneficiaries.\n  We have also carefully thought through the relationship between \npersonal account income and income through the traditional Social \nSecurity system. I would like to comment about some of what our \nlegislation would accomplish in this regard.\n  Personal accounts, by their nature, are not progressive. There is a \ndirect relationship between money put in and benefits received. It is \nnot redistributed from wealthy beneficiaries to needier ones.\n  Accordingly, if we move towards a system that includes personal \naccounts, benefits on the traditional side must be made more \nprogressive if we are ultimately to have a system that is just as \nprogressive, as a whole, as is our current one. We have done this with \nour plan.\n  Our plan includes a new ``minimum benefit'' poverty protection that \nwould strengthen the safety net for low-income beneficiaries. If an \nindividual works for a full 40 years, we would guarantee that they will \nnot retire in poverty. An individual becomes eligible for some of the \nprotection after 20 years of work, and receives increased protection \nfor every quarter of work after that.\n  Thus, for low-income beneficiaries, our plan would provide additional \nincome security, even without the personal accounts. The personal \naccount income would be a pure bonus for them. Even if they invest \nbadly, their basic protections will be secure--not only secure, but \nstrengthened.\n  In the short term, because of these protections, the Social Security \nsystem would become more progressive than it is now. Ultimately, when \nthe personal accounts have built up to be much larger, in the year 2050 \nor 2060, the progressivity of the system would be essentially what is \nnow--the main difference being that individuals would have much more \nincome.\n  We also did much to correct the flawed incentives of the current \nsystem. We eliminate the earnings test above the normal retirement \nage--a disincentive for continued work.\n  We would also increase the delayed retirement credit, and restore the \nproper relationship between normal retirement and early retirement \nbenefits. Under current law, an individual has little incentive to wait \nuntil normal retirement age, because the extra payroll taxes he pays \nduring those years will never fully be received back in benefits. We \nwould change this, so that for each year an individual works, benefits \nwould increase more sharply, and work would be rewarded.\n  We also would credit an individual for every year of earnings in the \nbenefit formula. Right now, the Social Security system only calculates \na benefit based on the average of the highest 35 years of earnings. \nMany reform proposals would increase this number of years, effectively \nreducing benefits. Our proposal also recognizes the necessity of \nincreasing the number of computation years in the denominator of this \nformula--but on the other hand, we would credit an individual in the \nnumerator for every year of earnings, no matter how small.\n  I am certain that my colleagues have received letters from senior \ncitizens who say, ``I am working part-time at the age of 64, but it is \nnot among my highest years of lifetime earnings. I won't get any credit \nfor this in my Social Security benefits. Why not?'' We believe that we \nshould reward all work, and this proposal would. We even would have the \nminimum benefit guarantee also depend on the total number of years \nworked. If we enact this proposal, rewards for continued work would be \ngreatly strengthened, and our country will benefit as a result.\n  At this point, I feel compelled to point out that there is no ``free \nlunch'' in Social Security reform. It is essential that we enact \npersonal accounts, but we must enact them in the right way.\n  Our proposal would explicitly replace unfunded benefits with funded \nbenefits. We move part of the current payroll tax into personal \naccounts, to fund future benefits. This only makes policy sense if we \nuse such a change to reduce federal liabilities. If we set up personal \naccounts--but leave all of the old, traditional liabilities in place--\nwe have not achieved anything. Indeed, we could make the financing \nproblem worse.\n  So we gradually replace unfunded benefits with funded ones. Every \nresponsible proposal to move towards pre-funded benefits will be \nvulnerable to the attack that it is ``cutting'' benefits, even though \nin sum, total benefits would be higher than under a ``traditional \nfix.'' It is imperative that Congress and the public not buy into such \nmisrepresentations as we undertake Social Security reform. If we leave \nin place all of the unfunded liabilities, and all of the old unfunded \nbenefit promises, then we will leave in place all of the projected tax \nincreases as well.\n  For example. Our proposal would, in order to prevent the traditional \nsystem from posing an ever-increasing burden on taxpayers, gradually \nraise the age of eligibility for full benefits to 70 in the year 2037 \n(for individuals turning 62 in the year 2029.) No one over the age of \n31 would be affected by the full phase-in of this change.\n  At the same time, it must be noted--we do not set an age for access \nto the personal retirement accounts. Our proposal would allow people to \nretire on these accounts once they are capable of providing a poverty-\nlevel annual benefit--even if this earlier than early retirement age. \nThis is an incentive for individuals to put more money into these \naccounts, and it provides them with flexibility on their age of \nretirement that they do not have under current law.\n  We would also require additional reforms to the Consumer Price Index, \nand adjust the bend points in the Social Security benefit formula in a \nprogressive manner, to gradually phase down the liabilities on the \ntraditional side as we move those benefits over into funded accounts.\n  I would repeat: Personal accounts are an indispensable component of a \nSocial Security reform program that delivers more retirement income \nthan merely balancing an unreformed system can possibly provide. But \nthey will not solve our long-term financing problems unless we use them \nto phase down the unfunded liabilities of the old system. This means \ndirectly addressing the growth of the unfunded benefits we are \npromising to pay out, at the same time that we are replacing them with \nfunded benefits.\n  As a result, we believe our plan is the most fiscally responsible \nproposal yet devised. The net liabilities upon the federal government \nin any year during the baby boom retirement period--whether you pick \n2020, 2025, 2030, or beyond--would be significantly less than under \nalmost any other proposal. We have avoided any and all tax increases--\nwhile at the same time avoided unseen financing costs above and beyond \nthe explicit tax rates.\n  We have also produced a proposal that will give beneficiaries the \nopportunity to generate more retirement income through self-directed \ninvestments, provide a Social Security system that the economy can \nsustain, and at the same time enhance protections against the risk of \npoverty.\n  I want to thank my co-sponsors--especially Senator John Breaux, \nCongressman Kolbe, and Congressman Stenholm--and their staffs, who have \nworked so closely with me and with my staff throughout a long and \ndifficult process.\n  I also want to thank all others who are constructively participating \nin the Social Security reform debate. We have made it this far without \nturning this critical issue into a partisan shooting match. I am \npleased that the President has remained open to various proposals for \nreform, and we have been reaching out to him to explain our ideas. I am \nalso appreciative that Senators Moynihan and Kerrey have also produced\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\nan actuarially sound proposal, and that discussions of the differences \nbetween our proposals have been made on a constructive basis. I would \nextend a similar appreciation for a number of other Senators who are \nexploring this issue seriously--everyone from Congressmen Mark Sanford \nand Nick Smith, to Senators Roth, Santorum and Phil Gramm in our own \nchamber.\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my \ncolleagues today as an original cosponsor of an exciting new proposal \nto reform Social Security.\n  We all know that the Social Security program gets in serious \nfinancial trouble when the Baby Boomers start retiring early in the \nnext century. The Social Security actuaries tell us that, just 15 years \nfrom now, in 2013, Social Security will begin paying out more in \nbenefits than it receives in taxes and will have to begin redeeming the \ntreasury bonds issued to the Trust Funds. By 2032, the Trust Funds will \nbe exhausted, and the program will be running annual cash deficits of \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  As more and more people become aware of these financial realities, \nSocial Security has quickly ceased to be the untouchable third rail of \npolitics. In my view, it should soon become the brass ring of politics. \nEntitlement reform is one of the greatest challenges our nation faces, \nand we should all be reaching for the solution that will enable Social \nSecurity to provide for our grandchildren like it did for our \ngrandparents.\n  Fortunately, right now we have a tremendous window of opportunity for \nreal reform. Our economy is strong; the federal budget is balanced for \nthe first time in 30 years; and the Congressional Budget Office is \nactually projecting budget surpluses each year for the next decade. \nJust as important, the 76 million Baby Boomers are still in the \nworkforce paying taxes into the Social Security system. If we wait \nuntil this enormous group stops paying taxes and instead begins drawing \nbenefits, the fixes will have to be much more severe.\n  Over the past 15 months, Senators Judd Gregg and John Breaux, along \nwith Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Charles Stenholm, have served as \ncongressional co-chairmen for the National Commission on Retirement \nPolicy, sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies. This 24-member group of politicians, businessmen, and policy \nexperts developed and unanimously approved a broad proposal for \nreforming Social Security. The Senators and Congressmen then crafted \nbipartisan legislation based on the commission's recommendations.\n  The outline of the Gregg-Breaux plan is simple. It would reduce the \nSocial Security payroll tax by 2 percentage points and divert the money \ninto a mandatory savings account for every worker under age 55. The \naccounts would supplement--not replace--benefits guaranteed through the \ntraditional system. Workers could pick from a limited number of \ninvestment funds dealing in stocks, government bonds, or a combination \nof the two, much like the Thrift Savings Plan available to members of \nCongress and federal employees. The benefits of current retirees and \nworkers age 55 or older would not be affected by the private accounts, \nand benefits to survivors of deceased workers and the disabled would \nalso be protected.\n  Meanwhile, Gregg-Breaux would make changes to the remaining pay-as-\nyou-go system to bring it into actuarial balance. It would accelerate \nthe scheduled increase in the retirement age, raising the age for full \nbenefits to 70 and the age for early retirement benefits to 65 by 2029. \nIt would reduce the Consumer Price Index by half a percentage point so \nthat it more accurately reflects the rate of inflation, and it would \nscale back benefits to wealthier retirees, who are likely to fare \nbetter with their individual accounts. Unlike several of the proposals \nthat are on the table, however, the Gregg-Breaux plan does not raise \ntaxes, period. In fact, the payroll tax is reduced from 12.4 to 10.4 \npercent and never rises above 10.4 percent again.\n  Some groups continue to insist that only minor adjustments are needed \nto put Social Security back on sound financial footing. What they often \nwon't tell you is that all of these adjustments would either raise \ntaxes or cut benefits. For me, it's clear that ``reforming'' Social \nSecurity in this way will no longer suffice. These kinds of traditional \nreforms were last used by the 1983 Greenspan Commission to ``fix'' \nSocial Security for 75 years. Today, we know the program will be in \ntrouble again in 2013, when tax revenues are no longer sufficient to \npay promised benefits.\n  Instead of taxing Americans at ever-higher rates while scaling back \ntheir retirement benefits, our goal should be to enable all workers to \naccumulate a level of wealth that will allow them to retire with a \nbasic level of economic security. That's why private accounts are a \ncentral part of the plan I support.\n  Private accounts would give working-class Americans the same access \nto the power of compound interest that the rich enjoy today. This \nnotion terrifies those who want to keep workers as dependent on \ngovernment as possible, but more and more people acknowledge that \nprivate accounts are the best way to simultaneously solve the two \ncrises facing Social Security--the impending insolvency of the program \ndue to enormous demographic shifts, and the lower and lower rates of \nreturn for each new generation of workers. First, private accounts \nwould allow younger workers to take advantage of the higher returns \navailable to private investment. Second, because these workers would be \ngiving up some of their future claims on traditional Social Security \nbenefits, the unfunded liability of the program would be reduced.\n  As the American people learn more about the issue of Social Security \nreform, public opinion on the issue of private accounts has clearly \nshifted. Depending on how the question is phrased, between 60 and 80 \npercent of Americans now say they favor letting workers invest some \nportion of their Social Security tax payments. Most of the current \nreform plans have an element of private investment, and I am pleased \nthat several of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate have openly \nendorsed them.\n  In my view, reforming Social Security is the most significant \npolitical issue on the horizon for the foreseeable future, and I am \nencouraged that the American people and elected officials on both sides \nof the aisle recognize its importance to our nation's continued \nprosperity. History has shown us that an issue of this magnitude can \nonly be addressed successfully through a bipartisan process. The Gregg-\nBreaux plan is a thoughtful approach to reform, and I expect it to \nwield considerable influence in shaping the important debate that lies \nahead.\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nsweeping Social Security Legislation introduced by my colleagues--\nSenators Gregg and Breaux. The ``21st Century Retirement Security Plan \nof 1998'' is designed to strengthen Social Security now, encourage \npersonal savings, and expand the availability of private pension plans.\n  Senators Gregg and Breaux recently co-chaired the National Commission \non Retirement Policy. This bipartisan commission of lawmakers, \neconomists, pension experts, and businessmen released a report calling \nfor legislation including, among other things, personal savings \naccounts and a gradual increase in the retirement age. The ``21st \nCentury Retirement Plan'' implements both these provisions and aims to \nserve a two-fold purpose: It strengthens the Social Security system--\nensuring payment to all of the hard-working Americans that have paid \ninto it. And it expands opportunities for private retirement savings--\nwhich will provide Americans with more options to save and invest in \ntheir future.\n  As we approach the dawn of the 21st century, it is common knowledge \nthat the aging baby boom will create huge financial problems for future \ngenerations. Without changes, the Social Security trust funds will be \nunable to pay full benefits beginning around the year 2030. Therefore, \na thirty-eight year old individual, making an average wage, will have \nto live until the age of 91 to get back what he paid into the system. \nThis is not the time to propose patchwork solutions to this problem, \nbut rather to seize this unique opportunity to restructure the entire \nsystem. I believe that this legislation is a logical first step toward \nachieving that goal.\n  President Clinton has also jumped on the save Social Security \nbandwagon,\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\nalthough his plan is to sit back and wait until we have three or four \n``national town meetings'' to discuss the ramifications of changing the \nsystem. Coincidentally, those meetings conclude at the end of this \nyear--which just happens to be an election year. This epitomizes the \nlack of courage of the part of most of our elected officials.\n  This legislation will save the Social Security system through the \nnext century without raising taxes. In fact, under this plan, taxpayers \nwould be able to invest 2 percent of their current payroll tax in \nprivate savings accounts modeled after the Government's thrift savings \nplan. This change would not affect current retirees, but would rather \nassist current tax-paying Americans preparing for their retirement. As \na tax-paying American, I trust myself to manage my money much more than \nI trust the Federal Government to provide for my future.\n  This allocation of part of the payroll tax would be offset by our \ncurrent budget surplus and a gradual rise of the retirement age from 67 \nto 70 by 2029. Further, these accounts would provide a higher rate of \nreturn for recipients. This would, as provided by the bill, lower \nguaranteed Social Security payments and ease the burden on the system.\n  This plan improves retirement security and protects future \ngenerations by strengthening the safety-net aspect of the Social \nSecurity system and providing Americans more options for savings and \ninvestment. The ``21st Century Retirement Security Plan of 1998'' \ncontains the courage and common sense necessary to save our children \nand our children's children from the economic strife that is bound to \narise if we do not address this impending problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 2314. A bill to clarify that prosecutors and other public \nofficials acting in the performance of their official duties may enter \ninto cooperation agreements and make other commitments, assurances, and \npromises, as provided by law in consideration of truthful testimony; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     prosecutors' cooperation agreements clarification legislation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this month, a three-judge panel of \nthe Tenth Circuit decided United States v. Singleton, in which it found \nthat the prosecutor had violated the federal gratuity statute and a \nstate ethics rule by entering a plea agreement with a cooperating \ndefendant that made certain promises in exchange for the cooperator's \ntruthful testimony at trial. The promises in question were the sort of \nplain vanilla promises that appear in virtually every cooperation \nagreement, and are the lifeblood of bringing successful prosecutions.\n  As a former prosecutor, I found this decision bizarre and dangerous. \nIn effect, it makes it illegal--a federal felony--for prosecutors to \noffer leniency in return for testimony on the theory that leniency is a \nform of bribery. Defense attorneys across the country have already \nbegun to jump on the Singleton bandwagon. In my state, Vermont, the \ndecision has already triggered new motions in a major drug smuggling \ncase involving a billion dollars worth of hashish. The defendant, \nMartin Scott, is scheduled to go to trial in September, and the \ngovernment's evidence includes testimony by cooperating codefendants. \nScott has now moved to exclude this testimony on the ground that it was \nobtained unlawfully in return for government promises of leniency, \nciting Singleton.\n  If this controversial decision stands, prosecutors would be exposed \nto the threat of felony liability and disciplinary action just for \ndoing their jobs. In addition, this decision could result in a tidal \nwave of reversals and suppression rulings in cases involving cooperator \ntestimony.\n  I was relieved to see that the Tenth Circuit acted swiftly to vacate \nthe panel decision and set the case down for en banc rehearing in \nNovember, and I am confident that the ruling will eventually be thrown \nout--but not before the issue has been raised and relitigated at every \nturn in every district and circuit court in the land. At a minimum, \nthis will delay trials, squander scarce judicial resources, and \ngenerally waste everyone's time.\n  We need to insure that prosecutors have the tools they need to do \ntheir jobs effectively, and being able to enter into cooperation \nagreements is critical. That's why I am introducing legislation today \nto make crystal clear that prosecutors and other public officials \nacting in the performance of their official duties may enter \ncooperation agreements and make other such commitments, assurances and \npromises in return for truthful testimony.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this matter, and ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2314\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CLARIFICATION OF PROSECU- TORIAL AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 201 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs \n     (3) and (4), respectively;\n       (B) by striking ``Whoever'' and all that follows through \n     ``otherwise than'' and inserting ``Whoever, otherwise than'';\n       (C) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as \n     paragraphs (1) and (2), respectively, and indenting \n     appropriately; and\n       (D) in paragraph (1), as so designated, by striking ``or'' \n     at the end; and\n       (2) in subsection (d), by striking ``paragraphs (2) and \n     (3)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (3) and (4)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. Ford):\n  S. 2315. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and titles XVIII and XIX of the \nSocial Security Act to require that group and individual health \ninsurance coverage and group health plans and managed care plans under \nthe medicare and medicaid programs provide coverage for hospital \nlengths of stay as determined by the attending health care provider in \nconsultation with the patient; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                  hospital length of stay act of 1998\n\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator D'Amato, Senator Ford and \nI are introducing a bill to require health insurance plans to cover the \nlength of hospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by \nthe attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be \nmedically appropriate.\n\n  This bill will return medical decision-making to medical \nprofessionals because it is time to stop insurance plans' interference \ninto this important area of physician decision-making.\n  It is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the American \nCollege of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists, the American Academy of Neurology and the American \nPsychological Association. Only a physician, taking care of the patient \nwho understands the patient's history, medical condition and needs, can \nmake a decision on how much hospital care a person needs. Physicians \nare trained to evaluate all the unique needs and problems of each \nindividual patient. Every patient is different and the course of \nillness has great variation.\n  Lengths of stay should not be determined by insurance company clerks, \nactuaries or non-medical personnel. It is the attending physician, not \na physician or other representative of an insurance company, that \nshould decide when to admit and discharge someone.\n  Professional physician organizations develop practice guidelines that \nguide them in determining medical necessity. These are intended as \nguidance and are medical judgments made by qualified medical people. \nPhysicians know what medical necessity and generally accepted medical \npractice are.\n  We are introducing this bill because we have had a virtual parade of \ndoctors come to us and in essence say, ``We are fed up. We spend too \nmuch of our time trying to justify our decisions on medical necessity \nto insurance companies. Insurance company rules have supplanted doctor \ndecision making.''\n  Donna Damico, a nurse in a Maryland psychiatric unit of a hospital, \ntold National Public Radio on October 1, 1997:\n\n       I spend my days watching the care on my unit be directed by \n     faceless people from insurance companies on the other end of \n     the phone. My hospital employs a full-time nurse whose entire \n     job is to talk to insurance reviewers. . . . The reviewer's \n     background can\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\n     range anywhere from high school graduate to nurse, social \n     worker or even actual physicians.\n\n  A number of examples have come to my attention:\n  In 1996, we addressed the problem of ``drive-through'' baby \ndeliveries, insurance plans covering minimal hospital stays for \nnewborns and their mothers because of examples like this: One \nCalifornia new mother was readmitted after a Caesarean section because \nof severe anemia from excessive blood loss. She didn't know how much \nblood loss was normal after a delivery. Two California women were \nreadmitted after vaginal deliveries with endometritis, an infection of \nthe uterus.\n  We've had examples of ``drive-through'' mastectomies, insurance plans \nshoving women out the door to deal on their own with drainage tubes, \npain and disfigurement. S. 249, which I introduced with Senator D'Amato \nlast year, addresses that abuse and we are trying to get it passed.\n  A California pediatrician told us of a child with very bad asthma. \nThe insurance plan authorized 3 days in the hospital; the doctor wanted \n4-5 days. He told us about a baby with infant botulism (poisoning), a \nbaby with a toxin that had spread from the intestine to the nervous \nsystem so that the child could not breathe. The doctor thought a 10-14 \nday hospital stay was medically necessary for the baby; the insurance \nplan insisted on one week.\n  A California neurologist told us about a seven-year-old girl with an \near infection who went to the doctor feverish. When her illness \ndeveloped into pneumonia, she was admitted to the hospital. After two \ndays she was sent home, but she then returned to the hospital three \ntimes because her insurance plan only covered a certain number of days. \nThe third time she returned she had meningitis which can be life \nthreatening. The doctor said that if this girl had stayed in the \nhospital the first time for five to seven days, the antibiotics would \nhave killed the infection and the meningitis would never have \ndeveloped.\n  A 27-year-old man from central California had a heart transplant and \nwas forced out of the hospital after 4 days because his HMO would not \npay for more days. He died.\n  Nurses in St. Luke's Hospital, San Francisco, say that women are \nbeing sent home after only two nights after a hysterectomy and two \nnights for a Caesarean section delivery, both of which are major \nabdominal surgeries, even though physicians think the women are not \nready to go home..\n  Just last week Lisa Breakey, a San Jose speech pathologist, came to \nmy office and told us that she is providing home healthcare for stroke \npatients she used to see in the hospital. She sees patients in their \nhomes who have G tubes in their stomachs for feeding and trach tubes in \ntheir throats for breathing. The trach tubes have an inflated balloon \nor cuff which a family members must deflate and inflate by using a \nneedle. Family members are supposed to suction the patient's mouth and \nthroat before they deflate the cuff. Families, she stressed, are \nproviding intensive care, for which they are unprepared and untrained. \nBedrooms have become hospital rooms.\n  Another California physician told us about a patient who needed total \nhip replacement because her hip had failed. The doctor believed a \nseven-day stay was warranted; the plan authorized five.\n  Rep. Greg Ganske, a physician serving in the House, told the story of \na six-year-old child who nearly drowned. The child was put on a \nventilator and it appeared that he would not live. The hospital got a \ncall from the insurance company, asking if the doctor had considered \nsending the boy home because home ventilation is cheaper.\n  These cases can be summarized in the comments of a Chico, \nCalifornia, maternity ward nurse: ``People's treatment depends on the \ntype of insurance they have rather than what's best for them.''\n\n  As these cases illustrate, premature discharges can increase \nreadmissions and medical complications. During the ``drive-through \ndelivery'' debate, we heard about babies who were jaundiced and \ndehydrated and had to come back to the hospital.\n  Similarly, as reported in American Medical News on March 23, 1998, \naccording to Dr. David Phillips, ``a shift toward outpatient treatment \nactually has come at quite a high price . . . an increased loss of \nlives.'' This University of California study found that medication \nerrors are 3 times higher among outpatients than inpatients; that \nmedications side effects provides limited oversight by medical \npersonnel and that the patient-physician relationships is compromised.\n  Ms. Damico said, ``Patients return to us in acute states because \ntheir insurance will no longer pay the same amount for their outpatient \ntreatment . . . [They] deteriorate to the point of suicidal thoughts or \nattempts and need to return to the hospital.'' She cited the example of \na suicidal woman whose plan denied a hospital admission requested by \nher physician. After the doctor told her of the denial, she took twenty \n50-milligram tabs of Benadryl, was then admitted, and the plan then had \nto pay for hospital care, an ambulance and emergency room fees.\n  So not only do premature discharges compromise health, they \nultimately cost the insurer more.\n  Physicians say they battle daily with insurance companies to give \npatients the hospital care they need and to justify their decisions on \nmedical necessity.\n  An American Medical Association review of a managed care contract \n(Aetna US Healthcare) found that the contract gives ``the company the \nunilateral authority to change material terms of the contract and to \nmake determinations of medical necessity . . . without regard to \nphysician determinations or scientific or clinical protocols . . . .,'' \naccording to the January 19, 1998 American Medical News.\n  A study by the American College of Surgeons found that guidelines \npublished by Milliman and Robertson and used by many insurers represent \na minimum length of stay, compared with surgeons' estimates.\n  A study by the American Academy of Neurology found that the Milliman \nand Robertson guidelines on length of stay are ``extraordinarily short \nin comparison to a large National Library of Medicine database . .. And \nthat [the guidelines] do not relate to anything resembling the average \nhospital patient or attending physician . . . .'' The neurologists \nfound that these guidelines were ``statistically developed,'' not \nscientifically sound or clinically relevant.\n  A study in the April 1997 Bulletin of the American College of \nSurgeons found that surgeons stated that the appropriate length of stay \nfor an appendectomy is zero to five days, while insurance industry \nguidelines set a specific coverage limit of one day.\n  According to 134 interviews reported in the March 15, 1998 Washington \nPost, 7 in 10 physicians said, in dealing with managed care plans, they \nhave exaggerated the severity of an patient's condition to ``prevent \nhim or her from being sent home from a hospital prematurely.'' Dr. \nDavid Schriger, at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, said that he \nroutinely has patients, such as a frail, elderly woman with the flu, \nwho is not in imminent danger, but could encounter serious problems if \nshe is sent home during the night. He told the Post, ``At this point I \nhave to figure out a way to put her in the hospital. . . And typically, \nI'll come up with a reason acceptable to the insurer,'' and orders a \nblood test and chest x-ray, to justify admission.\n  The Post article also cited Kaiser Permanente's Texas division which \n``warned doctors in urgent care centers not to tell patients they \nrequired hospitalization, as one Kaiser administrator recalled. ``We \nbasically said [to] the UCC doctors, `If you value your job, you won't \nsay anything about hospitalization. All you'll say is, I think you need \nfurther evaluation . . . .'''\n  Ms. Damico, the psychiatric nurse interviewed on NPR said, ``Our \nutilization review nurse gives all of us, including the doctors, good \nadvice on how to chart so that our patients' care will be covered . . . \nWe all conspire quietly to make certain the charts look and sound bad \nenough.''\n  The American College of Surgeons wrote: ``We believe very strongly \nthat any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and the \npatient from the medical decision-making process only undermines the \nquality of that patient's care and his or her health and well being . . \n. . specific, single numbers [of days] cannot and should not be used to \nrepresent a\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\nlength of stay for a given procedure.'' (April 24, 1997) ACS on March 5 \nwrote, ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan \nthat removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision \nmaking process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and \nhis or her health and well being.''\n  The American Medical Association wrote on May 20, 1998, ``We are \ngratified that this bill would promote the fundamental concept, which \nthe AMA has always endorsed that medical decisions should be made by \npatients and their physicians, rather than by insurers or legislators . \n. . We appreciate your initiative and ongoing efforts to protect \npatients by ensuring that physicians may identify medically appropriate \nlengths of stay, unfettered by third party payers.''\n  The American Psychological Association, on March 4, 1998 wrote me, \n``We are pleased to support this legislation, which will require all \nhealth plans to follow the best judgment of the patient and attending \nprovider when determining length of stay for inpatient treatment.''\n  Americans' faith in their medical system has plummeted as almost \ndaily we hear of more horror stories of care denied and HMO hassles. \nArbitrary insurance company rules cannot address the subtleties of \nmedical care. A March 1998 U.S. News and Kaiser Family Foundation \nsurvey found that three in four Americans are worried about their \nhealth care coverage and half say they are worried that doctors are \nbasing treatment decisions strictly on what insurance plans will pay \nfor.\n  The bill we introduce today begins to address some of these problems. \nI am also a cosponsor of the Patient Bills of Rights (S. 1890) and the \nPatient Access to Responsible Care Act (S. 644), bills proposing \ncomprehensive reforms.\n  I hope these initiatives will send a strong message to the health \ninsurance industry and return medical decision-making to those medical \nprofessionals trained to make those decisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and \nletters in support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           Summary of the Hospital Length of Stay Act of 1998\n\n       Requires plans to cover hospital lengths of stay for all \n     illnesses and conditions as determined by the physician, in \n     consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate.\n       Prohibits plans from requiring providers (physicians) to \n     obtain a plan's prior authorization for a hospital length of \n     stay.\n       Prohibits plans from denying eligibility or renewal for the \n     purpose of avoiding these requirements.\n       Prohibits plans from penalizing or otherwise reducing or \n     limiting reimbursement of the attending physician because the \n     physician provided care in accordance with the requirements \n     of the bill.\n       Prohibits plans from providing monetary or other incentives \n     to induce a physician to provide care inconsistent with these \n     requirements.\n       Includes language clarifying that--nothing in the bill \n     requires individuals to stay in the hospital for a fixed \n     period of time for any procedure; plans may require \n     copayments but copayments for a hospital stay determined by \n     the physician cannot exceed copayments for any preceding \n     portion of the stay.\n       Does not pre-empt state laws that provide greater \n     protection.\n       Applies to private insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid and \n     Medigap.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                                     May 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the American Medical \n     Association (AMA), we would like to express our support for \n     your draft legislation the ``Hospital Length of Stay Act of \n     1998''. We hope you introduce this legislation that would \n     require coverage of an inpatient's hospital stay to the \n     extent determined medically appropriate by the attending \n     physician in consultation with the patient.\n       We are gratified that this bill would promote the \n     fundamental concept, which the AMA has always endorsed, that \n     medical decisions should be made by patients and their \n     physicians rather than by insurers or legislators. As you may \n     know, on several occasions the AMA has supported legislative \n     initiatives that would require coverage on a diagnosis by \n     diagnosis basis for medically appropriate minimum lengths of \n     stay. While those bills have moved us in the right direction, \n     this legislation would take us where we want to be.\n       We appreciate your initiative and ongoing efforts to \n     protect patients by ensuring that physicians may identify \n     medically appropriate lengths of stay, unfettered by third \n     party payors. We offer you our assistance in helping to enact \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Lynn E. Jensen,\n     Interim Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 American College of Surgeons,\n\n                                                    July 15, 1998.\n\n           Statement: Postoperative Lengths of Hospital Stay\n\n     Edward R. Laws, Jr., MD, FACS,\n     Member of the Board of Regents,\n     American College of Surgeons.\n       On behalf of the American College of Surgeons, I would like \n     to commend Senator Feinstein for her continuing concern for \n     high-quality patient care. In particular, I want to praise \n     her and her cosponsor, Senator D'Amato, for their most recent \n     effort to protect patients by introducing legislation to ban \n     the practice of imposing arbitrary coverage limits on \n     hospital length of stay--a practice that is currently being \n     used by some third-party payers.\n       The issue of ``drive-through'' maternity care, followed \n     more recently by the issue of outpatient mastectomy \n     operations, clearly illustrate the patient care problems that \n     are created when third-party payers set a specific number of \n     days as the appropriate length of stay for a given procedure. \n     For some maternity and breast cancer patients, the outpatient \n     setting may well be medically appropriate and personally \n     preferred, but for many others this certainly is not the \n     case. As many state and federal legislators have come to \n     realize, each of these patients has her own set of unique \n     medical problems and related issues, and it is inappropriate \n     to expect them to conform to cost containment goals that were \n     designed with the ``optimum'' patient in mind.\n       What few people seem to recognize, however, is that these \n     problems are not limited to new mothers and breast cancer \n     patients. Indeed, thousands of patients whose illnesses do \n     not occupy a high profile on the nation's health care agenda \n     face the same dilemma. A variety of factors--such coexisting \n     illnesses, the optimum treatment method selected, \n     complications arising during the operation, and differences \n     in response to the treatment--can vary significantly among \n     individual patients, making it impossible to accurately or \n     precisely predict the appropriate length of stay for a given \n     procedure. Such factors may also determine the appropriate \n     site for performing a particular operation or procedure. \n     Despite these important considerations, efforts to restrain \n     growth in spending for health care services, although a \n     legitimate concern, are coming into conflict with individual \n     patient needs.\n       We need to view the issue of length-of-stay coverage limits \n     from a broader perspective than we have in the past. \n     Congress, state legislatures, and the managed care industry \n     have acted on a procedure-specific basis in response to \n     concerns raised about coverage limits placed on maternity \n     care and mastectomy operations. But, it is time to take the \n     next step.\n       Senator Feinstein's legislation, the ``Hospital Length of \n     Stay Act'' would take this step by proposing to protect \n     medical decisionmaking on behalf of all patients. The \n     legislation specifies that decisions about the medical \n     appropriateness of a hospital length of stay should be \n     determined by the attending physician, in consultation with \n     the patient. Further, the legislation would prohibit health \n     plans from penalizing patients, physicians, or hospitals for \n     following through on these medical decisions.\n       The American College of Surgeons believes strongly that, \n     for all surgical patients, the responsibility for making the \n     decisions to operate, what type of operation the patient \n     should have, and how long the patient stays in the hospital \n     following the operation must rest with the surgeon and the \n     patient. The College has always encouraged its members to \n     keep their patients' length of stay as short as possible. \n     However, we do believe very strongly that any health care \n     system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from \n     the medical decision-making process only undermines the \n     quality of that patient's care and his or her health and \n     well-being.\n       Once again, we congratulate Senator Feinstein and Senator \n     D'Amato for their courageous efforts on behalf of quality \n     patient care. The College looks forward to working closely \n     with them and their colleagues in the House of \n     Representatives, including Congressman Tom Coburn and \n     Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, to ensure swift passage of this \n     important legislation.\n       The American College of Surgeons is a scientific and \n     educational organization of surgeons that was founded in 1913 \n     to raise the standards of surgical practice and to improve \n     the care of the surgical patient. The College is dedicated to \n     the ethical and competent practice of surgery. Its \n     achievements have significantly influenced the course of \n     scientific surgery in America, and have established it as an \n     important advocate for all surgical patients. The College has \n     more than 62,000 members and is the largest organization of \n     surgeons in the world.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n\n\n                                 American College of Surgeons,\n\n                                                    March 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the 62,000 Fellows of \n     the American College of\n\n[[Page S8251]]\n\n     Surgeons, I want to commend you for introducing the \n     ``Hospital Length of Stay Act of 1998.'' Your legislation \n     will contribute significantly to the effort to educate \n     Congress and the public about the practice of imposing \n     arbitrary coverage limits on hospital length of stay that do \n     not take into account an individual patient's unique health \n     care needs.\n       For all surgical patients, the responsibility for making \n     the decision to operate, the type of operation, and how long \n     the patient stays in the hospital following the operation \n     must rest with the surgeon and the patient. The College has \n     always encouraged its members to keep their patients' length \n     of stay as short as possible. However, we believe very \n     strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the \n     surgeon and the patient from the medical decisionmaking \n     process only undermines the quality of that patient's care \n     and his or health and well being.\n       Once again, we appreciate your continuing concern, and \n     congratulate you on introducing legislation that acknowledges \n     the importance of preserving the surgeon-patient relationship \n     and ensuring that they are able to exercise their \n     responsibility for making medical treatment decisions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paul A.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     Attn: Glenda Booth and Ann Garcia, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Academy of Neurology, \n     an association of over 15,000 neurologists, has been in the \n     forefront of discussions and debate concerning the necessary \n     protections that should be afforded our patients in a health \n     care environment increasingly dominated by corporate and \n     managed care structures. We believe that it is imperative \n     that patients, who often feel powerless in today's health \n     care environment, be protected through the implementation of \n     basic health care standards including such protections as \n     appropriate health plan disclosure, adequate choice of plans \n     and providers, and appropriate grievance processes.\n       Your bill, the Hospital Length of Stay Act of 1998, \n     contains many of the elements that we deem important, \n     especially its fundamental premise to protect and preserve \n     the patient and provider relationship. Physicians need to be \n     allowed to exercise their decision-making without obstruction \n     when they consult with their patients concerning the \n     appropriate treatment or care for their health care \n     condition.\n       A survey by the National Coalition on Health Care found \n     that 80% of Americans believe that their quality of care is \n     often compromised to save money. Many Americans feel insecure \n     about their health care plan and question whether or not the \n     plan will take care of them when they really need it such as \n     when they become hospitalized. It is out of this demonstrated \n     national concern that the President of the United States as \n     well as several leading medical societies, such as the \n     Academy, are now calling on members of Congress to implement \n     national health care standards or more commonly known as \n     consumer ``bill of rights''.\n       The Academy applauds and endorses your bill as a bill of \n     rights component and we hope that this is one of many steps \n     that will be taken by you and your colleagues in helping us \n     to be able to confidently tell our patients that their health \n     care plan will take care of them when they are sick or are in \n     need of health care.\n       I have included a copy of the Academy's patient protection \n     statement that I hope you will review and consider as the \n     debate on this important issue continues throughout this \n     legislative session.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Steven P.

We \n     are pleased to support this legislation, which will require \n     all health plans to follow the best judgment of the patient \n     and attending provider when determining length of stay for \n     inpatient treatment.\n       We appreciate your sensitivity to our concerns over the \n     reality that psychologists in many states are attending \n     providers under their state license and scope of practice. \n     Accordingly, your bill extends this quality of care \n     protection to the patients of psychologists as well as \n     ``physicians'', as did the Coburn-Strickland amendment to the \n     House Commerce Committee version of the Balanced Budget Act \n     last year.\n       There is obviously enormous public interest in having \n     Congress act this year to pass enforceable federal standards \n     of consumer protection in managed care. Our members are also \n     supportive of a bill that you have cosponsored, the Patient \n     Access to Responsible Care Act (S. 644), and we are very \n     appreciative of your visible involvement in this issue. The \n     Hospital Length to Stay Act addresses another important issue \n     that should be addressed in this debate and we commend you \n     for taking it on.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Marilyn S.

A bill to require the Secretary of Energy to \n     submit to Congress a plan to ensure that all amounts accrued \n     on the books of the United States Enrichment Corporation for \n     the disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride will be used \n     to treat and recycle depleted uranium hexafluoride; read the \n     first time.\n\n\n           united states enrichment corporation privatization\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a must-pass \npiece of legislation to ensure that the Department of Energy is not \nstuck with a massive unfunded mandate as a result of privatizing the \nUnited States Enrichment Corporation. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator DeWine who is an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  Last month, the administration, the Department of Energy, and the \nUSEC Board came to a decision on how they intend to privatize the USEC. \nThis deal, which was struck in secret, is a complicated and confusing \nmatter that I am only just beginning to understand. The facts, I have \ndiscovered, are not welcome news to the communities of Paducah, \nKentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, where the two USEC gaseous diffusion \nplants are located. These facilities employ approximately 4,000 people, \nmaking them the largest employers in those regions.\n  The most discouraging aspect of this privatization proposal is the \nimpact this deal will have on jobs. The administration has tried to put \na positive spin on things by claiming that only 600 jobs would be lost \nover the next 2 years. Unfortunately, this may be the tip of the \niceberg, because after the first 2 years, the administration has made \nno guarantees on the number of jobs that might be lost. In fact, after \nreading the fine print of this agreement, union and community leaders \nfeel that closure of one of the two plants is a very real possibility. \nThis could result in the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs. Without some \nefforts to mitigate the job losses, these communities will be \neconomically devastated.\n  The second item of concern is that the Department of Energy--and \ntaxpayers--will be stuck with an unfunded environmental liability. As \nyou may know, under the terms of the USEC Privatization Act of 1996, \nthe responsibility for the treatment and disposal of the uranium waste \nwill be transferred from USEC to the Department of Energy. To prepare \nfor this reality, USEC has collected nearly $385 million from its \ncustomers for the specific purpose of cleaning up their environmental \nliability. Unfortunately, the administration's proposal only provides \n$50 million of that total to be used to address this problem, while the \nremaining $335 million is due to be deposited into the General \nTreasury.\n\n  Mr. President, there are two problems with this scenario. First, I \nfail to see the logic behind the decision to use only one-eighth of the \nmoney which has been collected for the purpose of addressing the \nnuclear waste at the USEC plants. Second, the administration's plan \ncalls for the $50 million to be given to USEC, Inc.--the private \ncorporation. Why should we, as legislators, allow the government to \ngive a $50 million handout to a private corporation to clean up a \nFederal entity's mess when $385 million is already available for \nenvironmental clean up? What is worse, the administration's plan will \nadd to the tens of thousands of canisters of depleted uranium \nhexafluoride already stored at the plants, further expanding the \nenvironmental problems of the plants and the cost to clean up this site \nfor the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. President, I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, but \nthis deal is not good for Kentucky and is an abrogation of the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility to clean up this nuclear mess. We need to \nensure that the taxpayers and the workers at these facilities get a \nbetter deal than what is being offered. That is why I have introduced \nthis legislation to ensure that all the funds raised and earmarked for \nthe clean up of USEC's environmental legacy will remain available for \nthat purpsoe--and that purpose only. This bill mandates that the \nadministration hold these earmarked funds until the Secretary of Energy \nsubmits a plan and\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\nlegislation to implement and operate a facility to cleanup the nuclear \nwaste at Paducah and Portsmouth. Once this plan is submitted, then the \nfunding can flow to clean up this environmental nightmare.\n  This bill will ensure that taxpayers aren't stuck with an unfunded \nmandate and makes a commitment to the communities that this toxic \nhazard will be disposed of in a timely manner. Unlike the \nadministration's plan to simply store additional uranium waste, my bill \nwill create many more jobs to construct and operate this facility. The \nnew facility will convert the depleted uranium from an unstable and \ntoxic hexaflouride form to a stable and non-threatening oxide. During \nthis process many useful commercial by-products can also be recovered \nand sold.\n  Mr. President, I have here a letter from the Governors of Kentucky, \nOhio, and Tennessee urging Secretary Pena to take immediate steps to \nconvert the toxic uranium hexafluoride into a more stable, non-\nthreatening oxide form. The Governors urge the Secretary to seek the \nnecessary funding to begin this process and they specifically \nidentified the funding I have identified in my amendment. I ask \nunanimous consent that the letter signed by Governors Patton, Sunquist, \nand Voinovich be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 27, 1998.\n     Hon. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary, Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\n     Re ``Draft PEIS for Alternative Strategies for the Long-Term \n     Management and Use of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride,'' DOE/\n     EIS-0269 dated December 1997.\n       Dear Secretary Pena: More than forty years ago the U.S. \n     Department of Energy began the uranium enhancement initiative \n     that created a common link between Ohio, Kentucky, and \n     Tennessee. This commonality includes the U.S. Department of \n     Energy's legacy of waste, a significant portion of which is \n     made up of depleted uranium hexafluoride. Today, our three \n     states are working together in order to recommend the \n     selection of an appropriate and lawful alternative for the \n     long-term management and use of depleted uranium \n     hexafluoride. We believe that such an alternative must \n     minimize impacts on human health and the environment, as well \n     as benefit the overall mission of our states and the U.S. \n     Department of Energy (``DOE'').\n       Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee have the following \n     significant concerns regarding the above-referenced document:\n       DOE should consider the immediate conversion of all \n     depleted uranium hexafluoride (DUF6) to the less hazardous \n     uranium oxide (U308) and provide above ground storage of the \n     U308. We do not believe that waiting for possible market \n     demands for the DUF6 is justification for delaying this \n     project. It is incumbent upon DOE to immediately begin \n     seeking funds from Congress for this conversion. We urge DOE \n     to complete conversion by the year 2018 or earlier and reduce \n     the mortgage of maintaining the cylinders.\n       A long-term strategy for DUF6 must include DOE's entire \n     cylinder inventory, including heel and small cylinders. The \n     10,000+ cylinders of DUF6 generated by the United States \n     Enrichment Corporation (USEC), which will revert to DOE \n     ownership upon privatization of USEC, must also be considered \n     in any plans.\n       An estimated $480 million has been accrued by USEC since \n     1993 in order to offset the cost of the future conversion of \n     DUF6 generated by USEC. DOE should work with Congress now to \n     ensure this fund is not diverted into the federal treasury \n     for an unrelated use. In addition, DOE might consider \n     partnering with the future owner of USEC in a long-term \n     strategy for managing and converting DUF6, in order to avoid \n     redundancy of efforts. Any partnering effort, however, must \n     not slow progress toward conversion.\n       Natural phenomena events or accidents may not have been \n     adequately considered in the PEIS. DOE must identify the \n     ``worse-case'' cylinder conditions and explicitly use this \n     information in the hazard modeling descriptions.\n       In order for states to effectively evaluate the potential \n     impact of the preferred alternative DOE must provide \n     information on the location of the sites where conversion \n     would occur and how wastes generated from this process will \n     be managed. In order to avoid the undue risk of transporting \n     deteriorating cylinders, we recommend that DOE evaluate the \n     feasibility of on-site conversion plants.\n       DOE must ensure that funding for safe storage and \n     maintenance of DUF6 cylinders and storage yards is at an \n     adequate level to protect human health and the environment.\n       The States welcome the opportunity to work closely with the \n     Department of Energy in addressing these complex issues and \n     moving rapidly toward an alternative that will well serve the \n     public and the environment. In addition we urge DOE to \n     carefully consider the more detailed comments being submitted \n     by each of our states environmental regulatory agencies.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor Paul E. Patton,\n     Governor George V. Voinovich,\n     Governor Don Sundquis.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I also have a letter from the Oil, \nChemical and Atomic Workers Union, which represents 2,200 hourly \nworkers at the Paducah and Portsmouth uranium enrichment facilities. \nThey have also advocated for the use of those funds to begin the clean \nup of this toxic material. I ask unanimous consent that this letter \nalso be printed in the record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International, Union, \n           AFL-CIO,\n                                                     Lakewood, CO,\n                                                    July 14, 1998.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On June 29, 1998 the Administration \n     announced that it will soon privatize the United States \n     Enrichment Corporation (USEC), which operates the two uranium \n     enrichment plants owned by the Department of Energy in \n     Portsmouth, Ohio and Paducah, Kentucky. Coinciding with this \n     announcement, USEC declared that:\n       (1) ``to the extent commercially practicable'' it will \n     eliminate no more than 600 jobs during over the next two \n     years, consistent with an undisclosed USEC ``Strategic \n     Plan'', and\n       (2) it will transfer thousands of canisters of its depleted \n     uranium hexaflouride waste to the Department of Energy who \n     will inherit the disposition responsibility for wastes that \n     were created by USEC between July 1, 1993 and the date of \n     privatization. USEC has accrued approximately $400 million on \n     its balance sheet to cover the disposition costs of this \n     waste.\n       Approximately $1.2 billion is presently in a revolving fund \n     account in USEC's name at the Treasury Department--a fund \n     which was created pursuant to Section 1308 of the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992. Of that amount, $400 million represents \n     the funds collected from utility customers for enrichment \n     services to cover the costs for disposition of these wastes. \n     The Administration has advised us that, absent legislation, \n     these funds will be swept out of this revolving fund \n     immediately after privatization.\n       To date, Treasury Department officials have been unwilling \n     to secure these funds for the purpose of which they were \n     reserved; to threat the massive quantities of waste left by \n     USEC for the government to clean up. If the funds accrued on \n     USEC's pre-privatization balance sheet were transferred into \n     a dedicated fund at the Department of Energy, these extremely \n     corrosive radioactive wastes would not sit untreated and \n     approximately 240 displaced workers could be re-employed \n     preforming waste treatment activity at Paducah and \n     Portsmouth.\n       We understand that you are planning legislation which will \n     secure the $400 million in USEC's account at Treasury for the \n     purpose for which it was reserved: to treat waste \n     generated by USEC. Your legislation will fence these funds \n     until the Administration submits a waste treatment plan to \n     Congress with its FY 2000 budget request. The plan will \n     include the construction of two treatment plants--one in \n     Ohio and one in Kentucky. This approach will reduce the \n     hazards associated with the transport of radioactive \n     wastes.\n       In April of this year the Governors from Kentucky, Ohio and \n     Tennessee wrote to Secretary of Energy Federico Pena \n     endorsing the concept of using the funds from USEC's balance \n     sheet for the treatment and disposition of the depleted \n     uranium hexaflouride tails.\n       The Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers Union (OCAW), which \n     represents 2,200 hourly workers at the two gaseous diffusion \n     plants in Paducah and Portsmouth, applauds your efforts to \n     pass legislation which will fence these funds prior to the \n     privatization of USEC.\n       As you deliberate this legislation, we urge you to ensure \n     that the Department of Energy will require the cleanup \n     contractor(s) to provide a right of first refusal to \n     displaced workers from the gaseous diffusion plants, and to \n     require the contractor(s) to minimize the social and economic \n     impacts by bridging health and pension benefits. Such an \n     arrangement is consistent with the amendment you proposed to \n     offer as part of the FY 99 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act.\n       We look forward to working with you and other members to \n     ensure swift passage of this legislation in the House and \n     Senate prior to the privatization date.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Richard Miller,\n                                                   Policy Analyst.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have also cleared this bill with \nChairman Murkowski of the Energy Committee and Senator Domenici, who is \nthe chairman of the relevant subcommittee on the Appropriations \nCommittee. Neither Senator has any objection to the immediate passage \nof this\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\nlegislation. Finally, I have cleared this proposal with the \nCongressional Budget Office and they have scored this bill as having \nzero budget impact.\n  Mr. President, we need to ensure that the people, economies and \nenvironment of Western Kentucky and Southeastern Ohio are not \nsacrificed to make a quick buck off the sale of the uranium enrichment \nfacilities, especially when funding is available. I urge my colleagues \nto approve this legislation and protect taxpayers from paying an \nadditional cost for clean up.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nlegislation offered by our distinguished friend from Kentucky, Senator \nMcConnell, to ensure that the Energy Department has the resources to \naddress an important public health issue and is not saddled with a \nmassive unfunded mandate in the wake of the privatization of the United \nStates Enrichment Corporation (USEC).\n  This privatization will entail the purchase of nuclear material from \nthe Russians--material which it is clearly in our national security \ninterest to have removed from the international market. There is \ncurrently a fund within USEC which deals with the ``disposition of \ndepleted uranium hexafluoride''--and this fund contains an estimated \n$400 million. If no changes are made, this money will go to the U.S. \nTreasury when the Initial Public Offering occurs, possibly as soon as \nnext week.\n  This fund was created explicitly to handle the disposition of this \nkind of material. But if the law isn't changed, the Department of \nEnergy (DOE) would have to find new funding sources in order to treat \nthe material--and it may not be able to come up with the money.\n  This would be a vary undesirable result. The material under \ndiscussion is highly toxic--and disposing of it is and should remain an \nimportant national security priority. That $400 million is needed to \nstabilize this material, and to process it so that parts of it can be \nrecycled and other parts can be safely secured.\n  This bill would provide that, ``the Secretary of Energy shall \nprepare, and the President shall include in the budget request for \nfiscal 2000, a plan and proposed legislation to ensure that all amounts \naccrued on the books of the United States Enrichment Corporation for \nthe disposition of depleted uranium hexafluoride will be used to \ncommence construction of, not later than January 31, 2004, and to \noperate, an onsite facility at each of the gaseous diffusion plants at \nPaducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, to treat and recycle depleted \nuranium hexafluoride.''\n  The bill will address this key challenge. And it will also prevent a \nmajor economic dislocation in two communities--Portsmouth, OH (whose \nUSEC plant has 2,400 employees) and Paducah, KY (whose USEC plant has \n2,000 employees). This bill will support new decontamination and \ndecommissioning jobs at these plants, which may experience limited job \nloss through the privatization.\n  It is an important investment in these two communities--and in a \nsensible toxic-materials disposal policy for America. I thank Senator \nMcConnell for his leadership on this legislation, and I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, in the nineteenth century, \nMerriwether Lewis and William Clark explored the western reaches of our \nexpanding country. As they explored my home region of the Pacific \nNorthwest, Lewis and Clark cataloged the mineral and natural resources \nof the land. In particular, they spoke of a mighty river known to the \nlocal inhabitants as Nch'i Wana, the Great River. We know it today as \nthe Columbia River and its importance as a reliable source of water and \npower to the people of the Pacific Northwest is undeniable.\n  When Twentieth Century American explorers embarked on a similar \njourney to explore the Moon, one of their earliest actions was to bend \ndown to the surface and pick up a rock. That simple movement framed an \nancient reflex that underscores the basic imperative to explore our \nsurroundings. Today, I want to recognize the important role played by \nthe earth sciences in expanding our economy, supporting our national \ngoals, and increasing our knowledge of the larger world.\n  Modern geophysical research reveals that ours is a dynamic planet. On \nthe Earth's surface, great tectonic plates shift continental positions \nwith terrific force. On the ocean's surface, microscopic plants and \nanimals help regulate global atmospheric gases and serve as the \nfoundation of our planet's food web. In the deep ocean abyss, \nmysterious and wondrous animal communities thrive in endless darkness \nby deriving life-sustaining nutrients from active volcanic vents.\n  Earth science is a global science that speaks a global language and \nunites people by promoting sustainable development. The study of earth \nscience provides the skills necessary for locating and utilizing \nnatural resources, understanding natural processes that often conflict \nwith human designs, and comprehending our natural heritage through the \nunusual perspective of geologic time. The unique panorama of geologic \ntime allows us to observe the full range of natural processes on Earth \nand aids in developing a comprehensive view of the natural world beyond \na perspective limited only to that of human influence.\n  In my home state of Oregon, we celebrate the land and respect the \npower of nature. We have learned to protect our citizens and expand our \neconomy by working with nature and prudently mitigating natural \nhazards. In consideration of the importance of the earth sciences in \nthe daily lives of all Americans, I submit, for the Record, the \nresolution issued by the Association of American State Geologists.\n  The resolution follows:\n\n       Whereas the earth sciences are fundamental to society; and\n       Whereas the earth sciences are integral to finding, \n     developing, and conserving mineral, energy, and water \n     resources needed for society; and\n       Whereas the earth sciences promote public safety by \n     preparing for and mitigating natural hazards such as floods, \n     landslides, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, sinkholes, and \n     coastal erosion; and\n       Whereas the earth sciences are crucial to environmental and \n     ecological issues ranging from climate change and water and \n     air quality to waste disposal; and\n       Whereas geological factors of resources, hazards, and \n     environment are vital to land management and land use \n     decisions at local, state, regional, national, and \n     international levels; and\n       Whereas the earth sciences contribute critical information \n     that enhances our understanding of Nature,\n       Therefore, be it resolved that the second full week of \n     October henceforth be designated as Earth Science \n     Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8262-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DR. BOB LEFTWICH\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the \nexemplary efforts of Dr. Bob Leftwich, a school councelor in Ellijay, \nGeorgia. Over the past years, Dr. Leftwich has worked with students in \nhis area by talking to them about life and their futures. In his \ndiscussions, he has urged students to be the very best they can be and \nto make firm commitments to excellence.\n  Dr. Leftwich is a prime example of a hero in my book. He is a \ncommitted advocate for young people and the freedoms they can achieve \nthrough hard work and perseverance.\n  It is people like Bob, with the motivation he brings to our students, \nwho will be remembered when these students are the leaders of our great \nnation. They will no doubt look back and remember the impact that this \nindividual had on their lives. And hopefully they will follow his lead \nby getting involved with young people themselves.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I would like to thank Dr. Leftwich for his \ndedication to excellence.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments \nregarding the passage of H.R. 3156 late yesterday. This bill authorizes \nthe President to present, on behalf of Congress, the Congressional Gold \nMedal to Nelson Mandela. I am very pleased that the Senate has acted \nswiftly to pass this legislation.\n  The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor that the United \nStates Congress may bestow on a civilian. This prestigious award has \nbeen bestowed on a variety of people whose leadership and lives have \nleft an indelible impression on our great nation. President Mandela is \nwithout a doubt, one of those persons who has earned our recognition \nthrough his leadership in the quest for freedom and equality.\n  His ongoing struggle for such noble causes has carried the people of \nSouth Africa into a new era. And, his compassion for the downtrodden \nhas been felt around the world uplifting all people suffering from \noppression.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the ranking member of the Senate \nBanking Committee, Senator Sarbanes for his efforts in seeing this \nlegislation through the Senate in an expedited manner.

Mr. President, I rise to bring to my colleagues' \nattention an opinion piece from the New York Times by Bruce A. Lucero. \nMr. Lucero until recently owned and operated the ``New Woman, All Women \nHealth Care'' abortion clinic and remains, in his words, ``staunchly \npro-choice.'' He also supports my Child Custody Protection Act, S. \n1645, currently being marked-up in the Judiciary Committee. This \narticle shows, I believe, that even strong pro-choice advocates have \ngood reason to join with those of us who are pro-life in supporting \nparental involvement in their daughters' decision whether or not to \nhave an abortion.\n  In his article, Mr. President, Mr. Lucero points out that the Child \nCustody Protection Act is important for the health of teen-age girls \nacross America. By making it illegal for anyone to take a minor across \nstate lines for an abortion without first meeting the home state's \nparental notification requirements, this Act sees to it that parents \nare involved in their daughter's critical medical decision of whether \nto have an abortion. Where teen-agers cannot consult their parents, for \nexample because of abuse, a judge may waive the parental notification \nrequirement. But as Mr. Lucero points out, parents almost always are \nthe best source of emotional support and financial assistance for girls \nfacing unplanned pregnancies. In addition, teen-age girls who avoid \nconsulting their parents too often end up having later term, more \ndangerous procedures and avoiding necessary follow-up care. These \nfactors combine to increase medical risks significantly for teen-age \ngirls who undergo secret abortions.\n  Mr. Lucero calls for people on both sides of the abortion issue to \njoin in supporting the Child Custody Protection Act. As he states, \n``The only way we can and should keep abortions legal is to keep them \nsafe. To fight laws that would achieve this does no one any good--not \nthe pregnant teen-agers, the parents or the pro-choice movement.''\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and on both sides of \nthe abortion issue will take seriously Mr. Lucero's point, that the \nhealth and well-being of the teen-age girls of America is too important \nto allow ideology to keep their parents from fully participating in \ncrucial decisions such as whether or not to have an abortion, and I \nurge them to support S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act.\n  I ask that the full text of Mr. Lucero's article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 12, 1998]\n\n                        Parental Guidance Needed\n\n                          (By Bruce A. Lucero)\n\n       Alexandria, VA.--I am a doctor who performed some 45,000 \n     abortions during 15 years in practice in Alabama. Even though \n     I no longer perform abortions, I am still staunchly pro-\n     choice.\n       But I find that I disagree with many in the pro-choice \n     movement on the issue of parental notification laws for teen-\n     agers. Specifically, I support the Child Custody Protection \n     bill now being considered by Congress. Under the legislation, \n     it would be illegal for anyone to accompany a minor across \n     state lines for an abortion if that minor failed to meet the \n     requirement for parental consent or notification in her home \n     state.\n       The legislation, which the House is scheduled to vote on \n     this week, is important not only to the health of teen-age \n     girls, but to the pro-choice movement as well.\n       Opponents of the measure believe that the bill would simply \n     extend the reach of a state's parental notification or \n     consent law to other states. And they claim that teen-agers \n     would resort to unsafe abortions rather than tell their \n     parents.\n       In truth, however, in most cases a parent's input is the \n     best guarantee that a teen-ager will make a decision that is \n     correct for her--be it abortion, adoption or keeping the \n     baby. And it helps guarantee that if a teen-ager chooses an \n     abortion, she will receive appropriate medical care.\n       In cases where teen-agers can't tell their parents--because \n     of abuse, for instance--parental notification laws allow \n     teen-agers to petition a judge for a waiver.\n       Society has always decided at what age teen-agers should \n     have certain rights--be it the right to drive a car or the \n     right to vote. In the same way, society should determine at \n     what age a minor has the right to an abortion without \n     notifying their parents.\n       In almost all cases, the only reason that a teen-age girl \n     doesn't want to tell her parents about her pregnancy is that \n     she feels ashamed and doesn't want to let her parents down.\n       But parents are usually the ones who can best help that \n     teen-ager consider her options. And whatever the girl's \n     decision, parents can provide the necessary emotional support \n     and financial assistance. Even in a conservative state like \n     Alabama, I found that parents were almost always supportive.\n       If a teen-ager seeks an abortion out of state, however, \n     things become infinitely more complicated. Instead of telling \n     her parents, she may delay her abortion and try to scrape \n     together enough money--usually $150 to $300--herself. As a \n     result, she often waits too long and then has to turn to her \n     parents for help to pay for a more expensive and riskier \n     second-trimester abortion.\n       Also, patients who receive abortions at out-of-state \n     clinics frequently do not return for follow-up care, which \n     can lead to dangerous complications. And a teen-ager who has \n     an abortion across state lines without her parents' knowledge \n     is even more unlikely to tell them that she is having \n     complications.\n       Ultimately, the pro-choice movement hurts itself by \n     opposing these kinds of laws. I have had many parents sit in \n     my office with their teen-age daughter and say, ``We never \n     thought this would happen to us'' or, ``We were against \n     abortion, but now it is different.''\n       The hard truth is that people often become pro-choice only \n     when they experience an unwanted pregnancy or when their \n     daughter does. Too often, pro-choice advocates oppose laws \n     that make common sense simply because the opposition supports \n     or promotes them. The only way we can and should keep \n     abortions legal is to keep them safe. To fight laws that \n     would achieve this end does no one any good--not the pregnant \n     teen-agers, the parents or the pro-choice movement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8263-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8263-S8264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              Y2K PROBLEM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, President Clinton yesterday \ncalled for urgent action regarding the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem in a \nspeech at the National Academy of Sciences. The President stated ``This \nis clearly one of the most complex management challenges in history.'' \nHe cited progress in American business and the Federal Government in \npreparing for the Y2K problem, while simultaneously noting ``far too \nmany businesses, especially small-and medium-sized firms, will not be \nready unless they begin to act.''\n  I am pleased to see that President Clinton is speaking openly about \nthe seriousness of the Y2K computer problem. Over two years ago I \nstated ``that the Year 2000 problem is indeed serious, and that fixing \nit will be costly and time-consuming. The problem deserves the careful \nand coordinated attention of the Federal Government, as well as the \nprivate sector, in order to avert major disruptions on January 1, \n2000.'' On July 31, 1996 I sent President Clinton a letter expressing \nmy views and concerns about Y2K. I warned him of the ``extreme negative \neconomic consequences of the Y2K Time Bomb,'' and suggested that ``a \npresidential aide be appointed to take responsibility for assuring that \nall Federal Agencies, including the military, be Y2K compliant by \nJanuary 1, 1999 [leaving a year for `testing'] and that all commercial \nand industrial firms doing business with the federal government must \nalso be compliant by that date.''\n  I trust the President's acknowledgment of the Y2K issue as a grave \nand pervasive problem will prompt the agencies and private sector to \nact quickly. Yet having spent two years studying the problem and \nwarning of the lagging progress of federal agencies in addressing it, I \nmust state that combating the millennium bug at this late date ``looks \nto be the 13th labor of Hercules.'' I can only hope that both American \nbusinesses and the Federal Government follow the President's\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\nwarnings and begin to give this problem the attention it \ndeserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8263-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GERARD AND MYRIAM UBAGHS\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nefforts of Gerard and Myriam Ubaghs of Margraten, Netherlands, who have \ncared for the graves of American servicemen killed in the line of duty \nduring World War II. In September of 1944, the United States Army \nreached the German frontier and entered the Netherlands near the city \nof Maastricht. By September 13, 1944, the troops of the U.S. 30th \nInfantry Division liberated part of eastern Holland, freeing the area \nfrom the grip of Nazi Germany. During the battle, 8,302 soldiers lost \ntheir lives including American servicemen from every state in the \nUnion.\n  I, as well as all American citizens, am truly thankful for the \nbravery, valor, and patriotism shown by our soldiers who fought and \ndied for their country on that day and every day of World War II. These \nservicemen not only gave their lives for their country, but also died \nfor the people of the Netherlands. For this, the citizens of the \nNetherlands have been and remain truly grateful to the fallen soldiers \nof the U.S. Army.\n  One manifestation of their appreciation is their care for the \nNetherlands American Cemetery in the town of Margraten, in the Limburg \nProvince of the Netherlands. This cemetery is the only one of its kind \nin the Netherlands. It was established in November of 1944 and free use \nof the land as a permanent burial ground was granted, without charge or \ntaxation by the government of the Netherlands. The cemetery occupies \n65.5 acres and includes a 101 foot-tall tower, a Court of Honor, a \nchapel and a reflecting pool. Among the 8,302 graves lie the remains of \nAmerican, English, Canadian and Mexican troops.\n  I would like to thank not only the people of the Netherlands for this \ncemetery, but two individuals in particular who have honored our fallen \nservicemen for fifty-three years. They are Gerard and Myriam Ubaghs. As \nchildren, after the liberation of their town by American troops, they \nadopted and cared for two graves until the bodies were identified and \nreturned to the United States. To this day, they continue to honor our \nfallen soldiers and express much gratitude to America.\n  I would like to officially acknowledge the Ubaghs and the people of \nMargraten, and thank them for their gracious deeds and for honoring our \nfallen soldiers. Their service is a reminder to all of us how the \nefforts of such brave soldiers on a day more than fifty years ago \neffects people around the world even today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8264-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8264-S8265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDALS TO THE ``LITTLE ROCK NINE''\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, in just a moment, staff will have a bill \nthat I introduced several months ago. I would like to just discuss it \nbriefly so we can get that behind us before I offer it.\n  But this is an amendment that would award the Congressional Gold \nMedal to the nine African American children who integrated Little Rock \nCentral High during probably the greatest threat to the Constitution \nsince the Civil War. I lived through it. I was in a small town in \nwestern Arkansas called Charleston. That is my hometown, where I was \nborn and reared.\n  My hometown had integrated in 1954, very quietly and very peacefully, \na town of 1,200 people at the time. Our schools had successfully \nintegrated from the fall of 1954 until Governor Faubus called out the \nGuard to block integration at Little Rock Central High School in Little \nRock.\n  Let me also say that Charleston, this little hometown of mine which I \nam seeking to get designated a national commemorative site by the Park \nService this year, was the first school to integrate following the \nBrown v. Board of Education decision in May of 1954. I was on the \nschool board during that time, and we integrated the school that fall. \nThere is still some controversy because good records were not kept \nabout how many African American children were integrated into the \nschool system.\n  It went along smoothly. There were some schools that wouldn't play us \nin football, and there were some schools that wouldn't allow our band \nto participate, because we had African Americans on the football team \nand in the band. We lived with that as best we could. There was a lot \nof seething undercurrent. Even though it had gone peacefully for 3 \nyears, there was still an unrest among some.\n  After the turmoil in Little Rock, that seething unrest surfaced. I \nwill never forget, Mr. President, I was trying a lawsuit on the third \nfloor of Logan County Courthouse in Paris, AR, and I heard these \nrumbling trucks going down Highway 22 from Fort Chaffee which came \nthrough my hometown to Little Rock to provide the logistical support \nfor the 101st Airborne which President Eisenhower had sent in to Little \nRock to enforce the integration of that school.\n  It was a very ominous, frankly, rather terrifying time. I was not as \nconcerned about what was going on in Little Rock--though that was \nterrifying and certainly to the people in Little Rock it was \nterrifying--as I was with the certain knowledge in my own mind that we \nwere in for big trouble in my hometown, too, because I knew, as I say, \nthat seething unrest was going to be fortified and encouraged to try to \ndo the same thing, and sure enough it happened.\n  We had a big knock-down-drag-out election in March of 1958, and the \nwhole issue was: Shall we stay integrated or shall we re-segregate?\n  I convinced a friend of mine to run to fill one of the vacancies that \nhad been created because things got so hot a couple of board members \nresigned. I think there were about 600 votes cast in that election, \nprobably five times more than ever had been cast in a school election \nin Charleston, AR, in its history. In any event, the so-called \n``moderates'' won overwhelmingly, and that put the issue to rest in my \nhometown.\n  Back to the Little Rock Nine. Ernie Green testified in the Energy \nCommittee the other day in support of a bill to make Central High \nSchool in Little Rock a unit of the Park Service. He was one of the \nLittle Rock Nine, later was Assistant Secretary of Labor when Jimmy \nCarter was President.\n  Anybody who didn't live through that time can never understand what a \ntraumatic period that was for my State. We didn't attract a single \nindustry in the State of Arkansas for almost 10 years after the Little \nRock High School integration crisis. But those nine young black \nchildren who were escorted into that school in the fall of 1957 by \nparatroopers from the 101st Airborne showed more bravery than anybody I \nhave ever seen in my life. It was absolutely unbelievable.\n  They have been recognized in a lot of ways, but S. 1283 would provide \nthem with the Congressional Gold Medal. It is an honor that they are \ndue and that is long overdue. This bill was recently reported out of \nthe Banking Committee and is now on the Calendar. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 465, S. 1283.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Justice Department is out of control. \nEvidence is mounting that officials at the Department's Antitrust \nDivision has been traveling around the world urging foreign governments \nto join them in their witch hunt against Microsoft.\n  The Administration is offering a helping hand to U.S. competitors \noverseas. While foreign governments work hard to protect their most \nimportant industries, our Justice Department is assisting those foreign \ngovernments in their efforts to keep one of America's most vibrant, \ninnovative, and successful companies out of their markets.\n  In a letter sent yesterday to Attorney General Janet Reno, my \ncolleagues Senators  Sessions, Abraham, and Kyl raised provocative \nquestions about the activities of Justice Department officials \noverseas. They have learned that Joel Klein and his staff at the \nDepartment's Antitrust Division are busily recruiting their foreign \ncounterparts to join in their war against Microsoft.\n  First and foremost, Mr. President, I would like to know what Justice \nDepartment officials, whose work focuses exclusively on issues here at \nhome, are doing traveling overseas at taxpayer's expense. According to \nthe letter, in the last 6 months, Joel Klein has traveled to Japan, \nRussell Pittman, chief of the Competition Policy Section of the \nAntitrust Division has visited Brazil, Dan Rubinfeld, chief economist \nfor the Antitrust Division has gone to Israel, and Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General Douglas Melamed spent a week in Paris in June.\n  At a time when Joel Klein has been complaining that his division does \nnot have enough money or people to do its job effectively, he and his \nstaff are traveling around the world on the Justice Department's dime. \nAnd they are using those foreign visits as a bully pulpit to tout the \nmerits of their case against Microsoft and to encourage foreign \ngovernments to join in the attack.\n  This activity is reprehensible. It is even more egregious when one \nnotes that it is being financed by the American people--many of whom \nmay wind up losing their jobs and their livelihoods if Joel Klein is \nsuccessful.\n  We need some answers, Mr. President. Does the Attorney General \nconsider such activities on the part of the Antitrust Division \nlegitimate? Is Joel Klein working on behalf of U.S. taxpayers or \nagainst them? How much is the antitrust division spending to send its \nemployees around the world? Which foreign competitors have benefited?\n  Here is the evidence my colleagues have compiled to date:\n  Joel Klein visited Japan to meet with the Japanese Fair Trade \nCommission last December. A month later, the Trade Commission raided \nMicrosoft's Tokyo offices, confiscating thousands of company documents.\n  When Russell Pittman went to Brazil in May, he spoke publicly to \nsenior Brazilian government officials responsible for antitrust \nenforcement in that country, outlining the Justice Department's case \nagainst Microsoft in detail. Nine days later, the Brazilian government \nannounced its intention to begin legal proceedings against the company.\n  A quote from Mr. Pittman at this event is particularly troubling, \nand, I might add, somewhat ironic. He accused Microsoft of behaving \n``like an arrogant monopolist, even acting arrogantly in its relations \nwith the antitrust authorities. It will receive from these agencies \nwhat it deserves.'' Who is calling whom arrogant? A Government \nbureaucrat on a taxpayer-funded jaunt to Brazil? If the situation were \nnot so serious, I would find this quote to be quite ironic, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  In Israel in May, Dan Rubinfeld gave a public speech on the \ndepartment's case against Microsoft to an audience that included \nIsraeli public officials responsible for antitrust enforcement. He \nlater met privately, along with his sidekicks from the Federal Trade \nCommission, with a group of Israeli Government officials to outline the \nDepartment of Justice's complaint against Microsoft.\n  Not surprisingly, the Israeli Government is now in discussions with \nMicrosoft concerning its business practices in that country.\n  And finally, on June 8, Douglas Melamed briefed the OECD's \nCompetition Law and Policy Committee in Paris on the strengths of the \ndepartment's case against Microsoft. The OECD Committee includes \nofficials from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Brazil.\n  I applaud Senators Sessions, Abraham, and Kyl for bringing this issue \nto light, Mr. President. It is just one in a series of steps by the \nadministration to tie the hands of successful U.S. companies.\n  The American people deserve to know how and why the administration is \nusing their money and why thousands of jobs in my home State of \nWashington and across the United States are being put on the line by a \ncontemptuous group of bureaucrats over at the Justice Department.\n  I demand that Attorney General Reno do right and answer the questions \nraised by my colleagues promptly and completely.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about health care, \nmanaged care, and the several proposals in Congress that attempt to \naddress these issues.\n  Mr. President, just this morning, the assistant Republican leader, \nSenator Nickles, and his Republican working group, unveiled an outline \nof a bill they are developing, a bill that they intend to shortly \nintroduce.\n  This is clearly an issue that affects all Americans. Back home in \nOhio, I hear constantly from my constituents about the issues involving \nmanaged care and the new world of health care that we all live in.\n  Mr. President, I recognize and share the concerns that many Americans \nhave with the cost and the quality of health care and of managed care. \nAs the father of eight children, I visited emergency rooms and I \nvisited pediatricians' offices. I hear and I understand parents' \nconcerns about all the new hurdles in health care. I understand the \nproblems of parents struggling to try to get a doctor's appointment for \ntheir children, the difficulty in trying to get managed care plans to \nauthorize care, and the concern that their children will not get needed \ncare if that care is not authorized.\n  Mr. President, these are problems shared by millions of American \nfamilies. They are problems Congress must deal with. But as we look at \nthis issue, and all the problems and concerns that go with them, we \nneed to be careful. We need to be careful that we do not create \nsolutions that are really worse than the problems.\n  For example, as we look at regulating managed care, we have to be \ncareful about the impact of proposed regulations on the availability of \nthat care. Certainly I do not believe any of us wants to see fewer \npeople being able to get health insurance as a result of our good \nintentions. That is why we need to be sure that whatever Congress does, \nwe do not cause health care costs to significantly increase. We know \nthat the only result of higher costs will be a health care system that \nmany companies and individuals will simply not be able to afford, \nmeaning more Americans will be denied quality health insurance.\n  So where do things stand right now? Obviously, several health care \nproposals already have been introduced and talked about, such as the \nPatient Access to Responsible Care Act, or PARCA, and also the \nDemocrat's Patients' Bill of Rights. Other options are being developed. \nI already mentioned the legislation being developed by my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, and a Republican working group. The \nHouse of Representatives is considering their own proposals as well.\n  The bottom line is this: It is clear that Congress needs to consider \nmanaged care reform legislation. I am eager to work with my colleagues \nto make sure some crucial issues, particularly the issues that face \nAmerica's children, are in fact addressed.\n  Mr. President, while I would like to see specific language--after \nall, as we always say, the devil is always in the details--I believe \nthat the legislation unveiled today by the Senator from Oklahoma, \nSenator Nickles, and the rest of the working group, represents a \npositive--a positive--start on the road to reform.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill includes a guarantee that \nchildren will have direct access to pediatricians. I have said it many, \nmany times on this floor, but let me say it again this evening--\nchildren are not just little adults. Their health care needs are \nunique. When a child goes to a doctor's office, that child needs to see \nsomeone who has been specifically trained to deal with the unique \nissues of pediatric care; that child needs to see a pediatrician.\n  I am very pleased that my discussions with Republican task force \nmembers on pediatric issues has helped produce a provision in the \nworking group bill that would guarantee our children will be, in fact, \ntreated by pediatricians.\n  Mr. President, there are several additional ways that we can further \nimprove the quality of children's health care as a part of this overall \nmanaged care reform effort. I would like to talk about these additional \nways right now.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, I believe there are three key issues \nthat would go a long way to addressing the health care needs of our \nchildren: No. 1, additional pediatric protections beyond what is \nalready now in the bill. In addition to guaranteeing access to \npediatricians, other basic protections for children should be addressed \nto help make sure that health plans are addressing specific pediatric \nneeds.\n  The most important of these is making sure that when a child faces a \nserious health problem that calls for specialty care, that that child \nhas access to a health care provider with pediatric training or \nexperience. This could mean that a child with a heart murmur would be \nguaranteed access to a pediatric cardiologist. It could also mean that \na baby in need of intensive hospital care and monitoring has access to \na children's hospital, a children's hospital to make sure that \npediatrics-specific equipment and care is available for that baby.\n  Mr. President, my wife Fran and I have personal experiences with our \nchildren and with children's hospitals. When your child--my child--has \na serious medical problem, you want the best care, you want the best \nspecialists. Many times, quite bluntly, that means going to a \nchildren's hospital.\n  Specialists trained to treat adults often do not have the expertise \nthat children need. That is not their specialty. I would hope that our \nefforts of managed care reform include making sure children have access \nto the necessary pediatric expertise, whether that be from the initial \ntreating physician being a pediatrician, or whether it means ultimately \ngoing to a children's hospital.\n  Mr. President, it is important that these basic protections are in \nplace for children, because pediatric care is probably the part of \nmanaged care that we really know the least about. The truth is, we just \ndon't know how well managed care takes care of our kids. The measures \nof quality and studies we have that evaluate managed care simply have \nnot looked at children. In the absence of this evidence, I think that \nsome basic protections for children are required, and they certainly \nmake sense.\n  I also don't believe the cost of these pediatric protections will \namount to a great deal. As we all know, children comprise about 30 \npercent of our population, but a much smaller part of the cost of \nhealth care, a much smaller. I don't believe that making sure children \ncan see pediatricians and pediatric specialists will have an increase \non health care costs. In fact, it should have the opposite effect. It \ncould and should reduce costs. This kind of access could cut down on \nunnecessary trips to doctors, emergency rooms, and work as a good \navenue for preventive medicine. Preventive medicine is important for \nall of us, but nowhere is it as important as it is in dealing with our \nchildren. Let me say that again. As the father of eight, I think anyone \nwho has had children knows that and understands that preventive care is \nthe key.\n  Let me move to the second point and the second suggestion, that is \npediatric quality-related research. One important trend we have seen \nlately in our health care system is the effort to measure quality and \nimprove the science of health care quality. The ability to measure this \nis vitally significant. But as with many parts of our health care \nsystem, not enough attention has focused on children. It is reported \nthat only about 5 percent of this research is aimed at our kids. What \nis the result? We just haven't had the same type of advances and \nquality improvements for our children that we have seen for adults.\n  I have introduced a bill that tries to fix this by focusing attention \non pediatric quality-related research. Among other things, our bill \nincludes dedicated funding to make up for the lack of health care \noutcomes and quality-related information for children. The legislation \nbeing developed by the Republican working group already includes a\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nsignificant focus on health care quality research. My friend from \nTennessee, Senator Bill Frist, has worked very hard on this part of the \nbill and he has done an excellent job. I believe we should build on \nthat effort to focus specifically on children. I believe that would be \nan excellent and an important addition to managed care reform.\n  Let me turn to the third item. The third area where I believe we can \nimprove this bill, the third item with which I think this Congress must \ndeal, the other improvement I would like to see considered, is language \nto strengthen the services provided by our Nation's poison control \ncenters. Other than preventive care, much of the health care our \nchildren receive is based on emergencies, occurs when emergencies \nhappen. One of the more common emergencies in children, of course, is \npoison. Each year more than 2 million poisonings are reported--2 \nmillion--over half of which occur in children younger than 6 years of \nage.\n  While our Nation's poison control centers do a very good job, a very \ngood job responding to these crises, they do face funding problems. \nMany of these centers have been financed through unstable arrangements \nfrom a variety of public and private sources. Funding difficulties are \nthe primary reason that about half of our poison control centers are \nnot certified, meaning that they may not be operating at all times or \nthat fully qualified experts may not be available around the clock.\n  I have written legislation that would deal with this problem by \nproviding Federal supplemental assistance to poison control centers. In \naddition, the bill that I have sponsored, and is cosponsored by Senator \nAbraham, would create a single, simple, toll-free number so parents \nwill always know who to call in the event of a poisoning emergency, so \nthat they always know what number they can call. These measures not \nonly would improve the quality of health care services available for \nchildren's health, they would be lifesavers as well.\n  We have before the Senate a very important debate dealing with the \nquality and availability of health care. As always, when we talk about \nhealth care, we need to be sure we are meeting the needs of children as \nwell as adults. So, as we begin the debate and consider the \nlegislation, we have a great opportunity, a great opportunity to take \naction that improves the lives of our young people. This Congress \nalready has enacted a number of important pieces of legislation that \nwill save lives, that will save young lives.\n  Last year, for example, we passed important bipartisan legislation to \nimprove the quality and the availability of health care for low-income \nchildren. We also passed bipartisan legislation to reform our foster \ncare system, vitally important legislation to reform our foster care \nsystem that will save lives and is saving lives.\n  This Congress clearly has taken the opportunity to improve the lives \nof our children. I am hopeful we will take advantage of this \nopportunity that we face this week and next week, the opportunity that \nis before us, to find the solution that best provides for health care \nquality for our children and for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/15/senate-section/article/S8266-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8267-S8268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOMEOWNERS PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I am glad that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 318, the Homeowners Protection Act. I thank my \ncolleagues on the Banking Committee for working so hard to come to a \nfinal agreement on this legislation. I am pleased with the result, and \nI believe that our final product is a good balance which will both \nbenefit consumers and protect the industry. The Senate passed S. 318 \nlast November and this version, which has been passed by the House, \ncontains all of the key provisions of the bill as it first passed the \nSenate.\n  Private Mortgage Insurance or PMI is a property insurance line that \nprotects lenders from mortgage default risk. Homeowners pay the \npremiums, but the lender is the beneficary. PMI is generally used to \nfacilitate loans in which the borrower makes a down payment of less \nthan 20 percent, and the lender usually seeks coverage of the initial \n20 percent of the loan value.\n  However, a number of homeowners currently continue to pay premiums \nwell pass the point of reaching 20 percent equity in their home, and \nsometimes for the entire life of the loan. This excessive PMI coverage \nis not only expensive for the consumer, but provides little added \nprotection to the lender. In many cases, homeowners are never informed \nof their right to cancel PMI, or are faced with significant obstacles \nwhen they do attempt to cancel the coverage. This legislation will end \nthat predatory practice. It gives homeowners the right to cancel PMI \nwhen they have accummulated sufficient equity in their home to protect \nthe lender from default. It will also provide for automatic \ncancellation of the mortgage insurance when the mortgagor's\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\npayments meet the defined loan to value ratio of 78 percent or less. \nFinally, the bill generally prohibits lenders from requiring that \nconsumers obtain PMI when they have a 20 percent or more down payment, \nwith certain exceptions.\n  S. 318 also ensures that lenders can continue to offer a product \ncalled lender paid mortgage insurance or LPMI, where the mortgage \ninsurance is paid by the lender. LPMI folds the insurance payment into \na slightly higher interest rate. The product provides an economic \nbenefit for consumers for the early part of the loan, and becomes less \nbeneficial over time if the loan is not refinanced for the life of the \nloan. When the legislation was considered in the Banking Committee I \nauthored an amendment, along with my colleague, Senator Grams, which \npreserves LPMI. Our amendment, which is a part of this legislation, \nprovides for strong disclosures that ensure the consumer is aware of \nthe way that LPMI works, and can assess the benefits and drawbacks of \nthis product. I would like to thank my colleagues for accepting my \namendment, which ensures that this product will continue to provide \nbenefit to consumers.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support for \nS. 318, the Homeowners' Protection Act, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its quick enactment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3171\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask unanimous consent the Senate concur in the \namendments of the House with an amendment, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
