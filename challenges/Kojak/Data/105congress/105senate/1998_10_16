Mr. President, I am pleased to report to my colleagues \nthat yesterday afternoon a tentative agreement on home health care was \nreached by negotiators from the House and the Senate. This agreement \nwill throw a much needed lifeline to our Nation's senior citizens who \nrely on home health care to provide much needed health services within \nthe surroundings of their homes.\n  Home health care is the cornerstone of the health care safety net for \nsenior citizens. It spares them the dislocation of moving to a hospital \nor nursing home, and it spares the taxpayers from paying for such \ncostly services when they are not really needed.\n  The administration has implemented reductions in home health care \nservices that treat every agency exactly the same, regardless of \nwhether the agency is efficient or wasteful. The result is that the \nmost efficient agencies are being hit with cuts they cannot absorb. \nVulnerable senior citizens in my State are on the brink--on the brink--\nof losing their vital services.\n  Under the proposal, payments to the older, low-cost home health \nagencies will be increased and an additional 15 percent across-the-\nboard cut scheduled for next fall will be delayed for 6 months. That is \nthe time when they say the proposed payments which will get us out of \nthis mess will be available. Adoption of this bill will give home \nhealth agencies needed financial relief until a new prospective payment \nsystem is in place.\n  All we need now is for the administration to also agree to help our \nsenior citizens who rely on home health care, as was wrapped into the \nomnibus bill yesterday. I call upon the President in the strongest way \nI possibly can to join us in saving hundreds and thousands of home \nhealth care services from being forced to cut back on critical \nservices.\n  Today is a day of political spinning. The media will examine who won \nand who lost, what provisions are in and what provisions are out. We \nmust take that time to make things right for senior citizens who need \nour help.\n  Over the last 8 months, I have been working as hard as I know how to \nfind a solution for the crisis faced by our home health care agencies \nin Vermont. Our 13 home health agencies are model agencies that provide \nhigh-quality, comprehensive home health care with a low price tag. \nHowever, under Medicare's new interim payment system, the payments to \nthe agency are so low that Vermont seniors may be denied access to \nneeded home health services. They are the lowest cost in the whole \nUnited States.\n  For the past 7 years, the average Medicare expenditures for home \nhealth care in Vermont have been the lowest in the Nation. However, \nrather than being rewarded for this cost-effective system, Vermont has \nbeen penalized by the implementation of the current interim payment \nsystem. In June 1998, Vermont's home health agencies projected the \nstatewide impact of their current interim payment system was a loss of \nover $4.5 million in Medicare revenues for the first year. These are \nnonprofit agencies in our little State. This represents a loss of over \n11 percent on an annual base of $40 million statewide.\n  Vermont is a good example of how the health care system can work to \nprovide for high-quality care for Medicare beneficiaries. Home health \nagencies are a critical link in the kind of health system that extends \ncare over a continuum of options and settings. New technology and \nadvances in medical practice permit hospitals to discharge patients \nearlier. They give persons suffering with acute or chronic illness the \nopportunity to receive care and live their lives in familiar \nsurroundings. Time and time again, Vermont's home health agencies have \nproven their value by providing quality, cost-effective services to \nthese patients. Yet, time and time again, Federal policy seems to \nensure that their good deeds will go punished.\n  The home health legislation is the product of a great deal of hard \nwork by the majority leader, Senators Roth and Gramm, and Congressmen \nThomas and Bilirakis. I worked with them yesterday before we reached \nour conclusion. The signing of this bill will mark a victory for our \nState and also reflect a strong nationwide commitment to high-quality, \ncost-effective home health agencies such as those in Vermont.\n  I anguish as I wait today to know what will happen at the White \nHouse. I ask the President, call upon him, to make sure that they do \nnot destroy this wonderful work that was accomplished yesterday to save \nour home health care system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12660-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Housing \n     Assistance and Self-Determination Amendments of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States has undertaken a responsibility to \n     promote the general welfare of the United States by--\n       (A) employing its resources to remedy the unsafe and \n     unsanitary housing conditions and the acute shortage of \n     decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for families of lower \n     income; and\n       (B) developing effective partnerships with governmental and \n     private entities to accomplish the objectives referred to in \n     subparagraph (A);\n       (2) pursuant to the provisions of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et seq.), the United \n     States set aside 200,000 acres of land in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii in order to \n     establish a homeland for the native people of Hawaii--Native \n     Hawaiians;\n       (3) despite the intent of Congress in 1920 to address the \n     housing needs of Native Hawaiians through the enactment of \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108 et \n     seq.), some agencies of the Federal Government have taken the \n     legal position that subsequently enacted Federal housing laws \n     designed to address the housing needs of all eligible \n     families in the United States could not be extended to \n     address the needs for housing and infrastructure development \n     on Hawaiian home lands (as that term is defined in section \n     801 of the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\n     Determination Act of 1996, as added by section 3 of this Act) \n     with the result that otherwise eligible Native Hawaiians \n     residing on the Hawaiian home lands have been foreclosed from \n     participating in Federal housing assistance programs \n     available to all other eligible families in the United \n     States;\n       (4) although Federal housing assistance programs have been \n     administered on a racially neutral basis in the State of \n     Hawaii, Native Hawaiians continue to have the greatest unmet \n     need for housing and the highest rates of overcrowding in the \n     United States;\n       (5) among the Native American population of the United \n     States, Native Hawaiians experience the highest percentage of \n     housing problems in the United States, as the percentage--\n       (A) of housing problems in the Native Hawaiian population \n     is 49 percent, as compared to--\n       (i) 44 percent for American Indian and Alaska Native \n     households in Indian country; and\n       (ii) 27 percent for all other households in the United \n     States; and\n       (B) overcrowding in the Native Hawaiian population is 36 \n     percent as compared to 3 percent for all other households in \n     the United States;\n       (6) among the Native Hawaiian population, the needs of \n     Native Hawaiians, as that term is defined in section 801 of \n     the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination \n     Act of 1996, as added by section 3 of this Act, eligible to \n     reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands are the most severe, as--\n       (A) the percentage of overcrowding in Native Hawaiian \n     households on the Hawaiian Home Lands is 36 percent; and\n       (B) approximately 13,000 Native Hawaiians, which constitute \n     95 percent of the Native Hawaiians who are eligible to reside \n     on the Hawaiian Home Lands, are in need of housing;\n       (7) applying the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development guidelines--\n       (A) 70.8 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or \n     who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     incomes that fall below the median family income; and\n       (B) 50 percent of Native Hawaiians who either reside or who \n     are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     incomes below 30 percent of the median family income; and\n       (8) \\1/3\\ of those Native Hawaiians who are eligible to \n     reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands pay more than 30 percent of \n     their income for shelter, and \\1/2\\ of those Native Hawaiians \n     face overcrowding;\n       (9) the extraordinarily severe housing needs of Native \n     Hawaiians demonstrate that Native Hawaiians who either reside \n     on, or are eligible to reside on, Hawaiian Home Lands have \n     been denied equal access to Federal low-income housing \n     assistance programs available to other qualified residents of \n     the United States, and that a more effective means of \n     addressing their housing needs must be authorized;\n       (10) consistent with the recommendations of the National \n     Commission on American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Housing, and in order to address the continuing \n     prevalence of extraordinarily severe housing needs among \n     Native Hawaiians who either reside or are eligible to reside \n     on the Hawaiian Home Lands, Congress finds it necessary to \n     extend the Federal low-income housing assistance available to \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives under the Native American \n     Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (25 \n     U.S.C. 4101 et seq.) to those Native Hawaiians;\n       (11) under the treaty-making power of the United States, \n     Congress had the authority to confirm a treaty between the \n     United States and the government that represented the \n     Hawaiian people, and under clause 3 of section 8 of article I \n     of the Constitution, the authority of Congress to address \n     matters affecting the indigenous peoples of the United States \n     includes the authority to address matters affecting Native \n     Hawaiians;\n       (12) through treaties, Federal statutes, and rulings of the \n     Federal courts, the United States has recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) the political status of Native Hawaiians is comparable \n     to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives;

Mr. President I would like to make a few brief comments \nabout the IDeA program within this bill, a program that I think is \nimperative to our nation's biomedical research capability. I would also \nlike to engage in a brief dialog with the Minority Leader, Senator \nDaschle, on this important issue.\n  The National Institutes of Health Institutional Development Award \nprogram--known as the IDeA program--builds additional research capacity \nand is an important part of our effort to better treat, cure and \nprevent disease by addressing the undue geographic concentration of \nresearch funds. IDeA works to increase our nation's biomedical research \ncapability by broadening our country's research base. IDeA funds \nbiomedical research in states that have not participated substantially \nin NIH research programs.\n  Mr. President, many scientists are concerned about the extreme \ngeographic concentration of NIH research funds. In Fiscal Year 1995, \nfor example, the NIH made $9.3 billion in extramural awards. Mr. \nPresident, the 24 states that participate in the IDeA program received \njust 5.2 percent of those funds. Let me repeat: in FY95, the last year \nfor which we have complete figures, the NIH awarded funds across this \nnation totaling $9.3 billion. But all the researchers in the 24 IDeA \nstates combined received only $487 million of that. On the other hand, \none state alone received nearly three times the total amount of those \n24 states combined. The top 5 states received nearly one-half the NIH \nfunds.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. President, that the concern here is not one of a \nparochial nature. Nobody is saying that the NIH ought to distribute \nfunding evenly by states. But at a time when we are seeing substantial \nincreases in the NIH research budget, we need to increase the capacity \nof every region of the country--not just of a handful of states.\n  IDeA has potential to be an important part of our efforts to build \nour biomedical research capacity, but it has not received the level of \nfunding it needs to truly be effective. The FY99 NIH budget request was \n$14.76 billion. Of that amount--well over $14 billion--the NIH \nrequested just $5.2 million for the IDeA program. The bill before us \nincludes $10 million for IDeA, which is a start--but in my view not \nenough to accomplish the goal for which the program was intended. I \nthank the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Senator\n\n[[Page S12669]]\n\nSpecter, for the support he has given IDeA thus far, but I believe we \ncan and should do more next year.\n  Mr. President, I would ask the Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, if \nhe would like to add anything to what I have said.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for his \ncomments, and I share the Senator's concern about the concentration of \nNIH funds. I, too, ask if next year we can't find more than $10 million \nfor this program--$10 million that will be split among researchers in \n24 states.\n  I would also like to explain briefly why I believe IDeA ought to be \nfunded at a much higher level. Mr. President, IDeA funds only merit-\nbased, peer reviewed research that meets NIH research objectives. Let \nme state that another way: IDeA funds only good science, and it is in \nno way an earmarked program specific to a specific disease or disease-\nrelated issue. Researchers from the 24 IDeA states can submit proposals \nto any one of a number of existing NIH funding mechanisms, and those \nproposals are then peer-reviewed and funding decisions are made based \non merit.\n  Mr. President, I think the statistics the Majority Leader mentioned \nregarding the extreme geographic concentration of NIH research funds \nare eye-opening. I think many members of the Senate would be surprised \nto learn that nearly one-half of NIH extramural funds go to just five \nstates, and that 24 IDeA states combined received just over 5% of NIH \nextramural funding in FY95. In fact, the Majority leader and I were \njoined by 24 of our colleagues in the Senate in sending a letter to the \nSubcommittee Chairman, Senator Specter, supporting $100 million for \nIDeA in FY99.\n  To put that request in perspective, Mr. President, the final FY99 \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education appropriation before us \nincreases NIH funding by $2 billion. In other words, a $100 million \nIDeA program would have designated five percent of one year's increase \nfor this program which funds competitive, peer-reviewed research in 24 \nstates.

I would like to ask the Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works a question regarding S. \n2364, the Economic Development Administration Reform Act, which passed \nthe Senate on Monday. As they are aware, the State of Alaska, while \nrich in resources, also has communities that suffer serious economic \ndistress. EDA assistance can make a difference to many of these \ncommunities. Thus I am pleased to support the efforts of my friends to \nreauthorize this important agency; and indeed, I am a cosponsor of this \nbill.\n  Let me ask specifically about an issue that is very important to \nAlaskans, especially those in Southeast Alaska. Under this bill, EDA \nprograms are available to aid distressed communities with both public \nworks and economic adjustment assistance. In Southeast Alaska, many \ncommunities have faced economic adjustment problems, such as high \nunemployment, as a result of Federal regulatory changes with regard to \ntimber harvests. If these communities meet the definition of \n``distressed'' as outlined in the bill, would a situation such as \ntheirs qualify as eligible for EDA assistance?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes, we expect it would. The situation the Senator \ndescribes is exactly the type of situation that we would expect could \nbe addressed by EDA. In fact, I would direct the senator's attention to \nthe bill's new Section 2(a)(1), which specifically references areas \nthat are affected by Federal actions. The language notes as possible \ndistressed areas those that suffer dislocation as a result of ``certain \nFederal actions (including environmental requirements that result in \nthe removal of economic activities from a locality).''\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree. In fact, many areas of the country, including \nMontana, face similar situations. We included that phrase intentionally \nto ensure that such distress may be addressed by EDA programs. It is \nour view, and it is a view shared by EDA officials, that such \ncommunities should be eligible to apply for EDA aid.\n  Mr. STEVENS. With regard to the criteria used to determine \neligibility, Section 301(a)(3) refers to communities that experience \nspecial needs arising from severe unemployment or economic adjustment \nproblems resulting from changes in economic conditions. Could my \ncolleagues tell me whether EDA has flexibility in applying this \ncriterion to areas--such as these timber-affected Alaskan communities--\nthat are requesting EDA assistance?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Section 301(a) sets the basic eligibility requirements \nfor economically distressed areas. These criteria are intended to \nensure that EDA assistance is targeted to truly distressed communities. \nThe third criterion, which you mention, is intended to allow the \nnecessary flexibility to address other situations of serious distress \nthat, for a number of reasons, may not fulfill the first two criteria \nbut that clearly would be considered by the Secretary and Congress as \ndeserving of assistance. Thus, the bill before us provides the \nSecretary with sufficient flexibility in this regard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Again, I agree. We recognized that flexibility is \nrequired to ensure that EDA may address the varied causes and types of \neconomic distress nationwide. Therefore, in his efforts to ensure that \nEDA assistance go to the communities of greatest distress, the \nSecretary is allowed some flexibility in making determinations for \nawards of assistance under this Act.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank my colleagues for making these important \nclarifications.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12669-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           LINDA MORGAN AND THE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, in the closing days of the 105th Congress, \nit appears that S. 1802, a bill to reauthorize the Surface \nTransportation Board, may not be enacted into law. I hope that the STB \nis not penalized in any way for the failure of Congress to enact S. \n1802. In fact, I want my colleagues to know that Linda Morgan, the \ncurrent chairman of the STB, is well respected within the Senate on \nboth sides of the aisle. She was a valued member of the staff of the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for several \nyears. The work ethic, honesty and balance that she demonstrated as a \nmember of the Committee's professional staff have been evidenced also \nat the STB.\n  Linda Morgan and her staff have handled a significant number of \ncomplex matters in a timely, thorough manner despite very limited \nresources. Just one example of the Board's evenhanded approach is the \nexhaustive review of the acquisition of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk \nSouthern. This transaction will yield significant competitive and \nenvironmental benefits, not only in Kentucky but throughout the Eastern \nUnited States. The Board's evenhanded, professional approach in \nreviewing this major transaction and assessing the public benefits is \nindicative of the excellent work that Chairman Morgan and the Board \nhave done since its creation.\n  As a result, I support S. 1802 and hope that the bill could still \nbecome law before the conclusion of the 105th Congress. Also, I urge \nthe Administration to renominate Ms. Morgan for an additional term as \nChairman of the STB. She is a proven, well-qualified public servant, \nand she has earned the opportunity to complete the work that she has \nstarted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12669-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12669-S12670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important issue \nof hunger in America. We often hear about hunger as a global problem \naffecting many people every day. Many in our own country warn us of a \ngrowing hunger problem in America.\n  One of my Minnesota constituents, Dr. Joseph Ioffe, is a former \nRussian professor of economics and challenges this thinking from his \nfirst hand knowledge of hunger in Russia. He has written an editorial \nthat suggests our real problem is one that involves the quality of diet \nfor low-income families rather than starvation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Ioffe's article be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n                   Is There Really Hunger in America\n\n                           (By Joseph Ioffe)\n\n       Another day, another letter in my mailbox from public \n     organizations fighting hunger in America. And every letter is \n     overloaded with general statements and emotional appeals but \n     lacks facts and specifics.\n       Here is one from Larry Jones, president of Feed The \n     Children, an Oklahoma City-based organization: ``I am writing \n     on behalf of a very special group that faces death every hour \n     of every day of the year. It is the 15 million hungry \n     children in the United States. Every 53 minutes a hungry \n     child dies.'' A horrible picture--it looks like Rwanda or \n     North Korea. Hard to believe that the U.S. government is \n     providing food aid to many other countries while letting \n     millions of its own people starve to death.\n       So I wrote a letter to Jones, asking him for specifics and, \n     in particular, to furnish the names and addresses, at random, \n     of children who died from starvation, say, last year. As it \n     appeared from Jones' response, he personally had never \n     witnessed such cases, never kept any records of the victims \n     of hunger, but relied on statistics from other organizations.\n       After all, he said, his mission was not in studying facts \n     about hunger but raising money for children who, he believed, \n     were starving in the U.S.--which he has been doing for years \n     by hitting mailboxes all around the country.\n       So I decided to go to the source Jones referred to. In a \n     publication by the Children's Defense Fund, a Washington, DC-\n     based public organization, I found the numbers but defined \n     differently: 15 million children living in poverty . . . \n     every 53 minutes a child dies from poverty. . . . It appeared \n     that Jones did not just borrow the statistics from CDF but \n     adjusted it to the purpose of his own understanding.\n       Poverty does not necessarily mean hunger. In the U.S. the \n     poverty lines is set up fairly high. Suffice it to say that a \n     family living at the poverty level in America has a higher \n     in-come than the median income of the same size family in 150 \n     other countries throughout the world including Eastern Europe \n     and the former Soviet Union.\n       But let us put aside the difference between hunger and \n     poverty. The point is that the CDF ``death from poverty'' \n     statistics were unfounded as well. The official mortality \n     statistics are based on the records of hospitals, and do no \n     operate with such cause of death as ``poverty.''\n       So any responsible statement about children dying from \n     poverty is supposed to be supported and substantiated by \n     special studies establishing the link between medical and \n     social causes. Nothing like that could be found in the CDF \n     publications. Small wonder that my requests for information \n     of this kind was just ignored by CDF.\n       And here is another letter, this one from Christine \n     Vladimiroff, president of Second Harvest, a food bank network \n     based in Chicago; ``Tonight millions of Americans won't get \n     enough to eat . . .'' Again, no specifics about numbers, not \n     the slightest attempt to prove that is real. Instead, \n     attached to the letter was a picture of the Statute of \n     Liberty holding the ``Will work for food'' poster, it was \n     ridiculous.\n       Those men and women with such posters on the busy city \n     streets, idlers and drifters, don't care about work and food \n     at all. They are just playing a trick on compassionate \n     motorists. At the red light, the motorists reach out for \n     their pocket-books and hand out a dollar or two to the \n     ``hungry'' guys. None of them has ever accepted any offer to \n     work. But their day's ``work'' with the poster usually brings \n     in $100 or more and the money is being spent, right away, for \n     drugs and alcohol.\n       As for food, they get it at the soup kitchens. In the 30's \n     soup kitchens served real hungry people, victims of the bad \n     economic situation. Nowadays in America they are mostly a \n     feeding place for people of anti-social behavior like idlers, \n     drifters, drug abusers and alcoholics. Now the old saying, \n     ``he who does not work, does not eat.'' is out of date.\n       So is there hunger in America. It is common knowledge that \n     the U.S. is the world leader in food production, that the \n     food prices, in relation to the wages, are the lowest, that \n     the food stamps program combined with free distribution of \n     basic nutritional products from the state reserves for the \n     low-income families provides a safeguard against any threat \n     of hunger in America. Nobody is starving in this country, \n     and, moreover, nobody is dying from starvation.\n       The real problem is not feeding the hungry but improving \n     the quality of the daily diet of the low-income families, \n     extending their diet beyond a certain number of plain \n     products and bringing it, gradually, to the modern \n     nutritional standards. That is where the efforts of the \n     charitable organizations should be directed.\n       Those ambitious activities who are trying to impress the \n     public with sensations and high drama, talking about millions \n     of starving Americans facing death, don't do any good to the \n     country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12670-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12670-S12673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BAILEY ``USE OR CARRY'' FIREARMS BILL, S. 191\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise to hail the passage last night of \nthe Bailey Fix Act, also known as the use or carry bill, after two \nCongresses. This legislation will provide enhanced mandatory minimum \npenalties for those criminals who use guns while trafficking in drugs \nor in the commission of violent crimes. When the Supreme Court handed \ndown its decision in Bailey versus United States in 1995, the Court \ndealt a serious blow to law enforcement. Prior to that decision, drug \ntraffickers who ``used or carried'' firearms during or in relation to \ntheir drug trafficking crimes were subject to mandatory minimums of \nfive years under Section 924(c) of Title 18. With this decision, the \nCourt significantly limited prosecutors' ability to put gun-using, drug \ntrafficking criminals away.\n  In Bailey, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, announced that \nin order to receive the sentence enhancement for using or carrying a \nfirearm during a violent or drug trafficking crime under Title 18 \nU.S.C. 924(c), the criminal must ``actively employ'' a firearm. This \ndecision severely restricted an important tool used by federal \nprosecutors to put gun-using drug criminals behind bars. According to \nthe U.S. Sentencing Commission, there were 9,182 defendants sentenced \nnationwide from 1991 to 1995 under 924(c). The Commission notes that \nthe vast majority, about 75% of these cases are drug trafficking and \nbank robbery cases. Since the Bailey decision, the number of federal \ncases involving a 924(c) enhancement has declined by about 17%.\n  The question before this Congress for almost four years, two Senate \nhearings, and seven bills was how to restore this crime fighting tool. \nAcross the political spectrum there is a consensus about the problem. \nThere is also a consensus, I believe, that the purpose of this ``use or \ncarry'' provision is twofold; to punish criminals who use guns,\n\n[[Page S12671]]\n\nand to be a deterrent to would-be criminals not to use a gun. So, \n924(c) comes with a message: ``If you mix guns and drugs, or guns and \nviolence, we're going to come after you--and the price will be high.''\n  The final bill attempts to address the issue: ``Where do we draw the \nline in constructive possession cases?'' How do we address those \nsituations when the gun is not in the direct possession of the criminal \nwhen either the crime is committed or he is caught for the crime.\n  This legislation, however, is meant to embrace not only instances of \nbrandishing, firing or displaying a firearm during a crime of violence \nor drug trafficking offense, but also to those situations where a \ndefendant kept a firearm available to provide security for the \ntransaction, its fruit or proceeds, or was otherwise emboldened by its \npresence in the commission of the offense. Many of these instances, \nfrankly, are simply an issue of proof. To that extent we must \nacknowledge our limitations in addressing a solution.\n  This bill would change the wording of Section 924(c) to add to \n``uses, carries'' ``in furtherance of the crime, possesses a firearm.'' \nThe original S. 191 did not contain this ``in furtherance language'' \nthat modifies ``possesses.\n\n       [In pertinent part, Section 924(c) would read:\n       ``. . . any person who, during and in relation to any crime \n     of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of \n     violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an \n     enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or \n     dangerous weapon or device) for which a person may be \n     prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a \n     firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses \n     a firearm, shall . . .'']\n\n  The purpose of adding the ``in furtherance'' language is to assure \nthat someone who possesses a gun that has nothing to do with the crime \ndoes not fall under 924(c). I believe that the ``in furtherance'' \nlanguage is a slightly higher standard that encompasses ``during and in \nrelation to'' language, by requiring an indication of helping forward, \npromote, or advance a crime. This provision applies equally to the \nindividual simply exercising his or her right to own a firearm, as well \nas the prosecutor who would bring a 924(c) action where there is, \narguably, an insufficient nexus between the crime and the gun.\n  This bill will:\n  Provide for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for anyone who \nuses, carries or possesses a firearm during a crime of violence or drug \ntrafficking offense;\n  Provide a seven year sentence for ``brandishing'' by making known the \npresence of a firearm during the commission of a crime.\n  Raise the penalty to ten years if the gun is discharged.\n  Mr. President, I have always believed that that this is an eminently \nfixable problem. Our prosecutors need full use of this provision now, \nand it is my hope and my belief that this legislation will accomplish \nthat purpose.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNational Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact of the National Criminal \n  History Access and Child Protection Act Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 211.--This section provides the short title of the \n     Act.\n       Section 212.--This section sets forth the congressional \n     findings upon which the Act is predicated. The section \n     reflects congressional determinations that both the FBI and \n     the states maintain fingerprint-based criminal history \n     records and exchange them for criminal justice purposes and \n     also, to the extent authorized by federal law and the laws of \n     the various states, use the information contained in these \n     records for certain noncriminal justice purposes. Although \n     this system has operated for years on a reciprocal, voluntary \n     basis, the exchange of records for noncriminal justice \n     purposes has been hampered by the fact that the laws and \n     policies of the states governing the noncriminal justice use \n     of criminal history records and the procedures by which they \n     are exchanged vary widely. A compact will establish a uniform \n     standard for the interstate and federal-state exchange of \n     criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes, \n     while permitting each state to continue to enforce its own \n     record dissemination laws within its own borders. A compact \n     will also facilitate the interstate and federal-state \n     exchange of information by clarifying the obligations and \n     responsibilities of the respective parties, streamlining the \n     processing of background search applications and eliminating \n     record maintenance duplication at the federal and state \n     levels. Finally, the compact will provide a mechanism for \n     establishing and enforcing uniform standards governing record \n     accuracy and protecting the confidentiality and privacy \n     interests of record subjects.\n       Section 213.--This section sets out definitions of key \n     terms used in this subtitle. Definitions of key terms used in \n     the compact are set out in Article I of the compact.\n       Section 214.--This section formally enacts the compact into \n     federal law, makes the United States a party, and consents to \n     entry into the Compact by the States.\n       Section 215.--This section outlines the effect of the \n     Compact's enactment on certain other laws. First, subsection \n     (a) provides that the Compact is deemed to have no effect on \n     the FBI's obligations and responsibilities under the Privacy \n     Act. The Privacy Act became effective in 1975, and can \n     generally be characterized as a federal code of fair \n     information practices regarding individuals. The Privacy Act \n     regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination \n     of personal information by the federal government. This \n     Section makes clear that the Compact will neither expand nor \n     diminish the obligations imposed on the FBI by the Privacy \n     Act. All requirements relating to collection, disclosure and \n     administrative matters remain in effect, including standards \n     relating to notice, accuracy and security measures.\n       Second, enactment of the Compact will neither expand nor \n     diminish the responsibility of the FBI and the state criminal \n     history record repositories to permit access, direct or \n     otherwise, to criminal history records under the authority of \n     certain other federal laws (enumerated in subsection (b)(1)). \n     These laws include the following:\n       The Security Clearance Information Act (Section 9101 of \n     Title 5, United States Code) requires state and local \n     criminal justice agencies to release criminal history record \n     information to certain federal agencies for national security \n     background checks.\n       The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act prescribes a \n     waiting period before the purchase of a handgun may be \n     consummated in order for a criminal history records check on \n     the purchaser to be completed, and also establishes a \n     national instant background check system to facilitate \n     criminal history checks of firearms purchasers. Under this \n     system, licensed firearms dealers are authorized access to \n     the national instant background check system for purposes of \n     complying with the background check requirement.\n       The National Child Protection Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. Sec.  \n     5119a) authorizes states with appropriate state statutes to \n     access and review state and federal criminal history records \n     through the national criminal history background check system \n     for the purpose of determining whether care providers for \n     children, the elderly and the disabled have criminal \n     histories bearing upon their fitness to assume such \n     responsibilities.\n       The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     authorizes federal and state civil courts to have access to \n     FBI databases containing criminal history records, missing \n     person records and court protection orders for use in \n     connection with stalking and domestic violence cases.\n       The United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended by the \n     Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996, authorizes \n     public housing authorities to obtain federal and state \n     criminal conviction records relating to public hosing \n     applicants or tenants for purposes of applicant screening, \n     lease enforcement and eviction.\n       The Native American Housing Assistance and Self-\n     Determination Act authorizes Indian tribes or tribally \n     designated housing entities to obtain federal and state \n     conviction records relating to applicants for or tenants of \n     federally assisted housing for purposes of applicant \n     screening, lease enforcement and eviction. Nothing in the \n     Compact would alter any rights of access provided under these \n     laws.\n       Subsection (b)(2) provides that the compact shall not \n     affect any direct access to federal criminal history records \n     authorized by law. Under existing legal authority, the FBI \n     has provided direct terminal access to certain federal \n     agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget and \n     the Immigration and Naturalization Service, to facilitate the \n     processing of large numbers of background search requests by \n     these agencies for such purposes as federal employment, \n     immigration and naturalization matters, and the issuance of \n     security clearances. This access will not be affected by the \n     compact.\n       Subsection (c) provides that the Compact's enactment will \n     not affect the FBI's authority to use its criminal history \n     records for noncriminal justice purposes under Public Law 92-\n     544--the State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations Act of 1973. \n     This law restored the Bureau's authority to exchange its \n     identification records with the states and certain other \n     organizations or entities, such as federally chartered or \n     insured banking institutions, for employment and licensing \n     purposes, after a federal district court had declared the \n     FBI's practice of doing so to be without foundation. (See \n     Menard v. Mitchell, 328 F. Supp. 718 (D.D.C. 1971).\n       Subsection (d) provides that the Council created by the \n     Compact to facilitate its administration is deemed not to be \n     a federal advisory committee as defined under the Federal \n     Advisory Committee Act. This provision is necessary since \n     nonfederal employees will sit on the Compact Council together\n\n[[Page S12672]]\n\n     with federal personnel and the Council may from time to time \n     be called upon to provide the Director of the FBI or the \n     Attorney General with collective advice on the administration \n     of the Compact. Without this stipulation, such features might \n     cause the Council to be considered an advisory committee \n     within the meaning of the Federal Advisory Committee Act. \n     Even though the Council will not be considered an advisory \n     committee for purposes of the Act, it will hold public \n     meetings.\n       Similarly, to avoid any question on the subject, Subsection \n     (e) provides that members of the Compact Council will not be \n     deemed to be federal employees or officers by virtue of their \n     Council membership for any purpose other than to effect the \n     Compact. Thus, state officials and other nonfederal personnel \n     who are appointed to the Council will be considered federal \n     officials only to the extent of their roles as Council \n     members. They will not be entitled to compensation or \n     benefits accruing to federal employees or officers, but they \n     could receive reimbursement from federal funds for travel and \n     subsistence expenses incurred in attending council meetings.\n       Section 216.--This Section admonishes all federal personnel \n     to enforce the Compact and to cooperate in its \n     implementation. It also directs the U.S. Attorney General to \n     take such action as may be necessary to implement the Compact \n     within the federal government, including the promulgation of \n     regulations.\n       Section 217.--This is the core of the subtitle and sets \n     forth the text of the Compact:\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       This briefly describes what the Compact is and how it is \n     meant to work. Under the Compact, the FBI and the states \n     agree to maintain their respective databases of criminal \n     history records and to make them available to Compact parties \n     for authorized purposes by means of an electronic information \n     sharing system established cooperatively by the federal \n     government and the states.\n\n\n                         Article I--Definitions\n\n       This article sets out definitions for key terms used in the \n     Compact. Most of the definitions are substantially identical \n     to definitions commonly used in federal and state laws and \n     regulations relating to criminal history records and need no \n     explanation. However, the following definitions merit \n     comment:\n     (20) Positive identification\n       This term refers, in brief, to association of a person with \n     his or her criminal history record through a comparison of \n     fingerprints or other equally reliable biometric \n     identification techniques. Such techniques eliminate or \n     substantially reduce the risks of associating a person with \n     someone else's record or failing to find a record of a person \n     who uses a false name. At present, the method of establishing \n     positive identification in use in criminal justice agencies \n     throughout the United States is based upon comparison of \n     fingerprint patterns, which are essentially unique and \n     unchanging and thus provide a highly reliable basis for \n     identification. It is anticipated that this method of \n     positive identification will remain in use for many years to \n     come, particularly since federal and state agencies are \n     investing substantial amounts of money to acquire automated \n     fingerprint identification equipment and related devices \n     which facilitate the capturing and transmission of \n     fingerprint images and provide searching and matching methods \n     that are efficient and highly accurate. However, there are \n     other biometric identification techniques, including retinal \n     scanning, voice-print analysis and DNA typing, which might be \n     adapted for criminal record identification purposes. The \n     wording of the definition contemplates that at some future \n     time the Compact Council might authorize the use of one or \n     more of these techniques for establishing positive \n     identification, if it determines that the reliability of such \n     technique(s) is at least equal to the reliability of \n     fingerprint comparison.\n     (21) Sealed record information\n       Article IV, paragraph (b), permits the FBI and state \n     criminal history record repositories to delete sealed record \n     information when responding to an interstate record request \n     pursuant to the Compact. Thus, the definition of ``sealed'' \n     becomes important, particularly since state sealing laws vary \n     considerably, ranging from laws that are quite restrictive in \n     their application to others that are very broad. The \n     definition set out here is intended to be a narrow one in \n     keeping with a basic tenet of the Compact--that state \n     repositories shall release as much information as possible \n     for interstate exchange purposes, with issues concerning the \n     use of particular information for particular purposes to be \n     decided under the laws of the receiving states. Consistent \n     with the definition, an adult record, or a portion of it, may \n     be considered sealed only if its release for noncriminal \n     justice purposes has been prohibited by a court order or by \n     action of a designated official or board, such as a State \n     Attorney General or a Criminal Record Privacy Board, acting \n     pursuant to a federal or state law. Further, to qualify under \n     the definition, a court order, whether issued in response to \n     a petition or on the court's own motion, must apply only to a \n     particular record subject or subjects referred to by name in \n     the order. So-called ``blanket'' court orders applicable to \n     multiple unnamed record subjects who fall into particular \n     classifications or circumstances, such as first-time non-\n     serious drug offenders, do not fit the definition. Similarly, \n     sealing orders issued by designated officials or boards \n     acting pursuant to statutory authority meet the definition \n     only if such orders are issued in response to petitions filed \n     by individual record subjects who are referred to by name in \n     the orders. So-called ``automatic'' sealing laws, which \n     restrict the noncriminal justice use of the records of \n     certain defined classes of individuals, such as first-time \n     offenders who successfully complete probation terms, do not \n     satisfy the definition, because they do not require the \n     filing of individual petitions and the issuance of \n     individualized sealing orders.\n       Concerning juvenile records, each state is free to adopt \n     whatever definition of sealing it prefers.\n\n\n                          Article II--Purposes\n\n       Five purposes are listed: creation of a legal framework for \n     establishment of the Compact; delineation of the FBI's \n     obligations under the Compact; delineation of the obligations \n     of party states; creation of a Compact Council to monitor \n     system operations and promulgate necessary rules and \n     procedures; and, establishment of an obligation by the \n     parties to adhere to the Compact and its related rules and \n     standards.\n\n\n            Article III--Responsibilities of Compact Parties\n\n       This article details FBI and state responsibilities under \n     the Compact and provides for the appointment of Compact \n     Officers by the FBI and by party states. Compact officers \n     shall have primary responsibility for ensuring the proper \n     administration of the Compact within their jurisdictions.\n       The FBI is required to provide criminal history records \n     maintained in its automated database for noncriminal justice \n     purposes described in Article IV of the Compact. These \n     responses will include federal criminal history records and, \n     to the extent that the FBI has such data in its files, \n     information from non-Compact States and information from \n     Compact States relating to records which such states cannot \n     provide through the III System. The FBI is also responsible \n     for providing and maintaining the centralized system and \n     equipment necessary for the Compact's success and ensuring \n     that requests made for criminal justice purposes will have \n     priority over requests made for noncriminal justice purposes.\n       State responsibilities are similar. Each Party State must \n     grant other states access to its III system-indexed criminal \n     history records for authorized noncriminal justice purposes \n     and must submit to the FBI fingerprint records and subject \n     identification information that are necessary to maintain the \n     national indices. Each state must comply with duly \n     established system rules, procedures, and standards. Finally, \n     each state is responsible for providing and maintaining the \n     telecommunications links and equipment necessary to support \n     system operations within that state.\n       Administration of Compact provisions will not be permitted \n     to reduce the level of service available to authorized \n     criminal justice and noncriminal justice users on the \n     effective date of the Compact.\n\n\n               Article IV--Authorized Record Disclosures\n\n       This article requires the FBI, to the extent authorized by \n     the Privacy Act, and the state criminal history record \n     repositories to provide criminal history records to one \n     another for use by governmental or nongovernmental agencies \n     for noncriminal justice purposes that are authorized by \n     federal statute, by federal executive order, or by a state \n     statute that has been approved by the U.S. Attorney General. \n     Compact parties will be required to provide criminal history \n     records to other compact parties for noncriminal justice uses \n     that are authorized by law in the requesting jurisdiction \n     even though the law of the responding jurisdiction does not \n     authorize such uses within its borders. Further, the \n     responding party must provide all of the criminal history \n     record information it holds on the individual who is the \n     subject of the request (deleting only sealed record \n     information) and the law of the requesting jurisdiction will \n     determine how much of the information will actually be \n     released to the noncriminal justice agency on behalf of which \n     the request was made. This approach provides a uniform \n     dissemination standard for interstate exchanges, while \n     permitting each compact party to enforce its own record \n     dissemination laws within its borders.\n       To provide uniformity of interpretation, state laws \n     authorizing noncriminal justice uses of criminal history \n     records under this article must be reviewed by the U.S. \n     Attorney General to ensure that the laws explicitly authorize \n     searches of the national indices.\n       Records provided through the III System pursuant to the \n     Compact may be used only by authorized officials for \n     authorized purposes. Compact officers must establish \n     procedures to ensure compliance with this limitation as well \n     as procedures to ensure that criminal history record \n     information provided for noncriminal justice purposes is \n     current and accurate and is protected from unauthorized \n     release. Further, procedures must be established to ensure \n     that records received from other compact parties are screened \n     to ensure that only legally authorized information is \n     released. For example, if the law of the receiving \n     jurisdiction provides that only conviction records may be \n     released for a particular noncriminal justice purpose,\n\n[[Page S12673]]\n\n     all other entries, such as acquittal or dismissal notations \n     or arrest notations with no accompanying disposition \n     notation, must be deleted.\n\n\n                  Article V--Record Request Procedures\n\n       This article provides that direct access to the National \n     Identification Index and the National Fingerprint File for \n     purposes of conducting criminal history record searches for \n     noncriminal justice purposes shall be limited to the FBI and \n     the state criminal history record repositories. A noncriminal \n     justice agency authorized to obtain national searches \n     pursuant to an approved state statute must submit the search \n     application through the state repository in the state in \n     which the agency is located. A state repository receiving a \n     search application directly from a noncriminal justice agency \n     in another state may process the application through its own \n     criminal history record system, if it has legal authority \n     to do so, but it may not conduct a search of the national \n     indices on behalf of such an out-of-state agency nor may \n     it obtain out-of-state or federal records for such an \n     agency through the III System.\n       Noncriminal justice agencies authorized to obtain national \n     record checks under federal law or federal executive order, \n     including federal agencies, federally chartered or insured \n     financial institutions and certain securities and commodities \n     establishments, must submit search applications through the \n     FBI or, if the repository consents to process the \n     application, through the state repository in the state in \n     which the agency is located.\n       All noncriminal justice search applications submitted to \n     the FBI or to the state repositories must be accompanied by \n     fingerprints or some other approved form of positive \n     identification. If, a state repository positively identifies \n     the subject of such a search application as having a III \n     System-indexed record maintained by another state repository \n     or the FBI, the state repository shall be entitled to obtain \n     such records from such other state repositories or the FBI. \n     If a state repository cannot positively identify the subject \n     of a noncriminal justice search application, the repository \n     shall forward the application, together with fingerprints or \n     other approved identifying information, to the FBI. If the \n     FBI positively identifies the search application subject as \n     having a III System-indexed record or records, it shall \n     notify the state repository which submitted the application \n     and that repository shall be entitled to obtain any III \n     System-indexed record or records relating to the search \n     subject maintained by any other state repository on the FBI.\n       The FBI and state repositories may charge fees for \n     processing noncriminal justice search applications, but may \n     not charge fees for providing criminal history records by \n     electronic means in response to authorized III System record \n     requests.\n\n\n              Article VI--Establishment of Compact Council\n\n       This article establishes a Compact Council to promulgate \n     rules and procedures governing the use of the III System for \n     noncriminal justice purposes. Such rules cannot conflict with \n     the FBI's administration of the III System for criminal \n     justice purposes. Issues concerning whether particular rules \n     or procedures promulgated by the Council conflict with FBI \n     authority under this article shall be adjudicated pursuant to \n     Article XI.\n       The Council shall consist of 15 members from compact states \n     and federal and local criminal justice and noncriminal \n     justice agencies. All members shall be appointed by the U.S. \n     Attorney General. Council members shall elect a Council \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, both of whom shall be compact \n     officers unless there are no compact officers on the Council \n     who are willing to serve, in which case at-large members may \n     be elected to these offices.\n       The 15 Council members include nine members who must be \n     state compact officers or state repository administrators, \n     four at-large members representing federal, state and local \n     criminal justice and noncriminal justice interests, one \n     member from the FBI's advisory policy board on criminal \n     justice information services and one member who is an FBI \n     employee. Although, as noted, all members will be appointed \n     by the U.S. Attorney General, they will be nominated by other \n     persons, as specified in the Compact. If the Attorney General \n     declines to appoint any person so nominated, the Attorney \n     General shall request another nomination from the person or \n     persons who nominated the rejected person. Similarly, if a \n     Council membership vacancy occurs, for any reason, the \n     Attorney General shall request a replacement nomination from \n     the person or persons who made the original nomination.\n       Persons who are appointed to the Council who are not \n     already federal officials or employees shall, by virtue of \n     their appointment by the Attorney General, become federal \n     officials to the extent of their duties and responsibilities \n     as Council members. They shall, therefore, have authority to \n     participate in the development and issuance of rules and \n     procedures, and to participate in other actions within the \n     scope of their duties as Council members, which may be \n     binding upon federal officers and employees or otherwise \n     affect federal interests.\n       The Council shall be located for administrative purposes \n     within the FBI and shall have authority to request relevant \n     assistance and information from the FBI. Although the Council \n     will not be considered a Federal Advisory Committee (see \n     Section 215(d)), it will hold public meetings and will \n     publish its rules and procedures in the Federal Register and \n     make them available for public inspection and copying at a \n     Council office within the FBI.\n\n\n                  Article VII--Ratification of Compact\n\n       This article states that the Compact will become effective \n     immediately upon its execution by two or more states and the \n     United States Government and will have the full force and \n     effect of law within the ratifying jurisdictions. Each state \n     will follow its own laws in effecting ratification.\n\n\n                 Article VIII--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n       This article makes clear that administration of the Compact \n     shall not interfere with the authority of the FBI Director \n     over the management and control of the FBI's collection and \n     dissemination of criminal history records for any purpose \n     other than noncriminal justice. Similarly, nothing in the \n     Compact diminishes a state's obligations and authority under \n     Public Law 92-544 regarding the dissemination or use of \n     criminal history record information (see analysis of Section \n     214, above). The Compact does not require the FBI to obligate \n     or expend funds beyond its appropriations.\n\n\n                        Article IX--Renunciation\n\n       This article provides that a state wishing to end its \n     obligations by renouncing the Compact shall do so in the same \n     manner by which it ratified the Compact and shall provide six \n     months' advance notice to other compact parties.\n\n\n                        Article X--Severability\n\n       This article provides that the remaining provisions of the \n     Compact shall not be affected if a particular provision is \n     found to be in violation of the Federal Constitution or the \n     constitution of a party state. Similarly, a finding in one \n     state that a portion of the Compact is legally objectionable \n     will have no effect on the viability of the Compact in other \n     Party States.\n\n\n                  Article XI--Adjudication of Disputes\n\n       This article vests initial authority in the Compact Council \n     to interpret its own rules and standards and to resolve \n     disputes among parties to the Compact. Decisions are to be \n     rendered upon a majority vote of Council members after a \n     hearing on the issue. Any Compact party may appeal any such \n     Council decision to the U.S. Attorney General and thereafter \n     may file suit in the appropriate United States district \n     court. Any suit concerning the compact filed in any state \n     court shall be removed to the appropriate federal district \n     court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12670-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. WARNER, from the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 2288.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my \npleasure that legislation providing permanent residency in the United \nStates for 13-year-old Vova Malofienko and his family, residents of \nShort Hills, NJ, passed the Senate. Vova Malofienko has leukemia from \nhis having lived 30 miles from the Chornobyl nuclear reactor in Ukraine \nduring and after the infamous disaster. His leukemia is in remission \nonly because of the emergency medical treatment he's received in the \nUnited States.\n  Were Vova forced to return to Ukraine, the United States would be \nplacing an innocent child near the front of the line on death row. Vova \nwas one of eight children of Chornobyl who came to the United States in \n1990--and when the seven others later returned to Ukraine, they died \none by one because of inadequate cancer treatment. Not a child \nsurvived.\n  On behalf of the Malofienkos, I thank my colleagues for their \ninvaluable support of this legislation. We are a compassionate nation \nthat has opened its heart to Vova and his family, who came in dire \nmedical need.\n   Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to tell my \ncolleagues a bit more about Vova and his family. Vladimir ``Vova'' \nMalofienko was born on June 29, 1984 in Chernigov, Ukraine. His mother, \nOlga Matsko, was born on September 29, 1959 in Piratin, Ukraine, and \nhis father, Alexander Malofienko, was born on December 25, 1957 in \nChernigov, Ukraine.\n  Vova was only 2 when the Chornobyl reactor exploded in 1986 and \nexposed him to radiation. He was diagnosed with leukemia in June 1990 \nat age 6. Vova and his mother came to the United States later in 1990 \non a B-1 visitor's visa so that Vova could attend a cancer treatment \ncamp for children, sponsored by the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund. \nVova was invited to stay in the United States to receive more extensive \ntreatment and chemotherapy. In November of 1992, Vova's cancer went \ninto remission. Vova's father, Alexander Malofienko joined the family \nin 1992, also on a B-1 visa.\n  Vova and his family have wanted to remain in the United States \nbecause of the extraordinary health concerns facing Vova. Regrettably, \nas I mentioned earlier, Vova is the only survivor from a group of eight \nchildren of Chornobyl who came to the United States together in 1990. \nThe seven other children returned to Ukraine and have since died. Now \nthat Vova is in remission, it would indeed be tragic to return him to \nan environment which would once again endanger his life. The air, food, \nand water in Ukraine are contaminated with radiation that people \nresiding there for several years have grown accustomed to, but which \ncould be perilous to Vova's weakened immune system.\n  Furthermore, treatment available in Ukraine is not as sophisticated \nand up to date as treatment available in the United States. Before Vova \ncame to the United States, no aggressive treatment for his leukemia had \nbeen provided. Although Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he \ncontinues to need medical follow-up on a consistent basis, including \nphysical examinations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure \nearly detection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate \nevent the leukemia recurs.\n  According to Dr. Peri Kamalakar, Director of the Valerie Fund \nChildren's Center at Newark Beth Israel hospital, where Vova has \nreceived care, Vova's cancer is considered high risk with a threat of \nrelapse. He is also at risk to develop significant later complications \nsecondary to the intensive chemotherapy he received, including heart \nproblems and secondary cancers. Another significant risk is relapse in \nthe bone marrow, testis, or central nervous system. Dr. Kamalakar has \nconcluded that Vova's chance for a permanent cure is considerably \nbetter if he stays in the United States.\n  I am pleased that this bill has passed today. It is now up to the \nHouse of Representatives to send this bill to the President and allow \nVova and his family to remain in the United States. Finally, I would \nlike to thank all of the Senators, from both sides of the aisle, who \nwere involved in negotiations on these private relief bills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12674-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12674-S12675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LIEUTENANT GENERAL CAROL MUTTER\n\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine \nMarine Corps Officer, Lieutenant General Carol Mutter, the Deputy Chief \nof Staff for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, Headquarters Marine Corps, \nWashington, D.C.\n  General Mutter, a native daughter of Colorado, will soon retire from \nactive duty following a long and distinguished career as an officer of \nMarines. A graduate of the University of Northern Colorado, in Greeley, \nCO she joined the Marine Corps in 1966 and completed the Woman Officer \nBasic Course in 1967. She was then trained as a data processing officer \nand assigned to data processing installations in Quantico, VA and Camp \nPendleton, CA. In 1971, she returned to Quantico as a platoon commander \nand instructor for women officer candidates and basic course \nlieutenants.\n  Over the years, Carol has made significant accomplishments both as a \nMarine officer and as a woman. As a Colonel, in July 1988 she joined \nthe U.S. Space Command, J-3 (Operations) Directorate in Colorado \nSprings where she became the first woman to gain qualification as a \nSpace Director. After initially serving as a Command Center Crew \nCommander/Space Director she became the Division Chief responsible for \nthe operation of the Commander in Chief s Command Center. In June 1992, \nshe transferred to Okinawa for a second tour, this time as the first \nwoman of general/flag officer rank to command a major deployable \ntactical command, the 3d Force Service Support Group, Third Marine \nExpeditionary Force, U.S. Marine Forces Pacific. Finally, upon \nadvancement to Lieutenant General (the first woman in the Marine Corps \nto attain this rank) on September 1, 1996, she assumed her current \nduties.\n  Throughout her services as a Marine, she worked continually to \nimprove herself through furthering her professional military education \nand earning a M.A. degree in National Security and Strategic Studies \nfrom the Naval War College at Newport, RI and honorary doctorate \ndegrees from Salve Regina College, also in Newport, RI and another\n\n[[Page S12675]]\n\nhonorary doctorate from UNC. In addition to the Naval War College at \nNewport, RI, General Mutter also attended the Amphibious Warfare School \nand the Marine Corps Command and Staff College, both at Quantico, VA\n  We know the officers and men and women of the Marine Corps, from the \nCommandant on down, will sorely miss the service of Lieutenant General \nMutter as she departs the Marine Corps. Among her many awards and \nrecognitions are the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Navy \nCommendation Medal, and the Navy Achievement Medal--worthy recognition \nfor days, months and years of selfless dedication. The Marine Corps \nloss will be Indiana's gain as she settles in her new home in the \nIndianapolis area. We offer the warmest wishes to Carol and her husband \nJim as they embark upon their new endeavors.\n  God Bless and good luck to a truly wonderful woman. Lieutenant \nGeneral Mutter is truly a great American patriot and an inspiration to \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12674-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S YOUNG ATHLETES\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the tremendous \naccomplishment of a number of young American athletes. Specifically, I \nwant to bring to the attention of the United States Senate the \naccomplishment of the 1998 United States All-Star High School Junior \nNational Ultimate Frisbee Team at the recently completed Ultimate \nFrisbee World Championship Tournament.\n  Mr. President, High School Ultimate Frisbee, or ``Ultimate,'' players \nfrom all over our great land competed for positions on the U.S. team. \nCompetition was fierce and the United States fielded a team of nineteen \nyoung men and one young woman at the tournament which was played at the \nbeautiful National Sports Center in Blaine, Minnesota at the end of \nAugust. Blaine is a suburb on the northern edge of the Twin Cities.\n  ``Ultimate'' is a fast growing, noncontact, sport. It resembles the \nfast-paced action of soccer and the thrill of American football. First \ndeveloped at Columbia High School in Mapelwood, NJ, in 1968, Ultimate \nFrisbee is now played around the world. Teams representing many \nnations, including Canada, Great Britain, Germany, and Sweden, came to \nthe World Championships. I must note for the Record, Mr. President, \nthat the junior World Championships have been dominated by Sweden. The \nSwedish team entered the 1998 World Championships with a string of \nWorld Championships dating back to 1983, interrupted only by the 1992 \ntournament victory of Taiwan, ROC. In light of their impressive record, \nSweden understandably was seeded first, Germany second, the U.S. third. \nYes, Mr. President, our team entered the world tournament as an \nunderdog. This was particularly apt in light of the fact that several \nof the teams had not only practiced together, but had also played \ntogether in numerous other tournaments. In fact, several of the \ncompeting teams were even sponsored by their governments. Not so for \nTeam USA! Our American ambassadors bought their own uniforms, paid \ntheir own ways to Minnesota and covered the expenses associated with \ntwo weeks at the National Sports Center. Even our coaches had to \nvolunteer!\n  I am pleased to report that not only did the American team represent \nour Nation with a great deal of enthusiasm, but they also quickly \ncoalesced into a real team. This was essential. With less than a week \nof practices under its belt, the U.S. team, which had never played \ntogether before, would face the stiffest Ultimate Frisbee competition \nin the world.\n  To make a long story short, Mr. President, the U.S. Team proceeded \nthrough the first round (10 games) of the tournament undefeated, \nhanding defending Champs Sweden their first two defeats in 6 years and \nsoundly defeating all other competitors, including second seed Germany. \nGoing into the semifinals, Team USA emerged as the decided favorite. It \nthen decisively defeated Great Britain in the semifinal. On Saturday, \nAugust 22, in a game begun in a driving rain storm, Team USA won the \nchampionship game against defending Champion Sweden. Yes, Mr. \nPresident, the U.S. team prevailed. The U.S. All-Star High School \nUltimate Frisbee Team won the gold meal.\n  Suffice it to say, we celebrate the great athleticism and victories \nof these young American athletes. We also have good cause to be proud \nof their great spirit as well. Spirit is very highly prized in \n``Ultimate,'' which does not field referees. To its credit, in \n``Ultimate,'' great spirit is often as prized as a great victory. In \nthis effort, our young American athletes demonstrated that good spirit \nand good play are wholly compatible.\n  Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of the U.S. Junior \nNational Team. Let me name each of the players and their home towns: \nHarper Alexander of Atlanta, Georgia; Jody Avirgan of Silver Spring, \nMaryland; Philip Burkhardt of Seattle, Washington; Sam Chatterton-\nKirchmeier of Seattle, Washington; Jeremy Cram of Seattle, Washington; \nBryan Edwards of Seattle, Washington; Jules Hirschkorn of Amherst, \nMassachusetts; Pauline Lauterbach of Atlanta, Georgia; Zach Morrison of \nNewton, Massachusetts; Kyle Neeson of West Newton, Massachusetts; Josh \nNugent of Amherst, Massachusetts; Sam O'Brien of St. Paul, Minnesota; \nIsaiah Robinson of Leverett, Massachusetts; Brian Rogers of Amherst, \nMassachusetts; Jeremy Schwartz of Scarsdale, New York; Matt Shamey of \nLeverett, Massachusetts; Michael Shiel of Chicago, Illinois; Jason \nSimpson of Decatur, Georgia; Ben Van Heuvelen of Bethesda, Maryland; \nand Garrett Westlake of Nashville, Tennessee. These are truly world \nclass athletes deserving of recognition.\n  Team USA was led to victory by an impressive world class coaching \nstaff. The Head Coach, Tiina Booth, has created and nurtured the \nUltimate Frisbee program at Amherst Regional High School in Amherst, \nMassachusetts. Her Assistant Coaches were Dave ``Mo'' Moscoe of Boulder \nCreek, California, and Mike Baccarini, who coaches the Ultimate Frisbee \nTeams of Paideia High School near Atlanta, Georgia. Mr. President, I \nwant to commend the coaches as well for their inspiration, hard work \nand tremendous contribution to the effort.\n  In short, Mr. President, please join me in congratulating the members \nand coaches of the U.S. Junior National Ultimate Frisbee Team on their \nvictory. We are proud of you and the Gold Medals you have won for our \ncountry!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/16/senate-section/article/S12675-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12675]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1998\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.
