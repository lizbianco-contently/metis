Under the previous order, the time until 10 \na.m. is equally divided between the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, \nand the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, or their designee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, time is very limited this morning, so I \nwill be brief.\n  We are voting shortly on cloture on a Motion to Proceed. In other \nwords, Senators will be deciding whether or not we can simply consider \nthis important measure.\n  We all know how contentious the issue of abortion can get around \nhere, and across the country. But this matter is not really even about \nabortion. This bill is simply about protecting the health and safety of \nminor children and the rights that their own states have concluded \ntheir parents should have. Specifically, it simply seeks to enforce \nstate laws requiring parental involvement in their minor daughter's \nabortion so that someone other than those parents cannot readily avoid \nthose state laws by taking a young girl across state lines for an \nabortion, certainly not without the notification to their parents.\n  But whether my colleagues agree or disagree with this bill, or \nwhether, like the Clinton administration, that want to modify or limit \nit, there is simply no reason to vote no on just proceeding to a \ndiscussion.\n  The concern has been expressed that there be an opportunity to offer \nrelevant amendments. Mr. President, no one has suggested otherwise. \nLet's have at it. The only action that would preclude amendments is a \nno vote this morning.\n  We are prepared to debate and vote on amendments. That opportunity \nwas available at committee and it can be worked out here. In fact, the \namendments offered or filed at committee would likely be germane post-\ncloture even if this were a cloture vote on the bill itself, rather \nthan a motion to proceed.\n  So let's not look for excuses here. I urge my colleagues to vote yes \nand allow us to consider this important legislation. American \nfamilies--parents and their children--deserve no less.\n  Having said that, I want to personally pay my respects to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator Abraham, for the \nleadership he has provided on this. Without him, we wouldn't be this \nfar. I have to say he has been a great leader on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I personally appreciate the efforts he has made on this bill \nthus far. I will support him every way I possibly can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \nkind remarks and look forward to\n\n[[Page S10228]]\n\nworking together on this and other legislation.\n  At this point, I yield up to 3 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is very \nsimple: It is to make it a crime to transport a child across State \nlines if this circumvents State laws requiring parental involvement or \nif it circumvents State laws requiring a judicial waiver for a minor to \nobtain an abortion. It is that simple.\n  Many States, as we know, have laws saying a parent or guardian has to \nbe notified if a child is trying to get an abortion. But not all States \nhave these laws. What is happening now, far too often in this country, \nis that people who aren't parents, who aren't guardians, are taking \nthese children across State lines, secretly, to get abortions in \nanother State where parental notification is not required. It is that \nsimple.\n  What we are addressing in this bill, and what Senator Abraham is \naddressing, is an obvious circumvention of these State parental consent \nand notification laws. This bill, then, has two purposes: to protect \nthe health of children and to protect the rights of parents. In fact, \nit might not be much of an exaggeration to say that these two purposes \nreally boil down to just one purpose, because, Mr. President, \nempowering parents is the single biggest investment we can make in \nensuring the health of our children.\n  What we are saying with this legislation is that, yes, parents have \nthe right to be involved in a moral and medical decision that affects \ntheir children's welfare. They have the right to do this. They have the \nduty to do this. When it comes to parental notification on abortion, \nthe American people have reached a clear consensus. By a huge majority, \n80 percent, favor parental notification; 74 percent favor not just \nparental notification but parental consent, as well--74 percent. This \nis a clear expression of the national wisdom. This legislation is an \neffort to make that kind of informed decision possible.\n  Now, earlier this year, we in Congress worked on another bill, one \nthat is now law. In that bill, the President and the Congress mandated \nthat the flight of a parent to another State to avoid paying child \nsupport would be a Federal crime. I worked with Senator Kohl to \nchampion the Deadbeat Parents Punishment Act in order to protect the \ninterests of America's children. We have to pursue very vigorously \nthose who would harm our children, either by omission or by commission.\n  Mr. President, the very same principle is embodied in the Child \nCustody Protection Act that we are considering today.\n  There are those living among us, Mr. President, who would place our \nchildren in harm's way by transporting them across State lines to \nachieve dangerous goals, both physically and emotionally. One such goal \nis abortion. The right of citizens to pass and enforce laws regarding \nthe rights of parents is completely violated by the ability of others \nto transport children to another State to obtain an abortion. As a \nNation, we must use all the resources available to us in order to \nprotect our children and our families from this conduct.\n  That is our purpose here today. Senator Abraham has shown strong \nleadership in bringing this legislation forward. I thank him for his \nwork on this important bill, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his \nleadership on this very important issue. I am here to offer my \nwholehearted support for him in his efforts on this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Currently, 22 States require parental notification if a minor is \ngoing to receive an abortion. Each year, thousands of adults \ndeliberately circumvent these laws by taking children across State \nlines to receive an abortion in another State which does not require \nparental consent.\n  This legislation would make it a Federal criminal offense to take \nchildren across State lines to receive an abortion without the \nknowledge of their parents. By implementing this safeguard legislation, \nwe will insulate our children from exploitation by adults who do not \nwant the parents involved in the decisionmaking process for an \nabortion, and who may not have the child's best interests at heart.\n  The decision to have an abortion is a critical one, which I hope \nwomen of all ages would not choose. However, despite an individual's \npersonal opinion about abortion, the majority of Americans, myself \nincluded, believe it is imperative for the parents of minor children to \nbe included in this life-altering decision. According to a 1996 Gallup \npoll, 74 percent of Americans support requiring minors to get parental \nconsent for an abortion. According to the Supreme Court, ``the medical, \nemotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious \nand can be lasting; this is particularly so when the patient is \nimmature.'' Clearly, our Nation's children should not be kept from \ntheir parents when making an important life decision, particularly one \nwith such broad ramifications as an abortion.\n  I find it unbelievable that schools throughout the country are unable \nto dispense even a simple aspirin to a child without written consent \nfrom their parents; yet, every day thousands of adults are permitted to \nescort children across State lines for an abortion which has serious \nphysical and mental effects.\n  This is simply preposterous. A child cannot receive over-the-counter \nmedications like an aspirin to relieve a headache while at school, but \nwe allow that same child to have an abortion without the consent or \nknowledge of their parents and guardians.\n  It is my firm belief that we must pass this law and stop people from \nbypassing the laws of our individual States. I would like to stress \nthat this bill does not impact the individual rights of States, nor \ndoes it alter, supersede, or override existing laws in the individual \nStates. What the Child Custody Protection Act does is protect the \ncurrent laws of States which have chosen to implement parental \nnotification. Most important, this legislation protects our children \nfrom making a life-altering decision without the guidance of their most \ntrusted and caring advisers, their parents. The mental and physical \nwell-being of thousands of children depends on us passing the Child \nCustody Act.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the \nSenator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I add my compliments to Senator Abraham \nfrom Michigan for his outstanding work in crafting this professionally \ndrafted, constitutional, and well-done amendment.\n  There was a recent article in the New York Times by an abortion \ndoctor who admitted to doing 45,000 abortions. He said in that article \nthat parents ought to be consulted in these circumstances. He said \nthat, when someone--often some young man--takes a very young girl \nacross a State line to a State where abortions don't require parental \nconsent, he is jeopardizing the health of that young girl, because the \nparents won't even know to watch out for her health. Having had the \nabortion a long distance away, the girl won't be able to return to the \nabortion clinic for follow-up. The parents won't be watching their \ndaughter's health and the complications that can arise. The doctor said \nthat pro-abortion forces do themselves a disservice when they oppose \nsuch legislation as this. I think that is plainly so from a medical \npoint of view. I think it is plainly so from a family point of view. \nYoung toughs who have impregnated a young girl ought not to be able to \navoid their responsibility by secretly taking her away to a distant \nplace, without the knowledge of her parents. This is basic.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for nearly 15 years, and during that time \nwe had what we call the Mann Act. It prohibits the interstate \ntransportation of a female across a State line for the purpose of \nprostitution or other immoral purposes. That is a law that has been \nupheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court. This bill will be upheld by the \nSupreme Court. It is consistent with American law. I am amazed that we \ncan't even get the bill up for a vote and that there are people \nopposing it.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for his leadership.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, because the first 4 minutes of this \ndebate\n\n[[Page S10229]]\n\nwas lost due to other business before the Senate, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we extend the time for debate an additional 5 minutes, \nwhich would move the cloture vote to 10:05.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to express my \nviews on the vote we are taking today regarding the Child Custody \nProtection Act. I will vote to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed \nto consideration of this legislation because I believe it is an issue \nthat merits consideration by the full Senate.\n  Based on my conversations with Pennsylvanians throughout the \nCommonwealth in recent weeks, I am well aware of the strong views on \neither side of this issue. It is the responsibility of the Senate to \ndeliberate over proposals concerning matters as complicated as an \nindividual's right to an abortion, particularly when minors are \ninvolved and there are substantial State interests at stake as well. \nWhile I am troubled by some of the implications of this bill, I believe \nit is important that this is debated by the entire body, not just the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be taken out of the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Hatch, and also my good friend from \nMichigan, Mr. Abraham, have said that the majority is prepared to \ndebate and vote on amendments to this bill. I know that a number of my \ncolleagues want to bring amendments that are also important for the \nhealth and safety of American families and children.\n  I have some concerns, as I have expressed to the Senator from \nMichigan, on the overall bill. But with the assurances that we are \ngoing to have debate--I am not talking about dilatory debate, I am \ntalking about real debate and amendments--I am prepared to take Senator \nHatch and others at their word and proceed to this bill and work \nthrough it.\n  Having said that, I have some difficulties with aspects of the bill. \nI note for my colleagues that those difficulties go to particular \nconstitutional and legal issues, not to the underlying concerns the \nSenator from Michigan has expressed.\n  The Senator from Michigan has expressed some very real concerns, many \nof which I share. He has done it in a way that shows a deep, heartfelt \nconcern, a concern of conscience, and I applaud him for that. We will \nwork through these particular things in the same way. As the Senator \nfrom Michigan knows, I did not take steps to delay this bill from \ncoming out of committee. This bill deserves to have a vote. We deserve, \nsome of us, and probably both sides, to have a vote on some of the \namendments. We will do that.\n  I will urge my colleagues to vote to move forward with this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I see nobody on our side looking for further time. I will yield, if \nthis will help the Senator from Michigan, the remainder of my time to \nhim, with the understanding that if somebody comes up I am sure he will \ntake care of their time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Vermont \nfor his remarks both here as well as in the committee when we dealt \nwith this issue. I think he and other members of the other side on this \ndebated in a very thoughtful fashion some of the issues at stake.\n  In light of his comments, it is my hope, obviously, that we will \nagree to this cloture motion this morning overwhelmingly, and then \nhopefully the Senate can begin to discuss a list of potential \namendments that might be debated on it for whatever time and we would \nthen call the bill up.\n  If there are others here who would like to speak at this point, I \nyield to them some time. I see there is one request.\n  Let me yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania for 1 minute to comment \non the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President. Now that the Senator from \nVermont has agreed to support the motion to proceed--that is \nheartening--we can now get to this.\n  I came here to plead that we at least be given the opportunity to \ndiscuss this issue. On this bill, while it is obviously important to \nthe entire country, the case which has been highlighted, which is the \none that is the most disturbing, is the case from Pennsylvania of a \nhorrible situation where a young girl 12 years old was raped by a boy \n18, was given alcohol, and was impregnated while she was unconscious. \nThe stepmother of the boy, without the knowledge of the little girl's \nmother, took her across the State line to have an abortion.\n  In fact, there are a series of false pretenses, which I will outline \nin the debate that we hope now to have on the full bill. It shows how \nthis law is necessary to protect the rights of parents, and the State \nof Pennsylvania wants to protect them. The State of Pennsylvania has a \nlaw in place that says you need parental consent. Parents in the State \nbelieve they should be able to rely upon the law, that they should be \nable to have that right that the State of Pennsylvania suggested that \nwe have, that the people of Pennsylvania should have their laws \nhonored, and that people, by crossing State lines, should not be able \nto evade what is the law within Pennsylvania. This is less an abortion \nissue than it is a State rights issue.\n  As Senator DeWine mentioned in his debate, we have done things just \nrecently with child support to get better enforcement of State \ndecisions across State lines to protect children and to protect \nfamilies. This is just another instance where we should do that--\nprotect the rights of parents and protect the rights of children within \nthe borders of the State, as the State legislatures and Governors have \nenacted laws to do so.\n  I commend the Senator from Michigan for his work to fight through the \nJudiciary Committee and to get this bill to the floor, and to now get \nit to a point where hopefully we can begin the debate and we can begin \nto move forward with the debate of these amendments.\n  I understand States rights and enforcing State laws is an important \nissue that we debate here often in the Congress. But there is none more \nimportant, as far as I am concerned, than to protect the lives and \nhealth of children and the rights of parents. That is exactly at the \nheart of this legislation.\n  I congratulate the Senator.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nhis support as well as for his work on a number of other related \nissues, including the one we will be debating here soon for the Senate. \nHe has given leadership in a variety of areas--especially in the area \nof abortion rights, which has been, I think, a source of great strength \nto people who care deeply about this topic. We look forward to working \nwith him later this week on a related matter that will come before the \nSenate.\n  In light of the current floor situation, I don't think there will be \nother speakers joining us. I intend to make a few remarks now, and, at \nthe end of that time, if no one else has come to the floor to speak, I \nwill yield back the remainder of the time that has been afforded me by \nthe minority and seek unanimous consent that we vote as originally \nplanned.\n  In light of Senator Leahy's comments, it seems that probably the \nmotion to proceed will receive enough votes for cloture and then we can \nbegin moving forward.\n  As I said in my remarks to the Senate yesterday, this is an issue \nthat would seem to me to be one that people, regardless of their view \non the underlying issue of abortion rights, could agree on; that is, \nthat the Supreme Court of the United States has deemed it to be \nconstitutional for States to enact parental involvement statutes--\nparental consent or parental notification statutes. Based on that \ndecision,\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\nabout 22 States have enacted such laws. The families in those States, \nthe parents in those States, and the children in those States have a \nright to rely on those laws. Those laws have been enacted to protect \nyoung women who are minors who might consider an abortion. The reason \nfor that is very simple.\n\n  The abortion procedure is a serious medical procedure. The \nconsequences of that procedure are very serious. There is no one in a \nbetter position, particularly with extremely young women, to know about \ntheir health considerations better than the parents. Of course, there \nare certain instances where parents may not be appropriate because of \nabusive situations. The States have addressed that. And the courts have \npermitted States to address that with bypass procedures and other \nmechanisms to allow young women to have options in those rare \ninstances. But other than in those rare instances, these laws make \nsense. I think an overwhelming percentage of Americans support them.\n  The problem is that these laws lack forcefulness. It is possible to \ncircumvent them very easily by simply transporting the child across a \nState line for an abortion. Our legislation is simply an effort to \nclarify which laws would apply in the new jurisdiction where that \nabortion might be performed. This legislation says that the laws of the \nStates which have enacted parental consent laws still have meaning, \nstill have consequence, and the families in those States still have the \nability to rely on those laws.\n  I cited yesterday on the floor the case that was presented in our \nhearings of Joyce Farley who was victimized by just such a situation--\nthe Senator from Pennsylvania just alluded to it--where her 12-year-old \ndaughter was raped by a neighbor, became pregnant, and then, in an \neffort to try to cover up that act, the neighbor's parent drove the \nchild out of Pennsylvania, where parental consent laws are required, to \nthe State of New York, where they had the abortion performed, falsified \ndocuments pretending she was the mother, brought the child back to \nPennsylvania, and left her 30 miles from home in a very, very serious \nstate of health. The child became very sick, finally got home, and \nfinally told her mother what had happened. Only because her mother was \na nurse was proper medical attention at that point applied and the \nlittle child's life saved.\n  This doesn't, in my judgment, seem to me to be a situation where we \ncan simply allow this to continue. For that reason, our legislation is \naimed not at changing the underlying abortion laws of States, not at \nchanging or in any way enhancing the parental notification laws, but \nsimply saying that where the laws exist, they have to be enforced \nregardless of where the child is taken for an abortion. That is what \nthe purpose of the legislation is.\n  I hope today we can move forward on this motion to proceed. Then I \nhope we can work together, regardless of what people's position might \nbe on the abortion question and the underlying question, to say that \nparents and families in these situations should be protected and shall \nbe protected by this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in support of S. \n1645, The Child Custody Protection Act.\n  The purpose of this act is to prohibit the transportation of minors \nacross state lines with intent to avoid application of a state law \nrequiring parental involvement in a minor obtaining an elective \nabortion.\n  As I imagine the fear, confusion, and perceived isolation of a minor \nchild who learns that she is pregnant, I can think of few situations \nwhere the support and security of family is more desperately needed. \nMany states have enacted laws to assure that parents are involved. This \nbill would assure that these state laws are not easily circumvented by \ncrossing state lines.\n  There is an even more sobering aspect to this issue. A significant \nreason behind evasion of the State's parental involvement law can be an \neffort to cover up statutory rape violations.\n  In a study of 46,000 pregnancies by school-age girls in California, \nresearchers found that seventy-one percent, or over 33,000, were \nfathered by adult post-high-school men. Another study reports that 58 \npercent of the time it is the girl's boyfriend who accompanies a girl \nfor an abortion when her parents have not been informed of the \npregnancy.\n  Obviously, many of these men are vulnerable to statutory rape \ncharges. This vulnerability provides these men with a strong incentive \nto pressure the much younger girl to agree to an abortion without \nrevealing the pregnancy to the parents. Currently, a man seeking to do \nso can evade the law and hide his crime by driving his victim across \nState lines.\n  Opponents of this legislation argue that in some families, ideal \nrelationship may not exist with the parents--that in families where \nabuse is present, for example, parental involvement would be \ndetrimental. This concern is addressed in that judicial bypass \nprovisions exist in every state with a parental notification \nrequirement. These judicial bypass procedures are not onerous. A recent \nstudy of Massachusetts bypass procedure published in the American \nJournal of Public Health reported that only 1 out of 477 girls was \nrefused a judicial authorization. Furthermore, the average hearing \nlasted less than 13 minutes.\n  Passing this bill will not force parental disclosure in instances \nwhere abuse exists within a family. Conversely, failure to pass this \nlegislation could compromise parental support from the majority of \nfamilies where good counsel and loving support would be provided.\n  Americans support the concept of parental involvement. In a 1996 \nGallup poll seventy-six percent of those polled favored laws requiring \nthe girls under the age of 18 get either parental consent or at least \ninform their parents before obtaining an abortion. This conviction is \nreflected at a legislative level by the 22 states that have enacted \nlaws requiring parental notification.\n  This is not a broad piece of legislation, it has in fact been \ndescribed by the media as ``narrowly tailored to address a specific \nproblem.'' The act does not establish a national requirement of \nparental consent or notification prior to the performance of an \nabortion on a minor under 18. Nor does it attempt to regulate any \npurely intrastate activities related to the procurement of abortion \nservices. S. 1645 simply helps effectuate the policies of States that \nhave decided to provide a layer of protection of their own residents \nagainst these dangers to children's health and safety by requiring \nparental involvement in the abortion decision.\n  Minors must not be left alone to make these crucial decisions. \nAbortion is a major medical procedure, highly invasive and often \nemotionally traumatic. There are hundreds of accounts of women who as \nadults, decide to undergo an elective abortion and are then plagued by \nprofound regret, health complications and emotional trauma for having \nmade that decision.\n  How much greater is the potential for a hasty and regrettable \ndecision when the mother is herself a child who may not fully \nunderstand her options and the consequences of her choices?\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture to proceed to this bill and \nto support this important legislation, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I know Members are anxious to get to this cloture \nvote. I strongly support the efforts of the Senator from Michigan and \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and others to deal with this important \nitem. I commend them for their perseverance in pursuing this. I think \nit is important that we move forward with this and support it.\n  It is designed in a way to protect the rights of children, the rights \nof parents, and the rights of States. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I note there are no other individuals on \neither side of the aisle here to speak at this point, and so in that \nthe hour of 10 o'clock, which was the original time that this vote was \nslated to occur, has arrived and there are no other speakers, I ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw the most recent unanimous consent \nagreement that was entered into, yield back all remaining time, and \nproceed at this point to a vote on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe matters now pending before the Congress as the House of \nRepresentatives considers what to do with the Starr report. I suggest \nthat we are guided now by the genius of the Constitution, which is the \nmost important, most efficacious, and most brilliant document ever \nwritten as to how our country should handle the issues and the problems \nwhich we now confront.\n  The Constitution establishes the blueprint for what we are to do \nnext, and that is for the House of Representatives to consider the \nStarr report, bearing in mind that it is a report which contains \ncharges to which there will be a reply and, perhaps, depending upon \nwhat the House of Representatives decides, we will move to a stage of \nhearing evidence.\n  The question of evidence is one of enormous importance because that \nis the determinant as to establishing the facts. In our judicial system \nand in our congressional system, and in the system on impeachment \nproceedings, the facts are established by witnesses who testify as to \nwhat they have seen or observed--or generally witnessed. It may be that \nwe will hear people who will come forward who will tell us what they \nsaw and what they observed as witnesses, contrasted with what appears \nin the news media, which is hearsay--sometimes reliable, sometimes \nunreliable--almost universally the source is leaks, a sustained line of \nsource material, but one which is the common parlance. But when it \ncomes to a proceeding as in a court proceeding or as in an impeachment \nproceeding, it is a matter of evidence, and the rules of evidence in an \nimpeachment proceeding may be entirely different. There are some \nhearsay declarations which are admissible under complex rules. There \nmay be broader rules of evidence established. At least we come to the \npoint of evidence as opposed to reports and as opposed to charges.\n  I think it is very important, as others have said on this Senate \nfloor and as others have said in the public milieu, that we not rush to \njudgment but that we consider what the evidence is and make a \nconsidered judgment, and that the interests of fairness are paramount, \nas they have been reflected in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, and really \nimproved upon in the American--the U.S. judicial system on what is due \nprocess and what is fair treatment. And deliberation is a critical \npart, and not rushing to judgment is a critical part.\n  We will see what the House of Representatives decides to do and what \nthe House Judiciary Committee decides to do. It may be, as the \nconstitutional procedure specifies, that the matter will be before this \nbody and each of us in the U.S. Senate will be, in effect, a juror. It \nis a complex matter which portends great problems for our Government if \nthe House takes up the matter of impeachment proceedings. It will tie \nup the House. If the Senate deliberates as a jury, it will obviously \ntie up this body. And what is not generally recognized is that the \nConstitution requires the Chief Justice to preside, so it ties up the \nSupreme Court of the United States. But the Constitution, that \nbrilliant document, sets forth the ground rules, and we have that as, \nreally, the strength of our American institutions to guide us in these \nvery, very troubled times.\n  I think it is very important that the Senate, and the House, too, \nfocus on very important legislative matters which have come before us \nin the course of the balance of September. Those are the appropriations \nbills which fund the Federal $1.7 trillion budget. I have the privilege \nto serve as chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee which \nhas jurisdiction over the Department of Education, the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and the Department of Labor. Traditionally, \nthis bill has been left to the end because it is so contentious. \nSenator Harkin, the ranking Democrat, and I have conferred and have \nformulated a plan to try to bring our bill to fruition early on this \nyear. If we wish to get something done--something I learned a long time \nago in the Senate is that if you want to accomplish what is in the \npublic interest, we have to cross party lines to do it. Senator Harkin \nand I have worked on that line.\n  Our staffs did an excellent job in pushing ahead on an expedited \nbasis to prepare a subcommittee report during the month of August, and \non the second day that we were back, September 1, a week ago Tuesday, \nthe subcommittee acted, and then, under Senator Stevens' leadership, \nthe full committee acted on Thursday. So the bill, appropriations for \nLabor, Health, Human Services and Education, is now ready to come to \nthe floor. The distinguished majority leader has stated that our bill \ncan be considered immediately after the Interior bill, so that we do \nnot wait until the very end of September. But Senator Lott has \narticulated a fair admonition, that if the bill becomes cluttered with \nso-called killer amendments or becomes highly politicized, that we \ncannot keep the bill on the Senate\n\n[[Page S10232]]\n\nfloor but it will be taken down. I think that is a fair consideration. \nSo we have our own institutional prerogatives. It goes without saying \nsometimes politics dominates what happens on the Senate floor, but it \nis our hope that we will be able to avoid killer amendments and will be \nable to proceed to consider the merits of the bill.\n  Senator Harkin and I have discussed this with the distinguished \nminority leader, Senator Daschle, who is sympathetic to our point of \nview and, without making commitments, has stated he would like to see \nthat proceed. We discussed the issue of time limits, and I have already \nstarted to talk to Senators who have amendments where we can consider a \ntime agreement, an hour equally divided or perhaps an hour and a half \nequally divided, so that we take up issues which have to be debated and \nhave a resolution of them, hopefully omitting the highly politicized \nmatters where there is going to be deadlock and which might require \nthat the bill be taken down.\n  Our subcommittee has had a good working relationship with the House. \nWe worked through with Congressman Porter, the subcommittee chairman on \nthe House side, my counterpart, and with Congressman Livingston, the \nchairman of the full committee. It is our realistic hope, realistic \nexpectation, that we can work through the process there.\n  I had a chance to discuss the matter previously with the President--\nyesterday. It was an event in the White House, where Pennsylvania was a \nrecipient. As is the custom, I received an invitation to attend, and \ndid so, and had a chance to talk for a few moments with the President \nabout this bill, Labor-HHS-Education. The President stated that he \nthought our Senate bill was a significant improvement over what has \ncome out from the House Appropriations Committee. I pointed out that, \nwhile it did not have everything the President had asked for, it was \nimportant to focus on the fact that the bill was $1.9 billion short of \nwhat the President had projected on income because we do not have the \nreceipts from the tobacco bill, which was never acted upon, and we did \nnot have the user fees, which had not been authorized.\n  Senator Harkin and I, then, earlier this week, took a rather unusual \nstep of convening a meeting of governmental affairs people, also known \nas lobbyists, who have an interest in this bill, especially those who \nhave increases, as we have significant increases on the National \nInstitutes of Health, Head Start, and the National Labor Relations \nBoard, in order to secure their assistance. Because, if we go to a \ncontinuing resolution, then those matters will be funded at last year's \nlevel and they will not have the advantages of the additions. So there \nis some very keen potential interest on their part seeing this bill \nmove. Our request to them was to exercise their best efforts--they have \na lot of contacts in the Senate, the House and the White House--to help \nus move the bill.\n  So I speak about this subject at some length, although I think not at \nexcessive length here today, to urge my colleagues to focus on the \nappropriations process and not to be distracted by what is happening \nwith the Starr report and the collateral problems which our country \nfaces at this moment.\n  One of our colleagues said last week that when the Starr report hit, \nthose issues were au courant in Washington, that it would suck all the \noxygen out of every room in Washington, DC, which is a dramatic \ncharacterization, but one which I think is realistic; sucking all the \noxygen out of every room in Washington, so that that is the sole focus \nof attention. From the conversations in the Cloakroom and on the floor, \nthat is a realistic problem.\n  I do believe we have to maintain a focus on these appropriations \nbills which are so important, as we look to what is going to happen \nwith the National Institutes of Health in cancer research, Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, et cetera, what happens with education on increases for \nHead Start, guaranteed student loans, what happens on worker safety. We \nare going to push very hard to bring forward our bill, hopefully next \nweek, and debate the issues under time agreements to let this body work \nits will and try to work the matter through the House and then through \nthe White House and then take up the other appropriations bills, so \nthat while we have this grave national problem which we have to \nconsider at the same time, we do not lose focus that September is the \ncritical month for appropriations bills.\n  I ask all of my colleagues who anticipate amendments for this bill to \nlet us know at an early date so that we can make a decision on what \nmight be accepted, what might be compromised, or what might be \nsubjected to time limits so that notwithstanding the problems which the \nPresident faces and which, in turn, the country faces, that we can \nfocus on the appropriations process and complete the people's business \nduring the month of September.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are three issues which I think we \nneed to be thinking about addressing as we move into the end of this \nsession. The first is an emergency spending bill which is coming at us \nand how we pay for that.\n  Traditionally, emergency spending bills have been paid for outside \nthe budget process. We have worked very hard, however, as a Congress \nand as a country to get our budget in balance. It has not been an easy \ntask. It has taken us 29 years to get the budget in balance. This year \nwe will have a $60 billion surplus, and that surplus is projected to \ncontinue for a number of years into the future. But that surplus will \nbe quickly frittered away if we add new spending programs that are not \npaid for, or if we arbitrarily increase the spending of the Federal \nGovernment in programs that already exist without looking at our \nbudgeting process.\n  The emergency supplemental, as well meaning as it is intended to be, \nrepresents, in my opinion, and raises the issue of how we are going to \nmaintain our surplus and threatens that surplus.\n  Since 1993, we have had $37 billion of spending under emergency \nbills. That is $37 billion that has been spent outside the budget \nprocess and has essentially added to the deficit, or in the case of \nthis year, reduced the surplus.\n  This year, the emergency supplemental is being talked about as a \nrather huge bill. In the past, since 1993, the average of those bills \nhas been somewhere in the vicinity of $5 billion or $6 billion. But now \nwe are talking about an emergency supplemental of--I have heard a \nnumber as high as $20 billion. But anything in the range of even $10 \nbillion or $15 billion would be a huge number and would significantly \nreduce the surplus unless it was offset.\n  The purpose of an emergency supplemental is to address issues which \nwe had not anticipated which need immediate action and to do so \npromptly. I can agree with all those purposes, but unfortunately, the \nemergency supplemental process has become a process which has basically \nbeen used as a giant loophole through which we have generated new \nspending and, thus, are putting at risk, in many instances, our surplus \nas we finally reached it.\n  Secondly, we have to ask ourselves, From where is this money coming? \nIn the past, we were borrowing it and creating debt, which was bad \nenough. This time when we fund this emergency supplemental, if it is \nanywhere near the range of $15 billion or $20 billion, that is all \nbasically going to come out of the Social Security trust fund. We will \nbe borrowing from the Social Security trust fund because this year the \nsurplus is essentially generated by the Social Security taxes which \nexceed the Social Security expenses. That, in and of itself, raises \nhuge public policy issues.\n  I hope that before we step into this or step off on to this road \nwhich leads to this giant loophole in our budgeting process, which \ngenerates expenditures outside of our budget caps, that we will think \nabout the process and, hopefully,\n\n[[Page S10233]]\n\ntake a hard look at offsetting a significant amount of this emergency \nsupplemental.\n  Much of it was anticipated. We already spent $1.5 billion emergency \nfor Bosnia. We should have been able to anticipate it and offset it. \nClearly, the situation that has occurred in the farming communities is \na severe emergency, but almost every year we appear to have an \nemergency in the farming communities. We should be able to budget and \noffset it. Disaster events have become, regrettably, all too \ncommonplace. They are severe, and they need to be responded to, but we \nshould be able to anticipate and budget it with some sort of reserve \naccount and be setting it off.\n  The only event which is truly an emergency which we could not \nanticipate was the blowing up of the embassies in Africa. I happen to \nchair the committee that has jurisdiction over that. If I were asked by \nthe appropriating authorities, by the leadership around here to find \noffsets for the purposes of paying for that, I would be willing to do \nthat, or at least some portion of that. So as to the extent that \nemergency has occurred, I am willing to go back and see if we can't \nfind some ways to pay the cost of that emergency with some sort of \noffset, some percentage of it anyway, maybe not the whole amount, but a \npercentage of it.\n  I am simply saying in throwing up a word of caution here, before we \nstep on to this emergency spending process without any offsets, let's \nlook at what it will do to the budget in the outyear and what it will \ndo to the Social Security fund and is it proper to do it without \noffsets. I don't think it is. Some percentage should be offset.\n  Second, I want to talk about caps. Caps are ways we as Congress \ndiscipline ourselves, where we say we will not spend more than this \namount in any one year. That is what the emergency issue is about, as I \nalluded to. The emergency spending designation allows you to exceed the \ncaps, which is an appropriate action in the budget process, but is not \nnecessarily a fiscally sound action.\n  The caps are in place only for the next 2 years because we do not \nhave in place a budget. We did not reach a budget agreement, and it \ndoes not appear we are going to reach a budget agreement this year \nwhich would extend the caps over the lifetime of the budget agreement \nwhich we reached last year with the President. Last year, we reached \nthe balanced budget agreement, a very important act in the history of \nthis country, which has led to the surplus, in large part, this year \nand will lead to projected surpluses in the future years. But that \nbudget agreement only had caps for 3 years. It was a 5-year agreement. \nSo we are closing in now on the point when those caps are no longer in \nexistence and we will no longer have any fiscal discipline around here.\n  I intend, and I hope I will receive the support of my colleagues, to \noffer an amendment to whatever the emergency supplemental is to extend \nthe caps for the last 2 years of the budget agreement which we reached \nwith the President. I think that is only reasonable that we do that so \nthat we can be sure that as we move forward in the future that we will \nhave fiscal discipline here and we will stay on the glide path toward \nmaintaining our surplus, which has been so difficult to attain and \nwhich is so important to the future of our country. That is the second \nfiscal point I wanted to make.\n  The fiscal third point I want to make is about taxes. It is obvious \nwe are running a surplus, and, yes, that surplus is significant and \nthere is a big demand to cut taxes, which is totally reasonable.\n  What is a surplus? It basically means people are paying more in taxes \nthan we are spending in Government. So whose right is it to get the \nmoney back? It is the taxpayers' right to get the money back.\n  So we should be looking at a tax cut. There are lots of different \ndiscussions around here looking at what the tax cut should be. But in \nlooking at this tax cut, we have to look at where the revenue is coming \nfrom.\n  Revenues for this surplus are coming from the Social Security tax. \nThey are not coming from the general revenue tax. They are not coming \nfrom the income tax or the corporate tax or a variety of fees that we \ncharge as a society, as a Government. They are coming from the fact \nthat people are paying more into the Social Security trust fund than \nthe Social Security trust fund is paying out today. As a result, we are \nrunning a surplus. That is true through about the year 2001 or maybe \neven the year 2002, that the surplus of this Government as it is \nprojected will be primarily a Social Security trust fund surplus.\n  So when we are looking at a tax cut around here, I think we ought to \nlook at the people who are paying the taxes. That would only be \nlogical. People who are generating the surplus should get the return of \nthe taxes. And that should be the Social Security taxpayer.\n  More importantly, there is no more regressive tax that we have on the \nbooks than the FICA tax. It is paid across the board. It is paid by \neverybody. No matter what your earned income is, you pay the FICA tax \nat the same rate. It is a regressive tax by any stretch of the \nimagination. No deductions, no exemptions, you pay it. Thus, if we are \nlooking for a place to cut taxes which would benefit the most Americans \nand be the fairest place to cut taxes, we should be looking at cutting \nthe Social Security tax.\n  So as we move down the road to the discussion on tax cuts, let us \ntake a hard look at cutting the FICA tax, returning to the American \npeople more of their tax dollars through a FICA tax cut. In doing that, \nwe ought to also be looking at increasing the savings of the American \npeople and trying to make the Social Security system more solvent in \nthe outyears.\n  One way to do that is a proposal that I put forth with Senator \nBreaux. And a number of other people have talked about it in different \nmachinations--including Senator Moynihan, Senator Grams, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Kerrey--to take the tax cut and put it into a \npersonal savings account which would be owned by the individual who \npays the taxes; and it will be their money, they will have it as an \nasset, and it will be available for them when they retire. I hope we \nwill consider that as an option also.\n  So as we move into this tax cut debate, I intend to raise this whole \nissue. And I believe we should raise this whole issue of where the \ntaxes are coming from and who appropriately should be getting a tax \ncut.\n  I ask unanimous consent for another 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. So three things we need to be concerned about are, first, \nas we step into this emergency spending water, let us be careful about \nwhere the money comes from, let us look at an offset; second, let us \nget those caps extended so we can have sound fiscal policy throughout \nthe 5 years of the balanced budget agreement we reached with the \nPresident; and third is, we look at a tax cut, let us have a tax cut \nthat flows back to the people who are paying the taxes, those folks who \nare paying Social Security taxes.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nfor--I will not say a specific period of time, I simply say that I will \nyield the floor any time our leader or anybody working on the \nbankruptcy bill asks me to. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10232-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10233-S10234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LET US RESERVE JUDGMENT ON IMPEACHMENT\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I had not intended to discuss the subject \nof the hour this morning, and I will only do so briefly and, hopefully, \nnot in a controversial way. I heard the Senator from Pennsylvania \npleading with people to reserve judgment. And I simply want to echo \nwhat he said. These are very traumatic times for this country. And I \nwould say, despite the trauma the country is experiencing over the \napparently possible impeachment of the President, we still have a \ntremendous amount of work to do in the U.S. Congress, and the American \npeople have a right to expect us to do that business before we leave \nhere.\n  While it is more gratifying, I suppose, from a political standpoint, \nas\n\n[[Page S10234]]\n\nwell as from a personal standpoint, to immerse ourselves in the Starr \nreport, we still have so much very serious, important work to do here, \nand I would be willing to suggest that we should come back after the \nelection if necessary to deal with some of these things.\n  Having said that, let me say that the President will respond in time \nto the Starr report, I am sure. He is entitled to be heard. The \nAmerican people are entitled to an objective, nonpartisan deliberation \nbased on the facts.\n  As a former trial lawyer, I have gone before jurors who I had a \nsneaking suspicion had made up their mind before I got to make my \nopening statement. And I can tell you, it is a very queasy feeling. I \nhave tried cases when, in my own mind, I was satisfied that the jury \nhad made up its mind before the case was tried, before they heard the \nevidence, despite what we lawyers call voir dire examination, where you \nask the jurors: ``Do you have any preconceived notions about this \ncase?'' All of them said no. And I did not come to that conclusion that \nthey made up their mind before they heard the evidence just because I \nlost, it was based on other things.\n  The American people have an inimitable, innate sense of fairness. The \nvast majority of the people in this country want, expect, and have a \nright to know that this whole situation is going to be considered in a \nvery dignified way in accordance with the process.\n  This should not be--and I do not think it will be a political witch \nhunt. And I want to compliment the people in the House whom I have \nwatched in the Rules Committee and in the Judiciary Committee, and the \nSpeaker of the House, in their admonitions to their own Members about \nthis being a very solemn, somber time in the history of this country \nand we must treat it with the seriousness it deserves. This is not one \nof those ``let's give them a fair trial and string them up'' kind of \nhearings.\n  So as an English philosopher once said, ``There's nothing more \nutterly impossible than undoing that which has already been done.'' \nWhatever the President's sins, they have been done. So far as anybody \nmuch knows at the present, the American people know what those sins \nwere, his indiscretions, what he described as ``indefensible.''\n  So the question before the House will be whether or not any or all of \nthose things combined reach the threshold that the Founders intended in \nthe Constitution; and that is, we know it is not treason and it is not \nbribery, and the next question will be: Does it reach the threshold of \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors?\n  The President has admitted, as far as I know, virtually everything. \nSo he has bared his soul to the American people and pleaded for their \nforgiveness, as he did this morning before a prayer breakfast.\n  So, Mr. President, while I did not come over here to speak on that, I \njust wanted to add my comments to those of the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  And I would also like to say that when I talk about the work we have \nyet to do here, I am talking about issues of health care, I am talking \nabout issues of the environment, and I am talking about issues of \neducation. I am not trying to make a comparison, but what I am saying \nis that morality is often like beauty, it is in the eye of the \nbeholder.\n  There has been an awful lot said about the President sacrificing his \nmoral authority. And I would simply remind people--and this is not \nintended to be defensive--I would simply remind people that allowing \nchildren to go without health care is immoral, too, in this Senator's \nopinion. And abusing the only planet God gave us to sustain ourselves \nis also immoral.\n  Probably next Tuesday, The Senate will debate a provision included in \nthe Interior Appropriations bill that would prevent the Secretary of \nInterior from being able to strengthen the environmental rules \ndetermining how the giant mining companies of this country will mine \ngold, silver and so on from our public lands. Most people don't know \nit, but we mine gold through a process called heap leach mining. And do \nyou know what we use? Cyanide. I am not saying it is immoral to use \ncyanide, but I am saying it is immoral to block regulations determining \nhow you are going to use cyanide to keep it out of rivers, streams and \nthe underground water supply. That is what the amendment on Tuesday \nwill be about.\n  I put in the category of being immoral to say the Secretary of the \nInterior must wait and let somebody else do a study before he can \nprotect the environment. Last year, we had a handshake deal on this \nsubject--we agreed not to procrastinate and delay Interior Department \nregulations any longer. Now, this year we have to have the National \nAcademy of Sciences study it--postpone it for another 27 months. At the \nend of that, the mining industry will probably want the National \nOrganization of Women to study it. After that, they will want NASA to \nstudy it --anything to keep from facing up to despoiling the only \nplanet we have to sustain our children and grandchildren. As I say, \nmorality takes a lot of forms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10233-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10234-S10235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TAX CUTS AND SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I also wanted to discuss another matter \nof significance. We are going to technically have a budget surplus this \nyear. Nobody knows how much it will be. The CBO has estimated the \nsurplus will be somewhere between $50 and $63 billion. They have \nprojected $1.4 trillion in surpluses over the next 10 years. We need to \nkeep in mind that estimates are just that--estimates. When you consider \nthe fact in the last 60 days, $1.9 trillion has been lost on the stock \nexchanges of this country, you tell me how you would evaluate that \nstudy that was made about 4 months ago that we are going to have a $1.4 \ntrillion surplus over the next 10 years. The surplus may hold up this \nyear and we may get a surplus next year, because an awful lot of people \nare bailing out of the market.\n  But when we talk about a surplus, it has been said time and time and \ntime again on the floor of this Senate, it is not really a surplus. I \ndon't know why in the name of God we keep calling it a surplus when it \nisn't. But for the sake of argument, because this is the way we do it \nhere, let's assume we will have a $50 to $63 billion surplus this year. \nBut let me add this caveat: $100 billion of that is the excess in the \nSocial Security Trust Fund. You take the Social Security excess out and \nwe will have a $40 to $50 billion deficit.\n  Now, having set the stage for whoever may be listening to this \nargument, we are effectively looking this fall for a surplus, and every \ndime of it will come from the Social Security Trust Fund. Then I pick \nup the paper this morning and I see where there is a move in the U.S. \nSenate to go ahead with a tax cut after all. I don't know whether what \nI read this morning is true or not, but I have applauded our Budget \nCommittee chairman in the past because he has steadfastly been opposed \nto tax cuts this year. But this morning I read that maybe he is about \nready to sign off on an $80 billion tax cut. I want to say this: There \nis an unassailable argument that can be made, that we are cutting taxes \nfor some of the wealthiest people in America and it is coming right out \nof the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  If you put $100 billion that we collected in Social Security this \nyear, in excess of what we paid out, if you take that surplus and take \nit off budget and put it in the Trust Fund where it is supposed to be, \nyou have a deficit. If you leave it in, you have a surplus. It is a \nphony surplus. And this tax cut will come out of the phony surplus, \nwhich means it is coming right out of the Social Security Trust Fund.\n  Now, I would not presume to give political advice to the people on \nthe other side of the aisle, and I can tell you that nobody ever lost a \nvote--normally--voting for a tax cut. In 1993, we lost control of the \nSenate because we voted for a tax increase on the wealthiest of \nAmericans which brought about our current economic prosperity and \nrenewed fiscal soundness. I said time and time again, if the Democrats \nhad to lose control of the Senate for casting a very courageous vote \nthat brought this country 7, 8 years of economic vibrancy, it was worth \nit.\n  I lost two of the dearest friends I had in the election of 1994 \nbecause they voted for the 1993 budget bill. We have been benefiting \nfrom it ever since, and we now find ourselves in this very happy, \neuphoric state. Why cannot we enjoy and leave it alone? Why do we\n\n[[Page S10235]]\n\nhave to keep tinkering with it? If you don't want the Social Security \nTrust Fund to be a vibrant fund, something that gives people who are in \nthe workforce at the age of 25 or 30 some degree of assurance that it \nwill be there for them, if you don't want to do that, say so.\n  Mr. President, do you know that under current estimates--and these \nestimates, as I say, are just what I say they are; they depend on the \neconomy and they depend on a lot of things. But the Social Security \nAdministration estimates by the year 2020, the Social Security trust \nfund will have a $3.7 trillion surplus. The only problem with that is \n12 years later it is bankrupt. If we don't fix Social Security--we are \nnot going to do it this year--if we don't get at it soon, and we allow \nourselves to squander a $3.7 trillion trust fund, it will be one of the \nmost callous, irresponsible acts ever taken by the U.S. Congress.\n  If you don't want it to go to the Social Security Trust Fund, then \nyou just tell your constituents you are not for a tax cut; you want it \nto either stay in the Social Security Trust Fund or you want it to go \non the national debt, which now stands at about $5.2 trillion.\n  We still have a vibrant economy. When you start taking money out of \nthe Social Security trust fund to funnel into the economy, you have the \nremote chance of increasing inflation. You increase inflation, you \nincrease interest rates. You increase interest rates, the buying of \ncars and houses goes ``kerplunk.'' Those are simple economic \nprinciples. They are just as certain to happen as the night following \nthe day.\n  Why cannot we be grateful for our prosperity? Mr. President, I vented \nmy spleen on one of my favorite subjects this morning, and that is that \nI think tinkering with the phony surplus in order to provide a tax cut \nis not only bad economic policy, it is bad politics for those who \npropose it. In 1981--I am not sure I would have had the courage, except \nI had just been reelected, had 6 years in front of me to rectify \nwhatever sins I committed--in 1981, I stood right here--I think I have \nbeen sitting at this desk for about 18 years--and I made the point just \nbefore we voted that if you passed Ronald Reagan's tax cuts and doubled \ndefense spending, you were not going to balance the budget in 1984, you \nwere going to create deficits big enough to choke a mule.\n\n  There is nothing more fun for a politician than to be able to say I \ntold you so, so that is what I am saying. Eleven Senators voted against \nthat. There were only three Senators who voted against the tax cuts and \nfor the spending cuts, which would have balanced the budget in 1984; it \nwas yours truly, Bill Bradley from New Jersey, and Fritz Hollings from \nSouth Carolina. But 11 of us voted against that tax cut and said you \nare going to get the deficit out of control. My precise words were: \n``It will be big enough to choke a mule.'' You will find that in the \nCongressional Record. And we did it. I don't know whether we choked a \nmule or not, but the consequences were absolutely horrendous, and \nremained horrendous until 1993 when we were looking at $300 billion in \nannual deficits as far as the eye could see.\n  So I am pleading with my colleagues to think about it. My voice is \nnot persuasive on the other side of the aisle, and I know that. It is \nvery presumptuous of me to even make this speech, and I don't intend to \nlecture. I am simply saying that despite what is going on here in this \ntraumatic time in the history of this country, let's not compound that \nby making a terrible economic mistake. And, as I say, for some, in my \nopinion, it is a terrible political mistake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Brownback addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10234-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10235-S10236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to proceed \nto the Child Custody Protection Act, S. 1645.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am a proud sponsor of the Child \nCustody Protection Act, which makes it a Federal offense to transport a \nminor across State lines to obtain an abortion in circumvention of \nState parental notification laws. Good laws, constitutionally-tested \nlaws, have been enacted in over 20 States which require parental \nparticipation, or judicial involvement, in a minor's abortion decision. \nYet, these same laws are flagrantly breached by nonfamily adults who \nsecretly transport young, pregnant girls in complete disregard of her \nparents' knowledge or participation. I think this is wrong, and I \nbelieve most parents would agree with me.\n  The Child Custody Protection Act is really a family values bill which \npreserves the parental right to oversee their child's medical treatment \nof the most intrusive kind--namely, that of abortion. This bill is \nabout choosing to support parents, rather than unrelated strangers, in \ntheir State-recognized right to care for a vulnerable, at-risk \ndaughter. Is this too much to ask? Even ear-piercing for minors \nrequires parental authorization, let alone this most disturbing \nsurgical procedure.\n  Abortion, I believe, is in a class by itself and is unlike any other \nmedical procedure, for both strikingly emotional and physical reasons. \nThere is no other surgery like it, where the object is to terminate a \ndeveloping human life, and the emotional repercussions can be \ndevastating. Women who have experienced abortion are haunted by the \nunspeakably weighty consequences of lost life and the deep emotional \nconflicts this produces. Add to this terrible mix the factor of \nyouthful vulnerability and you invite extreme emotional trauma.\n  Also, abortion can have unique physical consequences--rendering a \nyoung girl physically traumatized and even infertile from a bungled \noperation. Most alarmingly, some ``absconding'' adults can exhibit the \nextremes of irresponsibility and disregard for the physical well-being \nof their ``charges.'' There are tragic examples of young women who have \nbeen plied with alcohol, raped, impregnated, and then taken across \nState lines for secret abortions. Some of these cases are just so \nhorrific that one can't even really repeat them.\n  We simply don't want strangers interfering with this important \nparental responsibility, which is already protected by several States. \nWe must honor the fact that parents have a unique legal status of in \nloco parentis, which is a historic common law charge to protect their \nchild's well-being. Don't let this right be eroded by unfettered \nabortion activists with baseless constitutional law claims. To do \notherwise is an assault against the precious institution of ``family,'' \nwhich we prize and which has been harmed and is a fundamental \nfoundation for our culture and this society.\n  Let's help, and not hinder, parents in their difficult and crucial \njob in an otherwise potentially disastrous situation. Let's not allow \nparental rights and family ties to be further eroded. Let's support the \nwisdom of these 20-plus States which have already done the hard work of \nsafeguarding unwed, pregnant children by requiring parental \nnotification. In short, let's support family values by passing this \nChild Custody Protection Act.\n  Mr. President, this is a commonsense act. If you are going to allow--\nand we have--parents to have the responsibility over a child in getting \ntheir ears pierced, my goodness, shouldn't we have the responsibility \nfor a parent, or a court, to get involved if an abortion is going to \ntake place across State lines? Shouldn't we honor these States for \ntheir efforts in the devolution of power? Shouldn't we honor those 20 \nStates that have decided to go differently on this and require the \nparental notification to take place? This just makes sense throughout \nour constitutional system, throughout our Federal system, and \nthroughout our family system. The foundational unit of this Government \nis the family. We should not further erode that responsibility. For all \nthose reasons, I urge my colleagues to help and support in the passage \nof this Child Custody Protection Act.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10236]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

A bill to extend the extend the authorization for the Upper \nDelaware Citizens Advisory Council and to authorize construction and \noperation of a visitor center for the Upper Delaware Scenic and \nRecreational River, New York and Pennsylvania; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        upper delaware scenic and recreational river legislation\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my \nfriend and colleague Senator D'Amato, a bill that would extend the \nauthorization for the Upper Delaware River Citizens Advisory Committee \nand authorize the construction of a visitors center. The Upper Delaware \nis a 73 mile stretch of free flowing water between Hancock and \nSparrowbush, New York along the Pennsylvania border. The area is home \nto the Zane Gray Museum and to Roebling's Delaware Aqueduct, which is \nbelieved to be the oldest existing wire cable suspension bridge. The \nUpper Delaware is an ideal location for canoeing, kayaking, rafting, \ntubing, sightseeing, and fishing.\n  In 1987 the Secretary of the Interior approved a management plan for \nthe Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational River which called for the \ndevelopment of a visitors center at the south end of the river \ncorridor. It would be owned and constructed by the National Park \nService. In 1993 New York State authorized a lease with the Park \nService for the construction of a visitor center on State-owned land in \nthe town of Deerpark in the vicinity of Mongaup. This bill allows the \nSecretary to enter into such a lease and to construct and operate the \nvisitor center.\n  Mr. President, the many thousands of visitors to this wonderful river \nwould benefit greatly from a place to go to find out about the \nrecreational opportunities, the history, and the flora and fauna of the \nriver. This bill would move that process along to its conclusion. It \nwould also continue the Citizens Advisory Council that ensures that the \nviews and concerns of local residents are kept in mind when management \ndecisions are made.

Mr. President, today I introduce the Lisa De Land \nFinancial Protection Act. The bill that I am introducing would allow \nthe families of disabled persons to keep the money that they put in \ntrust funds to care for their family members. Individual states would \nhave the option of whether or not to recover those funds.\n  Recently, Virginia De Land, a concerned Montanan contacted me \nregarding a problem that her family was facing. The De Land family is \nfrom Missoula, Montana. Their daughter, Lisa suffers from a genetic \ndisease that has affected her since birth. It is called Williams \nSyndrome. Williams Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects \nabout 1 in 20,000 births. Those who suffer from the syndrome are \nmissing genetic material on their seventh chromosome. They are \nexcessively social people. They have low to normal IQ's, however they \nare often gifted musically and have great social interactions skills. \nPeople who suffer from Williams Syndrome are almost always extroverts.\n  From the time that Lisa was small, her parents wanted to be able to \nassume some responsibility for her healthcare. At one point the family \ntried to buy an annuity. In order for Lisa to qualify for programs such \nas medicaid and SSI, the family's lawyer advised them to disinherit \nLisa. If Lisa had other money set aside for her, she would have access \nto medicaid. For middle income families, it is virtually impossible to \nsupport a child with a disability on their finances alone.\n  Self Sufficiency trust funds allow families to use money in a variety \nof ways. The money can be used for reasons as varied as the \ndisabilities that individuals have. For example, if an individual has \nto live in a group home, money can be used to provide that person with \na separate telephone in his or her room. In Montana, these trusts are \ngreat mechanisms that allow families help support loved ones. These \ntrusts let families provide support without disinheriting a child and \nallow them to have ongoing participation in the healthcare process. For \nexample, if Lisa had a self-sufficiency trust, she would still qualify \nfor medicaid and her family would still be able to provide some \nassistance for her.\n  With the implementation of the Medicaid Recovery Act, any trust that \nwas set up would be recovered by the federal government when the \nmedicaid recipient turned 55, or when that person passed away. Lisa's \nparent's had hoped that when she no longer needed the money from the \ntrust fund, that money would go to the rest of their children. Current \nlaw requires the Government to recover that money, denying the other \nchildren access to it. Many people with disabilities have a short life \nexpectancy. In this case, these families would not be affected by this \nlaw. However, Lisa has a normal life expectancy and with this law, the \nmoney that is set aside for her health care will be recovered by the \ngovernment.\n  It is important for individual states to have the option to choose \nwhether or not these funds are recovered. Families across the country \nand in my home state of Montana are seriously affected by this problem. \nIt is time to make a change in the system that will help out average \nfamilies in extreme circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2462\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Kirk O'Donnell, succinctly \ndescribed by Albert R. Hunt in the Wall Street Journal as ``one of the \nablest and most honorable people in American politics,'' died suddenly, \nmuch too young, this past Saturday.\n  He epitomized the honor and dignity to which all of us engaged in the \npolitical life of our Nation should aspire. He served for more than 7 \nyears as chief counsel to then-Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, Jr. \nHe has been active in politics even since, as indeed he was in the \nyears before Washington too.\n  I knew Kirk from my earliest days in the Senate. He and his lovely \nwife Kathy have dined with Liz and me at our home. His cousin, Lawrence \nO'Donnell, served in my office for many years as chief of staff and as \nthe staff director of the Finance Committee when I became Chairman in \n1993. Our thoughts certainly are with Kathy, her children, and the \nO'Donnell family as they cope with this sudden, terrible news.\n  To begin, one must know that Kirk was a fellow Irishman and the great \nand indispensable achievement of the Irish is that they made it \nAmerican to be ethnic. On the contribution of the Irish I have written:\n\n       What did the Irish do? First, they stayed in the cities, \n     remaining highly visible. Next, they kept to their faith. \n     Thus the Roman Catholic Church became a major American \n     institution. Then they went into politics.\n\n\n[[Page S10246]]\n\n\n  Kirk O'Donnell, embodied all of these noble traits. He began his \npolitical career in 1970, working on Kevin H. White's campaign for \ngovernor of Massachusetts. That bid failed, but when Mr. White later \nbecame mayor of Boston, he hired Kirk to run the Fields Corner Little \nCity Hall, in essence, a field station of the city hall. In the words \nof Speaker O'Neill, ``All politics is local'' and this grassroots view \nof Massachusetts, coupled with Kirk's astute political sense, made him \nan ideal choice when the Speaker needed a new counsel here in \nWashington.\n  It is then that I first came to know Kirk O'Donnell. He was an Irish-\nAmerican who saw early on the danger of the financial support which \nsome others were providing the IRA. In 1977, Tip O'Neill, Hug Carey, \nEdward M. Kennedy, and I joined together at Kirk O'Donnell's initiative \nto oppose such activities. We issued a joint appeal on St. Patrick's \nDay, 1977, which stated:\n\n       We appeal to all those organization engaged in violence to \n     renounce their campaigns of death and destruction and return \n     to the path of life and peace. And we appeal as well to our \n     fellow Americans to embrace this goal of peace, and to \n     renounce any action that promotes the current violence or \n     provides support or encouragement for organizations engaged \n     in violence.\n\n  Now, finally, one of the oldest conflicts in Europe has the potential \nof healing and being resolved. A courageous agreement has been reached \nin Northern Ireland and is being implemented. The United States played \na role in reaching this agreement. And the seeds for American support \nof a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Northern Ireland were sown \nin the late 1970's, when principled people such as Kirk O'Donnell stood \nup to say that violence was not the answer to this problem.\n  Mr. President it is with great sorrow that I have risen today to \nthank Kirk O'Donnell for his lifetime of public service and again to \noffer my sincere condolences to his family.\n  At this point, I ask to have printed in the Record the obituaries \nfrom the New York Times and the Boston Globe, as well as a tribute to \nKirk O'Donnell by Albert R. Hunt, which appeared in The Wall Street \nJournal.\n  The material follows:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 10, 1998]\n\n            The Loss of a Talented, Decent and Honorable Man\n\n                          (By Albert R. Hunt)\n\n       Kirk O'Donnell, one of the ablest and most honorable people \n     in American politics, died suddenly last weekend at the \n     altogether too young age of 52. Even in grieving, it's \n     somehow hard not to think how different the Clinton \n     presidency might have been if Kirk O'Donnell had been a top \n     White House adviser starting in 1993.\n       He combined the best virtues of the old and the new \n     politics. Raised in the rough-and-tumble environs of Boston \n     tribal warfare, he never saw politics as anything but a \n     contact sport. But he always practiced it with decency and \n     civility.\n       He was a great student of political history, which better \n     enabled him to appreciate contemporary changes. There was a \n     pragmatism to Kirk O'Donnell that never conflicted with his \n     commitment and total integrity.\n       Success never changed him. He founded the influential \n     Center for National Policy (his successor as its chair was \n     Madeleine Albright) and then became a partner in the high-\n     powered law firm of Vernon Jordan and Bob Strauss. But his \n     values and devotion to family, friends and country were \n     remarkably constant.\n       ``He was a big oak tree of a friend,'' notes Stanley Brand, \n     a Washington lawyer, of the former Brown University football \n     star, a description which Mr. O'Donnell used to joke, was an \n     ``oxymoron.''\n       He cut his political teeth working for Mayor Kevin White in \n     Boston in the mid-70s, running the neighborhood city halls, \n     developing an appreciation of the relationships between \n     common folks and government that would serve him well for the \n     next quarter century. Then there were more than seven years \n     as chief counsel to House Speaker Tip O'Neill.\n       There was an exceptional triumvirate of top aides to the \n     speaker: Leo Diehl, his longtime colleague who was the link \n     to the past and the gatekeeper who kept away the hangers-on; \n     Art Weiss, although only in his twenties, unrivaled as a \n     policy expert; and Kirk O'Donnell, in his early thirties, who \n     brought political, legal and foreign policy expertise to the \n     table, always with superb judgment.\n       Though it may seem strange in today's Congress, he \n     commanded real respect across the aisle. ``Kirk was really a \n     tough, bright opponent; he was a great strategist because he \n     didn't let his emotions cloud his judgment,'' recalls Billy \n     Pitts, who was Mr. O'Donnell's Republican counterpart working \n     with GOP House Leader Bob Michel. ``But he always was a \n     delight to be around and his word was gold.''\n       When the Democrats were down, routed by the Reagan \n     revolution in 1981, it was Kirk O'Donnell who put together a \n     strategy memorandum advising the party to lay off esoteric \n     issues and not to refight the tax issues but to focus on \n     social security and jobs. It was the blueprint for a big \n     Democratic comeback the next year. When then-Republican \n     Congressman Dick Cheney criticized the speaker for tough \n     partisanship, Mr. O'Donnell immediately turned it around by \n     citing a book that Rep. Cheney and his wife had written on \n     House leaders that praised the same qualities that he now was \n     criticizing.\n       Few operated as well at that intersection of substance and \n     politics, or understood both as well. He played a major role \n     in orchestrating a powerful contingent of Irish-American \n     politicians, including the speaker, to oppose pro-Irish \n     groups espousing violence. ``Kirk put the whole Irish thing \n     together,'' the speaker said.\n       He was staunchly liberal on the responsibility of \n     government to care for those in need of equal rights. But he \n     cringed when Democrats veered off onto fringe issues, and \n     never forgot the lessons learned running neighborhood city \n     halls in his 20s. Family values to Kirk O'Donnell wasn't a \n     political buzzword or cliche, but a reality of life; there \n     never has been a more loving family than Kirk and Kathy \n     O'Donnell and their kids, Holly and Brendan.\n       The Clinton administration made job overtures to Kirk \n     O'Donnell several times but they were never commensurate with \n     his talents. He should have been either Chief of Staff or \n     legal counsel from the very start of this administration. He \n     would have brought experience, expertise, maturity, judgment, \n     toughness--intimate knowledge of the way Washington works--\n     that nobody else in that White House possessed.\n       But sadly, that's not what this president sought. For Kirk \n     O'Donnell wouldn't have tolerated dissembling. He never was \n     unfaithful to those he worked for but ``spinning''--as in \n     situational truths--was foreign to him. When working for the \n     speaker or Michael Dukakis in 1988, he would dodge, bob, \n     sometimes talk gibberish but never, in hundreds of interviews \n     with me, did he ever dissemble.\n       The contrast between this and someone like Dick Morris, who \n     Mr. Clinton continuously turned to, is striking. This was \n     brought home anew when Mr. Morris, the former top Clinton \n     aide, wrote a letter seeming to take issue with a column I \n     wrote a few weeks ago.\n       For starters, he erroneously denied that he suggested \n     Hillary Clinton is a lesbian. More substantially, Mr. Morris \n     says that Mr. Clinton called him when the Lewinsky story \n     broke and had him do a poll to gauge reaction. He did that \n     and told Mr. Clinton the public wouldn't accept the truth. \n     Although Mr. Morris turned over what he says is that poll to \n     Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, some of us question \n     whether the survey was genuine.\n       The infamous political consultant swears he sampled 500 \n     people, asked 25 to 30 questions and did it all out of own \n     pocket for $2,000. If true, it was a slipshod survey upon \n     which the president reportedly decided to stake his word. \n     (Only days later, Mr. Clinton swore at a private White House \n     meeting that he hadn't spoken to Mr. Morris in ages.)\n       There was no more an astute analyst of polls than Kirk \n     O'Donnell. He would pepper political conversations with \n     survey data. But because he understood history and had such \n     personal honor he always understood a poll was a snapshot, \n     often valuable. But it never could be a substitute for \n     principle or morality or integrity.\n       Those were currencies of his professional and personal \n     life. These no longer are commonplace commodities in \n     politics, which is one of many reasons that the passing of \n     this very good man is such a loss.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 7, 1998]\n\n      Kirk O'Donnell, 52, Lobbyist And an Aide to a House Speaker\n\n                          (By Irvin Molotsky)\n\n       Washington, Sept. 6.--Kirk O'Donnell, a lawyer and lobbyist \n     for a leading Washington law firm and the former chief aide \n     to former Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., died on Saturday \n     near his weekend home in Scituate, Mass. He was 52 and lived \n     in Washington.\n       A family friend, Robert E. Holland, said that Mr. \n     O'Donnell, who did not have a history of health problems, \n     collapsed after jogging. Mr. O'Donnell was pronounced dead at \n     South Shore Hospital.\n       The White House issued a statement tonight in which \n     President Clinton said: ``Kirk O'Donnell was a gentleman and \n     a patriot who brought wit, common sense and a genuine \n     humanity to his public and private life. He was a very good \n     man and has left us much too soon.''\n       Mr. Holland, a boyhood friend of Mr. O'Donnell's and for a \n     time his law partner in Boston, said that in his role as \n     chief counsel to Mr. O'Neill, Mr. O'Donnell always acted \n     behind the scenes in the Speaker's behalf, except on one \n     issue, the running of guns to elements of the Irish \n     Republican Army.\n       At the time, Irish-Americans were divided on the question \n     of providing guns and many politicians supported groups that \n     were shipping the weapons. The group that Mr. O'Donnell \n     helped form to oppose the weapon shipments included Democrats \n     like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Senator \n     Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mr. O'Neill and Hugh L. \n     Carey, then the Governor of New York.\n\n[[Page S10247]]\n\n       Mr. O'Donnell was born in Boston and graduated from the \n     Boston Latin School, Brown University and Suffolk Law School. \n     He taught history at a Somerset (Mass.) High School and then \n     took a job with Mayor Kevin H. White of Boston and ran Mr. \n     White's successful re-election campaign.\n       After leaving the Speaker's office, Mr. O'Donnell was \n     president of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic \n     advisory group, and he was a leader in the unsuccessful \n     Democratic Presidential campaign of Michael S.

Democrats\n\n                            (By Beth Daley)\n\n       Kirk O'Donnell, 52, a prominent Washington lawyer who once \n     worked with Boston's most colorful politicians, died Saturday \n     after collapsing while jogging near his Scituate summer home.\n       Known for his morality as much as his dedication to the \n     Democratic cause, Mr. O'Donnell entered the political world \n     after a brief stint as a history teacher to work on former \n     mayor Kevin H. White's failed 1970 gubernatorial bid.\n       He went on to serve as general counsel to US House Speaker \n     Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr., for eight years and quickly \n     gained the reputation in Washington as a skilled strategist \n     and a straight-talker.\n       Although he held key Democratic positions that included \n     White House adviser and former president of the Center for \n     National Policy, Mr. O'Donnell relished quiet time with his \n     family at their summer home in Scituate at least as much as \n     being near the center of power in the nation's capital.\n       ``He was politics at its best,'' said US Representative \n     Barney Frank, who first worked with Mr. O'Donnell during \n     White's gubernatorial bid. ``Talented and principled, he \n     really worked to make the world better and fairer.''\n       Most well-known for his advice, Mr. O'Donnell was a highly \n     sought-after adviser to the Democratic party and served in \n     that role for former Massachusetts governor Michael S. \n     Dukakis's failed presidential campaign in 1988.\n       President Clinton said yesterday Mr. O'Donnell ``was a \n     gentleman and patriot who brought wit, common sense, and a \n     genuine humanity to his public work and private life. He was \n     a very good man and left us much too soon.''\n       The son of a Dorchester investment adviser and a homemaker, \n     Mr. O'Donnell attended Boston Latin School and graduated in \n     1964 with a passion for history and football. At Boston \n     Latin, he remains in the Sports Hall of Fame for his football \n     exploits.\n       After graduating from Brown University, where he also \n     played football, he was a history teacher at Somerset High \n     School.\n       With the 1970 governor's race sparking a lifelong interest \n     in politics and law, Mr. O'Donnell taught while he attended \n     Suffolk Law School, graduating in 1975. When then-mayor White \n     pledged to bring City Hall to the neighborhoods--literally--\n     Mr. O'Donnell was hired to run the Fields Corner Little City \n     Hall and worked from a trailer parked beside Town Field. \n     There he helped residents navigate the downtown City Hall \n     bureaucracy while studying politics and human nature at close \n     quarters.\n       Years later, while serving as one of the top strategists \n     for the Democratic leadership of the US House, he said, ``If \n     you can understand Fields Corner, you can understand \n     Congress.''\n       In 1975, he set up one of the first computerized voting \n     lists for the White campaign. On the day of the election, in \n     a Boylston Street office building, he checked every polling \n     place in the 22 wards to see how light or heavy the turnout \n     was in pro-White precincts. The White political organization \n     had Chicago-sized ambitions, and Mr. O'Donnell harnessed its \n     resources to provide telephone reminders and transportation \n     to the mayor's supporters.\n       Mr. O'Donnell's encyclopedic knowledge of Boston politics \n     brought him to the attention of Speaker O'Neill after White \n     was re-elected to a third term.\n       Since the mayor had been considered vulnerable, his \n     relatively easy victory prompted a call from O'Neill, who was \n     seeking a new counsel to succeed Charles D. Ferris, the \n     Dorchester native who had just been named by President Carter \n     to head the Federal Communications Commission. The man who \n     popularized the phrase ``All politics is local'' wanted \n     someone at his side who knew the similarity between Fields \n     Corner and Congress.\n       At first, Mr. O'Donnell was reluctant. He had left City \n     Hall to start a law practice with his friend, Robert Holland. \n     But the fabled O'Neill charm suggested to him brighter vistas \n     in Washington than in Boston.\n       After the election of President Reagan in 1980, Tip O'Neill \n     became the best-known Democrat in the nation. Mr. O'Donnell's \n     aim was to prepare the House speaker strategically and \n     tactically for dealing with the White House. The president's \n     popularity made difficult the chore of holding House \n     Democrats together.\n       Mr. O'Donnell, a gregarious man with a booming voice, spoke \n     in a straightforward manner to House members, with the same \n     determination as he did while dealing with the foot soldiers \n     of the Kevin White organization.\n       After O'Neill retied, Mr. O'Donnell worked as head of a \n     Washington think tank, the Center for National Policy, aimed \n     at reviving the Democratic party. In conferences and \n     seminars, he sought to focus the intellectual energy of a \n     party that had consistently lost presidential elections while \n     continuing its domination of Congress.\n       After he left the center, he was succeeded as director by \n     Madeleine Albright, now secretary of state. An old Washington \n     hand and a former chairman of the Democratic National \n     Committee, Robert S. Strauss, recruited Mr. O'Donnell to his \n     Washington law firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld. As a \n     senior partner, Mr. O'Donnell represented a variety of \n     clients, from Liberty Mutual to the government of Puerto \n     Rico.\n       One lasting friendship that came from his legal work was \n     with a partner of Salomon Brothers, now Salomon Smith Barney. \n     After Robert Rubin, now secretary of the treasury, asked Mr. \n     O'Donnell for political advice in Washington, a close \n     friendship developed. He also advised another Cabinet member, \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Andrew Cuomo.\n       Mr. O'Donnell leaves his wife of 26 years, Kathryn Holland \n     O'Donnell, and two children, Holly of Washington, D.C., and \n     Brendan of Scituate.\n       A funeral Mass will be said at 11 a.m. Thursday in Holy \n     Name Church in West Roxbury.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10245-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO RITCH K.

Captain Eich retires in September \nafter 30 years as a reservist, the last three of which he spent on \nactive duty, representing the Navy in the Office of the Adjutant \nGeneral of the Indiana National Guard.\n  Ritch Eich has been a valued member of the Indiana team since 1989, \nwhen he started work for me as a member of my Service Academy Selection \nCommittee, screening and recommending promising Hoosier high school \nstudents as candidates for our nation's Service Academies. Three years \nago, he took on the additional responsibility of serving as the U.S. \nNavy's Liaison Officer for the State of Indiana, working in the office \nof Indiana's Adjutant General. During that time, Ritch made substantial \ncontributions to readiness planning in Indiana. He completed Disaster \nPreparedness Operations Plans for Indiana Naval, Marine Corps and Coast \nGuard facilities, and ensured a close working relationship between the \nIndiana National Guard and the State Emergency Management Office.\n  Ritch Eich's civilian job during this period was as the chief \nmarketing, public affairs and physician relations officer for Indiana \nUniversity Medical Center, where--over the course of a decade--he has \nhelped to build a vibrant and effective health care environment for \nHoosiers. According to one health care executive, Ritch had helped \n``define our vision, map our strategies, deliver on our promises and \nguide our affiliations.'' And for Rich, ``helping Hoosiers access the \nbest healthcare in the mid-west'' was what it was all about.\n  In all his endeavors, Ritch Eich has demonstrated a skill and \ndedication that reflect great credit upon himself, the State of Indiana \nand the United States Navy. I feel privileged to offer this tribute to \nRitch on the occasion of his retirement from the Naval Reserves. We \nwish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10247-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10247-S10248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EMMY AWARDS\n\n   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ngolden anniversary of the Emmy Awards telecast from Los Angeles. For \nfifty years, hundreds of the nation's brightest and most popular \npersonalities have attended this prestigious event to honor television \nexcellence.\n  Beyond the captivating glow of the Hollywood spotlight, the yearly \nawards presentation is a celebration of California's thriving \nentertainment industry. Television arts and production contribute \nbillions of dollars to the California economy, generating rapid job \ngrowth,\n\n[[Page S10248]]\n\nhigher income, and greater tax revenues. Entertainment's significant \nfinancial impact can be attributed to the rising television and \ncommercial production within the state. Recent studies confirm that \npayrolls and payments for goods and services within the entertainment \nindustry currently contribute over $27 billion to California's economy. \nThe Emmy Awards confer annual awards of merit to creative arts people \nin the television industry, as incentive to continue supporting the \neconomic growth in California.\n  Now celebrating its fiftieth anniversary, the Emmy Awards was not \nalways so celebrated and grand. The first awards banquet in 1949 was \nheld at the old Hollywood Athletic Club, with tickets costing a mere \nfive dollars. With few stars in attendance, the program was not even \ntelevised nationally. The ceremony was broadcast on local station KTSL \nbeginning at 9:30 p.m. Despite the American public's unfamiliarity with \nthe obscure, new medium, Los Angeles Mayor Fletcher Brown declared the \nday of the first telecast TV Day on January 25, 1949.\n  Sponsor of the annual awards program, the National Academy of \nTelevision Arts and Sciences has a long and venerated history. Since \nits early days, membership to the National Academy of Television Arts \nand Sciences has flourished to more than 9,000, making it the single \nlargest television professional association in the world. The Academy \nnot only presents the Emmy Awards, but also hosts a program for college \neducators and has underwritten the Archive of American Television in an \neffort to preserve television's rich and detailed past.\n  As the Emmy's golden anniversary approaches, let us pay tribute to \nthe award show's support of the entertainment industry and recognition \nof quality television programming. With 50 years of telecasts to its \ncredit, the Emmy's have become a genuine part of American \nhistory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10247-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO ZACHARY FISHER, THE 1998 PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM \n                               RECIPIENT\n\n   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Zachary \nFisher, who on Monday, September 14, 1998 will be presented the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton at the Waldorf \nAstoria Hotel in New York City.\n  The medal, which is the highest honor given to civilians by the \nPresident, is awarded annually to individuals who have made outstanding \ncontributions to the security or national interest of the United States \nor to world peace, or those who have made a significant public or \nprivate accomplishment.\n  Zach and his wife, Elizabeth, have always felt strongly about the \nyoung men and women who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. During WW II \nElizabeth served in the USO, entertaining thousands of troops while \nthey were away from home. Zach, unable to serve because of a leg injury \nsustained in a construction accident, assisted the U.S. Coast Guard in \nthe construction of coastal defenses.\n  Although still active in his family's construction company, Fisher \nBrothers, he has devoted his time and energy to his country and \nbettering the lives of Americans. In 1978 he founded the Intrepid \nMuseum Foundation, in an effort to save the historic and battle-scarred \naircraft carrier Intrepid from scrapping. Through his efforts the \nvessel became the foundation of the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum, \nwhich opened in New York City in 1982.\n  Through the Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Armed Services Foundation, \nZach has pledged to do all he can in support of our nation's military \nand their families, and to offer new opportunities to our children, \nsuch as through the educational programs at Intrepid, and as part of \nthe Fisher House Program, to build homes for families of hospitalized \nmilitary personnel.\n  His newest effort is the Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research \nFoundation, founded in 1995 to fund research in, and work towards a \ncure for Alzheimer's disease. In partnership with David Rockefeller, \nChairman of the Board of The Rockefeller University in New York, a new \nresearch center has been founded to help develop a cure for this \ndebilitating disease.\n  Zach is also involved in many other charitable causes, including the \nMarine Corps Scholarship Foundation, the Coast Guard Foundation, the \nNavy League, the Jewish Institute of National Security Affairs, the \nGeorge C. Marshall Foundation, the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, the \nReagan Presidential Library, the United Jewish Appeal, and many other \norganizations.\n  In addition to this year's Presidential Citizens' Medal, Zach has \nreceived the 1995 Presidential Citizens Medal, presented by President \nClinton, and the Volunteer Action Award, presented by President Ronald \nReagan.\n  Zachary Fisher truly exemplifies what it means to be a patriotic \nAmerican, and continues to strengthen our Nation and improve the lives \nof many Americans. Mr. President, I ask that you join me and our \ncolleagues in recognizing and honoring Zachary Fisher on many years of \nworth-while work and achievements which have culminated with the honor \nof receiving the 1998 Presidential Medal of Freedom. Zach Fisher is \ntruly a remarkable man and a first-rate American deserving of such an \nhonor.\n\n\n                          FARM CRISIS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader will \nentertain an inquiry.\n  At the conclusion of Senator Byrd's presentation, it is my intention \nto speak for a few moments on the agriculture crisis, and I would just \nlike to inquire of the majority leader, who I know was supportive in \nJuly as we moved a $500 million indemnity piece out of the Senate \ndealing with the farm crisis, I would like to ask the majority leader \nif he has some interest and some intention of allowing us to work on a \nfarm crisis package during the month of September.\n  The reason I ask the question, I know that the Senator from \nMississippi, the majority leader, is trying to fit a lot of things into \na very short window here, but I think he knows that Members on this \nside and the other side coming from farm country are having to deal \nwith an enormously difficult farm crisis. We hope very much that that \nwill become part of the agenda in the month of September. I would just \ninquire of the Senator as to his intentions.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator that I am \naware of the difficulties in the farm community in a number of States \nbecause of weather problems but also because of a number of problems \ninvolving falling prices and trade problems. It would be my intent that \nwe act in that area before we go out at the end of this session.\n  I think it is important that we start on it quickly, in a bipartisan \nway. I am going to be working on that early next week.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that is welcome news. I appreciate the \ncooperation of the majority leader. We obviously are facing collapsed \nfarm prices and as tough a time in farm country as we have ever seen. I \nappreciate the response of the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10248-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10248-S10250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE SYSTEM VOLUNTEER AND PARTNERSHIP ENHANCEMENT \n                              ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering H.R. 1856, a bipartisan bill that has tremendous potential \nto improve management and operations of the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem by supplementing scarce Federal dollars with outside services \nand donations by local groups and individuals.\n  As budgets continue to shrink, the Federal Government must look for \nalternative sources of funding and assistance. Volunteers have helped \nthe Refuge System since volunteer wardens staffed the very first refuge \non Pelican Island, Florida in 1903. Since 1982, when the Fish and \nWildlife Service (FWS) established a formal volunteer program, the \nprogram has grown from 4,251 volunteers donating 128,400 hours of time \nto 28,800 volunteers donating more than 1.5 million hours in 1997. This \n1997 figure represents almost 20 percent of all work done by the FWS on \nthe Refuge System, amounting to about $14 million worth of services, at \na support cost of $780,000.\n  The five refuges in my own state of Rhode Island, which are managed \nas a single complex, provide a wonderful illustration of how important \nthese efforts are. With only five full-time employees working among the \nfive Rhode Island refuges, volunteers contributed more than one-third \nof all work performed on these refuges. At several of our refuges, the \ntypical visitor will interact with only volunteer staff.\n  The ``National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteer and Community \nPartnership Enhancement Act'' lends much needed support to the efforts \nof the Service to maintain and operate the Refuge System. Specifically, \nit establishes pilot projects for the Service to hire volunteer \ncoordinators; it also authorizes the creation of a Senior Volunteer \nCorps, which is expected to be part of the Service's existing volunteer \nprogram, and for which the Secretary should explore coordination with \nNational Senior Service Corps programs operated by the Corporation for \nthe National Service. In addition to encouraging volunteer efforts \nwithin the System, the bill encourages financial contributions, \ncommunity partnership initiatives, and educational programs to benefit \nthe System.\n  H.R. 1856 was introduced by Congressman Saxton on June 10, 1997, and \nsubsequently passed by the House. On June 26, 1998, I introduced a \nsimilar bill, S. 2244, within 14 cosponsors. The Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works amended the House-passed bill to conform \nwith S. 2244, and I now ask that the Senate take up H.R. 1856 as \namended. I have been pleased to work with Congressman Saxton on this \nwonderful initiative, and I urge expeditious approval by both the \nSenate and House, as well as by the President.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the committee substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, the amendment to the title be agreed to, and that \nany statements relating to the bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3578) was agreed to.\n  The substitute amendment, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1856) was considered read the third time and passed.\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``An Act to amend the Fish and \nWildlife Act of 1956 to promote volunteer programs and community \npartnerships for the benefit of national wildlife refuges, and for \nother purposes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10248-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10250-S10252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FISH AND WILDLIFE REVENUE ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 4, strike ``plants'' and insert ``plant''.\n       On page 4, line 6, strike the quotation marks and the \n     following period.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 2094, the Fish and Wildlife Revenue Enhancement Act, a \nbill introduced by my colleague Senator Allard and cosponsored by me. \nThis bill represents a move towards efficient use of government funds, \nand support for the valuable programs carried out by the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service with those scarce funds.\n  Each year, the Service receives thousands of items derived from fish, \nwildlife and plants, such as boots, purses and wallets, made from furs \nand skins. These items can be forfeited or abandoned during enforcement \nof Federal wildlife laws, and they are eventually shipped to the \nNational Wildlife Property Repository in Colorado. The Repository \ncurrently has about 450,000 items, of which 200,000 can be legally \nsold.\n  However, under current law, revenue from the sale of forfeited items \ngo to the Service for certain program operations, while revenue from \nthe sale of abandoned items go to the General Treasury. More than 90 \npercent of the fish and wildlife items are abandoned, so that the \nService would receive very little revenue from sales of items in its \nRepository.\n  The Repository was appropriated $310,000 for operations last year. \nAfter overhead and operations, only $30,000 was available for carrying \nout the programs that loan these items to schools, universities, \nmuseums, zoos for educational purposes, and to Native American groups \nfor religious and ceremonial purposes.\n  The bill would initially generate approximately $1 million for the \nService through the sale of items derived from fish and wildlife that \nare currently stored by the Service. This money would be used to cover \nthe costs of storing and disposing of these items--which is now a \nfinancial drain on the Service--and to fund the worthwhile programs \nbenefiting education, research and Native American religious and \nceremonial purposes.\n  I would like to note that this bill does not change existing \nauthority with respect to items that may be sold by the Service. \nIndeed, it clarifies that other laws prohibiting the sale of fish, \nplants or wildlife equally apply to this law. Specifically, current law \nprohibits the sale of items derived from threatened and endangered \nspecies, marine mammals, and migratory birds.\n  In summary, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill with Senator Allard, \nand urge the Senate and House to approve it expeditiously.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to say a few quick words in \nsupport of S. 2094, the Fish and Wildlife Service Revenue Enhancement \nAct.\n  I have toured the Repository in the Rocky Mountain Arsenal. I was \nimpressed by the instructional programs the Fish and Wildlife Service \nruns from that facility. It is obvious that the Repository serves a \nvital educational role. The Service is trying to utilize their \nresources to educate and inform the public about wildlife and wildlife \ntrade. The passage of this bill will allow them to put to good use \nassets that are now just wasting away, and to further their scholastic \ngoals.\n  Another important reason for passage of this bill is that it benefits \nthe National Eagle Repository. They support the cultural and religious \nactivities of Native Americans. We all know how important Raptores such \nas Bald and Golden Eagles are to the various tribes. The Service goes \nto great lengths to match the thousands of requests they receive from \nNative Americans for these rare birds. Any assistance that we can give \nthem which will improve that already excellent operation will be a \ncredit to the Congress.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Chafee, Ranking Member Baucus, and \ntheir staff for their assistance on this bill. Several improvements \nwere made during the committee process, and I believe the bill is the \nbest possible solution to the funding and allocation problem currently \nfacing the Repository.\n  I would urge my current colleagues to support the passage of this \nbill, and I hope my former colleagues in the House will take up this \nmatter and pass it soon after they return next week. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the bill be considered read the third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3579) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2094) was considered read the third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2094\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 11 a.m. on \nMonday, September 14. I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on \nMonday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through \nthe morning hour be granted and the time until 1 p.m. be equally \ndivided for debate relating to the motion to proceed to S. 1981, the \nTruth In Employment Act, with the time divided between Senator \nHutchinson and Senator Kennedy or his designee.\n  I further ask consent that at 1 p.m. the Senate resume consideration \nof the Interior appropriations bill. And I want to emphasize at this \npoint that it would be my intent, the early part of next week, to be on \nthe Interior appropriations bill Monday afternoon, Tuesday, Wednesday--\nuntil we complete action. I know there have been other issues that have \nnecessarily been offered this week on the Interior bill, and cloture \nvotes, but I think next week it is important that we do get a focus on \nthe Interior appropriations and complete action on that so that we can \ngo to the remaining two appropriations bills.\n  I further ask consent that at 5 p.m. there be 30 minutes of debate \nequally divided, again related to S. 1981, with the vote occurring on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1981 at \n5:30 p.m. on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, but there is some phraseology in the majority leader's \nrequest that I wish to inquire about. And I have noted the same \nphraseology in the requests from time to time lately, but at this \nmoment, since we are both on the floor, I will ask the question.\n  What does the majority leader mean when, in his request, he uses \nthese words, ``the routine requests through the morning hour be \ngranted''? What does that mean?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, that would mean that the \nroutine business such as the reading of the Journal, things of that \nnature, would be deemed to have expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will not object on this occasion, but I \nthink--I am not trying to create any problems for the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Sure.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have been in that position and I know I never liked other \nMembers to create problems for me--but they did, often.\n  That phraseology includes several items, especially for a Monday.\n  Mr. LOTT. It does.\n  Mr. BYRD. So I would like, in the future, if the distinguished \nmajority leader would find it appropriate and agreeable to do so, that \nthat particular verbiage be a little clearer, as to just exactly what \nis meant.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe in the past, if I might respond to the Senator, \nthat perhaps there had been a longer explanation as to what was \nincluded. Perhaps that is the way the Senator from West Virginia did it \nwhen he was majority leader. I think probably I may have caused this by \nindicating or asking if we couldn't do that in a little shorter \nphraseology. But I will go back and take a look at the best way to say \nthat, so that Members' rights are protected and so that they will \nunderstand what is being asked for there.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. If I may ask the majority leader to yield, and I won't take \nlong, but having been majority leader myself, I know that there are a \nnumber of things involved there, and there may be one particular item \non a particular occasion, and for a particular reason, that Senators \nwould want to have operative according to the usual rules.\n  I urge that we not--Mr. President, that we not speed the operation up \nto the point that Senators' rights may be eclipsed. And I am not \nsuggesting that the majority leader intends that. He has already \nindicated--and I knew what he was doing--he was trying to speed the \noperation up in a way that would be more efficient. But there are \nthings involved in that particular phraseology which might take 30 \nminutes to discuss here if we started to do so.\n  I just hope that the distinguished Senator will have his staff look \nat that language and that we might be able, Senators, to reserve their \nrights while even agreeing to such a request, if the circumstances \nrequired it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, certainly I will review that again. I \nremembered, when we made a modification in the language--and I do have \nit before me here--on February 10, 1997, I did point out what the \nintent was here, the phrase ``the routine requests through the morning \nhour'' are deemed to include the approval of the Journal to date, the \nwaiving of resolutions coming over under the rule, the waiving of the \ncall of the calendar, and the expiration of the morning hour.\n  Because I was aware that this was a change and a shortening of that. \nBut we will take another look at it. We always certainly respect \nSenator Byrd's suggestions and requests, and we will do so.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished leader. It is not \nmy point here to quibble or to find fault with the leader. I appreciate \nthe spirit in which he has accepted this. I can see that someone who \nreally understands these rules, like myself, and I have forgotten \nprobably more than I will ever know again, I just want to protect the \nrights of all Senators, and I know that the leader wishes to do that. \nSo I hope that there is no connotation of what I am saying that appears \nto be sinister. I have no objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10252-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, on July 16, 1997, President Clinton directed \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review its nitrogen oxide \n(NOX) transport standards under the Clean Air Act. \nSubsequently, on November 7, 1997, the EPA announced a proposed ozone \ntransport rule to reduce the regional transport of ground-level ozone \nacross a 22-state region of the eastern United States, and the agency \nis now poised to announce its final ruling on NOX emissions \nand ozone transport. The 22 states that have been targeted by this rule \nare some of the nation's most heavily populated, and include a large \nconcentration of major industries, utilities, and automobiles.\n  Based on past experience, it is not surprising that the Environmental \nProtection Agency has, once again, decided to pursue a heavy-handed and \narbitrary approach toward its regulation of NOX emissions. \nWhile the EPA argues that its recommendations reflect the cooperative \nwork of 37 states through the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) \nprocess, OTAG actually recommended a range of options to be considered \non a state-by-state basis. The EPA, in its proposed rule, has chosen \nthe most extreme of those recommendations--an 85% reduction in \nNOX emissions within the 22-state region. Far from being a \nflexible, tailored reduction for individual states based on their own \ncontributions to the problem of ozone and air quality, this is a \ndraconian, one-size-fits-all, command-and-control approach and does not \ntake into account regional differences. I am concerned that this plan, \nwhich is apparently based on insufficient scientific information, poses \npotentially substantial harm to the economies of the affected states \nwithout delivering on the substantial environmental benefits it claims.\n  A key concern with the EPA's recommendation is that it is based on \nmodeling results that are inconsistent with modeling conducted by OTAG. \nThe EPA has made a finding that Midwest and Appalachian states \nsignificantly contribute to nonattainment in the downwind states. The \nOTAG modeling actually concluded that the air-borne transport of ozone \nis only a major concern within a radius of 150 miles of the emission \nsource. Using the OTAG results, emissions of nitrogen oxide from the \nMidwest and Ohio Valley simply do not affect ozone levels in the \nNortheast at a significant level, and the suggestion that emissions \nfrom the Mississippi area affect the eastern seaboard is even more \nunjustified by the empirical evidence. The OTAG modeling indicates that \nthe greatest contributions to the ozone problem in the Northeast are \nemissions from sources in the Northeast and, particularly, from the \ngrowing numbers of automobiles congesting the roads and filling the air \nwith their fumes. As my colleague, the senior Senator from Rhode Island \nand Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in an \nApril 16, 1997, letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, ``Contrary \nto a public belief too readily accepted without any evidentiary \nfoundation, our problem does not come primarily from distant \nsmokestacks in the Ohio River Valley.''\n  Recommendations based on OTAG's modeling ranged from targeted \nreductions only in specified non-attainment locations to the EPA's \nextreme choice of an 85% reduction across the board in all states. If \nthe EPA forces the so-called ``upwind'' states like West Virginia, \nOhio, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia to reduce their emissions by \nthe recommended 85%, the effect will be economically harmful, yet will \ndo little in the long run to reduce the Northeast's ozone problem or \nimprove its overall air quality. This recommendation is neither \nequitable nor cost-effective.\n  The consequences of the EPA's decision for the Midwest and \nAppalachian states will be severe. For example, my own state of West \nVirginia is currently in compliance for ozone. West Virginians are \nproud of this record and are working hard to maintain a clean \nenvironment. Unfortunately, however, despite this commendable record of \ncompliance, the EPA is proposing that West Virginia reduce its \nNOX emissions by a whopping 44%. This is a huge overnight \nshift in policy--from compliance to gross under-compliance in the \ntwinkle of an eye--which would force significant, costly changes to \nindustries and utilities in my state, but for what purpose? For what \npurpose?\n  Mr. President, studies conducted by industry officials estimate that \nit will cost $500 billion for every 10% decrease in NOX \nemissions, costs that will be passed onto consumers. If the EPA's \nproposal is implemented, electricity rates will climb precipitously in \nStates like West Virginia, but this sacrifice reportedly will do little \nto improve air quality in the Northeast. According to a recent study by \nthe Alliance for Clean Air Policy (ACAP), the EPA's 85% reduction will \nrequire an initial investment of $6 billion and an annual compliance \ncost of $1.2 billion by utilities in the 22-State region. Other \nindustry cost estimates are even larger. Businesses and consumers in \nthe Midwestern, Appalachian, and Southeastern States will bear the bulk \nof these costs. Electric power utilities will be forced to install \nselective catalytic reduction equipment on a large number of existing \nplants, but there is little experience in the United States with the \nuse of this type of technology. What we do know is that selective \ncatalytic reduction, SCR, technology is extremely costly and will \nrequire difficult retrofitting for many powerplants over a period of \nseveral years in order to meet the EPA's recommended reductions. By all \nappearances, the emissions reductions mandated by the EPA in the \nMidwestern and Appalachian region are unjustified and they are unfair.\n  We sometimes forget that, too often, bureaucratic rules have major \nimpacts on a personal level. Electricity rates in West Virginia and the \nMidwest are considerably lower than those of the Northeast. If the EPA \nissues its rule forcing States to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by \n85%, Midwest and Appalachian utility rates will rise significantly. \nMeanwhile, as much of the United States is enjoying the benefits of a \nstrong economy, the Appalachian region is still struggling to pull \nitself, in some areas, out of poverty. In recent years, West Virginia \nhas aggressively sought out and won new business opportunities.\n  Toyota is making a very important announcement even today, within the \nnext hour, of additional plans that it has for its plant in Putnam \nCounty, WV.\n  West Virginians who previously had to leave the State for career \nopportunities are now able to come back home to well-paying jobs that \ncan comfortably support their families. If this stiff new rule goes \ninto effect, families in West Virginia will find it harder to pay their \nelectric bills; retirees on small pensions will face choices that could \nthreaten their health and well-being; and companies, facing narrower \nprofit margins, may consider moving their operations elsewhere because \nthey would no longer receive the benefits of low-cost electricity. \nFurther, communities that have invested in new infrastructure and have \nstrained to help grow new and existing businesses could see their \neconomic base dwindle. I am weary of regulations that lead to \nunnecessary economic dislocation. I want to be sure that the citizens \nof Appalachia can afford to heat and light their homes, and that they \ncan receive reliable, consistent service from their utilities. I also \nwant to be sure that each State recognizes and takes responsibility for \nits own air quality standards. But, I do not believe that a few States \nshould have to shoulder the economic burdens for the EPA's hypothetical \nair quality improvements.\n\n[[Page S10254]]\n\n  Certainly, there are better, more scientifically and economically \nsound alternatives to the severe rule proposed by the EPA. A number of \nalternative proposals have been submitted that are projected to reduce \nNOX emissions and at the same time meet the attainment of \nthe new 8-hour ozone standard in many states earlier than currently \nscheduled. In fact, 13 Governors have submitted alternative strategies \nfor addressing this important issue. These alternative proposals \ninclude one by a group of six Governors, led by West Virginia Governor \nCecil Underwood, who have submitted a very comprehensive proposal. \nOther similar alternative proposals have been submitted individually by \nthe Governors of Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, North Carolina, \nSouth Carolina, and Wisconsin. These alternative plans share the same \ncore elements and represent aggressive steps to achieve a significant \nreduction in NOX emissions.\n  The alternative recommendation put forth by the aforementioned \ncoalition of six Governors representing West Virginia, Michigan, Ohio, \nTennessee, Alabama, and Virginia is a very comprehensive proposal. The \nfirst phase recommends a 55 percent reduction of NOX \nemissions by April 2002, followed by a 65 percent reduction in \nNOX emissions by April 2004. This alternative would also \nrequire significant reductions from other large non-utility sources by \nApril 2003. By contrast, the EPA proposed an overall 85 percent \nreduction from major utility sources, 70 percent from major industries, \nand 50 percent from small industries by May 2003--a target few \ncompanies anticipate meeting without substantial costs. The EPA's \ncompliance schedule also may threaten the reliability of electrical \nsupplies in these and adjacent States.\n  In the second phase, the coalition plan calls for assessing the \nreductions that will be necessary to meet the new EPA-mandated 8-hour \nozone standard by 2009--3 years ahead of the EPA's schedule of 2010-\n2012. As proposed, the assessment will be completed by 2001, the \ncontrol requirements established by 2003, and additional controls in \nplace in a reasonable period by 2007.\n  I support initiatives like those put forth by the 13 Governors. They \ndemonstrate a spirit of cooperation and have numerous advantages. A \nphased approach would avoid disruption in the reliability of \nelectricity services and would achieve substantial cost savings for \nbusinesses and consumers. In recognition of the limited impact of long-\ndistance ozone transport, NOX controls for achieving the 8-\nhour emission standard should be tailored at the local, State, and \nregional levels. The phased approach builds upon the OTAG \nrecommendations for addressing regional transport concerns and would \nencourage allowance trading as a compliance tool. Finally, a phased \napproach would be consistent with the Clean Air Act requirements and \nwould allow States to take the lead in developing technically sound \nstrategies for attaining the 8-hour ozone standard.\n  Clearly, alternative proposals exist that are achievable and that \nwould provide cleaner air for millions of Americans sooner than would \nbe provided in the Clean Air Act, without the adverse economic \nconsequences that appear inevitable as a result of the EPA's proposal. \nMoreover, these types of alternative approaches are consistent with the \nJuly 1997 Presidential Directive calling for a flexible, common-sense \napproach to address this important and complex issue.\n  The Governors have worked to craft reasonable, science-based, \nbalanced, and cost-effective proposals. I hope that the White House \nwill recognize the spirit of cooperation and commitment that these \nGovernors have made to air quality standards that address both the \nenvironmental and the economic interests of their States and \nsurrounding States.\n  I also hope that these alternative proposals are given serious \nconsideration before any final action is taken to issue a new rule. Let \nus not get in too big a hurry here. If a compromise is not reached \nregarding this very important matter, I am concerned that it will be \ntied up in the courts and thus prevent the States from taking the \nactions to which they have committed themselves, while also delaying a \nreal, beneficial reduction of nitrogen oxide. Mr. President, I urge the \nadministration to work with the Governors to reach an environmentally \nand economically sound and common-sense solution that is in the \ninterest of our Nation as a whole.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10253-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10254-S10255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LET'S RESPECT OUR CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Nation is awaiting the public release of \nthe Starr report. The rhetoric concerning the President's future has \nbecome superheated, and is nearing the point of spontaneous \ncombustion--and no one has even had a chance to read, let alone reflect \nupon, all 445 pages of that report. It will be all too easy for \nindividual pages and charges to be pulled out and waved around to fan \nthese flames, but that does an injustice to the dignity and stature of \nthis Nation. So I would like to pour a little cold water on these \nflames, and to urge everyone--all of us--to cool it.\n  The world was not created in a day. And we cannot rush that clock on \nthe wall, as much as some of us might like to do. The clock will take \nits time. And time will move no faster, no slower than it moved in the \ndays of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.\n  With the receipt of this report, a very grave constitutional process \nhas begun. I want to emphasize that. Let me say it again. With the \nreceipt of this report, a very grave constitutional process has begun. \nAnd we need to respect that process and all that it may mean for the \nNation now and into the future. I would like to outline that process, \nwhich is covered in its entirety in just a few brief passages of the \nConstitution. And they are to be found on page 59 of my book on the \nSenate. Of course, they can be found in the Constitution itself.\n\n  Article I, section 2, clause 5:\n\n       The House of Representatives . . . shall have the sole \n     Power of Impeachment.\n\n  Article I, section 3, clause 6:\n\n       The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all \n     Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on \n     Oath of Affirmation. When the President of the United States \n     is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person \n     shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of \n     the Members present.\n\n  Article I, section 3, clause 7:\n\n       Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further \n     than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and \n     enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or Profit under the United \n     States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable \n     and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, \n     according to Law.\n\n  Article II, section 2, clause 1:\n\n       The President shall. . .have Power to grant Reprieves and \n     Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in \n     Cases of Impeachment.\n\n  Article II, section 4:\n\n       The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the \n     United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors.\n\n  Article III, section 2, clause 3:\n\n       The trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, \n     shall be by Jury. . . .\n\n  Now, Mr. President, my colleagues are all well aware of the very \ndifficult path we may be starting down now that the Starr report has \nbeen received. The House will take the first hard steps, and the Senate \nmay--I say, may--have to follow. If we hope to restore the confidence \nof the Nation in their Government, and in the Congress in particular, \nMembers must be allowed to carry out their task free from the kind of \nhype and speculation and inflammatory commentary that is swirling all \naround us. I say this as much to the public, perhaps even more so, and \nthe media, as I do to my colleagues. Give us the time and the elbowroom \nto live up to our solemn constitutional obligation to the Nation.\n\n  We, in the Senate, of course, do not know at this point whether there \nwill be any impeachment of the President by the House of \nRepresentatives. That remains in the hands of the other body. That is \nnot in our hands. Only if and when the House were to formulate and \napprove articles of impeachment would any articles then come to the \nSenate. The Senate would then, and only then, under the Constitution, \nbe called upon to make its judgment, up or down, without amendment, on \neach article.\n\n[[Page S10255]]\n\n  This is a very solemn matter and this Senator will not be influenced \nby the hype. I shall do my very best if that time comes--and it may \nnever come, it may never come--but if it were to, I would do my very \nbest to render a fair judgment, not only to the person impeached but \nalso to the Nation, to the people, always keeping in mind the solemnity \nof the occasion and the kinds of precedents and standards that we, \nourselves, would be setting for all of the generations to come. It is \nnot going to be a matter to be decided tomorrow or next week or the \nnext 2 weeks or the next 3 weeks in this Chamber. The other House will \nact as it sees fit, based upon the evidence in the report. We would be \nsitting as jurors if and when articles of impeachment were ever sent to \nus by the other body.\n  It is a constitutional process. Let's keep that in mind. We must be \ntrue to the Constitution, and true to the Nation. We must be fair, and \nwe must be seen as having been fair.\n  Let me, in closing, read the oath which each Senator would be \nrequired to take in the event--and I emphasize, in the event--that the \nSenate were ever faced with an impeachment trial. The public should \nknow that this is the oath to which each Senator must subscribe.\n  Here is the oath. It is on page 61 of the document titled, \n``Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials in the United States \nSenate,'' revised edition, prepared pursuant to Senate Resolution 439, \n99th Congress, 2d Session, submitted by Senator Robert C. Byrd and \nSenator Robert Dole, by Floyd M. Riddick, Parliamentarian Emeritus of \nthe U.S. Senate and Robert B. Dove, Parliamentarian of the United \nStates Senate, August 15, 1986.\n\n       The form of oath administered to each Senator, as set forth \n     under Rule XXV, is as follows:\n       I solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that in \n     all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of \n     [blank], now pending, I will do impartial justice according \n     to the Constitution and laws: So help me God.\n\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 39 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have some remarks concerning Grandparent's \nDay. I ask unanimous consent I may proceed for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I see no other Senators seeking recognition at the moment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10254-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10255-S10256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CELEBRATING GRANDPARENT'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this Sunday is Grandparent's Day. Like \nMother's Day, this holiday has its origins in the great State of West \nVirginia. The Presiding Officer at the moment is from Ohio, a \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio. He is a neighbor. His State is a \nneighbor of ours. This holiday began in West Virginia.\n  In 1956, a lifelong mountaineer and the wife of a coal miner, Mrs. \nMarian McQuade, was asked to assist in organizing a ``Past 80 Party.'' \nI would qualify for that party if it were held today. Well, this group \ncontinues today to annually honor and celebrate octogenarians and other \nseniors in West Virginia. Mrs. McQuade began gathering participants to \njoin in these festivities by contacting nursing homes. She learned of \nthe chronic loneliness that many of the seniors in these homes \nexperienced, and she was deeply saddened. Her heartfelt concern \nengendered the idea of a special day, a specific day to celebrate \ngrandparents.\n  In May 1973, West Virginia became the first State with a specially \ndesignated Grandparent's Day. Five years later, Mrs. McQuade received a \nphone call from the White House. This call informed her that President \nCarter had signed a law that designated the first Sunday after Labor \nDay as National Grandparent's Day. The holiday was shifted to the fall \nfor symbolic reasons, as Grandparent's Day celebrates those in the \nautumn--ah, the autumn--of their lives. The first official national \nobservance of this holiday occurred in September 1979--autumn, when the \nleaves are turning from green to gold to red and to brown.\n  The statute creating Grandparent's Day states that the purpose of \nGrandparent's Day is ``to honor grandparents, to give grandparents an \nopportunity to show love for their children's children, and to help \nchildren become aware of [the] strength, information, and guidance \n[that] older people can offer.'' This is a day to celebrate sharing \nbetween the generations. It is a day for the older and younger \ngenerations to commune with one another. It is, above all, a day to \ncelebrate the family.\n  All too often in our increasingly fast-paced world, we fail to \nreflect. Perhaps on this Grandparent's Day we can enjoy the leisure of \nreminiscing on earlier days and, in so doing, opening a dialog between \nthe generations. Such a confabulation benefits all who participate.\n  Sharing time with grandchildren provides the grandparent not only \nwith longed-for companionship, but also may inspire great personal joy \nand a renewed liveliness. The young are like a rejuvenating elixir, \nrestoring a youthful spring in one's step. The young possess a certain \ncharm, reminding us of what it feels like to be young again, and \nthrough them the spirit is enlivened. The aged may even see in the \nyounger generation certain reminders of their own early ambitions, and \nforesee the potential that these sprouts have to take root and grow. \nAnd when these seedlings begin to bloom, finding their own success, \nthere is no greater pride than that of the grandparent who encouraged, \nwho listened, and who applauded along the way. And the majority leader \nwill see this one day, as he recently had a grandchild come into his \nfamily.\n  While grandparents' steps are enlivened by spending time with their \ngrandchildren, the children learn upon which path these steps ought to \nbe taken. Children, although they may, at times, view their elders as \nantediluvian and inveterate, will sit enraptured as they listen to \nstories recounted by their parents' parents. I remember how they used \nto sit around me when I played the fiddle. Oh, to live those days over \nagain!\n  The young will often, perhaps strangely, volunteer to assist with \notherwise tedious chores to be by the side of grandparents. From the \ntales told and the time spent tending to tasks together, youngsters \nlearn family history, and they ought to listen to it and they ought to \nbe interested in that family history. They learn family history, \ntraditions, and glimpse a wiser perspective of their world. Also, that \nis what many of us older persons need today--a wiser perspective of our \nworld. Narratives and demonstrations of the maxim ``hard work works'' \nhave the power to convey and ingrain the principles of success that are \neternal verities. It is hard to imagine or recall, with our cars, \nmicrowaves, cell phones, and laptops, just how hard our parents and \ngrandparents labored to do things that seem so simple today. We turn up \na thermostat instead of chopping wood. But if one wants to warm himself \ntwice, he only needs to chop his own wood. We hit ``spellcheck'' rather \nthan retyping term papers. When faced with future adversity, growing \nchildren may look back on such nostalgia to carry them through their \nown trying times.\n  I am lucky to share in my grandchildren's lives, I feel the pride of \nbeing a grandparent, and I recall Mrs. McQuade's story. I remember how \nshe found that some seniors were neglected and forlorn, living lives of \nlonely destitution. Who knows, that may come to any one of us in time. \nSadly, for some, this is still the case.\n  Although many of their loved ones may have passed on, other seniors, \nthanks to advances in medicine and to Federal programs that provide a \nsafety net of social services, continue to carry on. Many find ways to \nremain active in their communities, organizing events or sharing their \ntime with others. Some have even taken on the burden of raising their \nchildren's children or acting as surrogate grandparents to those \nchildren who have lost their natural grandparents or who never knew \nthem. Our older Americans have sweated and labored to defend and fight \nfor our Nation, educate our young, mine the fuel to keep our homes \nwarm, and shelter the values which we treasure the most. A greater \nobligation to our venerable matriarchs and patriarchs who have served \nas such wonderful role models to not one, but two, generations is our \nduty.\n\n[[Page S10256]]\n\n  This is why I am proud to add my name as a cosponsor of a bill to \nreauthorize the Older Americans Act. This Act helps to assess the needs \nof seniors and provide services to fill these needs. Funding through \nthis Act provides nutrition, disease prevention, and in-home health \nservice programs for the elderly. The Older Americans Act will also \nprovide for community service employment for senior citizens with low \nincome, so that they may continue to demonstrate the strength of their \nwork ethic. Furthermore, the Act will allow state and local aging \nagencies to operate as advocates to promote the rights of older \npersons. As more and more Americans enter the older generation, it is \ncritical that the mechanisms which have provided assistance continue to \nbe able to lend support. We must not forget the lessons which these men \nand women have passed on to us and to our children. To do so would be \nto debase their contribution to the prosperity of our own posterity. \nThe generous contributions our seniors have made will continue to \npropagate long after the grandchildren of today leave this world. \nRemembering our older Americans, and the importance of their influence \non many young, fresh lives, is perhaps the most apt offering we can \nbestow as we celebrate Grandparents' Day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. In doing so, may I thank my friend \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, for his patience, and all others on \nwhose time I have transgressed.\n  I thank him also for his contributions to the work of the Nation, for \nhis knowledge, for his clearheadedness, for his evenhandedness, and for \nthe inspiration that he gives to me and all of my colleagues.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his kind words. He always contributes immensely to this \nSenate when he rises and speaks to the Senate and to the American \npeople. I am enormously proud to serve with Senator Byrd, as I have \nindicated on previous occasions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10255-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10256-S10258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk briefly \nabout a couple of issues that are of critical importance to the \ncountry, and especially to that part of America that I come from--North \nDakota, the farm belt. It is an important part of our country. Our \ncountry is made up of many parts--of cities, of country, of family \nfarms, of main streets, and small businesses. But we are going through \na very, very tough time in rural America.\n  I asked the majority leader some moments ago on the floor of the \nSenate about the ability to deal with this farm crisis through some \naction by this Congress before we adjourn. I was impressed that he \nindicated that it is his intention for us to take up legislation to \naddress this farm crisis once again as we did in the month of July. It \nis an urgent situation.\n  The future of many family farms and the future of many families \nliving out in rural America depends on this Congress stepping up and \nmaking the kind of decisions that will give them the opportunity to \nmake a decent living on the family farm.\n  When I talk about my part of the country, or our part of the country, \nI am reminded of something that Daniel Webster said. He was one of the \ngiants of this institution. In fact, his portrait is on the wall out \nhere in the reception room of the U.S. Senate. He is recognized as a \ngiant in the history of this body. When Thomas Jefferson made the \nLouisiana Purchase, which was fairly controversial at the time, let me \nread to you what Daniel Webster said. Remember; this a part of the \ncountry that I come from. About that Louisiana Purchase, Daniel Webster \nsaid:\n\n       What do we want with this vast, worthless area, this region \n     of savages and wild beasts, of desert and shifting sands and \n     whirlwinds, of dust, cactus, and prairie dogs? What can we \n     ever hope to do with this western coast, a coast of 3,000 \n     miles, rockbound, cheerless, uninviting, and not a harbor on \n     it? What use do we have for this country?\n\n  Daniel Webster is not considered thoughtless because he made this \nstatement. But it is quite clear, I suppose, to all of us now that he \nmissed the mark some.\n  ``What do we want with this vast, worthless area?''\n  Gosh. What a remarkable part of our country that Louisiana Purchase \nbecame.\n  Then a couple of years after Daniel Webster asked this question about \nthat part of America, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to explore \nthat area, and it was one of the great expeditions in the annals of \nAmerican history.\n  Lewis and Clark, on May 14th, 1804, left St. Louis, MO, with 44 men \nand 120 gallons of whiskey, by the way, purchased with government \nvouchers. The President said, ``Buy whatever you need.'' I have made \njokes about the need to purchase 120 gallons of whiskey to get them \nthrough certain States. But I will not repeat those jokes here. I do \nthat only because I think it is interesting to study the history of \nthat Lewis and Clark Expedition. It was a remarkable expedition.\n  In April of 1805--April 7, to be exact--after Lewis and Clark had \ngone from St. Louis up to what is now near Washburn, ND, and spent the \nentire winter with the Mandan Indians, before they began the next \nportion of their journey to the West Coast, April 7, 1805, Captain \nLewis wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson. That letter--a six-page \nletter--was put on a keelboat with some soldiers and sent down the \nMissouri back to St. Louis, then down to New Orleans by boat, then to \nWashington, DC, to Thomas Jefferson. And then we never heard another \nword from Lewis and Clark for 17 months. Then we discovered on the \nconclusion of that remarkable expedition that they had been to the West \nCoast and back. And they told us what they found in this remarkable \ncountry of ours.\n  That letter, by the way, just for interest sake, was never viewed by \nthe public until a couple of months ago. That letter, in a special \neffort by the Library of Congress, is now being viewed publicly at an \nInterpretation Center of Lewis and Clark near Washburn, ND, with all \nproper security, about a mile from where Captain Lewis wrote the letter \nin the year 1805 on April 7. He sent it by keelboat down the Missouri, \nall the way around to President Jefferson, and, of course, it came back \nin by jet airplane nearly 200 years later.\n  I tell you that just to say that this is a wonderful, remarkable \ncountry, and in our part of the country, which is called the farm belt, \na rural area of the country, we are having an enormous amount of \ndifficulty, one that requires this Congress' attention.\n  There are two things that are of great concern to us.\n  The collapse of grain prices means that we see the threatened loss of \nthousands and thousands and thousands of families who now live out on \nthe family farm. Grain prices have flat out collapsed. Crop disease has \ncome and visited our State --the worst crop disease of the century at \nthe same time that grain prices have collapsed. And, on top of that, \nthese farmers also fail because of unfair trade, unfair trade which \nhelps cause the grain price collapse; an enormous amount of unfair \ntrade, unfair trade that no one seems to be interested in doing \nanything about.\n  That brings me to the point I want to make today dealing with our \ntrade problems, especially with our neighbors to the north--the \nCanadians--but these trade problems relate to Mexico, to France, to \nChina, and to other countries as well.\n  Let me describe the problems just briefly, as I have before, and then \ntell you why I am especially interested today.\n  Trade agreements: There are those talking about this mantra of free \ntrade saying let's do more free trade agreements, and the more we \ntrade, the better off we are, and the better it is for our country. \nTrade statistics show that as we negotiate these agreements, agreement \nafter agreement, whoever is negotiating these agreements must not be \nkeeping their eye on the ball, because agreement after agreement we see \ndeeper and deeper trade deficits for this country.\n  I ask those who negotiate our agreements: Is there any chance you \nmight negotiate a trade agreement that is in our country's best \ninterest just once; something that benefits our country instead of \ndeepens our trade deficits?\n\n[[Page S10257]]\n\n The economic all-stars in trade have become America's family farmers. \nWe have an abiding and abundant trade surplus in agricultural \ncommodities and products. But that is shrinking, as you can see. That \nis shrinking because the trade agreements that have been developed over \nthe years with other countries--the Canadian agreement, Mexican, and \nothers--have not been in the interest of our farmers. They have created \na bifurcation of trade strategy so that we become a sponge for \nvirtually anything anyone wants to send into our country, even if it is \nsent here unfairly. And we increasingly cannot get our products into \nother countries' markets. The result is that the agricultural trade \nsurplus, which once was healthy and which once reflected the one bright \nspot on our trade picture, is now itself diminishing.\n  Our foreign debt grows to finance this trade deficit. You know what \nred means, and I have shown many of these charts before that show that \nthe trade debt is increasing and increasing dramatically.\n  Now, we have a U.S. trade ambassador's office that negotiates trade \ntreaties. I voted against, I guess, the last three or four of the \ntreaties they have negotiated. They went and negotiated one with Canada \nand, fundamentally, in my judgment, sold out the interests of American \nfarmers. I think I can demonstrate it; I think I have. Then they \nnegotiated NAFTA with Canada and Mexico. Same thing--a wholesale exodus \nof American jobs. They negotiated GATT--fundamentally unsound in the \nway it was negotiated to protect our producers' economic interests. I \nam not talking about being protectionist now. I am talking about \nstanding up for the economic interests of our producers to say, if you \nmust compete--and that is a worthy objective--then we will make sure \nthe competition is fair.\n  Has that happened in all of these recent trade agreements? Not at \nall. Because these folks are interested in negotiating agreements, some \nkind of trade agreements that comport with some notion of free trade \nthey have, a notion that is foreign to the folks where I grew up.\n  Is it free trade to say to an American producer, you go ahead and \nproduce a product, then ship it to a marketplace and try to sell it? \nAnd by the way, you are going to compete with a manufacturing plant in \nSri Lanka or Indonesia or Bangladesh, and they are going to hire 14-\nyear-old kids and pay them 14 cents an hour; they are going to work \nthem 14 hours a day, and they are going to make that product dirt cheap \nso they can increase their corporate profits; they are going to ship \nthat product to Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, or Fargo, and \nyou, Mr. and Mrs. Producer, compete with them, go ahead, compete with \nthem. Is that fair trade? Absolutely not.\n  Or how about saying to a mom and pop operation in this country that \nis producing a product, you produce a product, but we need to make sure \nyou are not polluting our air, not polluting our water, not hiring \nkids, and you don't have unsafe plants?\n  So we have restrictions on air pollution, restrictions on air and \nwater pollution, we have child labor laws, and we have worker safety \nprovisions. And then we say, you produce that product under those \nconditions--and I support all of those conditions, by the way--and then \ngo compete, and when you compete, you compete against a plant in some \ncountry tens of thousands of miles away that doesn't have any \nrestriction on dumping chemicals into the air, chemicals into the \nwater, hiring kids or having unsafe factories. And so they increase \ncorporate profits, make cheaper products and ship them here and compete \nunfairly.\n  I ask our trade ambassadors to defend that; defend that. And if you \ncan't, then don't go negotiate another treaty for this country unless \nyou can demonstrate to the American people you are willing for a \nchange, for once, to stand up for this country's economic interests.\n  Now, there will be some people in this town who will listen to this, \nand they say, well, this guy is some xenophobic isolationist, and that \nis what all this language is about. I am not that: we need to find a \nforeign home for much of what we produce in farming today.\n  I want expanded trade, I want expanded trade opportunities around the \nworld, but I am flat out sick and tired of our farmers and our business \nmen and women being consigned to trade internationally in a \ncircumstance where our trade negotiators have negotiated trade \nagreements that, A, are incompetently negotiated so they put us at a \ndisadvantage and, B, totally nonenforced, unenforced. They won't lift a \nfinger to enforce a trade agreement that I can see.\n  This morning I read in the paper that our steel industry is going to \nfile an action alleging that there is dumping going on in this country. \nI don't even know much about it, but I say to the steel industry, sign \nme up as a supporter. It is about time people start standing up for \ntheir interests and demanding that trade competition be fair \ncompetition.\n  The first 25 years after the Second World War, trade policy could be \nforeign policy and we could tie one hand behind our back and beat \nanyone, anytime, anywhere. That was fine. War-torn Europe was trying to \nrestore itself, and we were dealing with weak competitors. That is not \ntrue anymore. Now we have shrewd, tough international competitors, and \nthe fact is our trade policy is still half foreign policy and our \nnegotiators and our trade agencies don't seem to give a whit about \neither negotiating good agreements or enforcing the agreements we have.\n  That brings me to the issue of Canada especially. While our farmers \nface collapsed prices and are having auction sales the Trade \nRepresentative does nothing. You can go to those auction sales and see \nthe tears those farmers cry because they have lost more than a farm and \na home; they have lost their hopes, their dreams and everything they \nwanted to do in life. And one of the reasons that that is happening and \nthat prices are collapsing is this grain from Canada, durum, wheat, \nbarley, is flooding through our back door because of a trade agreement \nthat was, again, incompetently negotiated.\n  It is unfair trade, in my judgment. That is quite clear. It is sent \nhere by a State trading agency in Canada which would be illegal in this \ncountry. A State trading monopoly in Canada would be illegal here. It \nsends that grain with secret pricing. By the way, we don't have secret \nprices here. Their prices are secret, and yet our trade agency refuses \nto lift a finger, doesn't lift a finger. And they boast about all the \nwork they are doing.\n  Senator Byrd once talked about Aesop's fly. It probably fits here. \nAesop's fly, sitting on the axle of a chariot observing, ``My, what \ndust I do raise.'' Yes, my, what dust this USTR does raise. It is not \neven relevant to what is going on. The fact is, there are levers, there \nare opportunities, for our agencies to use, including the USTR, to \nstand up and fight for fair trade for our producers, our farmers, and \nour manufacturers, and they consistently refuse to do it.\n  I will have more to say about this specifically next week and \nspecifically about USTR and specifically about the trade agreement with \nCanada. I will have more to say about it next week. But this country \nand this Congress should not allow this to continue where our producers \nare confronted with unfair trade circumstances. We either ought to \nexpect an agency to stand up and fight trade fairness or get rid of the \nagency; just get rid of it. Stop pretending.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned Canada. I could talk about beer, Mexican \nbeer coming north and American beer not going south. That is liquid \nbarley, I guess. You know that is where beer comes from. I could talk \nabout looking at trade through the eye of a potato, whole potatoes \nsouth, french fries north with the Mexican agreement. Or maybe we could \ndo it with something everybody understands--Beanie Babies. You go stand \nat the border and see a convoy of trucks coming south with millions of \nbushels of Canadian grain, coming into a country that already has too \nmuch grain, and the result is prices are collapsed. And at the same \ntime those convoys of trucks and railroad cars with millions of bushels \nof Canadian grain are coming into our country, trading unfairly, \nincidentally, at the same time that happens, try to bring a Beanie Baby \nin, and they stop you at the border and say, oh, no, you can only bring \none--one. You only get one Beanie Baby to come across the border.\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\n  So we are willing to stand up for cloth dolls filled with beans but \nnot for family farmers whose lives, whose economic lives are \nthreatened, who are going out of business in record numbers, going out \nof business so fast that they have had to call auctioneers in my State \nout of retirement to handle the auction sales.\n  Am I upset about this? Yes. I am upset because I am a part of a \nsystem here that anticipates that those in the system will do what they \nare supposed to do, and I am especially upset with the U.S. trade \nambassador's office. It is not new. I have been upset with them for \nyears. But there is a new energy at this point because they are sitting \non their hands doing essentially nothing while our farmers are going \nout of business. And there is a real and abiding problem that all of us \nunderstand that they refuse to take action to deal with it.\n  I will revisit this subject next week, early next week on the floor \nof the Senate and have more to say about the USTR with some specifics, \nand also about Canada.\n  But I wanted to make the point today, once again, that as part of the \nresponse to the farm crisis that I asked Senator Lott about today, we \nmust deal with strengthening prices. We must deal with an indemnity \nprogram that Senator Conrad and I got passed.\n  But we must also deal with the trade component, because we can't \ncontinue to try to find a way to deal with strengthening prices and \nfinding new markets overseas for our grain products and then have a \nflood or an avalanche of grain coming through our back door, unfairly \ntraded into our country.\n  That is not fair to farmers. They ought to expect more. I certainly \nexpect more. And the President ought to expect more from the U.S. Trade \nAmbassador's office, and as I said, I will have more to say about that \nearly next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10256-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10258-S10259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let briefly turn to one additional \nsubject. That is the question of interest rates and the Federal Reserve \nBoard. I want to talk about this because it also affects farmers--not \njust farmers, but all producers and all Americans. There is a lot of \ndiscussion these days about what is happening to the economy in our \ncountry. We have plenty of challenges. But it is also hard to miss some \ngood news. The unemployment rate has gone way down. And the Federal \nReserve Board, as most of us will recall, said: Now be careful, because \nif the unemployment rate ever falls below 6 percent there is a natural \nrate here below which we will get new waves of inflation; go below 6 \npercent, the Fed said, and we are going to have inflation problems.\n  Of course, the Fed was dead wrong. We have had unemployment below 6 \npercent for 4 years now. Inflation has not gone up, it has gone down. \nBut this is good news for the economy. The unemployment rate continues \nto be down. The Consumer Price Index has gone way down too. The core \nrate with respect to the CPI is 2.2 for the last 12 months ending in \nJuly.\n  Finally, the real Federal Funds Rate, that is the short-term interest \nrate, adjusted for inflation, that the Federal Reserve Board sets, is \n3.9 percent, the highest it's been in nine years. When inflation is way \ndown here and the Federal Funds Rate, the real interest rate, is up \nhere, you ask the question: Why? Let me see if I can answer that \nquestion and give just a bit of advice to the Federal Reserve Board.\n  The Federal Reserve Board is doing its best imitation of petrified \nwood. It is not a tough imitation for them. All you have to do is look \nat the Federal Reserve Board and it resembles the Petrified Forest. In \nfact, what I would like to do is, just for those who might be watching \nor those who might be interested, I would like to show them the Federal \nReserve Board's Governors and regional bank presidents, because they \ndon't get enough attention.\n  Here is who they are, here is where they are educated, largely their \nexperience, and this is how much money they make. This is who sets \ninterest rate policy in this country; interest rate policy which now \nhas short-term rates too high and therefore the prime rate and other \ninterest rates is too high.\n  Jerry Jasinowski, President of the National Association of \nManufacturers, says:\n\n       Interest rates are a dangerous drag on the economy in view \n     of the fact that 1/3 of the world is in a recession.\n\n  He calls on the Fed to cut interest rates.\n  Dr. Sung Won Sohn, Norwest Corporation:\n\n       If the Fed were to cut interest rates today, it would help \n     ease the farm crisis, which has become critical because of \n     low commodity prices, bad weather, crop disease, and so on.\n\n  James Glassman--I don't quote him very often, but James Glassman \nsays:\n\n       [Interest] rates are not really as low as they seem. After \n     adjusting for inflation, long-term rates are high, and short-\n     term rates are even higher. . . . The longer the Fed waits \n     (to cut rates), the closer a serious slowdown, or recession, \n     becomes.\n\n  Mr. President, the Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee will \nmeet on September 29. Two of these folks still probably think that \ninterest rates ought to be increased, despite the fact that our economy \nis slowing down and the real interest rates are far too high now. It \nmight serve the money centers' bankers' interests. It certainly does \nnot serve the interests of the producers in this country. And there has \nbeen, for 200 years in this country, a tension between those who \nproduce and those who finance production. At this point, with this \ncrowd, it tilts in favor of those who believe it might be in the \ninterests of the Fed to serve their constituency, the money center \nbanks. But there is no reason, given the economic circumstances in our \ncountry today, for them not to put interest rates where they belong, \ngiven the current rate of inflation, and that would augur not for an \ninterest rate increase on September 29, but a cut.\n  Here are the folks. Here are their names. You could put them in a \nbarrel and shake them all up and you would still have a gray suit, \nsomebody with an economics background, no one from my part of the \ncountry, and no one who has ever fixed anything or built anything.\n  In fact, we have a vacancy now, and I said I would like my Uncle Joe \nto be considered for that. My Uncle Joe doesn't have any particular \nskills that would suggest him for the job, but he used to fix \ngenerators and alternators, so he has run a business and worked with \nhis hands. He fixes things. Nobody here represents producers. Nobody on \nthe Federal Reserve Board has an understanding, in my judgment, about \nthe productive side of our economy.\n  My Uncle Joe is not going be seriously considered, I suppose. But \nwhat we will probably find is this administration, like all others, \nwill find somebody who looks just like this, same color suit, Ph.D. in \neconomics. Certainly nobody from the Upper Midwest where they have been \nfarming or their folks have run a small business or anything like that.\n  I guess the point I wanted to make today is, as we head towards \nSeptember 29, all of the evidence suggests that we ought to be seeing a \ncut in interest rates. I should confess that I actually used to teach \neconomics a bit in college. I have been able to overcome that and lead \na reasonably productive life. All I ask from the Federal Reserve Board \nis to look at this from the standpoint of this country's long-term \neconomic health and the economic facts that are now self-evident.\n  There is nothing that could persuade a couple of these people, as I \nunderstand they still believe that we ought to have higher interest \nrates except that they must represent some narrow self-interest for the \nmoney center banks. Certainly most of them ought to be able to look at \nthe facts and understand we need--and this country deserves and our \neconomy requires--a lowering of Federal Funds rate and therefore a \nlowering of the prime and other interest rates that represents where we \nought to be, given the historical interest rates and declining \ninflation.\n  Mr. President, I understand that when you come down and are even \nobliquely critical of the Federal Reserve Board, it is like taking on \nthe last American dinosaur. I regret that I do that. But it is the last \npart, the last institution that remains impervious to the broader \npublic interest. Some think that the Fed is a hero for whatever has \nhappened in our economy. I don't happen to view it that way. I\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nthink they view themselves as a set of human brake pads, and they keep \ntheir foot on the brake--and good for them. Except that what we have \nnow is a need to put interest rates back where they ought to be for \nproducers and farmers and others, given the fact that overall inflation \nis down at 1.7 percent over the last twelve months and only 1.5 percent \nsince the beginning of this year.\n  Today's announcement was that the Producer Price Index for finished \ngood in August fell 0.4 percent. This means that producer prices have \nfallen 1.6 percent over the past twenty months. All these numbers augur \nvery hard for the Federal Reserve Board to do something that some \nsuggest they are not prepared to do. I ask Fed Chairman Greenspan and \nothers to see if they can't do what some people now don't expect them \nto do, but do the right thing: On September 29, we reduce those \ninterest rates.\n  Several of us in Congress are considering offering at least a sense-\nof-the-Congress resolution to send a message to the Fed. Who knows \nwhether it will get through the door there, but at least send a message \nto say here is what we think. Interest rates have a significant impact \non virtually every family in America, on every producer, business and \nfarmer in this country. And my hope is that at the end of this month, \ngiven the uncertainty we face in the world, given the numbers from the \nlast quarter here in this country showing a slowing of our economy, and \ngiven the historical low rate of inflation and the fact that we are now \noverpaying because of the Federal Funds Rate, the Federal Reserve Board \nwill finally do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ROGER WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to a great Utah man \nof science, Dr. Roger R. Williams, whose life came to a tragic end last \nWednesday in the horrific crash of Swissair Flight 111.\n  Tomorrow, Dr. Williams' remarkable life will be celebrated at a \nmemorial service in Salt Lake City.\n  In the wake of this solemn occasion, I ask that my colleagues pause \nfor a few moments in remembrance of those husbands and wives, sons and \ndaughters, brothers and sisters who perished in this terrible crash.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  Like Dr. Williams, each had abundant potential which was so unfairly \ncut short.\n  Dr. Roger Williams was known throughout the world, not only as a \ndistinguished professor of internal medicine at the University of Utah, \nbut also as a leading expert in the field of cardiovascular genetics.\n  In fact, at the time of his death, our Utah scientist was on his way \nto Geneva to chair an international panel of the World Health \nOrganization, which is working to promote the prevention of premature \ndeath through early diagnosis of genetic cholesterol abnormalities.\n  Dr. Williams was the founder and director of the University of Utah's \nCardiovascular Genetics Research Clinic, which fosters collaborative \ninvestigations involving numerous fields of medicine.\n  He was the author of more than 200 professional publications and a \nfrequent chair of National Institutes of Health advisory committees.\n  But what I remember most about Dr. Williams was his abundant spirit, \nhis tremendous enthusiasm for life and for his work, an exuberance that \nwas virtually impossible not to get caught up in.\n  I can recall many occasions when he visited my office to educate, \ncajole-- and even plead--for an enhanced Federal commitment to research \non the genetic basis of familial cholesterol problems.\n  In fact, earlier this year, Dr. Williams' and I began work to design \na program leading to the diagnosis and treatment of the unmet needs of \nmany thousands of persons with strong familial predisposition to \npreventable early deaths.\n  It is ironic that Dr. Williams' promising research was so abruptly \nhalted by his own premature death.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful for these opportunities to have worked \nwith such a fine man, a man who did so much for our State, our country, \nand indeed, the world at large.\n  Dr. Roger Williams will truly be missed--not only because of his \ncontributions to science and medicine, which brought him international \nacclaim--but also because he was simply a good, decent man who always \nwanted to be fair.\n  It is hard to forget a statement made by his son last week that \ncaptured the true essence of Roger Williams.\n  Tom Williams remarked that his father was known to say ``If you \nwouldn't do it for the guy on the bottom, you can't do it for the guy \non the top.''\n  I think we can all learn a valuable lesson from the life and work of \nRoger Williams, a man who always lived his life with the highest \npossible integrity and kindness, a man who regarded his happy marriage \nand seven children as his most important accomplishment and \nresponsibility.\n  Dr. Williams' passage is a tremendous loss to the State of Utah, the \nworld of medical research, and to all those who knew him and knew him \nwell.\n  My heart goes out to his wife Linda, to his children, and to his \nextended family, including his colleagues, during what I know is a most \ndifficult time. They will all be in our thoughts and prayers.\n  We know that they will be blessed because of the lives that they live \nas well.\n  This was a great man, a person who had unlimited potential. It is \nhard to understand why a life like this--indeed lives like all the \nothers on that plane--were snuffed out. The fact of the matter is that, \nbelieving in a life hereafter and believing that there is a God who \nrewards people for the works that they do on this Earth, I have no \ndoubt that Roger Williams will be with our Father in Heaven as one of \nhis chosen people. It is my prayer all the passengers on flight 111 \nwill be as well.\n  I personally express my gratitude and appreciation for what Roger \nWilliams has meant to this country, what he has meant to the University \nof Utah, what he has meant to our State, and what he has meant to so \nmany other persons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10259-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING SEPTEMBER 4TH\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has \nreported that for the week ending September 4 that the U.S. imported \n8,549,000 barrels of oil each day, 998,000 barrels a day more than the \n7,551,000 imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 57.2 percent of their needs last \nweek.

Mr. President, earlier today the majority leader \npropounded the unanimous consent request relevant to the bankruptcy \nlegislation. In that proposition, he had indicated that the first \namendment to be considered to the bankruptcy bill would be the \namendment which I will offer with a number of our colleagues on behalf \nof the Americans who are at the bottom two rungs of the economic \nladder, those who are making the minimum wage in our Nation.\n  It is an amendment to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents in \nJanuary of next year and another 50-cent increase the following year. \nThe total increase would be a $1 increase in the minimum wage. We will \nhave an opportunity to debate that issue on Tuesday morning, with a \nvote on that sometime around the noon hour. At that time, the \nmembership will express itself on whether we are going to reward work \nin the United States of America, whether we are going to say that our \nfellow Americans who are at the lower end of the economic ladder, who \nhave lost more than any other group in our society in terms of their \npurchasing power over the period of these last years, whether they are \ngoing to be able to have a very, very modest increase of $1 over the \nperiod of the next year and a half to 2 years to their wages.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of reasons for this increase. I \nthink the most compelling one is the reason that those of us in this \ncountry have a sense of common purpose, have a sense of community, have \na sense of caring about our neighbors and those who are fellow \ncitizens. That has been a strength of our Nation ever since its \nearliest days.\n  We also put a strong emphasis and a strong quality on the issue of \nworking. What we are saying is that those who are going to work 40 \nhours a week, 52 weeks of the year, should no longer live in poverty. \nThat has been the reason for the minimum wage in the first place, \nfollowing the Great Depression and over a long period of time. There \nhave been five raises in the minimum wage since 1955. Raising the \nminimum wage has been supported by Republicans and Democrats, \nRepublican Presidents, Democratic Presidents. It has by and large been \na bipartisan effort over the recent years.\n  The principal cautions in raising the minimum wage have been, would \nthe raising of the minimum wage result in an increase in the rates of \ninflation which would work to the detriment of other workers in our \nsociety, and would it contribute to increasing unemployment in our \nsociety and, in that respect, have a disadvantaging impact on the \nvarious people we are trying to help?\n  Those are powerful economic issues. And they ought to be considered \nat any particular time. And we are glad to consider those issues at \nthis time as we are advancing the cause of workers in our society, \nworkers who have not benefited from this extraordinary prosperity which \nwe as Americans have seen over the period of the last 6 years, the \ngreatest economic growth, the greatest price stability, the lowest \nunemployment, the lowest rates of inflation. The economy, with all of \nthe ups and downs of the stock market, is extremely strong, and it has \nbeen strong, and it continues to be strong.\n  Nonetheless, we have seen that over the period of recent years the \npurchasing power of those at the lower level of the economic ladder has \ndeteriorated significantly. And what we are attempting to do is to say \nto our fellow Americans, as we as a nation move ahead in terms of the \neconomic prosperity, that we want all of our fellow citizens to move \nalong together. It is not asking very much to have a 50 cent increase \nin the minimum wage or $1 over a period of the next 2 years. That is \nthe issue, Mr. President, that will be squarely before this body on \nTuesday next and where we will have an opportunity to vote on it.\n  Mr. President, as we have on other occasions, I think it is fair to \nlook at where the minimum wage is today and where it has been. The \ninclusions in our amendment, are they really reasonable given the \ncurrent economic conditions? We maintain they are extremely reasonable.\n  On this chart here, the real minimum wage reflects where the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage in real dollars is--in real \ndollars from 1995, 1998, and beyond.\n  If you look at this end of the chart, Mr. President, you will see \n1997, 1998; and you will see where my pen is, that at this point here \nwe are talking about a $1 increase from $5.15 to what would be $6.15, \nwith the increase in the minimum wage in real dollars. By the year \n2000, it will only amount to $5.76 in real dollars.\n  If you go across this line, Mr. President, going back through the \n1960s all the way through the 1970s, you will see even with this kind \nof increase in the minimum wage of $1, the purchasing power of the \nminimum wage for working families will still be lower than it was for a \nperiod of some 20, 23 years from 1960s all the way through the early \n1980s. So even with this increase, it is extremely modest, Mr. \nPresident, extremely moderate--it still does not bring us back to the \npurchasing power that the minimum wage has had for the better part of \nour postwar period. But, nonetheless, it is important progress for \nfamilies.\n  All you have to do is ask any family what a difference it makes for a \n50-cent or a $1 increase in the minimum wage. They will answer very \nquickly, ``It means that we'll have to have two jobs instead of three \njobs.'' That will be their first answer. And secondly, an increase of \n$1 in the minimum wage will mean the purchase of groceries for probably \n6 months of a year. It will mean the rent for a working-poor family of \nabout 7 months of a year. It will be about two-thirds the cost of the \ntuition for a son or a daughter, of a working family earning the \nminimum wage, to attend a public university in their State. This is \nvery important to those at the lower end of the economic ladder. That \nis basically the historical situation, Mr. President.\n  It is fair to ask ourselves now, what has happened in the rates of \ninflation? Let us take a look at inflation and the minimum wage. Many \nsay, ``If we increase the minimum wage, we're going to see a bump in \nthe rate of inflation.'' Well, if we look at what happens to the \nminimum wage--and in this particular chart here we go from 1996 all the \nway up to 1998--we look at what is happening to the rate of inflation.\n  Prior to the rise in the minimum wage, which was in October 1996, the \nrate of inflation per month was three-tenths of 1 percent. Then we \nraised the minimum wage to $4.75. And if you look at this chart here, \nyou will find that it continued along virtually the same three-tenths \nof 1 percent. It dropped down here in the wintertime, it rose again in \nthe early spring, dropped again, and then settled into a significant \ndrop. If you are talking of three-tenths of 1 percent per month to two-\ntenths of 1 percent, you are talking about a significant drop in the \nrate of inflation, even with the last increase in the minimum wage. \nThen it rose another 50 cents in 1997. And the inflation rate was two-\ntenths of 1 percent.\n  Look what has happened since that last raise to $5.15. It went along \nfor a period of time, dropped, bounced up, and is now down to one-tenth \nof 1 percent.\n  Mr. President, the clear signal from this chart is that the last \nincrease in the minimum wage virtually had no impact on the rate of \ninflation. And if we are to look at the history of these last several \nyears, we will see that the rate of inflation has actually gone down. \nIt is not a valid point to say that if we try to do something to raise \nthe minimum wage, it is going to add to inflation.\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\n  Now, if we look at what the impact is on unemployment, this is a \nsecond argument. If we raise the minimum wage, it is going to have an \nadverse impact on inflation and it is going to increase unemployment. \nAgain, if we go back to October 1996 where we saw an increase in the \nminimum wage, we had 5.2 percent unemployment, a little bump, and then \na gradual decline through September 1997, when the last increase in the \nminimum wage went to $5.15. Since that last increase in September of \n1997, up until August of 1998, we have seen a continuing reduction of \nthe unemployment, down at the present time to 4.5, 4.4 percent. It has \nnot added to inflation. It has not added or contributed to \nunemployment. Those two economic arguments do not stand.\n  If we look at the impact on our teens, the arguments are made, \n``Senator, we are concerned about what the impact is going to be on \nteen unemployment and particularly among the minorities.'' The fact is, \nabout 20 to 25 percent of all those who receive the minimum wage are \nteenagers. Most of the teenagers in my State who are receiving the \nminimum wage are out there their first year in college trying to make \nends meet.\n  Travel with me to the University of Massachusetts in Boston at the \ncampus. Mr. President, many of the children who go to that excellent \nschool are from families where the parents never went to the school. \nAnd much of the student body is working 25 hours a week or more. These \nare teenagers. These are many of the children who are trying to gain \nsufficient income to fund their education. We should think it is a \nworthwhile and valuable endeavor in trying to support kids who are \ntrying to go to school and stay in school, many of whom are coming from \ndifficult and complex backgrounds. Nonetheless, they go on.\n  Take the minorities. In this case, the black teen unemployment--we \ncan go through any of the various groups in terms of unemployment--and \nwhat we see again is the increase in the minimum wage, the continued \ndecline in terms of unemployment of black teenagers and minority \nteenagers. This chart is just a reflection of the same trend. We see \nthat the total number of employment in terms of teenagers 16 to 19, \nwith the increase in the minimum wage, these are the individuals who \nfind the employment going up. Increase in the minimum wage based upon \nsound economic principles, and we see that there has not been an \nadverse impact on the issues of employment or inflation.\n  Now, I think it is worthwhile to ask who is really for this increase \nin the minimum wage. Mr. President, 170 organizations--170 \norganizations--representing not just workers. The AFL-CIO, even though \ntheir workers are all receiving far above the minimum wage, is \ncertainly interested because of respect for the value of work. The \nprincipal church groups and church leaders are strongly supportive. The \nleaders of the various women's and children's organizations are \nstrongly supportive. The various civil rights organizations, knowing \nthe importance of this in terms of the individuals, are strongly \nsupportive.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of the \nvarious groups and organizations that are in support of this \nlegislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record,  as follows:\n\n           Campaign For a Fair Minimum Wage--Participants\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     \\1\\ Coalition in formation (August 27, 1998).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments, now that we \nhave the statistics behind us and we have dealt with the economic \nissues. If there are those who have differing economic indicators, we \nwelcome them. Present those so we will have a chance to debate. But we \nhave not heard from them as we have been making this case in the past \nweeks and past months, even the past year, about the importance of this \nincrease. We haven't heard those arguments made.\n  Let me indicate to this body who we are really talking about, because \nI think it is important that we realize who these individuals are who \nare the recipients of the minimum wage. Mr. President, 33 percent of \nthose who benefit from this increase are in service occupations, \nincluding home health care workers. These are workers like Cathy Adams, \na home health aide from Viola, IL. Cathy is a high school graduate, who \nis currently enrolled in a computer training program at the local \ncommunity college. She lives with her two daughters, who are 10 and 11.\n  Cathy works 11\\1/2\\ hours a day, 5 days a week. She cares for a woman \nwith multiple sclerosis. She bathes her, dresses her, and feeds her. \nShe does the grocery shopping, the laundry, and the cleaning. She runs \nerrands and schedules doctor appointments.\n  Cathy likes her job and is fond of her client, but she finds it hard \nto live on $5.30 an hour. In March, she told a minimum wage forum:\n\n       I literally live paycheck to paycheck. After paying the \n     bills, whatever is left over goes to groceries. I have $9 in \n     my savings account and worry about being able to save for my \n     girls' education. We rarely have money to go to a movie or \n     eat out at a restaurant. The other day, my girls asked me to \n     take them ice skating at school. While it only costs $10, I \n     had to think twice about whether we could afford it. Most of \n     the clothing I buy for my kids and for myself comes from yard \n     sales and secondhand stores.\n\n  This is a minimum wage worker, someone who will be affected by our \namendment.\n  A second group, is child care workers. According to ``Worthy Work, \nUnlivable Wages,'' a recent study by the Center for Child Care \nWorkforce, in 1997, the average wage for a teaching assistant in child \ncare centers ranged from $6 to $7 an hour. This is less than the 1998 \npoverty level for a family of three--$13,650. Turnover among these \nassistants is high, 40 percent.\n  We talk about what we care about in terms of our children. One of the \nmost important aspects of the child's life is what is happening to them \nin their home, primarily, but also what happens to them when they are \nin some kind of child care setting, in a Head Start child care setting. \nSo many of those who take care of those children are child care \nworkers. Those child care workers, by and large, are receiving the \nminimum wage.\n  One of the reasons you have the great turnover is because they can't \nmake it. Rather than having the child care workers who stay with your \nchildren throughout the year and interact with them and help and assist \nthem getting a decent, livable wage, we have this very considerable \nturnover. The study found that centers paying higher than average \nsalaries had lower turnover rates than centers paying less.\n  We find that true in the Head Start programs, as well. We care about \nchildren. We care about fairness and we care about child care workers. \nWe need to do something about a minimum wage.\n  These are workers like Kimberly Frazier, a child care aide from \nPhiladelphia. Kimberly works full time and earns $5.20 an hour. She is \na single mother with three children and has worked at the same center \nsince 1992.\n  Kimberly says her salary barely covers her bills--rent of $250 a \nmonth, food, utilities, clothing for three growing children, and \ncarfare to get her daughter and herself to the child care center. She \ntold our forum:\n\n       Of course, there is never money for a vacation for my \n     children or me. I go without new clothes for myself because I \n     have to keep buying new sneakers for my children, they \n     outgrow them so fast. I can't afford a car and pay for gas \n     and insurance so I rely on public transportation. If I had a \n     car, I could get out to the places where there are better \n     paying jobs. And, like all Americans, I dream of buying my \n     own house so that I can raise my kids in a neighborhood that \n     has less crime and more trees. But I know that, although I \n     work and study as hard as I can, I will never have the down \n     payment for a house earning the minimum wage.\n\n  She concluded,\n\n       A dollar an hour probably doesn't sound like a lot to many \n     people, but to me and my children it would mean a real \n     improvement in our lives.\n\n  Many minimum wage workers are janitors, cleaning offices in buildings \nacross the country. They are people like Valerie Bell. Valerie works as \na custodian at the Baltimore City World Trade Center. Since 1995, that \nbuilding has been covered by Baltimore's Living Wage Ordinance, which \nrequires city contractors to pay $6.10 an hour. That's higher than the \nfederal minimum, but still lower than the level that I have proposed.\n  According to Valerie Bell, the living wage means dignity for workers \nand their families. As she puts it, ``under the living wage, we no \nlonger have to receive food stamps or other social services to \nsupplement our incomes. We can fix up our homes and invest in our \nneighborhoods. We can spend more at the local grocery store. We can \npossibly work two jobs rather than three low wage jobs and spend more \ntime with our families. Our utilities won't be cut off. We can pay the \nmedical bills we accumulated from not having benefits in these jobs. \nThe best welfare reform is a living wage job.''\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\n  Nationwide, most security screeners at airports earn the minimum \nwage. These workers screen passenger luggage, operate metal detectors \nand work x-ray machines. They are responsible for the safety of \nmillions of passengers and thousands of airplanes entering and leaving \nairports around the country--yet they earn the minimum wage.\n  These are workers like Melvin Ware, a customs carousel handler at the \nLos Angeles Airport. He takes home about $317 every two weeks. ``By the \ntime you pay rent and utilities, you're broke,'' he said. ``There's no \nlife after work.'' Raquel Littlejohn screens passenger luggage, and \nspends much of her day at a computer terminal. This strains her eyes \nbut, with take-home pay of under $400 every two weeks, she can't afford \nto get them checked. A sympathetic L.A. Councilwoman said, ``I don't \nthink it's good that the person who is doing such an important job has \nto be worrying about trying to get to the next one because the security \njob doesn't pay a living wage.''\n  Eighteen percent of today's workforce is employed in the retail \nindustry--that's 22.5 million workers. Many are paid the minimum wage.\n  These are people like Cordelia Bradley of Philadelphia. She works at \na clothing chain just outside Philadelphia. She is the mother of one \nson, and she earns $5.15 an hour.\n  She told our minimum wage forum in March that:\n\n       I am currently living in a rented room for which I pay $300 \n     a month. I would like to have my own apartment but I cannot \n     afford one. In addition to paying my rent, I pay for food, \n     clothing and transportation. . . . If the minimum wage was \n     higher I would be able to save up for my own apartment for me \n     and my son. . . . I ask you to reward the people who go to \n     work by raising up the minimum wage. Things are very rough \n     for people, not just people on welfare. There are many people \n     like me who go to work every day and cannot afford to live. \n     Please do the right thing.\n\n  Then there are laundry workers, and the list goes on. These are the \nindividuals whose lives would be impacted by the increase in the \nminimum wage. We are talking about a dollar--a dollar an hour. We are \ntalking probably $2,000 over the course of a year. That's not two-\nthirds as much as the increase that every Member of the U.S. Senate \nreceived in this Congress--two-thirds as much as we have received in \nthis Congress. We are being asked whether we are going to try to give \nthose individuals some relief, some help, some assistance, as we have \nin the best days of our past, to say that these individuals could and \nshould be able to have an impact.\n  Nationwide, the soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters \nare increasingly serving the working poor, not just the unemployed. \nAccording to a recent study by Second Harvest, the nationwide networks \nof food banks, in 1997, 39 percent of households seeking emergency food \naid had at least one member who was working. Eighty-six percent of \nhouseholds receiving emergency food aid earned under $15,500 a year, \nand 67 percent of the households earned less than $10,000 a year.\n  According to a U.S. Conference of Mayors study, requests for \nemergency food aid increased 86 percent in the cities survey. And 67 \npercent of the cities cited low-paying jobs as one of the main causes \nof hunger. These aren't only just for the parents, these are for the \nchildren. This is not a Member of Congress that is saying it, these are \nthe mayors of the country saying what is happening out across the \nNation, which is that individuals can't make it with this kind of an \nincome, and there is something that we can do.\n  We are facing many complex problems here in the United States \nCongress and Senate. We have faced many of them. But one that we can \nimpact and one that we should impact is trying to make sure that people \nwho work will not be in poverty for themselves and their children. We \nhear a lot about American values in our country, about what is \nimportant and what is unimportant. The newspapers are filled with that. \nWell, this is something that is important.\n  I welcome the fact that President Clinton has been a strong supporter \nof this particular issue. So we will have an opportunity, Mr. \nPresident, to come back and visit this issue. Nothing, I believe--and I \nhave had a chance to vote and participate on many different issues over \n37 years in the U.S. Senate--there is no single issue that is more \ndefined in terms of fairness than the issue of the minimum wage. \nNothing. Just in terms of fairness, are we going to be fair to working \npeople in our country and in our society? Are we going to be fair \nagainst the background and history of Republicans and Democrats that \nwere fair?\n  We are going to be asked next Tuesday whether this body will be fair. \nWe will have a chance then to speak to that issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10260-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10263-S10264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE TRUTH IN EMPLOYMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last night my Republican colleagues filed \ncloture on the so-called Truth in Employment Act. Supporters of this \ndeceptively-titled bill claim that it is designed to bar a union \norganizing technique known as ``salting.'' Under that technique, union \nsupporters seek a job at a non-union shop with the intention of \npersuading co-workers to join the union.\n  I oppose this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to oppose \ncloture. I believe that salting, like other types of organizing \nactivity, should be protected by the labor laws.\n  Under the bill, employers could make employment decisions based on \ntheir subjective view of an employee's motivation. If an employer \nbelieved that a person was likely to try to organize a union, the \nemployer would be free not to hire that person. If an employer \nunilaterally determined that an employee's interest in organizing co-\nworkers would interfere with her ability to do the job, the employer \ncould refuse to hire her. If an employer rightly or wrongly decided \nthat an employee might work together with colleagues to change \nconditions on the job, the employer could discharge or discipline the \nemployee.\n  Many may remember the movie ``Norma Rae,'' starring Sally Field. In \nthat film, Norma Rae decided she had had enough of the abusive \npractices in her factory, so she worked with a labor union to organize \nher co-workers so they could stand up to these abuses together. But \nunder this bill, Norma Rae could be fired.\n  This bill would make mind-reading a protected right under the \nNational Labor Relations Act. It would let employers deny work to \nemployees based on a perception that they might try to organize a \nunion. That perception is most likely to come from the employee's \nmembership in a union. In effect, this bill would institutionalize the \nblacklist. That is unacceptable.\n  Let us be clear what types of activity are protected under the labor \nlaws, and what kinds of conduct would be left open for employer \nretaliation under this bill. Section 7 of the National Labor Relations \nAct protects employees' rights to organize, bargain collectively, and \nengage in other concerted activities for mutual aid or protection.\n  If this bill became law, an employer could refuse to hire an employee \nbased on a fear that she might band together with co-workers to push \nfor an on-the-job child care center. The employer could claim that this \nactivity was undertaken in furtherance of an organization other than \nthe employer, be it a union or a women's rights organization. \nTherefore, the workers' conduct would not be protected, and the \nemployer could discriminate or discharge at will.\n  Under this bill, a firm could fire African-American workers who \ntogether sought Martin Luther King's birthday as a holiday. Once again, \nthe employer could argue that the workers were acting in furtherance of \na civil rights group's goals, and therefore were not protected by the \nNational Labor Relations Act.\n  Under this bill, a company could deny jobs to employees it believed \nmight try to persuade others to support a political campaign, or get \ninvolved in a community group, or contribute to a church or synagogue. \nAnd, a firm could refuse to hire workers because they might join a \nunion, or persuade others to do so.\n  Most of us would agree that discrimination on the basis of race, or \nreligion, or gender, or political belief--and many of us would also put \nsexual orientation on that list--is unacceptable in this society. The \nright to self-expression on these important issues flows from the First \nAmendment, and\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\nhas been protected by decades-old federal laws. The National Labor \nRelations Act places an employee's right to organize and bargain \ncollectively on an equal footing with these other rights, and so it \nshould.\n  This bill would effectively repeal that right. It leaves employees in \nan intolerable position.\n  In 1995, the National Labor Relations Board ordered nearly 7,500 \nworkers reinstated. Those workers had been fired unlawfully for union \nactivity. Over 26,000 workers discharged for unionizing were awarded \nback pay. On average, workers waited four years from the date of the \nunlawful discharge before being awarded any relief. And, the Dunlop \nCommission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations found in 1994 \nthat union supporters were unlawfully fired in one out of every four \nunion election campaigns.\n  These figures demonstrate that workers who become active supporters \nof a union after they are hired run a substantial risk of being fired. \nUnder this bill, if the employer thinks an employee might become active \nin a union, that worker never gets the job in the first place. This is \nnot progress. Instead, it takes us back to the days when employees \ncould be required to sign ``yellow dog contracts,'' promising never to \njoin the union, in order to be hired.\n  The Supreme Court has emphatically rejected this approach. In 1995, \nthe Court unanimously ruled that union supporters are employees \nprotected by the National Labor Relations Act when they apply for a \njob. In the Town & Country decision, the Court dismissed the employer's \nclaim that union organizers are inherently untrustworthy because they \nowe their primary loyalty to the union. But that is precisely the \npremise underlying this bill.\n  Current law gives employers many ways to advance their legitimate \ninterests in an efficient and productive workforce--without undermining \nemployees' rights to engage in concerted activity. For example, an \nemployer can establish a policy barring its employees from all outside \nemployment. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held just a few months \nago that such a policy can be applied against union organizers, so long \nas it is also applied neutrally to all other types of employment.\n  Workers who neglect their job duties in order to organize other \nworkers can be disciplined or discharged. The Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals has held that it is lawful for an employer to fire employees \nwho fail to carry out their duties because they are trying to organize.\n  Employers can lawfully discipline employees who fail to do the job \nthey were hired to do, or disrupt the employer's operations, or engage \nin unlawful conduct. Employers can file charges with the National Labor \nRelations Board, or even the police, if the conduct is criminal. In \nshort, employers have many tools available today to address the \nconcerns that supposedly motivate this bill.\n  Finally, I note that many of this legislation's proponents are also \nstrong supporters of the so-called TEAM Act. TEAM Act supporters claim \nthat bill is necessary in order to promote employee participation in \nthe workplace. The present bill would permit employers to refuse to \nhire workers who band together in order to participate in the \nworkplace.\n  It is ironic that supporters claim to favor employee participation in \nthe one context, but seek to squelch it in the other. The common thread \nappears to be employer domination. Participation is seen as desirable \nonly if employers can control the ``team,'' and worker-controlled \ngroups such as unions can be prohibited.\n  This legislation poses a significant threat to employee rights that \nhave been fundamental to our industrial democracy for over 60 years. \nBecause the bill is dangerous as well as unnecessary, I must oppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX.

Mr. President, I will not take a long time. I know the \nhour is late. But there are still very important issues that I think \nCongress needs to pay attention to and to address. I know that all of \nthe news in Washington today has been generally about the problems of \nthe President. While I understand that, it is also very important, I \nthink, for all of us to realize that we cannot pretend to be ostriches \nand stick our heads in the sand, and not face other very serious \nproblems that many of our constituents are facing around this country.\n  I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention the very serious \nagricultural disasters that exist as we stand here in Washington today \nthroughout a large portion of the agricultural belt in the United \nStates of America. It is a serious problem. We cannot allow the \nproblems of the moment to distract us from very important duties that \nwe have, as legislators, to do everything within our power to try to \nhelp solve the problems of America's farmers.\n  It is really interesting, because while the farmers are having \nproblems throughout the United States, there are different reasons for \nthe disasters which I would like to point out.\n  In the northern and many of the western parts of the country--the \nnorthwestern part of our United States--the problems in agriculture are \nvery simple--they have very low prices for their products--while in the \nSouth, in the Southwest, and in my State of Louisiana, the problem is \nalso very simple to understand: It is not that the crops have low \nprices but, rather, that they have no crops. They have no crops because \nof the drought conditions that have caused an economic, agricultural, \nfarming disaster.\n  While the reasons for the problems for the farmers are quite \ndifferent, the results are the same. Whether you are a farmer in the \nnorthern part of the United States who can't get enough money for your \ncrop to justify your cost of production, or whether you are a farmer in \nmy State of Louisiana, which has no crop because of the extreme drought \nthat has ravaged my State, the end result of the farmer and the family \nfarm is the same; it is loss of income; it is loss of the ability to \ncontinue as a family farm. What happens to a family farm affects not \nonly that family farm but it affects the community that they live in. \nWhen farmers suffer economic loss, the entire State suffers as well.\n  What I want to mention is the severity of the problem in my State, \nwhich is not unlike many other States. We just recently had the \nLouisiana State University Agricultural Economic Department review the \nlosses that my farmers in Louisiana have faced. Their report as of \nAugust 14 is truly astounding. The total State reduction in farm income \nfor the following crops is as follows:\n  For the corn crop, it is over $64 million of loss;\n  For cotton, it is over $50 million of loss;\n  For just soybeans, it is over $72 million;\n  For rice, it is over $14 million;\n  For sugar, it is nearly $45 million;\n  For sorghum, it is over $4 million.\n  The total crop loss they are estimating is $254 million.\n  Sweet potatoes, over $8 million;\n  Commercial vegetables, almost $4 million;\n  The pine seedlings for forest reproduction is estimated at $10 \nmillion;\n  Pasture, $90 million;\n  Hay, almost $25 million.\n  The current estimated total as of August 14 was over $390 million.\n  When you factor in the problems with some of the diseases that are \nbeing experienced--aflatoxin, for instance--you have to look at about \n$420 million. This is just in one State.\n  So the loss is truly devastating.\n  These are real problems. These family farm problems affect not only \nthe family farmers, as severe as that is, but they affect the economy, \nthe community, and the people who sell the harvesting equipment, the \ntractors and combines; the people who sell the seed and the \nfertilizers; the people who sell shoes and clothes and food in town. If \nthe farmers do not earn a living, they cannot buy the other products; \nthe implement dealer and the car dealer, all suffer. It has a ripple \neffect throughout the United States of America.\n  The problems in the North--as I said, because of low prices, because \nof cheap\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\nimports being dumped from Canada, because of the overall depressed \neconomy in many parts of Asia and Europe, and particularly in the \nSouth, in addition to low prices on the crops, we have no crops.\n  So the question is now not the extent of the problem. We know that. \nThe question is now, What do we do?\n  I just think it is interesting. When we have a hurricane, tornado, or \nearthquake, there is always a rush to provide economic assistance. \nThere is always on the nightly news when someone is visiting a \nhurricane-ravaged area or area that has been hurt by a tornado, a \nreaching out to the people. When you have the earthquake, it is the \nsame result. Somehow it seems like it is different with the farmers \nbecause I think it is so gradual. If you have an earthquake, it \nhappens, it is over, the people come in, they leave, and they have made \nan expression of their concern. But when it is an economic disaster \nover a longer period of time, it is harder to have people focus on the \nseverity of the problem.\n  I think that is what is true in the agricultural disaster that we are \nnow experiencing in my State. But the loss is just as severe, the hurt \nis just as severe. When you have to sell the family farm and move, and \nyou can't pay your bills, you are hurting just as much as someone who \nhas lost a family home because of a tornado, earthquake, or hurricane, \nor some other natural disaster.\n  The question now is, What do we do? It is clear, in my opinion, that \nthe current agricultural programs that are designed to address \nassistance are too bureaucratic.\n  They do not work. They are outdated. They need something else to be \nhelpful. What I mean by that is, for instance, with the loan program, \nemergency loans, the Government tells a farmer, well, you have to get \nturned down by three lending institutions in your local area and then \nyou can come to the Government and get some financial assistance in \nterms of a Federal loan. If you could get the local loan, you would not \nneed the Federal loan. But somehow you have to show that you could not \nget the local loan, but that if you get the Federal loan you can pay it \nback. If you could pay back the Federal loan, you could have paid back \nthe local loan and you would not have had any need for help at the \nFederal level in the first place.\n  Those programs, well intended as they are, are simply too \nbureaucratic and do not work in providing real assistance to millions \nof American farmers.\n  What we are working on is to try to present a package, and this \nshould be bipartisan. Republicans did not cause the problem and \nDemocrats did not cause the problem, but the truth is we are going to \nhave to work together to solve the problem. If we do not work together, \nchances are it is not going to get solved. This is not a political \nproblem; it is a natural disaster problem. So what we are trying to do \nis provide some assistance.\n  Some have suggested increasing the loan levels, the artificial target \nprices, removing the caps on those programs to allow for a higher loan \nrate in order to give more assistance to farmers. That is a good thing \nto do. But in my area, it does not really help because my farmers don't \nhave a crop to put in the Federal loan program. So in the South where \nyou have no crop, we support what we are trying to do for our northern \nfarmers. It is very important and I think it is the right thing to do. \nBut in the southern portion of the United States where there is no crop \nat all and they have not been able to benefit from the program, we are \nsuggesting direct financial assistance. It would go to farmers who do \nnot have their losses covered by any other type of program. If someone \nhas crop insurance, well, they may be helped a little bit. And the \namount of help they get under the Crop Insurance Program should not \nallow them to double dip, but crop insurance is not going to cover \ntheir entire losses. So that part of their loss which is not covered by \nsome insurance program should be clearly eligible for direct financial \nassistance. And for many of our farmers, they can't even afford crop \ninsurance and so they have nothing. So their losses should be also \ncovered, obviously, by any type of direct financial assistance to try \nto help them survive.\n  It is strictly a question of this one-time aid to help them survive \nuntil the next year so they can still be around to plant and grow the \ncrops that help feed most, if not all, of America and much of the rest \nof the world.\n  Some will say, well, Senator, this is going to be expensive. Where is \nit going to come from? Well, No. 1, because of the good economic \nconditions, I think because of many of the things we have been able to \ndo in the Congress, fortunately, the economy of the country is good in \nother areas, and, fortunately, we do not have a Federal deficit which \nwe used to have--we now have a Federal surplus and we have had \nestimates of $50-, $60-, $75 billion just in this year--why not look at \nthis disaster as an emergency, and if you have a surplus in the Federal \nbudget, let's consider using that surplus to address a real economic \ndisaster which has huge consequences if we do not do something to help \nout family farms.\n  Some say, well, we should use the surplus for a tax cut. There is \ncertainly room for a tax cut. I think if it is the right type of tax \ncut and is helpful to the people who need help, we should move in that \ndirection. Should we use it for saving Social Security? Yes. Certainly, \nthat is a higher priority. But should we also use some of it to help \nsave family farms that are facing an economic disaster beyond their \ncontrol? They had absolutely nothing to do with it. The answer is yes.\n  This is what Government is all about, trying to help those who are in \nneed and creating an economic climate whereby through hard work and \nindustrial spirit they can produce and be profitable. If something \nhappens not related to anything they have done that causes an economic \ndisaster, I think we in Government have an obligation to participate in \nfinding some solution to that problem. That is why, hopefully, in the \ncoming week we will be able to join forces, Republicans and Democrats, \nand say, look, no one here caused the problem but, by golly, we had \nbetter work together in order to solve it; otherwise, we will not have \ndone our duty. I certainly want to participate in that effort and plan \nto be very actively involved.\n  Just this week we had a very good meeting with the Secretary of \nAgriculture, Dan Glickman. The Secretary understands the nature of the \nproblem. He understands the severity of it. He also understands that \nmany of the programs we have on the books simply are not enough to \naddress the problems that we are experiencing this year, and he has \npledged his cooperation to try to come up with something that can \nprovide the type of direct financial assistance that is certainly \nneeded in my State of Louisiana. I look forward to accomplishing that \nin the coming weeks.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/11/senate-section/article/S10264-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "11", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
