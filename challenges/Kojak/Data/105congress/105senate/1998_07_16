The President \n     should use the administrative tools available to him to use \n     Commodity Credit Corporation and unused Export Enhancement \n     Program funds for humanitarian assistance.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nregarding the problems that our farmers are experiencing and what we \ncan do to ease the burden of uncertainty and risk that every farmer \nfaces.\n  As those of us from States with major ag economies know, and as my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle have discussed, farmers across \nthe Nation have legitimate concerns about the prices they receive for \ntheir products. I know, as do my colleagues who represent ag States, \nthat commodity prices are not good.\n  Making that problem worse, in Iowa, for example we are looking at the \npossibility of a bumper crop and we still have nearly 40 percent of \nlast year's grain in storage, which obviously, will work to keep prices \nlow.\n  I am not here to say everything is just fine with the ag economy \nright now. But I am here to say that in addressing these problems we \nmust take our marching orders from farmers and the folks who represent \nfarm interests such as Farm Bureau, the corn growers and the soybean \nproducers, among others. Opening up the 1996 farm bill, as some \nadvocate, is not the way to legitimately address these very real \nconcerns. And it is not what these very respected farm organizations \nadvocate, and I must say, it is not what farmers in my State have been \ntelling me to do. Nonetheless, we need to do something to alleviate the \nworries our farmers face. Earlier this year, representatives of all the \nmajor agriculture organizations came to Capitol Hill to discuss the \nproblems the ag industry is facing. Frankly, opening up Freedom to Farm \ndid not make their list of priorities. In fact, this list consisted \nalmost entirely of initiatives to support and enhance trade \nopportunities. Farmers tell me the most important thing Congress can do \nto ensure the long-term prosperity of the family farm is to open and \nexpand foreign markets for their products. That's why we must give our \nfarmers the opportunity to compete for every sale, in every market in \nthe world.\n  In fact, the message that we were sending to the rest of the world \nwhen we passed Freedom to Farm is that we intend to compete for every \nmarket anywhere in the world and we are going to be a sure supplier in \nthat market.\n  We in the Senate ought not be telling farmers what they should want \nand need. We should be listening to farmers and doing what they tell us \nis important. That is what my resolution is all about. My resolution is \nnothing less than a commitment to the American farmer that we have \nheard you and we share the principles that you support and we will work \nwith you to make those principles a permanent part of farm policy.\n  It is a reiteration of the principles of Freedom to Farm. But it is 3 \nyears later a reiteration of what we ought to be doing and an admission \nthat in some places we have come up short as far as the marketing \nopportunities we promised that they should produce and that there will \nbe markets for that product.\n  And as we know, at least in my part of the country, we export about \n40 percent of our production, so farmers have to have open markets. \nThey must be overseas. Anybody who wants to price the United States out \nof the world market is saying that we ought to shut down 40 percent of \nour productive capability. That is not only intolerable for farmers, \nbut it is economically disadvantageous to small business people of \nAmerica who depend upon the business that farmers bring to them, both \nin processing of our agriculture products as well as inputs in \nagriculture.\n  So I do not pretend that there is anything new here. But I do intend \nto carry out the principles of Freedom to Farm, which is dependent upon \nmarket-opening opportunities overseas. There is a crisis in trade \npolicy right now and we need to focus more on it. And some of that \ncrisis is politically oriented. There is not enough activity in this \ntown on market promotion and on setting a political tone that the \nUnited States will continue to be a leader in market-opening \nnegotiations around the world, which we have been for the last 50 \nyears, and it is an expression of all of these things coming together, \nthat we have to have more of an emphasis on trade opportunities.\n  So this Sense-of-the-Senate resolution states that we in Congress \nshould act on a variety of measures that have been endorsed by \nagriculture groups as providing the best hope for farmers across the \ncountry for sustained economic growth and opportunity. These measures \ninclude fast-track negotiating authority for the President, legislation \nthat I introduced establishing farm and ranch savings accounts, \nsanctions reform legislation, normal trading status with China, \nstronger oversight on international trade agreements affecting \nagriculture, additional estate and capital gains tax reform, full \ndeductibility of health care insurance for self-employed individuals, \nreducing the regulation on farmers, and finally using the CCC and the \nEEP funds for food aid.\n  Mr. President, these are reforms that the leaders of the farm groups \nwe met with have asked for. Many of these items were also promised to \nfarmers when we passed the 1996 farm bill. It is time for Congress to \nlive up to these promises.\n  We have heard today and in the days past in the debate on this bill \nabout the serious problems facing American farmers in the northern \nplains States, particularly the Dakotas. So I met with North Dakota \nGovernor Ed Schafer yesterday morning, and he told me about the serious \ncircumstances in which his farmers find themselves. But he also told me \nemphatically that reopening Freedom to Farm would be a tremendous \ndisservice to his constituents; that doing so would not give his people \nthe help they need. It is time that we show our solidarity with the \nAmerican farmer and pledge to give these hard-working men and women \nfundamental, long-term assistance that they count on from year to year \nrather than so-called emergency measures.\n  I have lived and worked on a family farm all of my life. My son \noperates our family farm. I know that farmers are independent, and I \nknow they want as little Government interference in their business as \npossible. The initiatives listed in my resolution will help ensure that \nindependence. It will help make sure that the promises of Freedom to \nFarm, that the farmer was going to be able to operate according to the \nmarketplace and not according to the dictates of bureaucrats in \nWashington, DC, are adhered to.\n  The 1996 farm bill took positive and necessary steps to bring this \nabout for the American farmer. Some in this body would reverse that \nprogress. Let's show that we really listen to farmers' concerns and put \nthe Senate on record as supporting our farmers in the initiatives they \nhave asked. I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation. It is a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. It does not change any policy, but it \nreaffirms what we did 3 years ago. It acknowledges the problems that \ncome from the Southeast Asian economic situation--less exports going to \nthat part of the world and a deteriorating income situation because of \nthat.\n  Now, some people might say, well, what is different than 2 days ago \nor just yesterday when there were some negative votes for some help for \nthe American farmer offered by people on the other side of the aisle? \nWell, the difference is this. Those programs would have changed Freedom \nto Farm. Those programs would have been short\n\n[[Page S8271]]\n\nterm rather than long term. Those programs would not have been budget \nneutral. Keeping the budget balanced to keep interest rates low for \nAmerican farmers is very, very important.\n  But what has also happened is very bad signals coming from the White \nHouse. Now, let me emphasize--very bad signals coming from the White \nHouse and coming within the last 24 hours, and so this was not a part \nof the political environment when we were talking about farm \nlegislation yesterday and the day before. The White House is sending \nvery clear signals through the business community of America that they \ndo not want fast-track trading authority for the President brought up \nthis year. They do not want to vote on it.\n  So we are hearing from the White House, for the first time, that the \nUnited States should withdraw from leadership in world trade as a \nmatter of fact because of the absence of policy we have had, because we \nhave not had fast-track negotiating authority for the last 4 years. But \nnow there is a signal sent that nothing should be done about fast \ntrack.\n  To this point, the administration kept telling us we should be \npushing for fast-track trading authority because this President wants \nit, and also because it has been the tradition of this country since \nWorld War II to lead in this area. The administration sent signals, \nboth through the legislation and the activity of the White House, that \nthe president wants to continue to get this authority, to continue to \nlead.\n  But now I hear there are meetings going on at the White House with \nthe business community where the administration is sending a signal \nthat, no, now is not the time for fast track. Well, this is the first \ntime in 50 years that now is not the time for the President of the \nUnited States, Republican or Democrat, to be a leader in breaking down \nbarriers to free trade so that our farmers can export and be prosperous \nbecause of it.\n  Now, when we are in this environment, where the administration is \nsending this signal that they do not want fast-track trading authority, \nthen it is time for us to reiterate Congress' stand, which has been the \nstand of this Congress since World War II, that we should be a leader \nin marketing opportunities for our farmers, for our businesses, and for \nour services in America.\n  It is a sad day to hear, particularly for those involved with us in \nthe Senate who are leaders in international trade, that we are not \ngetting the support from the White House that we need to pass fast \ntrack. It does not send a very good signal to the people we have been \nworking with around the world for the last 50 years, looking to the \nUnited States for leadership, that the United States doesn't want to \nlead. We are saying to the rest of the world: You lead. We are saying \nto the rest of the world: We don't see that it is necessary for us to \nbe at the table. We don't think it is necessary for the President of \nthe United States to be at the table to protect our farmers, to be at \nthe table to protect our business interests, to be at the table to \nprotect our producers that want to export.\n  This is an intolerable situation. If we do not reverse this policy, \nthe legacy of this administration is going to be that the United States \nhas withdrawn from world leadership in trade barrier reduction. I don't \nthink that is the legacy this President wants. I don't think that is a \nvery good legacy for this country as we go into the 21st century.\n  What is so important? It is not just the economic opportunities we \nlose, but commerce breaks down barriers between people. Commerce \npromotes peace. Commerce is going to expand the world economic pie for \na growing population so we have more for more people rather than less \nfor more people, not only from the standpoint of the quality of their \nlife but from the standpoint of their ability to just survive--just \nsurvive. When we have a growing economic pie, we are going to have more \npolitical stability in the world and we are going to promote the \nprocess of world peace.\n  That is what is at jeopardy when a President of the United States is \nsending a signal--or even his staff is sending a signal--to the \nbusiness community of America: Forget fast track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my colleague from Kansas asked whether \nhe might speak, and then I know the Chair wants to speak briefly. I \nwill be pleased to defer to my colleague. I ask unanimous consent that \nI then be allowed to follow those two Senators.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I especially thank my colleague from \nMinnesota. I know he will have some important things to say, too.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Grassley amendment. \nWhile this vote is nonbinding, as the Senator has said, I believe it \ndoes give the Senate the opportunity to make a very important statement \non our commitment to our farmers and ranchers. We have had a rather \nspirited and I think a rather good debate in these past few days in \nregard to the many challenges that face farm country. I think this \namendment is very clear. It simply lays out the issues Congress must \naddress before we finish this session. Time is certainly drawing near. \nThe time for action is now.\n  None of these issues, as the distinguished Senator from Iowa has \npointed out, is more important than fast-track trade negotiating \nauthority. Senator Grassley did actually consider offering the fast \ntrack as an amendment to this bill, but obviously, due to the need to \ncomplete this bill, he has decided not to offer the amendment. So we \nhave a sense of the Senate, if you will, that this is our priority \naction. That does not mean we should not come back to the issue as of \nthis session, and that is the plan.\n  Before the Senator leaves the floor, let me point out, I do not know \nanybody in this Senate who has been a more distinguished leader in \nbehalf of agriculture than the Senator from Iowa. There is an \nexpression in farm country that you need to sit on the wagon to be able \nto listen to farmers. Chuck Grassley is the personification of that. \nThere isn't anybody who speaks more in concert with the corn producer \nof Iowa or the hog producer of Iowa or livestock producer or any other \nfarmer in Iowa, and I think that is reflective of his position of \nleadership in the Senate and all throughout the country.\n  As a matter of fact, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution mirrors a \nletter sent to the President, to the Secretary of State, the Secretary \nof Agriculture, to the distinguished Democratic leader, to our leader. \nThis is the letter I referred to in my remarks when we had the debate \non the Daschle amendment. It was sent, as I have said, to the \nPresident, the Secretary of State, to our Special Trade Representative, \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, everybody on the House Committee on \nAgriculture, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Ways and Means.\n  The person who really paid attention to this was, in fact, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa. He pretty much took what these farm \norganizations--and I might add, it is: the American Farm Bureau \nFederation, the American Soybean Association, the National Association \nof Wheat Growers, the National Barley Growers Association, the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, the National Corn Growers--obviously they \nwould be here if Senator Grassley did it--the National Cotton Council \nof America, the National Grain Sorghum Producers Association, National \nGrange, National Oilseed Processors Association, National Pork \nProducers Council, National Sunflower Association.\n  They had a meeting with Senator Lott and 12 Senators, attended by \nSenator Grassley. Not content with just saying, ``Here's the list of \nwhat we need to do,'' Senator Grassley has come to the floor of the \nSenate and said, ``These are our marching orders. It's the sense of the \nSenate that we do these things.'' Consequently, he listened to \nagriculture. He followed the farm summit that the agriculture leaders \nof America had with Republican Senators, and this is bipartisan as \nwell. So I certainly credit him in that regard.\n  I do have some concern about the President first saying, ``Yes, let's \ndo this,'' and then, ``Perhaps, you know,\n\n[[Page S8272]]\n\nlet's not.'' So, consequently, in that regard I am happy that both the \ndistinguished majority leader of the Senate, Senator Lott, and Speaker \nof the House Newt Gingrich, have indicated we will vote on fast track, \nand hopefully it can be combined with IMF funding, a Caribbean \ninitiative, or the African trade bill. I cannot think of a more \nimportant message to say to our farmers or more important work that we \nshould do prior to this session ending.\n  With that, I thank, again, the Senator from Minnesota, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I have suggested to the Democratic \nmanager, on the other side, that this amendment ought to be accepted. \nBut I understand that there are some Senators who have objections to \ncertain provisions of the resolution.\n  My observation is that at the beginning of the debate on this bill \nthere was a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which we approved \nunanimously on a recorded vote, that talked about the plight of \nagriculture, the problems in production agriculture, the low prices in \nsome commodities, disasters that occurred in some parts of the country. \nIt is a very uneven situation in agriculture right now. But the serious \nproblems are serious. There are serious problems that need the \nimmediate attention, as that resolution said, of the Congress and the \nPresident. This resolution spells out what some of those specific \nthings are that can be done by the Congress and the President to \nrelieve problems in production agriculture and strengthen our \nagricultural economy.\n\n  So I applaud the Senator from Iowa for going further than the sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution in getting into the details of some specific \nideas that he has for improving the plight of farmers and those \ninvolved in the agriculture sector. I intend to support the resolution. \nI recommend the Senate approve it. There will be some others who will \nhave other ideas, and they are here on the floor to speak to them, but \nI suggest to Senators, if you do want to be heard on this resolution, \nyou should come to the floor and express yourself on the resolution, \nbecause I expect we will vote on it--whether it is a voice vote or a \nrecord vote--and that could occur soon.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I just want to echo the words of my chairman, Senator \nCochran, and state, first of all, this is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. So the world is not going to come to an end, no matter how \nstrenuously somebody might object to a particular provision of the \nbill. I would have been willing--when I came on the floor, I discussed \nit with Senator Cochran--I would be willing to accept it and go to \nconference with it. It doesn't seem all that ominous to me. But there \nare some really strenuous objections on this side. So I suppose, as the \nchairman said, we are going to have to have a vote on it. I not only \nfind nothing objectionable, I find a lot in it to commend.\n  I think it is an excellent, very thoughtfully crafted proposal, and I \nagree with every one of the items he has listed here. I understand, as \nI say, that there are strong feelings on the other side.\n  In conclusion, this is one of those things--I see my colleague from \nArkansas seeking the floor, and I think I know which provision he \ndislikes intensely in it, and Senator Byrd, I think, has voiced \nobjection to the fast-track provision. I wish we could adopt it on a \nvoice vote. If we can't do that, why, then do something else. Maybe we \ncan get Senator Grassley on the floor and at least get a time agreement \non this amendment. It is the kind of amendment that can just go on all \nday long and it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We never will get \nthe bill passed if we spend this much time on sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions. We have a lot of work to do here. If we finish this bill \ntoday, we will be lucky, in my opinion.\n  In any event, Mr. President, I hope that people who want to speak on \nthis bill will hurry to the floor and get said whatever they want to \nsay, and we can get Senator Grassley on the floor and maybe work out a \ntime agreement so we have some definition of what the day in front of \nus is going to look like. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other distinguished Senator from Arkansas \nis recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, before I raise my \nconcerns about this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, I pay my respects \nand my thanks to the Senator from Iowa for his leadership and his \nadvocacy for agriculture, as well as the Senator from Kansas, who is \npresiding at this time, for his many years of service to agriculture \nand service to our country as a proponent and advocate for the \nagriculture community. I think that the intent of the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution is admirable. It has many very laudable provisions. \nCertainly, I am a proponent of fast track. We need to give the \nPresident fast-track authority. I regret that President Clinton has \nexpressed his unwillingness to pursue that aggressively in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I applaud the Speaker of the House for scheduling \na vote in September on fast-track authority.\n  I believe the votes are there to pass fast-track authority in the \nSenate, and I hope we have the opportunity to do that. I hope we have \nmore than sense of the Senate. I hope we will, in fact, have the \nopportunity to give the President that negotiating authority, which I \nbelieve will be an important step in opening markets for the \nagriculture community. I am glad that we have a sense of the Senate \nthat has that provision in it.\n  I also applaud the provisions regarding sanctions reform. I believe \nvery strongly that we misuse the sanctions tool. Sanctions is not a \npolicy; sanctions is a tool, and it is a tool that we should not \nabandon. We have only three great tools: one is military, one is \neconomic, and one is diplomatic. We need all three of them, and it \nwould be a mistake for us to make a wholesale abandonment of the use of \nsanctions in dealing with other nations. It would make the use of \nmilitary force a greater likelihood, and that would be a mistake.\n  There is no doubt we need to reform sanctions laws in this country, \nand I am glad to be serving on the leader's bipartisan task force to \nbring about comprehensive reform of the sanctions laws. It is \nimportant, and the leader has said by September 1, we should try to \nproduce comprehensive reform of the sanctions in this country. I don't \nknow that we will make the September 1 deadline, but it is a mistake \nfor us to prematurely begin to make those kinds of reforms \nincrementally. I think we should wait for a comprehensive approach to \nsanctions reform, but I am glad to support the sense of the Senate that \nadvocates that we reform the sanctions.\n  My concern about this resolution, nonbinding though it is, is that \nthere is a provision included that would put us on record in support of \nextending most-favored-nation status to China. Next week, the House of \nRepresentatives will begin what I think will be a heated and intense \ndebate on whether we should, once again, provide most-favored-nation \ntrading status to the People's Republic of China. For the U.S. Senate, \n1 week before the House begins its debate, to have, in a sense of the \nSenate, one little provision that says, ``Yes, we should extend MFN \nand, in fact, extend MFN permanently to China,'' would be a great \nmistake. I regret that the authors of the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution saw fit to include that one provision which I think, more \nthan any other provision in this resolution, becomes controversial.\n  This week there was a headline in the Washington Post that said this: \n``Chinese Resume Arrests.''\n  Mr. President, perhaps nothing is more prophetic or revealing about \nthe lack of impact the President's recent trip will have on the future \nof democracy in China than this week's headlines announcing a multitude \nof new arrests of political dissidents in China.\n  Less than 1 week after the President of the United States ended his \ntour of China, Chinese police arrested 10 prodemocracy advocates in \nChina. I will read the first paragraph in that Post article, dated July \n12, Beijing:\n\n\n[[Page S8273]]\n\n\n       Police detained 10 democracy advocates just one week after \n     President Clinton ended a tour of China, during which he \n     emphasized the benefits of freedom and the rule of law, and \n     praised Chinese President Jiang Zemin as a man who could \n     transform this nation into a modern democracy.\n       The detainees included two cofounders of the opposition \n     China Democratic Party, who tried to register it on June 25, \n     the day Clinton began his nine-day visit.\n\n  These people were arrested for one reason: They dared to start an \nopposition party to the Communist Party in China. For daring to say we \nwill be an opposition voice, for daring to say we will dissent from the \nruling political party in China, they were arrested.\n  I asked an advocate of MFN today, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives who is a proponent of MFN, ``Sir, what would it take \nfor you to vote against normal trading status with China? What would \nthey have to do? What abuse would they have to perpetrate in order for \nyou to cast a vote against MFN?''\n  There was a thoughtful response, and I think a cause for pause. I ask \nall those who say we need to adopt a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \ntoday advocating MFN for China to ask themselves the question: What \nwould it take? Is it forced abortion? Apparently not. So a nation that \ncontinues to practice taking women who are 7, 8 and 9 months pregnant \nagainst their will forcibly to a labor camp, putting them in a cell and \nforcing them against their will to have an abortion, if that is not \nenough to deny normal trading status or MFN, what does it take?\n  China today continues to persecute religious minorities, whether they \nare Hindus, whether they are Buddhists or whether they are Evangelical \nChristians, they continue to incarcerate them, they continue to require \nregistration, they continue to monitor the messages.\n  If religious persecution is not enough to deny MFN for China, what \ndoes it take? What would they have to do? China continues to \nproliferate weapons of mass destruction. In committee testimony this \nweek, officials of this Government admitted they cannot guarantee that \nChina is not today continuing to proliferate. So if the proliferation \nof missiles and weapons technology is not enough to deny MFN, what does \nit take? What would it require that we say no to giving them normal \ntrading status?\n  For us to go on record in light of the ongoing abuses--what a thumb \nin the eye to the U.S. Senate and to the United States of America and \nto the President of this country, within 1 week of our President's \nvisit, to round up those who dare to say, ``We would like to be an \nopposition political party,'' and who dare to call their political \nparty the Democracy Party. They rounded them up and put them in jail. \nHow ironic that the President would refer to, and I quote the \nPresident's words in his speech in China, what he called ``a steady \nbreeze of freedom blowing through China.''\n  That gentle breeze has become a brittle wind chilling any hope for \ntrue freedom--freedom of speech, freedom of political expression, \nfreedom of religion in this Communist nation.\n  So while there were dazzling pictures and eloquent rhetoric about \nhuman rights, the President's tour of China was full of missed \nopportunities and mistakes that are sure to have a much more \ndetrimental impact on human rights in China in the long run than the \nbenefit of any short-term afterglow.\n  I will not today itemize what I think were the missed opportunities \nduring the President's trip to China. But there is one--there is one--\ncertainty, that on the heels of that trip, the Chinese Government once \nagain cracked down on those who would make the mildest of political \ndissent and seek to register as a new political party.\n  Any pretense that the government, the regime, that dominates China \ntoday is moving toward reform and democracy should have been dispelled \nby what they did this week. And for the U.S. Senate to say, we are \ngoing on record in favor of most-favored-nation status, in view of what \nthey did, I think would be a great mistake.\n  I would welcome the opportunity for the sponsors of this amendment to \nsimply take the MFN provision out of this sense of the Senate; and I \nwould wholeheartedly support it. But I think it is a mistake for us to \ngo on that kind of record in view of what China has done in the wake of \nthe President's recent trip in which he spoke so eloquently for freedom \nand for democracy.\n  I add, to my colleagues in the Senate, that it was this week that the \nCommunist government in China rebuked the U.S. Senate for our audacity \nin passing a resolution reaffirming our traditional support for Taiwan.\n  I believe the President made mistakes in his trip to China, and I \ncould enumerate them. But the greatest mistake was this: pinning our \nhopes for democratic reform in China to this regime. And the laudatory \ncomments made about Jiang Zemin and the expression of the belief that \nhe would be the leader to move in a transition from the current \ntotalitarianism and repression to democracy and freedom, that hope was \nsurely dashed in the actions of the Chinese Government this week.\n  I ask my colleagues to think again. I ask my distinguished colleague \nfrom Iowa, whom I admire and respect so much, to rethink the inclusion \nof a pro-MFN statement in this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my colleagues--I have been waiting for \nawhile--have asked me whether they could have a minute--a minute, I say \nto my colleague from Arkansas--to speak.

Mr. President, yesterday the Congressional Budget \nOffice released its annual midyear review. I believe every Senator \nshould acquaint himself with it. This CBO analysis speaks volumes about \nthe success that the Republican-led Congress has had in putting the \nFederal Government's fiscal house in order--because policies aimed at \nreducing Federal spending, stimulating economic growth, coupled with \nthe passage of the Balanced Budget Act last year have produced \nremarkable results.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which is our official scorekeeper \nand economic analysis group, now projects that there will be a Federal \nbudget surplus of $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Let me repeat, \nthe Congressional Budget Office now projects a Federal budget surplus \nof $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. This is up significantly from \nthe $650 billion, 10-year number they gave us in January.\n  The Budget Office forecasts surpluses of $63 billion for this year; \nbut they tell us that surplus will grow, rising to $80 billion in 1999; \n$251 billion in 2008. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nthe total accumulated surplus--I repeat --during the next 10 years will \nbe a whopping $1.6 trillion.\n  More importantly, the Budget Office projects that in the second 5 \nyears, from 2003 to 2008, we will produce a $168 billion operating \nbudget surplus. That means a surplus, excluding the money borrowed from \nSocial Security.\n  For those who said they wonder when the day will ever come when we \nwill have a balanced budget, having returned to the Social Security \ntrust fund whatever was used in the general funding of this Nation, the \nCongressional Budget Office says that day will arrive in the year 2003. \nAnd it will produce a very genuine and solid $40 billion a year, more \nor less, in a genuine surplus on budget, taking into consideration the \nSocial Security trust fund in its entirety.\n\n  In other words, under the leadership of this Congress, we have moved \nfrom Federal budgets that produced deficits for as far as the eye can \nsee to budgets that project surpluses for as far as the eye can see. I \nbelieve we must now\n\n[[Page S8274]]\n\nmove to protect this surplus from those who would use it to expand \nGovernment. Rather, our first priority must be to protect and preserve \nthe fiscal integrity of Social Security for the future.\n  We are committed to that goal. But we are also committed to providing \nneeded tax relief to our hard-working families. We now know that we \nwill have an operating surplus, roughly $40 billion a year, beginning \nin the year 2005. Therefore, I believe we must see to it that this \nsurplus is available for tax cuts for the American people and that we \nnot spend this money to grow Government. Let us spend this money to \ngrow the paychecks of Americans.\n  Mr. President, there will be a lot of talk about this Congressional \nBudget Office's re-estimating of our national fiscal policy. I commend \nit to those who are concerned, legitimately concerned, about where we \nought to go in the future based upon our successes.\n  I also would like Senators to know that the Congressional Budget \nOffice did not assume a robust, strong, growing economy for the entire \nnext 10 years. They have taken into consideration the potential, \nalthough we hope it will not occur, of a downturn in the economy, and \nwe still have these kinds of surpluses--indicating that the economy is \nvibrant, productive, that the increases in productivity are far greater \nthan we have estimated in the past, tax revenues are growing faster \nthan we estimated in the past.\n  Clearly, an opportunity now is before us to make sure Social Security \nis taken care of and also to look carefully and surely right in the eye \nof, Should we give tax cuts to the American people? I think the answer \nis going to be a resounding yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to speak \nbriefly as if in morning business, and then go right to this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my colleagues \nfor their courtesy. I will definitely speak to the amendment in a \nmoment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8273-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AUTOWORKERS OF FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, for more than 5 weeks, the Nation's \nlargest industrial corporation has been locked in a labor dispute with \nworkers in two of its Flint, MI, plants. I do not believe that we have \nhad any discussion on the floor of the Senate about this. I want to \nspeak about it. The company and the workers are fighting over local \nissues--health and safety, speeding up the production lines, and \nsending work to outside suppliers--but these local disputes also \nhighlight a broader national concern that affects millions of working \nAmericans: how U.S. corporations invest, how they compete, and where \nthey invest.\n  GM's hard-line stance and labor-war tactics endanger the livelihoods \nof tens of thousands of workers in the automotive industry and in the \nindustries that rely on auto production for their business. Ironically, \nthese hardball tactics also undermine the very competitiveness that GM \nsays it wants. Competitive firms need good labor relations; and good \nlabor relations begin with a handshake, not a 2 by 4.\n\n  Monday's Washington Post reported that high-level negotiations to end \nthe strike broke down Sunday ``amid signs the auto maker now may be \nwilling to risk an all-out labor war.'' The company has asked an \narbitrator to rule on the legality of the strike. The union has said \nfine. But GM's vice president in charge of labor relations broke off \nnegotiations, refusing to even participate further in talks to reach an \noverall solution to the strike. The Post further reported, ``A GM \nsource said some top company officials are pushing for a form of \ndrastic action to `send a clear message to the UAW' * * * Options \nreportedly under consideration, the source said, range from a legal \naction challenging the walkout * * *; cutting off health-care benefits \nto all UAW members idled by the strike; or shutting down the two \nstrike-bound parts plants in Flint, Mich., and contracting out the \nwork. Such a move,'' the Post explained, ``would amount to an all-out \nwar.''\n  GM has taken the first step, filing a lawsuit against the union. GM \nwould apparently rather sue than negotiate. They would rather fight \nthan talk. The Post has reported that, ``Company sources said the \nlawsuit is probably the first step in an escalating war between the \ncompany and the union.''\n  This is no way for the Nation's largest industrial organization to \ntreat its workers and their representatives. The duly recognized \nrepresentatives of GM workers, the United Auto Workers, had sought to \nnegotiate a global settlement. GM senior representative should come \nback to the table.\n  Yes, GM has every right to seek to improve productivity and profits. \nBut as yesterday's New York Times reported, ``G.M.'s biggest \nproductivity problem lies in its auto parts factories, which were * * * \nstarved of investment during the 1980's * * * and have antiquated \nmachinery as a result.''\n  GM entered into agreements with the United Auto Workers to invest \nmore in its American operations but has fallen short of making new \ndemands on workers before it would comply with what it had already \npromised.\n  What is really at stake here are American jobs--good jobs, with good \nbenefits. The workers at GM's Flint parts plants are fighting to \npreserve those American jobs. Over the next 2 years, in this act alone \nGM threatens to transfer about 11,000 of these jobs to subcontractors \nor out of the country altogether. GM's workers are justifiably \nconcerned with what the New York Times calls ``G.M.'s steady push to \nbuild factories overseas while slowing investment in its low-profit \nAmerican operations.''\n  GM should stop fighting its workers and get back to investing in the \ncreation of those good jobs which bring good benefits right here in the \nUnited States. Strikes are hard on everyone--on the company, on the \neconomy, and hardest of all on the men and women on the picket line. \nThe best way for GM, or any corporation, to avoid picket lines is to \naddress the underlying problems that lead to strikes, not to challenge \nthe right of workers to strike.\n  The free world looked upon strikes in the 1930s with hope, because, \nas Franklin Roosevelt said in 1939, ``Only in free lands have free \nlabor unions survived.'' As long as there have been unions, we have \nknown that the right to strike and liberty go hand in hand.\n  That is why, in 1860, Abraham Lincoln told striking New Haven shoe \nfactory workers, ``Thank God we have a system of labor where there can \nbe a strike.''\n  I have confidence in the auto workers of Flint, MI. Although I stand \nhere today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, in my heart I stand with \nthe auto workers of Flint, MI. They know the history of work, the auto \nworkers of Flint, MI.\n  It was the auto workers of Flint, MI, who, on December 30, 1936, \ncalled another strike against the same company, General Motors. The \ngoal of that strike was simple, too. All the strikers wanted was for GM \nto recognize the union. For over 6 weeks, the auto workers of Flint, \nMI, stopped production in the famous Sit-Down Strike of 1937. They \nslept on unfinished car seats and ate what food their families could \nslip through the factory windows. The auto workers of Flint, MI, faced \ntear gas, heat shutoffs, and company security guards. Led by their new \n29-year-old president of Local 174, a man named Walter Reuther, and the \ngreat union leader, John L. Lewis, the auto workers of Flint, MI, \nprevailed.\n\n  Because the auto workers of Flint, MI, were willing to strike, the \nauto industry was forever challenged. Because the auto workers of \nFlint, MI, were willing to strike, over the years the automotive \nindustry became a source of good jobs with good benefits and the Nation \nprospered. GM was the most successful auto maker in the world when it \npaid the highest wages, not the lowest. Americans want to be the \nbeneficiaries of a more competitive firm, not their victims. And that \nis exactly why the auto workers of Flint, MI, walk the picket lines \ntoday.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8274-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8275-S8281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3172\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wanted to briefly speak to this \namendment, as well, and I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I \ndon't know ultimately how we will dispense with this. I understand \nthere has been some change in the language from the original amendment \nthat was brought to the floor.\n  By the way, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of the \nSenator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson.\n  In addition, I would like to say to my colleague, Senator Grassley \nfrom Iowa, a colleague for whom I have a tremendous amount of respect, \nthat there are some provisions in this amendment I just don't quite \nunderstand. The idea of most farmers right now being able to put money \nin IRAs just doesn't make a lot of sense. If I go to northwest \nMinnesota this weekend and I say, ``We have a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that talks about your being able to put all the extra money \nyou are making into IRAs, tax free,'' they are going to look at me like \nI have been living on the Moon. What good does it do for farmers who \nare going under to have a provision talking about IRAs--that you can \ntake all the extra money you have and put it into savings?\n  For the last several days we have been talking about a farm crisis. \nWe have been talking about 20 percent of the farmers in Northwestern \nMinnesota in economic trouble. We have been talking about people not \nbeing able to cash-flow. Why are we talking about IRAs, tax-free \nsavings, for people who not only can't save but can't cash-flow on the \nrecord low prices they are getting?\n  Second, we can talk about trade and fast track and all the rest. Our \nfarmers can compete with anybody, anywhere, anytime, if we have fair \ntrade. But in all due respect--and my colleague from North Dakota \ntalked about this the other day--if I was to take a look at the United \nStates-Canadian Free Trade Agreement, which was the precursor to NAFTA, \nwhich then superseded that agreement, and asked the wheat farmers in \nnorthwest Minnesota, ``How are you doing on the basis of that trade \nagreement?'' they would say, ``What are you all talking about? You cut \nan agreement that did great for intellectual property rights, that did \nwell for all the big grain companies, but left us completely out in the \ncold. Why in the world would you want to extend or expand that trade \nagreement that never gave us a fair shake or level playing field in the \nfirst place?''\n  Maybe the wording of this amendment has changed, and maybe everybody \ncan agree, but I only saw the original version; I was down here on the \nfloor listening to my colleague from Iowa. I have to say, maybe we hear \nwhat we want to hear. Maybe we talk to different kinds of farmers. \nMaybe there is something else that explains this. But I have been to a \nfair number of farm gatherings, now called ``farm crisis meetings.'' \nWhen you walk into a school in northwest Minnesota, there is a sign \noutside ``Farm Crisis Meeting.''\n  When people start talking about what is happening to them, there are \ntwo things that I hear: No. 1, we need some direct assistance; this is \na disaster. In northwest Minnesota, that means scab disease, wet \nweather, and low prices.\n  My colleague, Senator Conrad, I think, will have an amendment on the \nfloor talking about indemnity payments. People are saying, ``In the \nhere and now, please get that payment to us.'' It is like in Ada, \nMinnesota, I say to my colleague from North Dakota. We got hit with the \nflooding. It destroyed the high school. FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Assistance, came in with direct grant money that enabled the \ncommunities to rebuild their school. That is what we are talking \nabout--some direct assistance to family farmers so that they can \nrebuild their lives, so they at least have a chance to go on and don't \ngo under.\n  The other thing that I hear farmers talking about over and over and \nover again is price. In all due respect, this Freedom to Farm \nlegislation which my colleague, Senator Grassley from Iowa, talks \nabout, and I have heard other colleagues talk about staying the course, \nis a disaster. When prices were up, yes, people were for it--some \nwere--when there were the transition payments. But we cut out the \nsafety net; we took away from farmers their ability to have any \nleverage and get a fair price in the marketplace. Farmers can't cash-\nflow on less than $2 a bushel of corn and $2.58 a bushel of wheat. It \nis that simple. I think I am pretty good at arithmetic. If on every \nbushel of corn and every bushel of wheat you continue to lose a lot of \nmoney because it costs you far more to produce it than the price you \nget, then just producing more bushels of corn and more bushels of wheat \nwill put you further into debt.\n\n  The way it works, colleagues, vis-a-vis trade, is we should go with \nthe trade, go with the exports. But if you don't get the loan rate up, \nthe family farmers have no leverage with the grain companies, and the \ngrain companies make the money on the trade; it is not the family \nfarmers. The loan rate is what is key to the price. We are talking \nabout price. It is like when I was teaching in Northfield, MN, at \nCarleton College, I remember one evening bringing in a bunch of farmers \nfrom the community so they could teach the class. Many of the students, \neven though Rice County, where they lived, was very much an \nagricultural county, hadn't had a chance to learn that much about \nagriculture. I remember one farmer coming in and he came up to the \nblackboard and he wrote down ``price,'' and then underneath it \n``price,'' and then underneath it ``price.''\n  I just want to say one more time, since we had this discussion on the \nfloor here today, that if we don't do something about the loan rate and \nget it up to give the farmers a price, they can't cash-flow. The \nexports will be great for the grain companies, but the farmers aren't \ngoing to get the fair price. Do you think that farmers, when they are \ndealing with the big grain companies, are dealing with Adam Smith's \ninvisible hand, some small businesses? They are dealing with a few \nlarge companies that dominate. They are facing an oligopoly. They need \nto have some leverage in the marketplace, so we need to get the loan \nrate up.\n  So, with all due respect, I am in profound disagreement about staying \nthe course on Freedom to Farm. It has become freedom to fail. It is \ngreat for the grain companies and terrible for family farmers. If you \ndon't get the price up, all the speeches and rhetoric in the world will \nnot help, and the surest, quickest, most efficient, fairest way to get \nthe price is to at least take the cap off of the loan rate.\n  We lost that amendment yesterday. We are going to come back to it \nbecause, in the fall, this situation could be even worse. In the short \nrun, to lead up to my colleague from North Dakota speaking, who is \nabout to lay down an amendment, I fully support this effort by my \ncolleague from North Dakota, which at least will get some indemnity \npayments out there and give farmers some assistance so our families can \nstay on the land and they can have a chance at least to dream about a \nbetter tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I must comment on Senator Grassley's \nsense-of-the-Senate. While I unequivocally support many of the \nprovisions within the amendment, I must voice my concern over the \nprovision regarding extending most-favored-nation trading status to \nChina.\n  For more than 20 years, the Pacific Northwest has been unable to \nbreak China's ban on our wheat. In addition, China has consistently \nbarred imports of our apples and other high quality commodities. With \nthese obvious barriers to American agriculture, I question the wisdom \nof extending MFN to China when it refuses to open its agricultural \nmarkets to our produce.\n  I have serious reservations regarding extending MFN status for China, \nbut because of the dire situation facing the family farm in America, I \nwill support Senator Grassley's sense-of-the-Senate.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Grassley amendment that is before us \ntoday expresses the sense of the Senate about a\n\n[[Page S8276]]\n\nwide array of issues, about nine different issues in all. I agree with \nsome of the ideas expressed in the amendment, but I have serious \nreservations about others.\n  Mr. President, among the ideas I favor are the provisions of the \namendment that express support for additional capital-gains and death-\ntax relief.\n  Although it is unclear from the language of the amendment what form \nthat relief should take, I hope Senator Grassley would agree with me \nthat a good approach on capital gains would be something like the 70-\npercent exclusion that would be allowed by S. 73, the Capital Gains \nReform Act, which I introduced last year. That is the same exclusion \nproposed by President John Kennedy some 35 years ago.\n  Preferably, death-tax relief would mean outright elimination of the \ndeath tax, as proposed in S. 75, the Family Heritage Preservation Act. \nThat bill, which I introduced last year, is cosponsored by 30 other \nSenators.\n  Fast-track trade authority is something that I have voted for in the \npast, and I will vote for it again. Hopefully, we will have the chance \nto do that before the year is out.\n  And I have long supported legislation that would provide full \ndeductibility for health insurance for the self-employed. There is no \ngood reason why people who are self-employed are singled out for \ndisparate treatment when full deductibility is allowed for all other \nemployees. We ought to provide 100 percent deductibility, and do it \nnow, not several years from now.\n  Unfortunately, there is more to the amendment than capital-gains and \ndeath-tax relief, health insurance, and fast track. There are other \nissues, too, and some of them are quite controversial. For example, the \namendment expresses the support of the Senate for full funding for the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). But what does full funding mean? Is \nit $3.5 billion or $18 billion--or will it be more, now that the IMF \nand Russia are talking about another bailout? Will the funding be \nconditioned on meaningful reform of the way the IMF does business?\n  We do not know the answers to these questions from the language of \nthe amendment. It is not designed to answer them, because it is merely \na sense of the Senate amendment. But without knowing the answers, I \nbelieve it would be imprudent to go on record in support of ``full \nfunding for the IMF.''\n  In fact, many of us have serious reservations about providing more \nmoney for the IMF, particularly it if is not accompanied by meaningful \nreform of the way the international agency does business. Many of us \nquestion the fundamental wisdom of having taxpayers bail out bad \nbusiness practices and bad investment decisions abroad. Therefore, I \nwould have to object to the IMF-related provisions we are considering \nhere.\n  There is also language in this amendment on economic sanctions. We \naddressed that issue yesterday when we considered the Lugar, Dodd, and \nTorricelli amendments, so I am not sure why we are considering it \nagain, particularly since the amendment does not specify what kind of \nsanctions reform is in order.\n  Most Favored Nation status for China is another controversial issue, \nand I believe we need to focus on it separately, more deliberately. \nThere are far too many issues at stake this year to be considering MFN \nstatus along with myriad others in this sense of the Senate amendment.\n  Mr. President, as I said at the outset, this is only a sense of the \nSenate amendment. It has no force of law, no effect, regardless of \nwhether it passes.\n  But I think it does cloud the record when issues like the IMF, \neconomic sanctions, and MFN status for China are coupled with things \nlike capital-gains and estate-tax reform, fast track, and health \ninsurance. I would not want support for the latter set of issues to be \nconstrued as support for the former set.\n  Since we will still need to act on separate legislation to accomplish \nthe things raised by the Senator from Iowa in his amendment, and since \nthere are some key elements of the amendment to which I object, I am \ngoing to vote against the amendment. It accomplishes nothing, and it \nadds confusion by suggesting that members either oppose or support \neverything in it. My ``no'' vote should be construed as a vote against \nthis irrelevant and confusing procedure.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, although I have great respect for the \nSenator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and I recognize that he is one of the \nSenate's foremost experts on matters that affect the Nation's farmers, \nI nevertheless strongly oppose the pending amendment. The amendment \nmerely expresses the ``Sense of the Senate,'' and in so doing would \nnot, if adopted, result in any legislative action in any of the areas \naddressed by the amendment. Nevertheless, in my years of service in \nthis body, I cannot recall having seen an amendment that attempted to \naddress so many diverse issues at one time. It amounts to a virtual \nsmorgasbord, a Dagwood sandwich, a grab bag, a hodgepodge designed to \nenable one to issue a zillion press releases rolled into one. It is \nintended to be all things to all people. It is analogous to wearing a \npinstripe suit, a plaid tie, paisley trousers, and a polka-dotted shirt \nat the same time.\n  The amendment raises ten very important matters and expresses the \nSense of the Senate that each of these ten matters should be enacted or \nundertaken by the President and Congress in short order. I will not \ntake the time of the Senate to address in detail each of the areas \ncontained in the amendment. But, for the interest of the viewers who \nmay be following this debate, it urges the President and Congress to \npass fast track trading authority--which authority, in my view, would \ngrossly undermine the constitutional prerogatives of the Legislative \nBranch to oversee trade agreements; it states that Congress should pass \nand the President sign S. 2178, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act; \nit calls for full funding of the International Monetary Fund--some $18 \nbillion--over which there is substantial controversy at this time as to \nhow much funding should be given to IMF and what reforms should be \nundertaken by that organization in order to be able to access any \nappropriations that may be provided to them; it states that Congress \nshould pass and the President should sign sanctions reform legislation \nso that the agricultural economy is not harmed by sanctioned foreign \ntrade; it urges Congress to uphold the Presidential waiver of the \nJackson-Vanik amendment to the 1974 Trade Act relating to normalizing \ntrade relation status to China; it calls on the House and Senate to \npursue a package of capital gains and estate tax reforms; it calls on \nthe President to pursue stronger oversight on all international trade \nagreements affecting agriculture; it then shifts to the question of \nproviding full deductibility of health care insurance for self-employed \nindividuals--urging the President to sign such legislation; it then \ncalls on Congress and the Administration to pursue efforts to reduce \nregulations on farmers--never mind what regulations, it just says to \nreduce regulations on farmers; and finally the tenth matter in the \namendment calls on the President to use administrative tools available \nto him to use Commodity Credit Corporation and unused Export \nEnhancement funds for humanitarian assistance.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment which is ill-conceived and should \nnot be attached to this Agriculture Appropriation Bill. It is a very \nfar-reaching resolution, basically outlining an ambitious agenda for \nthe Senate on a number of very contentious issues. I do not want to \nprematurely endorse action on all the items on this list, particularly \nbefore I have had a chance to study the actual language on which he \nproposes we act. I remind my colleagues of the old adage, ``Act in \nhaste, repent at leisure.'' Each of these matters in the amendment is \nvery important and deserves extensive consideration and debate by the \nSenate. We should not attempt to address them in this manner at this \ntime.\n  I urge Senators to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me briefly rise in opposition to the \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment that has been offered. While I think \nthere is much in that amendment to commend--and I support some parts of \nit--the first provision in that amendment is to suggest that Congress \nshould bring up and pass fast-track trade authority. I could not \ndisagree more with\n\n[[Page S8277]]\n\nthat recommendation. I cannot support a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat includes it.\n  I want to just demonstrate for my colleagues with some numbers where \nwe have been with fast-track trade authority. I know some people don't \nwant to talk about the details; they want to talk about the theory. The \ntheory is that if you have expanded trade around the world, that is \ngood for everybody. I am all for expanded trade. Put me down as a \n``yes'' checkmark on the line for expanded trade. Yes, this country \nought to be a leader in expanding trade. But this country also ought to \nbe a leader in saying that we demand and insist on fair trade \nagreements with our trading partners. And when we have trading partners \nthat don't treat us fairly, this country ought to say, stop, wait, we \nwon't allow that to continue to happen. We ought to say to the Chinese, \nJapanese, Canadians, Europeans and, yes, others that I could mention \nbut have not, when we have a relationship with you, it must be \ndifferent than the relationship we used to have just after the Second \nWorld War.\n  Just after the Second World War, almost all of our trade \nrelationships were foreign policy issues. How do you treat this \ncountry? Well, this country is weak and rebuilding, so let's give them \nconcessions here and concessions there, and we will open our market up \nto their products, and they can close their market to ours, because we \nare bigger and better and stronger and tougher and we can beat anybody \nwith one hand tied behind our back, and that is fine. For a quarter of \na century after World War II, that is the way we thought and behaved, \nand it didn't matter because we succeeded anyway. Income in this \ncountry had increased, economic growth was substantial, and we were \njust fine.\n  The second 25 years, post-Second World War, have been different. Our \ntrading partners are now stronger, better, shrewder. We still have the \nsoftheaded notion that our trade policy ought to be foreign policy. We \nsay to the Chinese, you can ratchet up in one decade a $50 billion or \n$60 billion trade surplus with the United States, or put the United \nStates in a trade deficit position with China, and it is OK. Let the \nUnited States be your cash cow for your hard currency needs. That is \nOK. We are willing to do that. With Japanese trade, as far as the eye \ncan see, there are $40 billion, $50 billion and $60 billion deficits \nevery single year that we experience.\n  We are urged to pass fast track authority. Now, fast track--which is \nthe reason I am objecting to this amendment--is a specific, unusual \nprocedure that says, let's have the American trade negotiators go \nsomewhere and negotiate a trade agreement. Almost always, it will be in \na closed room, and almost always, behind a closed door. They negotiate \nthe agreement and then bring it back. Here is the catch: Fast track \nmeans that when it is brought back to the floor of the House and the \nSenate, there are no amendments--no democracy here--just up or down. \nThere are no suggestions for improvement, no objections, no amendments. \nYou must vote up or down, yes or no, and that is fast-track authority.\n  Mr. President, let me just review a couple of the fast-track \nagreements we have had. Well, our folks went off and negotiated with \nCanada a fast-track trade agreement. At the time, we had about an $11 \nbillion trade deficit with Canada. So our negotiators got involved and \ngot behind those doors. I don't know whose ``jerseys'' they were \nwearing. I kind of wish we could buy them jerseys and they would say \n``U.S.A.,'' indicating that they represent the good old U.S.A., that \nthey are on our team, that they are negotiating for us. I kind of wish \nwe could put jerseys on them and send them into the room. I expect that \nthe people wear white shirts, and they have all the theories in mind, \nand they talk back and forth about trade theory.\n  In any event, when they did it with Canada, here is what happened. We \nhad an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada. They went in and talked \nabout their theories and did their little deal behind closed doors, and \nthey brought it back to the Congress and said, OK, there's no chance \nfor amendments. So the Congress passed it--not with my vote; I voted \nagainst it--Congress passed it, and guess what? The trade deficit with \nCanada doubles. It doubles. And the people that negotiated the \nagreement say, gee, didn't we do a good job? This is really working \nwell. Well, what school did they go to? They do a trade agreement and \nour deficit doubles, and they think we are making progress? I don't \nknow of any schools that teach that.\n  So they say, well, that is not enough. Now let's do a deal that \nincludes Canada and Mexico and call it NAFTA, and we will do it under \nfast track. So we get them all at the table, close the room, bring more \nchairs to the table and negotiate some more. Still no jerseys, I \nexpect. But they negotiate and negotiate, and they come back. Now, we \nhad a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico as we started negotiating.\n  They come back with a trade agreement, and they say to Congress, \n``Gee, you've really done a good job this time.'' And Congress votes on \nno amendments with no opportunity to change it. I didn't vote for it. \nBut Congress supports it, because fast-track trade authority prevents \nanybody from making any adjustments or changes. And the Congress then \npasses NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the time, we \nhad a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico. Guess what happened. The $2 \nbillion trade surplus evaporates, and the $2 billion trade surplus we \nhad with Mexico now becomes a $14 billion to $15 billion trade \ndeficit--$14 billion to $15 billion deficit--and the same people who \ntold us we ought to do it say, ``Gee, this is working really well.'' \nApparently they went to the same school and took the same classes.\n  Let me give you some numbers with respect to Mexico, just as an \nexample. This is how they describe these trade agreements. They say, \n``From 1993 to 1996, do you know that we increased our exports from the \nUnited States to Mexico by $14 billion?'' Why, give them a blue ribbon \nat the county fair--$14 billion increase in exports from the United \nStates to Mexico. They don't read what is on the other page, do they? \nThe other page says, ``Oh, yes, we did increase our exports to Mexico \nsome''--$14 billion. But imports from Mexico into the United States \nincreased nearly double, from $39 billion to $73 billion--$34 billion \nincrease in imports from Mexico. In fact, we now import more \nautomobiles from Mexico into the United States than the United States \nexports to all the rest of the world.\n  We were told with NAFTA, by the way, ``If you pass NAFTA, guess what \nwill happen. The products of low-skilled labor will come into the \nUnited States. That is what will happen with Mexico.''\n  What are the three largest imports from Mexico? The products of high-\nskill labor: Automobiles, automobile parts, and electronics.\n  But my point is simple. With Canada, with Mexico, the two most recent \nexamples, they are saying: Take fast track, let us negotiate it, and we \nwill essentially shove it down your throat with no opportunity for \namendment, and things will work out just fine. If history is any guide, \nwe ought to understand things don't work out fine. The NAFTA agreement \nwas not a good agreement for this country. It is not working. It has \nincreased this country's trade deficit. The agreement with Canada has \nnot worked.\n  My colleague from Minnesota and I know other people get tired of me \nsaying this and referencing the Canada agreement. And I am going to say \nit again. The Senator from Iowa acknowledges that he either heard it \nbefore or is tired of perhaps hearing it. But there is virtually a \nflood of grain coming into this country from Canada. Mr. Clayton \nYeutter, good enough fellow, was trade ambassador at the time. He went \nup to negotiate this. I was on the Ways and Means Committee in the U.S. \nHouse at the time. I have in writing from the trade ambassador a \nrepresentation that the trade agreement between the United States and \nCanada would not result in the increase in quantity of grain being \nshipped across the border either way--in writing, a guarantee from the \ntrade ambassador. That is what the two sides agreed to. It wasn't worth \nthe paper it was written on.\n  The agreement was passed. The fact is, we had this flood of unfairly \nsubsidized grain coming in. We tried to enforce our laws and get the \ninformation that we ought to get from the Canadian Wheat Board.\n\n[[Page S8278]]\n\n  By the way, in the negotiations with Canada, we said, ``We will allow \nyour state monopoly trading enterprise to ship into this country.'' It \nwould be illegal in this country, by the way, to have a state monopoly \ntrading enterprise like the Wheat Board. But we will allow that \nCanadian Wheat Board to ship into our country and unfairly compete with \nUnited States farmers and refuse to disclose information about the \nshipping costs and the cost of acquisition.\n  So we finally decided to push really hard on this, and file \ncomplaints, and so on. Then we discovered a secret deal had been made \nwith the Canadians by the trade ambassadors, and which had not been \ndisclosed to any of us, which said in terms of antidumping, and so on, \nin the United States that we agree that certain payments under the GRIP \npayment system by the Canadian Wheat Board to Canadian farmers will not \nbe included as acquisition costs for their grain, which means you would \nnever be able to prove antidumping because, by definition, they \nexcluded part of the cost of acquisition of the grain. It just \nessentially sold out American farmers.\n\n  I will never go for fast track--never--under these circumstances. It \nis not in this country's interests.\n  Is it in this country's interest to increase the Federal trade \ndeficit? If so, how? Someone explain that to me. Is it in this \ncountry's interest to do another trade agreement that increases the \ndeficit? I don't think so. Yet, what trade agreement have we in recent \nyears negotiated that has not resulted in a substantial increase in \nthis country's trade debt or trade deficit? Name one. No one in this \nChamber can name one trade agreement that has turned out in recent \nyears. That is because, as I have said before, our trade policies in \nthis country are soft-headed and weak-kneed. And, yes, that is strong \nlanguage, but it describes exactly what is happening to trade.\n  We have negotiators that negotiate fundamentally incompetent \nagreements because they don't have the nerve and will, it seems to me, \nto stand up for this country's interests. I have even thought that \nmaybe on an appropriations bill I would offer an amendment that says \nlet's add at least four or five employees down at USTR, and we will \nname them ``Backbone,'' ``Nerve,'' and will add a couple other names, \nand see if we can't inject some kind of passion to stand up for this \ncountry's interests and to say that we care about America's farmers, \nthat we care about America's jobs, and we are willing to compete with \nanybody in the world--anybody. But the competition must be fair with \nrespect to farmers. It is not fair.\n  If a state monopoly pushes the flood of unfairly subsidized grain \nacross our border, it drops the prices for American farmers. It is not \nfair. It is not fair that factory workers in this country are told: \n``You compete against 14-year-olds that work 14 hours a day for 14 \ncents an hour somewhere on the other side of the globe.'' That is not \nfair competition. Yet, that is precisely what is negotiated in these \ntrade agreements.\n  My only point is--I will simplify it because others want to speak. I \nwas going to offer a second-degree amendment to strip out the first \nprovision which would push for fast-track trade authority. But in \ndeference to time--Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers are gallantly \ntrying to run this bill through the Senate in a way that is thoughtful \nand favorable to everybody--in deference to that, I will not offer a \nsecond-degree amendment. I will just oppose the amendment that has been \noffered. I want to cooperate. I think other Members do as well.\n  I do just want to say that while there is some in this amendment to \ncommend it--some provisions to commend it, the first provision that \nsays let's start doing again that which has failed us so badly, let's \nbegin anew to stimulate trade policy that has resulted in such \nsubstantial increases in our Federal trade deficits, let's try once \nagain and see if we can't do more trade agreements that have resulted \nin such unfairness to American farmers, I say there is no sense in that \nat all.\n  Let me complete my statement by just showing a couple of charts. This \nis the trade deficit. If this isn't an avalanche of red ink, I don't \nknow what is. Those who say this is a successful strategy, I say get me \nthe names of the people who negotiated these trade agreements and let's \nmake sure they do not negotiate again for this country.\n  Let me just provide the one that shows what is happening with China. \nOur trade deficit with China is $50 billion and getting worse yearly. \nWe don't get enough wheat into China. They displaced us as a major \nwheat supplier to China, as you know. We don't get enough pork into \nChina. They consume half the world's pork. Our trade agreement with \nChina, or the agreement by which we trade with China, is fundamentally \nunfair with us. If we take your trousers, shoes, shorts, and shirts, \nyou take our beef and wheat, and don't tell us when you need to buy our \nairplanes from us, that you will only buy our airplanes from the United \nStates if they come and manufacture them in China.\n  That is not fair trade.\n  Let's stand up for this country's interest.\n  There are some who say, ``Well, when you talk like that, you are a \nprotectionist.'' I am not a protectionist. I am for expanded trade. But \nI am darned sure for insisting that this country demand fair trade.\n  Let me just, with one final chart, describe graphically what I have \ntalked about now for a few minutes.\n  In 1993, when we negotiated the trade agreements with Canada and \nMexico, we had a $2 billion trade surplus with Mexico and an $11 \nbillion trade deficit with Canada. Two years later, three years later, \nthat trade deficit went from $11 billion to $23 billion with Canada, \nand it went from a surplus of $2 billion with Mexico to a nearly $16 \nbillion deficit with Mexico.\n  If that is progress, you give them the names of people who call it \nprogress, and I think they ought to be banned from further trade \nnegotiations.\n  So I cannot support the amendment that is offered because it calls \nfor fast-track trade authority and the renewal of that authority. And \nwhile I will not offer a second-degree amendment to strip that, I will \nsimply vote against the amendment for the reasons I have stated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for just a few moments I would like to \nagree with the Senator from North Dakota on a couple of points that he \njust made. But I would also like to disagree with him on a few other \npoints.\n  He, like I, voted against the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, and we \nboth voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement because we \nfelt they were not properly negotiated. We felt both agreements had \nloopholes in them. The Senator from North Dakota has pointed out some \nof those loopholes.\n  What we disagree on is the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that is \nbefore us now which clearly outlines what a lot of farm and commodity \ngroups in this country feel they need this Congress and this \nadministration to do to improve the situation down on the farm. The \nSenator from North Dakota is right. The situation down on the farm is \nnot very good right now. There are a lot of farmers losing money. But \nthe Government should not dictate rules to farmers, and the Government \nshould not be the total safety net. In a free enterprise system, such \nas ours, there should be an element of risk. In the 1996 FAIR Act, \nCongress have offered farmers flexibility along with that risk. Today, \nthe Senate must decide how to shape that flexibility in a way to assure \nthat farmers can make a safe transition to Freedom to Farm. This is \nwhere the Senator from North Dakota and I disagree.\n\n  Yesterday I talked to the Governor of North Dakota, the president of \nthe North Dakota Farm Bureau, and representatives from the North Dakota \nWheat Growers. I left that meeting with the impression that these folks \nfrom North Dakota don't agree with the Senator from North Dakota \neither. They told me North Dakotans don't want to see Freedom to Farm \nreversed. They don't want Congress to lurch back into the failed \npolicies of the past. They don't want the Government to be the largest \nprovider of income to American agriculture, to be the one that holds \nthe hand of the farmer and\n\n[[Page S8279]]\n\ntells the farmer what to farm, how to farm, and when to farm. They \nagree that these choices ought to be made by the individual, as a free \nperson in a free market.\n  Now, Government has a role. The Senator from North Dakota is right \nwhen he states that the Government has not been fulfilling that role \nwell. However, that role is not to be a safety net. It is not to be a \ncaretaker. The proper role of the Government is to be the force which \nopens the door at the border. Government is to be a facilitator.\n  I agree with the Senator from North Dakota on that point. Our \nnegotiators ought to put jerseys when they go into trade talks. I want \nit to be Team America working for America and America's farmers. But I \ndon't want a government check to be the sole source of income to \nAmerica's farmers. Past administrations tried it and farmers became \nvictims of an agricultural system design by Government. It did not \nwork.\n  Now agriculture is in transition. Times are not easy. And all of us \nare trying to sort out what can be done to help agriculture through \nthat transition. But a step back into the past is not the route to \ntake. I believe what the resolution before us today is exactly what \nAmerican agriculture is looking for.\n  What I want to know is why was this administration asleep at the \nswitch for 12 long months while commodity prices slid and never used \nthe tools Congress have given them to make a difference? Was it \npolitics or was it simply ignorance of what was going on? Did they not \nknow what they could do and what they should have been doing?\n  What we heard from the commodity groups is very simple: Keep Freedom \nto Farm. Give us the flexibility and trade, trade, trade. They don't \nwant crops stored on the farm--not for 1 year, not for 2 years, not for \n3. They do not need a huge surplus hanging over the market. Let's move \nthe grain. Let's sell the product.\n  Yet, what has this administration done? They haven't used one tool to \nmake a difference, and they don't know how to do it. That is what is \nfrustrating to me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I can't yield. We have a time limitation. Let me close, \nand then the Senator from North Dakota can speak if he wishes, because \nthere is a lot that we agree on but there is also a lot that we \ndisagree on.\n  I do not want to look into the past. I want to look into the future. \nI want American agriculture to modernize and develop the flexibility \nthat it ought to have. I want to help them when they need help. That is \nwhat we are on the floor discussing.\n  The Senator from North Dakota talks about trade deficit. Trade \ndeficits have occurred, and I do not like it either. But I have also \nwatched our ability to trade expand with every agreement that we have \nstruck. We know that in American agriculture today, if you don't sell \n40 percent of the crop you raise in a foreign market, you are in \ntrouble financially. That is why they are in trouble financially \ntoday--because this Government, this administration, this USDA, didn't \nhelp them sell the product at a time when markets were collapsing and \nother governments were aggressively pursuing those markets.\n\n  So there are things we can do, but I hope this Senate will not step \nbackwards into a dark age of government programs, farming controlled by \nGovernment, forcing farmers to live with a government check arriving in \nthe mailbox as their only source of income. My farmers don't want that. \nMost farm groups don't want that.\n  That is what this resolution is about--to craft a sense of the Senate \nin the area of trade, in the area that deals with taxes, to offer \nfarmers the flexibility so that they won't be injured like they where \nwhen a Democrat controlled Congress in 1986 rolled back the ability of \nfarmers to use income averaging. Congress ought not make those same \nmistakes again. I don't think we will.\n  So let me conclude by saying this. There is a lot that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and I agree on. We agree on the Government's \ninability to negotiate good trade agreements. Our trade negotiators \nneed to be out there, working for agriculture.\n  I voted yesterday and I will vote today and probably again next week \nfor programs to help American agriculture out during this transition, \nbut they have to be compatible with Freedom to Farm. We can't go back \nto all kinds of on-farm programs that store the wheat and store it and \nstore it and store it for another year. Let's sell it, move it through \nthe market, so we can get on with the business of transition. That is \nwhat I think this resolution represents. I hope the Senate will support \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will take just a couple minutes, but I must respond to \nthe Senator from Idaho. There is no time agreement here. I wish the \nSenator would have allowed me to ask a question and he had responded to \nit.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to respond to a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like us to have a debate. In fact, the Senator \nfrom Idaho was winning a debate we weren't having a few minutes ago. So \nthat is the easiest debate to win. We weren't having a debate a couple \nminutes ago about price supports. We were having a debate about this \namendment. But we did have a discussion yesterday about price supports, \nand the Senator from Idaho described the Democratic Congress previously \nthat did so and so, and the President, and USDA.\n  This is not about which party has forsaken farmers. This is about, \nafter all, what can be done to help farmers survive in the future. I am \nall for this nation to say to farmers, ``Get your money from the \nmarketplace.'' I would love for a farmer to load up a truck and drive \nthat truck to the country elevator and raise that hoist and drop that \ngrain and sell it and get a decent price for it. But I will you this: \nthat farmer loses money on every load of grain and loses big money, not \nbecause of something they have done but because of a whole range of \nother reasons--because, first of all, we have bad trade agreements, we \nhave unfair grain coming in undercutting their markets, we have trade \nsanctions that mean 10 percent of the international wheat market is \noutside of their ability to sell, when they market up into the neck of \na bottle against grain trade firms that hold an iron fist around the \nneck of that bottle when they buy farm machinery and equipment--guess \nwhat. They pay for it. They pay through the nose because those prices \nare going up.\n  When they try to get their grain to a flour miller, four milling \nfirms own over 60 percent of the milling capacity in this country. The \nsame thing with wet corn milling. The same thing with meatpackers.\n  If the Senator from Idaho can tell me that a family farmer driving on \nthat lonely road in an old truck, in most cases a 10- or 12- or 15-\nyear-old truck, trying to get those few bushels of grain to market, \nhoping above hope that they will be able to get something for that \ngrain that meets their cost of living and meets their cost of \nproduction--if the Senator from Idaho can tell me that the deck isn't \nstacked against those farmers, that we don't have virtual monopolies in \nevery area they turn around, that they don't show up at a railroad \ntrack and find that there are not two or three railroads ready to serve \nthem, there is one (and in my State they will double-charge because \nthere is no competition)--if the Senator from Idaho can tell me that \nthat farmer driving that truck is driving down the road towards free \nand open and fair competition, then I say that is just fine, then we \nought to butt out.\n  But if the Senator can't say that--and I do not think he can say that \nin a million years--then somebody, somebody, had better say that family \nfarmers matter and the future of this country will be benefited and \nenhanced if we decide that family farming has value and merit.\n  I said it yesterday, and I am going to say it again. There is \nsomething so fundamentally wrong with what is happening in this country \nwith respect to agriculture. We have people starving on the other side \nof the world, people trying to eat leaves on trees because they don't \nhave food, and we have people driving their trucks to the elevator, \nsweating all year and risking everything they have in life to plant a \ncrop\n\n[[Page S8280]]\n\nand harvest it, and they are told when they get to the elevator that \ntheir grain doesn't have value, their crop doesn't have value. That is \na situation we must find a way to correct and change.\n  So, while we agree on some things, the Senator from Idaho and I, one \nthing we don't agree on is suggesting, as he has suggested, that, \n``Gee, it is the Democrats here, Democrats there.'' All of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats, have a stake in whether there are family \nfarmers in the future.\n  I wish very much that we never again have to have a farm program that \nprovides support prices. But I will say this, when grain prices \ncollapse and crops are ravaged by disease, if someone is not available \nto step in to say to family farmers, ``We are here to help; you \nmatter,'' if someone isn't around to say, ``We are not going to pull \nthe safety net out from under you because we want you in our future,'' \nthen they are not going to survive and we will have corporate \nagrifactories farming America from the west coast to the east coast. \nAnd some might be fat and happy about that, thinking it is good for the \ncountry, but it won't be me, because we will have lost something very \nimportant in rural areas of our country.\n  I know the majority leader wishes to be recognized. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I \nknow the issue is very important. I know Senators had wanted to be \nheard on it. But we have now been in session for 1\\1/2\\ hours and we \nhave been on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I wonder if the Senate \nis not prepared to vote here momentarily. I know Senator Cochran has \nbeen working on that. Senator Harkin will use just a couple of minutes, \nand Senator Daschle--did the Senator want to comment on this?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I agree with the majority leader. There \nis no reason why we can't bring this to closure. I think there is going \nto be a strong vote for it. We ought to just get on with it.\n  I will be prepared to go to a vote immediately. I know Senator Harkin \nhad a couple of minutes he wanted to speak. Then we can hold it open, \nif we have to accommodate a Senator. So we can get on with the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to do that, because someone else will come in \nand say, ``Could you delay it a little longer?'' Or, ``Do it quicker?'' \nI would like to accomplish it quickly, but it is impossible to \naccommodate everybody.\n  I want to make this point. We have had some good debate on this. I \nknow there are some important issues out there. But we need to get on \nwith it and we need to complete this bill this afternoon. I would say \nto my colleagues, we are going to have to finish it today because we \nhave other votes.\n  I hope everybody would recognize that this afternoon at some point we \nshould just start, on both sides of the aisle, moving to table all \namendments. If we had a vote right now on this bill, it would get over \n90 votes. So I hope the Senate would cooperate. I know Senator Daschle \nand the managers on both sides are trying to do that. But I am a little \nnervous that the tempo is not there yet to get this completed so we \ncould go on to other appropriations bills and so Senator Daschle and I \ncan continue to work to try to get agreement on other important issues.\n  So please let's cooperate. Let's bring this to a conclusion by the \nmiddle of the afternoon. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I agree with the majority leader. We have \nhad a good debate. We have had some very important issues debated. We \nwere on the Lugar amendment most of the day yesterday, for good reason. \nIt was a very controversial issue that I think was important. We had a \ngood opportunity to discuss it. We have had some good amendments on \nthis side.\n  But there comes a time when we have to bring this matter to a close. \nI hope my Democratic colleagues can work with the leadership here in an \neffort to come to a finite list that is narrower than the one that \ncurrently exists, in an effort to accommodate our schedule. I am \nhopeful we can do that in the next couple of hours so we have a very \ndefinitive list of what needs to be done and we can finish this bill \nsometime tonight or this afternoon.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have been listening, of course, to the \nlast couple of days of debate. I sympathize with the majority leader \nand minority leader on the issue of moving ahead with the legislation. \nI think we should. There are some very important issues here on \nagriculture. We have a crisis looming for our farmers, ranchers, and \nour rural economies all over America.\n  Maybe it has not hit with full force and effect yet, as it has in \nNorth Dakota, and maybe a couple of other places, but we are on the \ncusp of it in Iowa. I had an Iowa farmer call me yesterday. The corn \nprice in northwest Iowa is down to $1.89 a bushel, and it is dropping \nevery day. It doesn't look like it is going to get any better. There is \nnothing out there, nothing out there that is going to do anything \nbetween now and harvesttime.\n  I was checking the figures a little bit, with what we had in the \n1980s. We had corn priced in the 1980s--about 1985, it was down to \n$1.50 a bushel, and after that we had a whole wave of foreclosures and \nfarm bankruptcies. Those of us who have been around remember that in \nthe 1980s. The corn price in Iowa is getting down to that same level \nagain, when you consider the increase in the cost of inputs and \neverything like that. So we are back where we were, right before the \nwave of foreclosures and bankruptcies in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988.\n  You would think we would learn from history not to repeat that, not \nto wait too long before we respond to this crisis. But that looks like \nwhat we are going to do here. We are just going to jaw it around and \ntalk about it and not do anything.\n  I had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution a couple of days ago that \nbasically said there is a crisis out there. There are problems out \nthere. There is a sense of the Senate that the President and the \nCongress should immediately respond to this farm crisis out there. Mr. \nPresident, 99 Senators voted for it.\n  Yesterday, we really had a chance to do something about it by lifting \nthe caps on the loan rates, at least for 1 year, and giving farmers \nmore flexibility in being able to market their crops, and giving them \n15 months rather than 9 months to pay it back in a marketing loan \nprocedure--which would not leave grain hanging over the market. I heard \nthat debate around here. Obviously, people don't understand marketing \nloans if they say that. So we had a good debate on that. And we lost, \n56 to 43. Not one Member of the Republican side voted for it--not one. \nNot a single one. Yet the day before they said there was a crisis there \nand we have to do something about it.\n  Now we have another sense-of-the-Senate resolution by my colleague \nfrom Iowa. It has a lot of good language in there. There are a lot of \ngood things we ought to do. Funding IMF, I am all for that; China; \ncapital gains and estate tax reforms, I am all for that. That is good. \nOh, yes, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act, which allows farmers \nto have IRAs. That is fine, too. But before you can have an IRA, you \nhave to have some money. They don't have any money.\n  So, while my colleague's sense-of-the-Senate resolution sounds very \nnice, it doesn't do anything. So, once again, I guess the Senate is \ngoing to be the greatest deliberative body in the world. We will \ndeliberate it but we won't do anything. So that is basically what we \nhave here in this resolution.\n  I must say that I have one serious reservation about this amendment \nthe Senator from Iowa offers. It says:\n\n       Congress should pass and the President should sign S. 1269, \n     which would reauthorize fast-track trading authority for the \n     President; . . .\n\n  There may be a fast-track bill that I could support, but I cannot \nsupport that one. While I might vote for this amendment, I want to be \nclear on the\n\n[[Page S8281]]\n\nRecord that I do not support S. 1269. I had an amendment to that bill \nthat I thought had a good chance of being adopted if we ever got it on \nthe floor. We never did. But I could never vote for S. 1269 as it is \ndrafted.\n  Some of the other things in here are pretty good. I would say \nprobably about 70 percent of this amendment is pretty good, and 30 \npercent is not too good. You have to weigh those around here.\n  We can all vote for it. It might make you feel good, but it doesn't \ndo anything. This resolution doesn't do a thing to get the price up for \nour farmers. Why don't we just have sense-of-the Senate resolutions \naround here forever, then we won't have to do anything, but it will \nmake you feel good. If you want to feel good, you can go ahead and vote \nfor the Grassley amendment, but I don't think it is going to do one \nsingle thing to get the price up for our farmers that is going to help \nthem get through this next year, not one single thing. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3172. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is 12:15 and we have had one vote. We \nhave dispensed with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution on the agriculture \nappropriations bill. Now the managers are having difficulty getting \nSenators to come to the floor and offer amendments. This is beyond \nridiculous.\n  If we don't get going in the next 15 minutes or so, we are going to \ngo live on a quorum. I am going to look, then, for the next serious \naction to take, because we should be through with this bill. If \nSenators are serious, they should be here offering their amendments. If \nthey are not, then we are going so start having votes of another \nnature. We are not just going to stand in a quorum for the next hour, \nhour and a half. It is not fair to the managers. We will be here at \nmidnight tonight, and I don't think anybody wants that.\n  So again, I call on Senators to come to the floor. Surely a Senator \nhas an amendment, out of the 40 amendments we have pending, that could \nbe offered. Let's dispose of it.\n  We will wait 15 minutes, or so, to get one going and then we will go \nto a live quorum.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am in the majority leader's corner on \nthis. This is unforgivable. Maybe there is some forgiveness in the \norder because most Members on our side are in a meeting with the \nPresident right now. I am hoping that somebody will have the nerve to \nwalk out of that meeting to come over here and offer an amendment and \nget this show on the road.\n  The other thing that is mildly encouraging is that we have been going \nover the list of Democratic amendments, and an awful lot of them are \nfolding, and some are going to be accepted. I only know about three or \nfour fairly controversial amendments that are probably going to require \na rollcall vote--in the vicinity of three or four. The rest, I think, \nare either not going to be offered, or we are going to be able to \naccept them. Hopefully, we can get through here by sometime in the \nmiddle to late afternoon.\n  I certainly appreciate the majority leader's frustration, with all of \nthese amendments lying around and nobody here to offer them. In all \nfairness, the reason nobody is over here is because they are all in a \nmeeting with the President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as if in \nmorning business for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8275-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8281-S8283]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHINA TASK FORCE INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was disappointed by some of the actions of \nthe majority leader's statement the day before yesterday in which he \nprovided an update on the Senate inquiry into U.S. policy on satellite \nexports to China.\n  In particular, some charged that the majority leader was engaging in \npartisan politics when he simply presented some of the things that we \nhave learned in the 13 hearings and the numerous briefings and meetings \nheld on that subject to date.\n  As a member of the task force appointed by the leader, I can state \nconclusively, Mr. President, that this investigation is driven by a \ndesire to safeguard our Nation's security, and it is not motivated by \npartisan politics.\n  Let's examine the five main points that the leader raised in his \nremarks.\n  Point one: The Clinton administration's export controls for \nsatellites are inadequate and have not protected U.S. security.\n  Many of us have been dismayed at the lax implementation and the \nirregular application of safeguards during launches of American \nsatellites in China. For example, the Clinton administration has failed \nto require Defense Department monitors for every Chinese launch of U.S. \nsatellites. Monitors are typically Air Force officers who are required \nto be present at all meetings with the Chinese launch service provider \nand the American satellite exporter. The monitor's presence is \nnecessary because sensitive know-how can be inadvertently disclosed.\n  Chinese officials make no secret of their desire to obtain high-tech \ninformation, and the incentive for an American company to provide \ninformation\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\nnecessary for a successful launch of a multimillion-dollar satellite is \ngreat, therefore a monitor can be extremely helpful in reducing the \namount of information that is shared with Chinese engineers and \nscientists.\n\n  Although Clinton administration officials routinely note the \nimportance of monitors in testimony and briefings, under the current \nsystem, monitors are not required by statute, regulation, or \ninternational agreement. In fact, during three satellite launch \ncampaigns conducted in China since 1995, monitors have not been present \nat any stage of the process. In three other launch campaigns in China, \nthough not required by the government, monitors have been present only \nfor the launch, but not the important technical exchange meetings \ndealing with mating the satellite to the launch vehicle and ensuring \nthat it survives the stressful launch environment and is delivered \nintact to the intended orbit.\n  The majority leader's point that export controls on satellites are \ninadequate is not merely endorsed by the members of the task force. As \nthe New York Times said in an editorial on the issue on May 26, ``In \nits eagerness to improve relations with Beijing and expand American \ncommerce in China, the White House has been careless about enforcing \nsecurity protections.'' One month later, the New York Times again \ncommented on the subject in another editorial on June 19 which stated,\n\n       Evidence keeps mounting that the Chinese Army is exploiting \n     flawed American export controls to acquire sophisticated \n     satellite communications technology for military and \n     intelligence use. The Pentagon and State Department are now \n     questioning the pending sale of a Hughes communications \n     satellite whose upgraded design would let Chinese authorities \n     eavesdrop on mobile telephone conversations at home and \n     abroad. President Clinton should suspend this sale and the \n     licensing of any more satellite deals with China until export \n     control rules are tightened. In particular, he needs to put \n     the State and Defense Departments back in charge of export \n     approvals and diminish the role of the Commerce Department.\n\n  That is the New York Times speaking. That is not the majority leader. \nIt is obviously a sentiment he shares.\n  This sentiment is shared on a bipartisan basis. During a hearing of \nthe Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, \nSenator Cleland criticized the administration for shifting \nresponsibility for regulating satellite exports from the State \nDepartment to the Commerce Department stating, ``I've got more and more \nconcern about Commerce becoming the lead dog here. I'd rather hedge my \nbets and put national security first and commerce second.''\n\n  The second point made by the leader day before yesterday was that in \nviolation of stated United States policy, sensitive technology related \nto satellite exports has been transferred to China.\n  Mr. President, this is also an accurate, objective statement that is \nwidely shared. Additional hearings will be necessary to continue to \ngauge how much damage has been done to United States national security, \nbut several launches have occurred in China without the necessary \nsafeguards and at least two analyses conducted by American companies of \nfailed launches have been sent to China without first being reviewed by \nthe State or Defense Departments.\n  As the Washington Post said on May 31,\n\n       There is little dispute that some American know-how \n     inevitably seeped across to the Chinese, despite strict rules \n     covering what technology United States companies could share \n     with the Chinese and despite the monitoring of contracts by \n     United States Air Force specialists. The argument is over how \n     much seepage occurred and whether any of it helped China \n     improve its military rockets.\n\n  Again, the majority leaders' comments are vindicated by the press.\n  The third point made by the leader day before yesterday was that \nChina has received military benefit from United States satellite \nexports.\n  Additional information in this regard may be uncovered as the \nSenate's inquiry continues, but some key information has already come \nto light. Last month, in a front page story published on June 13, the \nNew York Times broke the news that,\n\n       For the past two years, China's military has relied on \n     American-made satellites sold for civilian purposes to \n     transmit messages to its far-flung army garrisons, according \n     to highly classified intelligence reports. The reports are \n     the most powerful evidence to date that the American \n     Government knew that China's Army was taking advantage of \n     the Bush and Clinton Administrations' decisions to \n     encourage sales of American high technology to Asian \n     companies.\n\n  Again, the majority leader was not wrong. He is right.\n  The fourth point made by the majority leader was that the \nadministration has ignored overwhelming information regarding Chinese \nproliferation and has embarked on a de facto policy designed to protect \nChina and United States satellite companies from sanctions under United \nStates nonproliferation law.\n  This is another objective observation about what we have learned from \nthe hearings conducted so far. And again I turn to reports in the media \nin confirmation of the majority leader's point. As the Washington Post \nreported on June 12,\n\n       The former chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's \n     weapons counter-proliferation efforts told a Senate committee \n     yesterday that the Clinton Administration's determination not \n     to impose economic sanctions on China led it to play down \n     persuasive evidence that Beijing sold nuclear-capable M-11 \n     missiles to Pakistan. ``There's no question in my mind'' that \n     China sold 34 M-11 missiles to Pakistan in November 1992, \n     Gordon Oehler, former director of the CIA's Nonproliferation \n     Center, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \n     Intelligence agencies are ``virtually certain'' the sale \n     occurred he said, but ``intelligence analysts were very \n     discouraged to see their work was regularly dismissed'' by \n     Clinton aides.\n\n  Yet despite this overwhelming evidence, the Clinton administration \nhas not imposed sanctions and as a result of the transfer of authority \nover satellite exports from the State Department to the Commerce \nDepartment, satellite exports have been shielded from the effects of \nsanctions. Prof. Gary Milhollin made this point in testimony to the \nArmed Services Committee on July 9, stating,\n\n       One of the main effects of this transfer has been to remove \n     satellites from the list of items that are subject to U.S. \n     sanctions for missile proliferation. In effect, the transfer \n     has given Chinese firms a green light to sell missile \n     technology to Iran and Pakistan. Chinese companies can now \n     sell components for nuclear-capable missiles without worrying \n     about losing U.S. satellite contracts.\n\n  The administration has been interested in shielding China from the \neffects of United States nonproliferation sanctions for some time. \nAccording to a classified National Security Council memo reprinted in \nthe Washington Times in March, the administration believed one of the \nbenefits of United States support for China's membership in the Missile \nTechnology Control Regime would be ``substantial protection from future \nU.S. missile sanctions.''\n  And again what the majority leader said is on the record. It is \nvindicated. It is not wrong.\n  The fifth and final point made by the majority leader day before \nyesterday was that new information has come to light about China's \nefforts to influence the American political process and that the \nAttorney General should name an independent counsel to investigate.\n  I serve on the Intelligence Committee which recently received \nclassified testimony from the Attorney General and the Director of \nCentral Intelligence on this subject. While obviously I will not \ncomment on that testimony here, I simply point out that over the past \nfew months a great deal of troubling information has been published on \nthe subject in the press. As the Senate investigation proceeds we may \nuncover additional information in this area, but in my view the \nappointment of an independent counsel to investigate these allegations \nis already long overdue.\n  As I have tried to demonstrate today, attempts to portray the \nmajority leader's statement or the work of the task force as partisan \npolitics are simply invalid. The protection of our nation's security \nhas been--and should be--our only concern. I urge my colleagues to \nexamine the Record before leveling such charges. Although the Senate \ninvestigation will continue, it is clear that we must change the way we \nhandle export controls on sensitive technology or risk further \njeopardizing America's security.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that when the majority leader made \nhis controversial remarks, he was right and the record needs to reflect \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to begin discussing the \namendment that we have been working on, on a bipartisan basis here, for \na number of days, awaiting final determination from the Budget \nCommittee on the question of a budget point of order. That is being \ndiscussed now by their legal people and the chief of staff of the \nBudget Committee. While we are awaiting that determination, I would \nlike to take this opportunity to talk about the circumstances we find \nourselves in and why the amendment that we have been discussing is \nneeded.\n  The basic idea is that we have enormous economic distress out across \nfarm country. Certainly, in my own State, we have seen a triple whammy \nof bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. The result has been \ncollapsing farm income, and the result of that is thousands of farmers \nbeing forced off the land.\n  This chart shows North Dakota farm incomes being washed away in 1997. \nAccording to the Government's own figures, from 1996 to 1997, farm \nincome reported to the Commerce Department, reported by the Labor \nDepartment, went down 98 percent in North Dakota from 1996 to 1997. We \nall know there are many factors here. Low prices are a chief culprit. \nIn addition to that, dramatically reduced production as a result of \nunusual weather patterns that have led to a massive outbreak of \ndisease, so-called scab, which is really a fungus, which cost us a \nthird of the crop in North Dakota last year.\n  Let me just say it is not just North Dakota that is affected. USDA \nhas informed us that many States would benefit by such an indemnity \npayment; that North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota would be key \nbeneficiaries, but so, too, would Texas, Oklahoma, North Carolina, \nSouth Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, and the State of Idaho, and many \nother States as well. In a few moments I will show a map of the United \nStates and show the States affected.\n  What is happening is, in addition to all of those things, the so-\ncalled Asian flu is costing us our most important export market. And on \ntop of that, our own Government is sanctioning other countries and, as \na consequence of those sanctions, removing us from being able to sell \ninto those countries. So the fundamental problem is a dramatic loss of \nincome in many States in the country.\n  This chart shows that farm income has dropped in a majority of the \nStates. We can see those that are over a 40-percent drop are in red. \nThat is North Dakota, at 98 percent; Missouri, I think their loss is in \nthe 40-percent range. You can see New York, Maryland, Virginia and West \nVirginia. These States have all suffered very dramatic income declines \nin the agricultural sector.\n  In addition to that, in orange are those States that have seen a 20- \nto 39-percent reduction in farm income: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, \nKentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Maine and Connecticut are in that \ncategory, as well as Washington, Nevada and Utah out West. Those that \nare in the zero to 19-percent decline: Montana, Idaho, South Dakota, \nIowa, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South \nCarolina, North Carolina, New Jersey, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and \nVermont.\n  Farmers are suffering in silence. It has not gotten a lot of \nattention, but it is nonetheless real and it is nonetheless urgent. We \ncan see the change in income by major industry from 1996 to 1997. All \nof these major industries saw increases with one exception--agriculture \nsaw a $3.4 billion decline. But we saw increases in mining--theirs were \nmodest; in forestry and fishing, in transportation and public \nutilities, in construction, in wholesale trade, in government services, \nin retail trade, in finance, insurance and real estate, in \nmanufacturing and services. Services, by the way, saw an enormous \nincrease of over $100 billion as we move increasingly towards a service \neconomy.\n\n  One of the key reasons that we have seen the steep drop in North \nDakota and some of the other States is these very unusual weather \npatterns. In Texas and Oklahoma it is drought. In North Carolina it is \nhurricanes. In North and South Dakota and Minnesota it is overly wet \nconditions.\n  This is a picture of the North Dakota farm country. This picture, if \nyou can see it, shows not the kind of dry landscape one would associate \nwith North Dakota, but one sees water everywhere. We are swamped in \nNorth Dakota. When I say farm income has been washed away, that is \nexactly what has happened. Farmland can't be planted. That which has \nbeen planted is drowned out. That which isn't drowned out is suffering \nfrom a massive outbreak of disease that has cost a third of the crop \nlast year, to this dreadful scab outbreak.\n  I wish we could say it was restricted to scab, but in addition to \nthat we have white mold, now, attacking the canola crop. That will \naffect not only our State but Minnesota, Montana, and South Dakota as \nwell.\n  These are an extraordinary set of circumstances with which our \nfarmers are dealing, and it is forcing them off the land. We anticipate \nlosing 2,000 farmers in North Dakota this year out of 30,000. The \nSecretary of Agriculture came to North Dakota 3 weeks ago and he had a \ndisaster team that briefed him before the meetings. They told him, \n``You could lose 30 percent of the farmers in North Dakota in the next \n2 years''--30 percent. If that is not a disaster, I don't know what is.\n  It is not just North Dakota, although we are one of the hardest hit, \nbut certainly Minnesota, South Dakota, Montana, and the other States I \nmentioned, Oklahoma and Texas, all were hard hit by drought, continuing \ndrought; of course Florida with their fires, North Carolina with \nhurricanes, and we saw other States affected as well.\n  This is another picture of North Dakota. Again, everywhere you look--\nwater. I was just in the southeastern part of our State, six counties. \nI met with a young farmer there. He had planted corn twice this year. \nBoth times it drowned out. For mile after mile, we saw land under \nwater, land that is not going to be planted again this year, land that \nhas been not planted for 2 or 3 years. In that particular farmer's \ncase, he had land he hasn't been able to farm for 4 years.\n  These exceptionally wet conditions in North Dakota, Minnesota, and \nparts of South Dakota are leading to perfect conditions for the \nbreeding of this fungus disease--scab. That is not only reducing the \nproduction--as I indicated, we lost a third of the crop last year--but \nin addition to that, what you do harvest is then badly discounted when \nyou go to the elevator to sell.\n  It is this combination of factors that is putting such a crunch on \nNorth Dakota agricultural producers. Again, as I say, it is not just \nour State but other States as well. It is very much related to a \ncollapse in prices, very much related to natural disasters, very much \nrelated, in addition to that, to what is happening abroad. The collapse \nof the Asian financial markets is reducing demand for our products. \nThat is where we sell most of our agricultural production. That is the \nfastest growing market for the United States, in Asia, and they don't \nhave the funds to buy. As a result, we are seeing sharp reductions, \nsharp restrictions in agricultural exports.\n  This chart, I think, tells the story very well. It shows a 50-year \npattern of spring wheat prices. These are all stated in 1997 dollars so \nwe are comparing apples to apples. You can see we are about at an all-\ntime low at the end of 1997. You see a long-term trendline of wheat \nprices coming down, but we are now at virtually an all-time low. If you \nthen look at 1998, you see the pattern continuing. By June of this \nyear, we are at a 50-year low for spring wheat prices. Wheat prices in \nNorth Dakota are now about $3.20 a bushel. To put that in some \nperspective, it costs about $4.50 to produce wheat, so you have an \ninvitation to lose money if you are planting wheat.\n  Of course, the upper Great Plains are dominated by wheat production. \nIt is not just wheat. We see exactly the\n\n[[Page S8284]]\n\nsame pattern with respect to barley. Here is a 50-year trendline of \nbarley prices, and you can see by the end of 1997, we were near a 50-\nyear low.\n  If you go to this year, you can see what has happened this year--\nfurther price collapse--so that we are at a 50-year low. Prices for \nwheat and barley have not been this low in 50 years. When you then \ncouple that with reduced production because of the massive outbreak of \ndisease, what you have is an income collapse--as I showed in the first \nchart--an income collapse in my home State of North Dakota.\n  What does that mean? That means we are seeing record auction sales, \nas the little house on the prairie is auctioned off. That is what is \nhappening in my State. It is a disaster. It is a calamity and something \nmust be done.\n  We can debate at great length overall farm policy. We have \ndifferences on the question of long-term farm policy. I don't think we \nhave differences on the question of responding to an emergency, and \nthat is what we have. We have an emergency. It is a dire emergency, but \nwe have very little ability to respond to it.\n  We did away with disaster programs for agriculture during \nconsideration of the last farm bill and actually before that. We \ndecided to do away with disaster programs and use crop insurance. The \nproblem is, crop insurance does not work where you have multiple years \nof disaster. Even the head of the risk management agency has agreed \nwith that proposition. In testimony before the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, he made very clear: Crop insurance, as currently \nconstituted, does not work when you have multiple years of disaster.\n  Unfortunately, all across America, we see multiple years of disaster.\n  This chart shows where the losses have been most severe. As you can \nsee on the chart, those areas that are in red are the parts of the \ncountry that have been hardest hit over the last period of time. You \ncan see, yes, North Dakota and South Dakota and Minnesota hard hit, but \nwe also see Oklahoma and Texas very hard hit and, of course, we go east \nand North Carolina and Virginia are very hard hit as well.\n  Interestingly enough, Pennsylvania; that is because they have been \nhit by tornadoes and have repeated losses as a result. But it is not \njust those States. You can see South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, \nMississippi--all of those States are badly affected. Go out west and \nthe State of Idaho has been hard hit. This map doesn't reveal it, but \nthere are parts of Montana hard hit as well.\n  This map doesn't reveal the individuals. This reveals the counties \nthat are hardest hit. We also have many individuals, especially in the \nState of Montana, who have been hard hit by this same set of unusual \nconditions: Precipitous drop in prices, coupled with sharp drops in \nproduction because of natural disasters, weather disasters of one kind \nor another, and combined, they have led to an income collapse for many \nfarmers in many parts of the country.\n  The question is, How do we respond? The idea has been we wouldn't \nhave disaster programs for agriculture because we are going to use crop \ninsurance. The problem is crop insurance doesn't work where you have \nmultiple years of disaster. Some who are viewing may ask, Why is that? \nWhy wouldn't crop insurance work if you have multiple years of \ndisaster. Nobody knows better than the occupant of the Chair what the \nproblem is. The problem with crop insurance is it is calculated based \non your last 5 years of production. If you have 5 years of disaster, \nyour production base erodes, it evaporates, and then you don't get much \nhelp from crop insurance. That is the fundamental problem that we have \nidentified.\n\n  So how do you address it? What we are recommending is an indemnity \nprogram that will help make payments to those farmers who have had \nmultiple years of disaster, who have had a sharp income decline, sharp \nlosses in income so that they can get some assistance to carry over so \nthat they will live to fight another day, so they can get through these \ndepressed times and get on to better times.\n  Mr. President, we have worked with our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle in terms of crafting a program that we think will be of \nassistance. Before I send that amendment to the desk, we are waiting \nfor an evaluation on which one of the amendments best meets the budget \nrequirements that the U.S. Congress is under. We are hoping for word on \nthat very soon.\n  To sum up, this is a calamity. This is a disaster. This is an \nemergency. By the way, the President yesterday said he will support an \nemergency designation for an answer to what we are seeing across the \ncountry. The Secretary of Agriculture indicated he, too, will support \nan emergency designation, and that is critical so that we don't violate \nthe budget caps.\n  The chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Committee, Senator \nCochran, and the ranking member, Senator Bumpers, are under very sharp \nstrictures with respect to what they can spend. They have allocations \nmade to them. If we are going beyond that, we have to have an emergency \ndesignation. The President has indicated he is willing to make such a \ndesignation. I am hopeful that we will find the Budget Committee agrees \nas well. We are awaiting their word on that matter.\n  Mr. President, these sharp drops in farm income are certainly not \nisolated. It is not just North Dakota. The State of Missouri saw a very \nsharp drop, 72 percent drop there; Maryland, 44 percent drop; New York, \n44 percent drop; West Virginia, 44 percent; Virginia, 42 percent; \nMinnesota, 38 percent; Wisconsin, the same; Nevada, 35 percent; \nPennsylvania, a sharp drop, again, because of natural disasters with \nwhat is happening with tornadoes.\n  We also know that producers, on this map provided by USDA, in North \nCarolina have been very, very hard hit by a set of hurricanes. Of \ncourse, Oklahoma and Texas is burning up with this drought, and so many \nof their producers are under extreme economic pressure as a result.\n  I will enter into the Record a letter from the President. I will read \nfrom it before I send it to the desk. This is a letter sent to Leader \nDaschle yesterday. The President says:\n\n       I am very concerned about the financial stress facing \n     farmers and ranchers in many regions of the country. Natural \n     disasters, combined with a downturn in crop prices and farm \n     income, expected by the Department of Agriculture to remain \n     weak for some time, cause me to question again the adequacy \n     of the safety net provided by the 1996 farm bill. In some \n     areas of the U.S., as many as five consecutive years of \n     weather and disease-related disasters have demonstrated \n     weaknesses in the risk protection available through crop \n     insurance.\n\n  I think all of us who represent farm country certainly understand \nthat. That is because of the formula. It is going to take us time to \nfix crop insurance. It is going to take a bipartisan effort to do that, \nbut that takes time. Those of us who serve on the Agriculture Committee \nunderstand the complexities of reforming crop insurance. That is not \ngoing to happen this year. That is not going to be done in time to help \nthese people who have been hit by repeated years of disaster and for \nwhom the crop insurance system does not work. What we are saying \ntogether is we ought to move and fill in the difference, provide some \nassistance while we are waiting for crop insurance to be fixed.\n  The President said:\n\n       Therefore, I am instructing the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     redouble his efforts to augment the current crop insurance \n     program to more adequately meet farmers' needs to protect \n     against farm income losses. In the interim, to respond to the \n     current unusual situations, I urge the Congress to take \n     emergency action to address specific stresses now afflicting \n     sectors of the farm economy.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I agree with the intent of Senator Conrad's amendment and \n     recommend that funding to address these problems be \n     designated as emergency spending. A supplemental crop \n     insurance program for farmers who experience repeated crop \n     losses, a compensation program for farmers and ranchers whose \n     productive land continues to be under water, and extended \n     authority for the livestock disaster program are examples of \n     the type of emergency actions that could help farmers and \n     ranchers.\n  Well, amen to that. I certainly thank the President for recognizing \nthe extraordinary economic stress our farmers and ranchers are under.\n  The President concludes by saying:\n\n       I am confident that you and your colleagues share my \n     concern for American farmers and ranchers who are \n     experiencing financial stress from natural disasters and low \n     prices, exacerbated by the global downturn in agricultural \n     trade, and I encourage\n\n[[Page S8285]]\n\n     the Congress to take emergency action quickly.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the \nPresident be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, July 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: I am very concerned about the financial \n     stress facing farmers and ranchers in many regions of the \n     country. Natural disasters, combined with a downturn in crop \n     prices and farm income, expected by the Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) to remain weak for some time, cause me to \n     question again the adequacy of the safety net provided by the \n     1996 farm bill. In some areas of the U.S., as many as five \n     consecutive years of weather and disease-related disasters \n     have demonstrated weaknesses in the risk protection available \n     through crop insurance.\n       During the debate on the 1996 farm bill, I encouraged \n     Congress to maintain a sufficient farm safety net, and since \n     its enactment my Administration has repeated that call, \n     proposing measures to buttress the safety net that are \n     consistent with the market-oriented policy of the 1996 farm \n     bill. The 1994 Crop Insurance Reform Act established a policy \n     of improving the crop insurance program in order to remove \n     the need for ad hoc disaster payments. This commitment to \n     crop insurance as the preferred means of managing crop loss \n     risks was reaffirmed in the 1996 farm bill. Farmers have \n     responded to this policy by maintaining their enrollment in \n     crop insurance at very high levels, especially in the \n     Northern Plains states.\n       Therefore, I am instructing the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     redouble his efforts to augment the current crop insurance \n     program to more adequately meet farmers' needs to protect \n     against farm income losses. In the interim, to respond to the \n     current unusual situations, I urge the Congress to take \n     emergency action to address specific stresses now afflicting \n     sectors of the farm economy.\n       I agree with the intent of Senator Conrad's amendment and \n     recommend that funding to address these problems be \n     designated as emergency spending. A supplemental crop \n     insurance program for farmers who experience repeated crop \n     losses, a compensation program for farmers and ranchers whose \n     productive land continues to be under water, and extended \n     authority for the livestock disaster program are examples of \n     the type of emergency actions that could help farmers and \n     ranchers.\n       It is also crucial that the Congress provide the level of \n     funding proposed in my FY 1999 budget in the regular \n     appropriations bills and that the Congress pass the full IMF \n     package to support the efforts of American farmers.\n       I am confident that you and your colleagues share my \n     concern for American farmers and ranchers who are \n     experiencing financial stress from natural disasters and low \n     prices, exacerbated by the global downturn in agricultural \n     trade, and I encourage the Congress to take emergency action \n     quickly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, I will relinquish \nthe floor at this point and await the word from the Budget Committee. \nWe are expecting it momentarily. So I relinquish the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Will the Senator withhold the request?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I say to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, I \nappreciate very much his going forward and offering this amendment. We \nhave been discussing the amendment and the problems that he identifies \nas emergency problems because of drought and other problems throughout \nthe agricultural sector. We are very sympathetic to these problems and \nthe need for Congress and the President and the Department of \nAgriculture to act in a positive way and in an effective way to address \nthese problems and to try to help solve them.\n  We have been advised there may be a problem with the Budget Act in \ngetting an amendment, as drafted, approved in the Senate without having \nthe amendment subject to a budget point of order. We have discussed \nthis with the chairman of the Budget Committee. And there are other \nSenators with whom we have discussed the problem as well.\n  There is a lot of concern on both sides of the aisle that we have a \nbill for agriculture appropriations that takes into account all of the \nproblems we have in the country, and that we respond in a thoughtful \nway. We are continuing to work on this issue. I want Senators to know \nthat I hope we get it resolved so we can approve an amendment of some \nkind to provide relief, such as that sought in the amendment of Senator \nConrad.\n  But while we await further negotiations on this subject, I agree with \nthe Senator that we probably should suggest the absence of a quorum. \nSome Senators are away from the Capitol right now who want to be \ninvolved in this discussion. I expect we will be able to make progress \non it in the early part of the afternoon.\n  If there are other amendments that can be offered by Senators, we \nwould encourage Senators to come to the floor to offer those \namendments. We could set aside this amendment for that purpose to \nreceive other amendments. And some of them may be agreeable. We are \nwilling to work with all Senators. We appreciate the assistance we have \nhad from many today indicating a willingness to reach agreement on \nproposed changes to the bill. I am hopeful we can complete action on \nthe bill today, and I pledge to Senators that I will work very hard to \ntry to help make that a reality.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8283-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8285-S8287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I notice no one is on the floor debating \nthis bill, so I thought I would take the opportunity to say a little \nbit about health care. I understand our President has come to Capitol \nHill today to tell us about how, having rejected his proposal to take \nover the health care system 4 years ago, we now ought to join the \nPresident and Senator Kennedy in letting the Government tell us how to \nrun that health care system. Obviously, we are always flattered when \nthe President comes to Capitol Hill to talk to us, to tell us about his \nviews.\n  I want to make a couple of things clear. Yesterday, we offered the \nRepublican alternative. The Republican health care proposal is superior \nin a lot of ways, but there are several ways that I think are very \nimportant. No. 1, we don't preempt States in those areas where they \nhave already acted to deal with problems in providing health care. We \ndiffer with the President and with Senator Kennedy in that we don't \nbelieve we know more about the interest of each individual State than \ntheir Governor and their State legislature do. What we do in our \nalternative proposal is deal with the parts of the problem that the \nFederal Government has jurisdiction over.\n  I notice the President and some of our colleagues made a big point \nout of the fact that their bill affects 140 million people, whereas our \nbill affects a smaller number. Why is that? The reason our bill affects \na smaller number is, in those areas where the States have the power to \ndeal with their own medical problems, we don't get involved in telling \nthem how to do it. In those areas where they don't have jurisdiction \nbecause of ERISA, then we step in and try to deal with the problem.\n  We differ with the President on the whole issue of how to deal with \nthe denial of services. The President says we can improve the situation \nby taking it to court. The President and Senator Kennedy say it is \nindispensable that we give people the power to sue. We think there is a \nbetter way. We think the better way is setting up an appellate process \non an expedited basis, both internal and external, to an HMO so that \npeople can get a resolution. What happens when you take it to court is \nthat it really does not solve the problem that you are trying to deal \nwith. It may, after the fact, put money--most of it in the hands of a \nlawyer, maybe some of it in the hands of the patient.\n  I assert that when a mother has a sick baby she wants medical \nattention for the infant. She doesn't want the ability to go out and \nhire a lawyer and go to court and 2 years later get a judgment when it \nis too late to deal with the health care concerns of her baby. We \nbelieve we need to get a resolution in 72 hours on those issues rather \nthan\n\n[[Page S8286]]\n\ngoing into court, exploding the cost of health care, and denying \nmillions of Americans their right to health care.\n  We also believe in freedom. Here is the problem as stated very \nsimply. We have a situation today where there is only one part of our \nhealth care system where anybody has any incentive to control cost. \nThat is in the health maintenance organization, the HMO. Twenty years \nago, very few people, outside of a very small number of States, were \nenrolled in HMOs. In the last 25 years, we have had an explosion of \nenrollment because the cost of health care has literally skyrocketed. \nThe positive effect has been that for the first time since 1965 we have \nbrought the cost of medical care and its growth below the Consumer \nPrice Index. For the first time since 1965, we are not pricing blue-\ncollar working families in America out of the health care market. That \nis the good news.\n  The bad news is that a lot of Americans are unhappy about a system \nwhere they have to get approval from the HMO in order to get certain \nkinds of treatment. I liken it to the situation where you go into the \nexamining room and you expect to be in the examining room with only \nyour physician and you find that you have a gatekeeper in the examining \nroom with you.\n  Now, Senator Kennedy's solution, President Clinton's solution, is to \nput a government bureaucrat and a lawyer in the examining room with the \ngatekeeper, with your doctor, and with you. That way, the government \nbureaucrat can be there to regulate the gatekeeper and the lawyer can \nbe there to sue the doctor.\n  We believe there is a better solution. The better solution is \nsomething we call medical savings accounts.\n  I have two cards here. One is from the Mellon Bank. It is a medical \nsavings account on MasterCard. The other is with American Health Value, \nand it is a medical savings account on Visa. How the medical savings \naccount will work is, for the first time it will empower the individual \nfamily to make their own health care decisions and to control cost. How \nwill it do that? It will do it in the following way: Say today that \nyour family has a Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy, family of four, and \nthat Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy costs $4,000 a year. If they had \nstandard option, Blue Cross-Blue Shield, that would be about the \naverage cost. That Blue Cross-Blue Shield policy gives you very low \ndeductibles. Under the medical savings account, you would buy the Blue \nCross-Blue Shield policy with a $3,000 deductible and it would cost \nabout half as much as it costs now. You would take the $4,000 that your \nemployer is currently spending, $2,000 would buy the high-deductible \ninsurance policy and $2,000 would go into your medical savings account. \nThen, you would take the $1,000 that is typically spent annually on \npremiums and deductibles and deposit that in the medical savings \naccount, adding it to the $2,000 contributed by the employer. Then you \nwould make the health care decisions on when and how to spend that \nfirst $3,000 of health care. After meeting that deductible, your health \ninsurance policy would kick in and cover all remaining costs.\n  Now, there are two things that are very important about this program. \nOne is, you have an incentive to be cost conscious; the other is, you \nare in charge.\n  Under Senator Kennedy's proposal and under the President's bill, if \nyou call up the gatekeeper and you can't get to see your doctor, you \ncan then call a government bureaucrat and you can talk to him, he talks \nto the gatekeeper, and then if you can't see your doctor, then you can \ncall a lawyer, who will talk to the Government bureaucrat and the \ngatekeeper, and he might file suit, and 2 years from now you might get \na resolution. That is the Kennedy-Clinton alternative.\n\n  Here is our alternative: When you want to see your doctor, under the \nmedical savings account, you pick up your card and you pick up the \nphone and you make the decision: Do you need a general practitioner? Is \nit an OB/GYN? Should you call a pediatrician? Is it Dr. Frist, who does \nheart and lung surgery? You pick up the Yellow Pages, you call the \ndoctor of your choice, and you have to ask only one question--not, ``Is \nit approved?'' or, ``Are you at our point-of-service option?'' Your \nsimple question is, ``Doc, do you take Mastercard or Visa, or do you \ntake a check?'' If he takes Mastercard, Visa, or a check, you walk into \nthe doctor's office and you make the choice for yourself.\n  Now, which would you rather have? Would you rather be alone with your \ndoctor in the examining room, where you are in control, because you \nhave the ability to give him your medical savings account credit card, \nwithout anybody saying ``yes,'' ``no,'' or ``maybe''? Or would you \nrather go into the examining room with your doctor, with the gatekeeper \nfrom the HMO, with a Federal bureaucrat, and with a lawyer? I think \nmost Americans would rather do it themselves. They want to get \neverybody out of the examining room, except their doctor. They want the \nfreedom to choose.\n  The Republican health care bill gives them the freedom to choose, \nbecause it empowers them.\n  Now, as I said yesterday, Senator Kennedy and the President are as \nafraid of this credit card, this Mastercard and this Visa, they are as \nafraid of these cards as a vampire is afraid of a cross. They fear \nthese cards because they fear choice, because they know that if we \nempower families to make their own health care decisions, they will \nnever, ever tolerate the Federal Government taking over and running the \nhealth care system. And we know that, deep in their hearts, the \nPresident and Senator Kennedy want the Government to take over and run \nthe health care system, and they want the Government to run the health \ncare system because they ``feel our pain,'' and they believe that the \nGovernment could do it better. They know that if they could make \neverybody go to a Government-run health care system, it would all work \nbetter, and that the Government would be caring, and that a Government \nthat does not work well in any other area of our lives would be magic \nin health care. And so they give us the alternative, which is to \nregulate HMOs so that they can't control costs, so that then we can \nhave one HMO--the Government HMO--and it, of course, will control \ncosts, because when it says ``no,'' you have nowhere else to go.\n  I do think it is an incredible paradox that the same people who, 4 \nyears ago, wanted to put every American family into a Government-run \nHMO, where the government would have had absolute authority to say \n``yes'' and ``no,'' now they want to tell private HMOs how to be run, \nand they suddenly are concerned that HMOs have too much power.\n  We have an alternative, and the alternative is to take the power away \nfrom HMOs and give it to families. Let families have medical savings \naccounts so that they can determine which doctor they go to see and \nthey can decide when they go.\n  Finally, I want to respond to two charges that are made by the \nDemocrats against medical savings accounts. The first one is that they \nare for rich people. Well, why would rich people need or want high-\ndeductible insurance? They can buy any insurance they want. But if you \ncut the cost of health insurance in half, you let working families, for \nthe first time, have coverage for those expenses when they have to go \nto the hospital, or when something terrible happens. Working families \ncan begin, over the years, to build up their medical savings account \nuntil they have the same kind of coverage everybody else has. Medical \nsavings accounts cut in half the cost of the insurance you really need \nand have to have. That is not for rich people, that is for working \npeople.\n  Secondly, the charge is made that only people who are healthy will go \ninto medical savings accounts. I think exactly the opposite is true. If \nyou have a chronic health problem, do you want to go to an HMO where \nsome gatekeeper makes the decision about your health care? It seems to \nme that if you have a chronic health care problem and any morning you \nmight wake up with a life-threatening illness, you would much rather be \nin a position, instead of calling the gatekeeper, the Government, a \nlawyer, or a Government bureaucrat, to call up a doctor and say, ``I \nwould like to come in. Do you take Mastercard or Visa?''\n  So I think we have a very clear choice, and we are ready to vote. We \nare glad the President has come to Capitol Hill to tell us, once again, \nthat he knows what is best for our health\n\n[[Page S8287]]\n\ncare. Four years ago, he told us he wanted the Government to take over \nand run the health care system, and we listened with respect and \nreverence, and we said ``No,'' and the American people said ``No,'' \nwith an expletive in front of the ``no.''\n  Now the President is telling us, 4 years later--he appears before \nGovernment employee groups and says, ``I haven't changed my mind; I \nstill want the Government to take over and run the health care system, \nonly we have to do it one step at a time.'' It seems that he believes \nthe next step is to let the Government run the HMOs. How does he think \nthat make the patient better off? Well, it presumable makes the patient \nbetter off because when we go into the examining room with the doctor \nand the gatekeeper, a Federal bureaucrat and a lawyer will now join us. \nI don't think that is what people want. People want to be alone in the \nexamining room with their doctor.\n  The Republican plan, which empowers the family to decide, puts only \nthe patient and the doctor in the examining room. It throws out the \nGovernment bureaucrat, it throws out the lawyer, it throws out the \ngatekeeper, and it replaces all of that mechanism of Government \nbureaucracy with one simple question: ``Do you take Mastercard, or do \nyou take Visa, or do you take a check?'' If the answer to any of those \nquestions is ``yes''--and it will be yes to all three--then you go to \nthe doctor of your choice.\n  That is our alternative. It is a better alternative. That is why we \nare going to defeat the President and Senator Kennedy once again. The \nAmerican people do not want a Government-run or a Government-controlled \nhealth care system, and we can give them an alternative. The \nalternative is freedom.\n  Once again, America is at a crossroads. We are going to have to \nchoose. Do we believe the solution to our problems in medicine will be \nfound with more Government interference, with more time in court, with \nmore time working under the control of Government bureaucrats? Or do we \nbelieve the solution is to be found in freedom? Well, I am going to bet \nthe future of my family and the future of the 19 million people in \nTexas, who hired me to represent them in the Senate, on freedom because \nI know freedom works, and I know something else--I know Government does \nnot work.\n  Four years ago, the American people didn't want Government to run the \nhealth care system, and today they don't want Government to control the \nhealth care system. So Republicans and Democrats agree on one thing: \nThere are problems in the health care system. But where we disagree is, \nwe want to empower families with innovations like medical savings \naccounts, and the President and Senator Kennedy want to empower the \nFederal Government. That is the choice. It is a clear choice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8285-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8287-S8293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, in a few minutes Senator Conrad from North \nDakota will send an amendment to the desk on behalf of himself and \nmyself and some others that will deal with an indemnity program, an \namendment that I think he has already described to Members of the \nSenate. I think this is one of the most important amendments we will \nvote on on this bill while it is on the Senate floor.\n  I want to just describe again, as I think my colleague has and I have \non other occasions, what causes us to feel the need and the urgency to \nrespond to an agricultural crisis. The agricultural crisis is occurring \nin a number of States in our country in a way that is causing family \nfarmers to lose their farms, to have the auction sales, to sell out and \nlose their hopes and dreams. We feel that because of collapsed prices \nand rampant crop disease, and other things which are not the farmers' \nfault, that we ought to do something to extend a helping hand and say \nto them that we want to help them over this tough period.\n  I would like to show my colleagues a map that describes the problems \nwe have had in North Dakota for family farmers. The red represents \ncounties that have been declared disaster areas every year for 5 \nstraight years. All of these counties have been declared disasters \nevery year for 5 years in a row. That means if you are farming here, or \nhere, any one of these areas, you have been out there farming in an \nenvironment and in a climate in which there is, in most cases, a \ndevastating wet cycle with you being prevented from planting because \nthe fields are full of standing water that has not left and has not \nabsorbed, and if you did get a crop in, you have had it devastated by \nthe worst crop disease in this century in North Dakota.\n  The orange have been declared disaster areas for 4 years out of 5 \nyears, and the yellow, 3 years out of 5 years,. The farmers in these \nareas have confronted a disease called scab. This picture doesn't mean \nmuch to a lot of folks. But it is the picture of a field of hard red \nspring wheat infested with scab disease. It is called fusarium head \nblight. But it is a devastating disease that decimates the quality of \nthis crop, so that when and if the farmer gets a crop and hauls it to \nmarket, the farmer discovers it is worth very, very little.\n  The cereal scientist, Bryan Steffeson, said, ``I have never faced \nanything as tough as fusarium head blight. Make no mistake about it. \nThis is the worst plant disease epidemic that the United States has \nfaced with any major crop during this century.''\n  This is very unusual and devastating to the pocketbooks of family \nfarmers.\n  With respect to wheat, I just described the previous chart; with \nrespect to barley, the same plant scientist says, ``North Dakota's \nbarley industry is hanging by a thread, even though it is typically the \nleader in feed malting barley products.''\n  As a result of crop disease and collapsed market prices, our farmers' \nincomes in North Dakota dropped 98 percent in 1 year--a devastating \ndrop in income. And I think almost anyone can imagine if, in their \nneighborhood, or on their block, or among their friends, they had a 98-\npercent drop in income, they would understand this is very, very \ndifficult to live through. A lot of family farmers aren't able to \nsurvive it. The result is they are forced off the farm and forced to \nsell out.\n  This was in the New York Times accompanying a story on July 12. \n``Across the northern tier, farmers' income drops.'' And it says we \nhave a problem with farm income dropping in Montana, North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and elsewhere. The point \nof that is that this is a pervasive, difficult problem that requires an \nurgent response.\n  The Fargo Forum in an editorial yesterday indicates that, ``The \ncrisis in farming is for real. The social and economic damage piling up \nin farm country cannot be minimized. Politicians who believe the \nrevolutionary Freedom to Farm law is working should spend some time in \nrural America, especially in the upper Midwest.''\n  This is a paper, incidentally, that has editorialized in favor of the \nFreedom to Farm bill. They say that it needs some adjustments and \nchanges. You can't ignore that.\n  They say at the end of this editorial, ``The least Congress can do \nnow, while in the longer term enlighten lawmakers to revisit and revise \nthe Freedom to Farm, is to try to pass some type of supplemental \nlegislation that would respond to urgent needs for some payments in \nfarm country.''\n  A number of us, led by Senator Conrad, and joined by myself and \nothers, have worked on a program that would provide the opportunity for \nsome indemnity payments, which is just another way of saying those \nfarmers who have had their income washed away would be given some \nshort-term interim help with the passage of this amendment. The \namendment would provide up to $500 million for the Indemnity Payment \nProgram.\n\n[[Page S8288]]\n\n  It is supported by President Clinton. We were meeting at the White \nHouse yesterday with President Clinton. My colleague, Senator Conrad, \nmyself, and a number of others from farm country, received a letter \nfrom President Clinton that describes in writing what he told us \npersonally yesterday during the meeting--that he supports the amendment \nwe are offering now, and it is part of a three-pronged approach that he \nhimself espouses: No. 1, a supplemental benefit program of the type we \nhave described, an indemnification program; No. 2, compensation for \nfarmers who have flooded lands; and, No. 3, extended authority for \nemergency livestock needs.\n  Mr. President, I mentioned earlier--I want to say again--that this is \nnot a political or a partisan issue. Out in the country they don't \ndrive Democratic or Republican trucks. They don't pull Democratic or \nRepublican plows. They are only family farmers trying to make a living \nin a very difficult set of circumstances. They are some of the hardest \nworking Americans. They get up early, work hard all day, and go to bed \nlate. They risk everything they have. Everything they have is on the \nline--all of their hopes, all of their dreams--and all of their savings \nare invested in a crop that might or might not grow. If it is grows, it \nmight or might not yield them an income that allows them to repay the \nexpenses they incurred to put in the crop.\n  That is the nature of family farming. I think family farmers have \nalways understood that risk and always accepted that risk. But they \nhave always hoped. And they have sometimes been the recipients as a \nresult of that hope that when times are tough, when the bottom falls \nout, when prices collapse, when they are hit with devastating crop \ndisease, that somehow there would be a basic safety net to try to be \nhelpful to them to allow them to get over those price valleys; some \nkind of a bridge to allow them to cross that difficult period.\n  If you are a very, very large corporation, you can cross that price \nvalley. Things get tough, you can tighten your belt, and you can \nsurvive. But the thin financial nature of a family farm often cannot \ncross that price valley. When prices collapse, or disease conspires, \nthen there must be some kind of a bridge, some kind of mechanism of \nsupport that says, ``Let us step in and help.''\n  That is what the amendment offered by Senator Conrad, myself, and \nothers will do. It simply says, ``Let us step in and provide some help \nto respond to a growing and urgent farm crisis.''\n  Mr. President, with this, I would yield the floor. I believe we are \nclose to having the amendment in order to send to the desk. When we do, \nI believe that Senator Conrad, a couple of others, and I will make \nbrief additional comments. We would hope very much that our colleagues \nwill respond favorably to this.\n  We think it is thoughtful. It is supported by the President and it is \nsupported by the Secretary of Agriculture. Editorially it is supported \nby newspapers that support the Freedom to Farm bill, because the \neditorials, others, and family farmers recognize this need is urgent \nand the response to it cannot be delayed.\n  Let me commend my colleague, Senator Conrad, with whom I am \nprivileged to work. We work on a lot of issues together but none more \nimportant than the issue of trying to respond to and to help family \nfarmers survive during times of crisis and times of urgent need. His \nleadership and efforts on this legislation are significant.\n  I am pleased to be a part of the effort today to offer this \namendment, and I hope for the favorable consideration of our \ncolleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3173\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funds for and improve the reserve inventories \n                                program)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, who has been with \nus every step of the way in developing this amendment, in offering it \nto our colleagues and persuading others to support it, and in \nconvincing the White House that this is an emergency matter.\n  I am very pleased with the outcome of the meeting we had yesterday. I \nthink there is a real sense of urgency not only by the President but by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture and others in the administration who \nrecognize that in many parts of the country we are simply faced with a \ncollapse of income as a result of badly depressed prices, and in \naddition, a loss of production because of natural disasters that have \ntaken many forms in many places--as I described earlier, monsoon \nconditions in North Dakota and Minnesota and parts of South Dakota, \nbut, on the other hand, terrible drought in Oklahoma and Texas; and \nthen perversely in the eastern part of the United States, hurricane \nactivity that has had a devastating effect on North Carolina and \nVirginia. And I was just talking to a Senator from Pennsylvania; they \nhave also been hard hit. So this amendment would move to provide \nresources to provide assistance to those areas.\n  Now, some may say, gee, I thought we put crop insurance in place so \nwe didn't have to have this kind of program. And that is precisely \nright. Unfortunately, what we have discovered is the Crop Insurance \nProgram we put in place does not work when you have multiple years of \ndisaster. And the reason for that is the formula. The formula in crop \ninsurance looks at your last 5 years of production. If you have had 3 \nto 5 years of disasters, whether it is drought, whether it is overly \nwet conditions, whether it is a terrible disease outbreak as we faced \nin North Dakota, or hurricanes as they have faced in the East, your \nbase for crop insurance is so badly depressed it does not provide the \nrisk management tool that all of us intended.\n  I was just talking to the Senator from Idaho, who is one of the most \nknowledgeable members of the Agriculture Committee with respect to this \nmatter, and he was saying what we see is that when the base goes down, \ncrop insurance cannot provide the coverage we all intended.\n  We are not going to get crop insurance reform this year, as much as \nmany of us would like to do; that simply takes a longer effort. And so, \nMr. President, until crop insurance gets fixed, something has to be \nthere to allow farmers to survive. If we do not, we are going to have a \ncalamity of staggering proportions.\n  USDA tells us in North Dakota that we are going to face potentially \nthe loss of 30 percent of our farmers in 2 years--30 percent. That is a \ndisaster by any description.\n  So what we have tried to do is work in a way that is not subject to a \nbudget point of order, that does provide assistance to these farmers \nall across the country.\n  We have now received a letter from the Executive Office of the \nPresident, the Office of Management and Budget, which indicates that \nthis amendment would not be subject to a point of order, that this \nwould qualify for an emergency designation, and the President supports \nan emergency designation for this legislation. We will submit that for \nthe Record when we have a chance to actually submit the language. It is \nbeing typed now.\n  We have it. The final provision is here. We will send that to the \ndesk. We need to get copies distributed to our colleagues.\n  The Budget Committee of the Senate has informed us this would not be \nsubject to a budget point of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record the \nletter from the Office of Management and Budget, the Executive Office \nof the President, indicating that they, too, agree that this qualifies \nfor an emergency designation and would not be subject to a budget point \nof order.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: This responds to your request for the \n     views of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on whether \n     your proposed amendment relating to farm payments under 7 \n     U.S.C. 1427a qualifies for the emergency adjustment under the \n     Budget Enforcement Act (BEA).\n       Section 251(b)(2)(A) of the BEA provides that an adjustment \n     in the discretionary spending limits shall be made for \n     appropriations designated as an emergency by Congress and the \n     President. That section also\n\n[[Page S8289]]\n\n     states that the designation is not available for \n     ``appropriations to cover agricultural crop disaster \n     assistance.''\n       We have examined your proposed amendment, and we are of the \n     view that it qualifies as emergency relief under Section \n     251(b)(2)(A) and is not an appropriation to cover \n     agricultural crop disaster assistance. Your amendment would \n     provide funding for the reserve program established under 7 \n     U.S.C. 1427a. That program is designed to establish a reserve \n     of certain crops through the price support program. The \n     purpose of purchasing the commodities is to hold a reserve \n     that then may be disposed of to relieve distress at a later \n     time. The purpose of the program is to establish a reserve of \n     crops for future use, not to make assistance available to the \n     producers from whom the crops are purchased. Thus, it is \n     OMB's view that the funding does not provide ``crop disaster \n     assistance'' within the meaning of Section 251(b)(2)(A), and \n     the adjustment provided by that section for emergencies may \n     thus be applied to the funding in your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert G. Damus,\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are ready for any additional debate, \nand we are ready to move, after people have had a chance to speak, to a \nvote at a time that the chairman of the committee thinks is \nappropriate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we are at a point now where we \ncan ask the question, What is the will of the Senate? Because that is \nthe question. We have an amendment here that proposes a new program of \nspending based on an emergency of about one-half billion dollars. I \nthink that is the number. Five-hundred million is the total projected \ncost of the bill, but it is based on an emergency that is declared in \nthis legislation to exist in agriculture. We understand the President \nhas agreed that there is an emergency, not specifically that this \namendment describes that emergency, but that a response should be made \nby the Government to deal with this problem.\n  Now, I know that there are Senators who are wondering, well, what are \nthe criteria? How are farmers going to be declared eligible to \nparticipate in payments under this program? There are questions that \nare very legitimate and, frankly, this legislation does not tell us \nmuch about that. It is leaving a lot of discretion in the hands of the \nSecretary of Agriculture. That is very clear. And this amendment could \nbe subject to the criticism that it is too much, there is too much \ndiscretion. I am confident the department would have to issue \nregulations and describe some program payment benefit scheme that \nfarmers would have to be governed by in terms of applications and \neligibility.\n  So there are some legitimate questions that can be asked. I am \nwilling to listen to the advice of other Senators and be governed by \nthe will of the Senate on this issue. I do not want to reject this out \nof hand and say that it is not a good amendment. I think it is based on \na legitimate interest in helping deal with very real problems that \nexist in certain parts of the country, primarily in North Dakota, South \nDakota, Minnesota, where half the payments are projected to occur under \nthe amendment, but there are other States as well. We know that Texas, \nOklahoma, and Colorado would be eligible. We know that southern-tier \nStates, parts of States in the Southeast, North Carolina, in addition \nto South Carolina; there are some parts of my State, I am told, that \nwould benefit from the legislation.\n  So it is time now in the consideration of this amendment for Senators \nto take a look at the proposal and come to some consensus on what to do \nabout this. We can accept the amendment on a voice vote, the managers \ncould accept the amendment, if that is the will of the Senate, or if \nsome Senators want to have a record vote on the amendment, we could do \nthat. I had been told earlier that this amendment would probably be \nsubject to a budget point of order in that it would violate the Budget \nAct. But because of changes the drafters, the authors of the amendment \nhave made within the language, I am advised that the Budget Committee \nstaff director has told us there is no violation of the Budget Act. \nThat could be confirmed by a statement from the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and I would like for him to tell us that formally before we \nmake a decision on whether a point of order would be made on the basis \nof the Budget Act.\n  Those are my reactions to the proposal, and I will await other \nSenators coming to the floor to let us have some suggestions and \nguidance about how to proceed at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi, the \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, for the \ngracious way he has allowed us to work through this. He has been very \npatient, and we thank him very much for his patience. We also thank him \nvery much for his open-mindedness. I think he does recognize there are \nreal problems around the country. Unfortunately, we do not have the \nperfect tools to deal with them. The Senator from Mississippi raises \nquestions that are absolutely legitimate questions: What kind of system \nwould be used to use these funds?\n  This is not a new program in the sense that this is replenishing a \nprogram and an authority that the Secretary has had. This is a program \nthat the Secretary has utilized. And those funds are now depleted.\n\n  The way it was done in the past was to use actual commodities, but \none thing we have learned is, it is really much more efficient to use \nmoney in that fund rather than commodities, because when we use \ncommodities, we find that about 25 percent of what is used is used up \nin distribution costs, in handling charges, and the rest. So USDA, in \nexamining this, has said it would be much more taxpayer friendly, \nreally, to have money in this fund that is now depleted rather than to \nhave commodities.\n  We are using the same model we used for the Livestock Indemnity \nProgram last year; that is, to give the Secretary broad discretion, \nbecause when you sit down and try to write the specifics here on the \nfloor with this relatively short period of time, we have discovered \nthere are a series of problems. One of them is, we would probably \nbecome subject to a budget point of order. So we find doing it this \nway, with the general authority of the Secretary that he already has, \nwhich is recognized, but we restore the fund, we replenish the fund \nthat has been depleted so the Secretary has the ability to respond to \nthese various circumstances around the country.\n  It is not one set of events that is affecting us. We have one set of \nevents in North Dakota and Minnesota and South Dakota, and the Senator \nis exactly right, we would get a significant portion of this. But other \nparts of the country as well--in Texas and Oklahoma it is a drought; in \nNorth Carolina, where they have been so badly hit, and Virginia, it is \nhurricanes. In Pennsylvania, the Senator from Pennsylvania tells us, it \nis a combination of factors. In Idaho, it is much the same thing that \nhas been happening in these northern-tier States; they have, in many \ncases, overly wet conditions.\n  But combining it all, we have a natural disaster and we have price \ncollapse. What is happening is, we are left with dramatically reduced \nfarm income that is forcing people off the land. The question is, Do we \nact? Do we do something? Do we provide the tools to respond? I think \nthe will of the Senate will be, as it has been in the past: Yes, we \nshould respond. We have a chance to do that.\n  I also will indicate, in the amendment I sent to the desk, the \noriginal cosponsors are Senator Dorgan and Senator Cleland. I welcome \nother Senators. I am very hopeful this is a bipartisan enterprise. I \nhave been talking to Republican Senators over the last several weeks \nabout this matter, and I very much hope they join in and we make this a \nfully bipartisan effort. They certainly have contributed thoughts to \nwhat we could do here.\n  So I hope, before we reach conclusion here, we have a healthy number \nof Senators on both sides of the aisle who cosponsor this legislation, \nthat we join together and say, ``Yes, there are problems out there. \nLet's address them. Let's provide some assistance.''\n  This does not mean we are voting on overturning agricultural policy. \nWe have differences there. We recognize those differences. This is one \ncase where we are rising above those differences to march together and \ntry to help those who clearly are in need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S8290]]\n\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself, \n     Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Cleland, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3173.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 29, after line 21, add the following:\n\n                          Reserve Inventories\n\n       For the reserve established under section 813 of the \n     Agricultural Act of 1970 (7 U.S.C. 1427a), $500,000,000: \n     Provided, That the entire amount shall be available only to \n     the extent that the President submits to Congress an official \n     budget request for a specific dollar amount that includes \n     designation of the entire amount of the request as an \n     emergency requirement for the purposes of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et \n     seq.): Provided further, That the entire amount of funds \n     necessary to carry out this paragraph is designated by \n     Congress as an emergency requirement under section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7____. RESERVE INVENTORIES.\n\n       Section 813 of the Agricultural Act of 1970 (7 U.S.C. \n     1427a) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence of subsection (a), by inserting \n     ``of agricultural producers'' after ``distress'';\n       (2) in subsection (c), by inserting ``the Secretary or'' \n     after ``President or''; and\n       (3) in subsection (h)--\n       (A) by striking ``(h) There is hereby'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(h) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--There are''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Use of funds for cash payments.--The Secretary may \n     use funds made available under this section to make, in a \n     manner consistent with this section, cash payments that don't \n     go for crop disasters, but for income loss to carry out the \n     purposes of this section.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Let me make two points that I think \nSenator Conrad and I and others would want to make. One responds a bit \nto some comments made earlier.\n  The potential benefits of this amendment would be available to people \nin a range of areas of the country who have suffered, in one form or \nanother, substantial income loss and are going through an agricultural \ncrisis. That includes Texas, South Carolina--a whole range of areas of \nthe country. But I want to make it clear, this is not simply an \namendment that would target one or two or three States. Farmers in many \nother parts of the country who face similar circumstances and a similar \ncrisis would be eligible.\n  Second, and I think most important, while there has been a lot of \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate about agricultural policy, I \nthink it is important to make clear, this amendment is not a substitute \nfor or a denial of the interest many of us have in some of the \narguments that have been offered and proposed in recent days by others \non the floor about the increased need for additional effort in trade. \nSome of our colleagues have stood on the floor and talked about the \nneed for moving American grain overseas, for additional efforts in \ntrade, additional use of the Export Enhancement Program, and other \nthings. I support all of that.\n  I think we ought to be more aggressive with respect to Food for \nPeace. I have mentioned that there are people starving around the \nworld: A million people to a million and a quarter people face \nstarvation in Sudan today. We can and should, in my judgment, with the \nquantity of grain we have, substantially increase shipments under title \nII and title III of Food for Peace.\n  We can and should be more aggressive with the use of the Export \nEnhancement Program. We can and should be more aggressive with a range \nof other programs. The Secretary of Agriculture, I would say, has been \nvery aggressive with the GSM program and others. But I would like our \ncountry to meet competition anywhere around the Earth. If the European \nUnion wishes to deeply subsidize its grain and attempt to take markets \naway from this country, we ought to go to those markets and meet them \nand compete and win that competition. If that requires export subsidies \nto meet what the Europeans are doing, then so be it; that is precisely \nwhat we should do.\n  So, those who insist on a much more aggressive approach in \ninternational trade will find no quarrel with me. I believe we should \nhave a more aggressive posture with respect to trade issues. That is \none, but only one, of the issues we need to address.\n  Another of the issues we need to address is the issue of emergency \nresponse in times of crisis to farmers, particularly in some areas of \nthe country that have seen almost a total collapse of their income. \nThat is the purpose of the amendment we have sent to the desk.\n  I, too, listened carefully to the Senator from Mississippi. I think \nhe is an awfully good legislator. He is certainly fair. I hope we can \nachieve some bipartisan support here in this Chamber on this kind of \nlegislation. I don't think there is any pride of authorship here \neither. My expectation is that in the coming period we will be able to \ndiscuss some of the specifics of this legislation and perhaps reach a \nconclusion on it.\n  With that, I know my colleague from Montana is here, although he \napparently is not going to speak at this point. Let me yield the floor \nto the Senator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, last night, after we had our last \nrecorded vote, there were two amendments which we discussed and \nrecommended to the Senate that we accept and they were accepted, one of \nwhich was offered by the Senators from Florida. Senator Graham offered \nan amendment, it was cosponsored by Senator Mack, and it dealt with \ndisaster problems that exist in Florida because of the recent wildfires \nthat we are all familiar with because we saw these vividly photographed \non television. For days and days, fires raged throughout the State of \nFlorida. As a result of that, the Senators are asking that emergency \nfunds be made available to compensate victims of that disaster who were \ninvolved in agriculture. I invite the attention of the Senators to the \nrecord of the discussion of that issue last night.\n  The proposal was to make available funds from the account that has \nbeen described by the Senators from North Dakota. There is no \nindication right now, from the Department of Agriculture, whether or \nnot the disaster fund that is discretionary with the Secretary has been \ndepleted to the extent that replenishment is necessary in order to \ncompensate the victims in Florida. What I said during the discussion of \nthe amendment involved an assurance that we would receive from the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the President a supplemental request for \nfunds to replenish that discretionary disaster fund of the Secretary's, \nso that appropriate disaster relief could be made available to \nagriculture producers and others who are eligible for those funds. That \nsatisfied the Senators from Florida, and, on that basis, the amendment \nwas accepted by the Senate.\n  I am prepared to make the same suggestion to the Senate on this \namendment. There is no question that there are differences, however--\none of which is that farm producers would have to show that, out of 3 \nof the last 5 years, there had been declarations declaring disasters, \neither by the Secretary of Agriculture or the President, in the areas \nwhere eligibility would be considered to have been established.\n  At least that is what I understand the amendment provides.\n  The point is this: The year is not over. This fiscal year that we are \nappropriating money for right now begins on October 1. We don't know \nwhat the full needs for agriculture producers around the country will \nbe by the time we get to the beginning of the fiscal year.\n  I am suggesting that it may be appropriate to take this proposal to \nconference with the House and await the receipt from the President or \nthe Secretary of Agriculture of specific requests for supplemental \nfunds beyond that requested in the budget that has already been \nsubmitted by the administration for next year that they foresee will be \nneeded to replenish the Disaster Assistance Discretionary Fund of the \nSecretary to compensate disaster victims for their losses.\n  There are other programs available to provide benefits, Senators \nrealize. There are crop insurance programs, there are other assistance \nprograms that are authorized in the 1996 farm bill.\n  As I understand it, this does not create a new disaster assistance \nprogram,\n\n[[Page S8291]]\n\nand because it doesn't, it is not subject to a budget point of order.\n  I am mentioning that idea that I have as an alternative way of \nconsidering this and would like to have the benefit of other Senators' \nthoughts on it, particularly those who chair the legislative committees \non the budget and on agriculture legislation. It may be we can work out \nsome way to take this amendment to conference. If that is not possible, \nthen the question will be whether we move to table the amendment and \nbring this issue up later as a freestanding bill--that is a \npossibility. This legislative session doesn't end with the passage of \nthis agriculture appropriations bill. There may be other opportunities \nto assess the disaster situation around the country.\n  I thought since the similarity between the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Florida last night which was accepted by the Senator, and \nthe presentation of the amendment which we have heard now from the \nSenators from North Dakota were so similar, that it presented us with \nthe same alternative that we exercised last night.\n  Let me read what I said on the floor of the Senate last night:\n\n       . . .the Department of Agriculture advises us that they \n     cannot at this time verify whether available disaster money \n     has been depleted. I understand this has been a devastating \n     disaster for Florida and that other areas of the country have \n     also been affected by various disasters. We will work with \n     the administration and the House conferees to address the \n     needs of the areas affected by these recent disasters and to \n     determine whether these needs are being met through available \n     funds.\n       It is my hope that the Department of Agriculture and the \n     Office of Management and Budget are assessing the need for \n     additional funding to meet the needs resulting from these \n     most recent disasters and that the President will soon submit \n     to the Congress requests for supplemental funds which are \n     determined to be required.\n\n  I am prepared to suggest to the Senate that on that basis, we take \nthis amendment to conference, but I will not make that suggestion \nwithout further discussing my idea with the appropriate legislative \ncommittee chairmen.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from \nMississippi. I understand he wants to hear from other Senators. It \nseems to me that one of the suggestions he made makes a lot of sense. \nHaving the opportunity to go to conference with a provision similar to \nthis in the piece of legislation that comes from the Senate will put us \nin the position of sending a message to those areas that have been \nhardest hit, a number of areas of the country ranging from the \nSoutheast, to the South, to the North, that we understand this is, in \nfact, a crisis; that we are responding as we did in the sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution passed earlier this week without a dissenting vote, \nthat the ag crisis is something that we are willing to address.\n  I accept the point made by Senator Cochran that there may well, in \nthe coming days or weeks, be a need to change the response. Perhaps the \nresponse will need to be more aggressive. Perhaps the response may need \nto be characterized differently. But it seems to me appropriate to go \nto conference with a provision of this type in the legislation, because \nit is, I think, telling the family farmers in this land that this \nSenate does care, does want to respond, and understands that there is a \ncrisis in certain parts of the country.\n  Again, I certainly respect the interest of the Senator from \nMississippi wanting to gauge the reaction of a number of Senators on \nthis subject, but I hope when the day is out and this amendment is \ndisposed of that it will be disposed of in a way--I guess ``disposed'' \nof is the wrong word--I hope that it is resolved in a way that reaches \none of the suggestions perhaps offered by the Senator from Mississippi \nthat we can include it in this legislation.\n  I must say that I have watched the Senator from Mississippi for some \ndays on the floor. I have always felt he has the patience of Job. He is \none of the most gracious and considerate Members of the Senate. I know \nthis is a trying time. I am on the Appropriations Committee with \nSenator Cochran, and I am also someone who will sit here as a ranking \nmember on one of the subcommittees. I know it is a trying time to bring \na bill to the floor of the Senate and discover that a lot of folks want \nto address this bill with peculiar amendments on a range of issues.\n  I know he understands, because of the vote earlier in the week, that \nwe face very unusual and, in fact, very difficult times in some parts \nof the country. The crisis we have in our State is unparalleled. I \ncan't think of a time when we have suffered a 98-percent loss in net \nfarm income. It has been devastating. The Senator from Mississippi \nunderstands that is what has occasioned amendments to be offered to \nthis bill.\n  I must say, again, he has enormous patience. Even in exhibiting that \npatience, he has a graciousness and dignity that all of us appreciate. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Baucus pertaining to the introduction of the bill \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in further discussions with the Senators \nfrom North Dakota and others, I am prepared to recommended that we \naccept the amendment offered by the Senators from North Dakota and take \nthe issue to conference under the same understanding that I read into \nthe Record last night when I accepted, and the Senate agreed to, the \namendment offered by the Senators from Florida, Mr. Graham, and Mr. \nMack, who was a cosponsor of that amendment.\n  The statement is as follows:\n\n       The Department of Agriculture advises us that they cannot \n     at this time verify whether available disaster money has been \n     depleted. I understand this has been a devastating disaster \n     for Florida and that other areas of the country have also \n     been affected by various disasters. We will work with the \n     administration and the House conferees to address the needs \n     of the areas affected by these recent disasters and to \n     determine whether these needs are being met through \n     available funds. It is my hope that the Department of \n     Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget are \n     assessing the need for additional funding to meet the \n     needs resulting from these most recent disasters, and that \n     the President will soon submit to the Congress requests \n     for supplemental funds, which are determined to be \n     required.\n\n  It is also my understanding that the proposal in this amendment is a \nnew program. I had suggested that it was a description of an existing \ndiscretionary program of the Department of Agriculture, and that I had \nmisread or misunderstood the proposal offered by the Senators.\n  Nonetheless, I am prepared, under the same understanding, to \nrecommend to the Senate that we accept this amendment. It has been, in \nthis amendment, described as an emergency, which would require an \nemergency finding not only by Congress, but by the President, in order \nto avoid having an offset of the funds that are contemplated to be \nspent under the amendment. But because it does have the emergency \ndeclaration, it does not require an offset, and I am advised by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee that it is not subject to a budget \npoint of order. On that basis, I recommend that the Senate approve it. \nI understand from my good friend from Arkansas that he has no objection \nto this recommendation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter I \nhave sent to the desk be printed in the Record. It is from farm \norganizations endorsing this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the farmers and ranchers \n     of our organizations, we strongly support your amendment to \n     the agriculture appropriations bill which would\n\n[[Page S8292]]\n\n     provide supplemental assistance to those producers who have \n     suffered multiple years of crop losses.\n       Your amendment is tailored to provide urgently needed \n     assistance to those farmers who have purchased crop \n     insurance, but are unable to obtain adequate coverage, due to \n     multiple years of disaster.\n       The amendment would help over 45,000 producers. While there \n     are regions in every state that would be eligible, it is \n     especially important for Oklahoma, Texas, North Carolina, \n     Virginia, Mississippi, western Pennsylvania, Idaho and the \n     Upper Plains states.\n       The supplemental assistance will not only help the \n     individual producers, but will also provide a critical boost \n     to the rural communities in which they reside, which are \n     suffering from the severe losses.\n       Our organizations share a strong commitment to \n     strengthening the crop insurance program to allow producers \n     to stay in business, even in times of disaster. This \n     amendment will go a long way toward improving coverage for \n     those producers who have purchased crop insurance.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Soybean Association.\n     National Farmers Organization.\n     National Farmers Union.\n     National Sunflower Association.\n     North Dakota Grain Growers Association.\n     United States Canola Association.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3173) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, would the Senator from Idaho like to be \nincluded as an original cosponsor?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Idaho, Mr. Craig, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nhis help with this amendment, and the many others who participated in \nthese deliberations. I especially thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, \nand the Senator from Idaho, Senator Craig, who helped us with this \namendment.\n  I think we are moving in the right direction. Obviously, we will have \nadditional opportunities to fashion a final package, as we all \nunderstand this will have to go to conference. Again, I thank, very \nmuch, the chairman and ranking member and all those who helped.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues from North \nDakota for the sincere effort they have made and the willingness of the \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee to review this \nand help them shape it and accept it.\n  Certainly, as we get to conference, there is going to be every effort \nmade by this Senator and others to provide what can be provided, and to \nresolve, as best we can, this impending farm crisis. We clearly \nunderstand the problem, the growing problem, and we know that certain \nactions here can be very, very helpful. I am pleased to be a \nparticipant in this, to be supportive of it. I am sure we will be \nlooking at other packages that we will want to bring together in a \ntotal effort to help agriculture during this time.\n  Let me say in my closing comments that our actions here on the floor \nhave consequences. Every Senator who is on the floor now joined with us \nwere active participants last Thursday when the Senate of the United \nStates voted 98-0 to drop the sanctions against Pakistan and India. The \nPresiding Officer at this moment, the Senator from Kansas, led that \ndramatic effort to show that this country would stand united and not \nuse food as a tool of foreign policy.\n  Just moments ago the Senator from Kansas and I had calls from the \nAmbassador of Pakistan. They have tendered an offer now of over a 100-\nmillion-ton purchase from the United States. It is my understanding \nthat they will make an effort at a nearly 300,000-tons purchase within \nthe next several months. That is significant, and those tonnages will \nbe purchased from the United States.\n  Our actions here have consequences. If we want to be players in the \nworld market, with and for our producers, we cannot throw up the \nartificial barrier of politics. We tore that down last Thursday in this \ninstance, and the nations involved are responding.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are a number of issues we find \nstrong agreement on today on the agricultural matters. And the matter \nthat was just spoken about by the Senator from Idaho regarding \nsanctions is one in which I have very strong agreement with him, and \nalso with the Presiding Officer, Senator Roberts of Kansas. All of us \nagree that it doesn't make any sense at all to use food as a tool of \nforeign policy and to tell farmers to pay the costs of sanctions, and \nso on. So I am very pleased that we were able, on a bipartisan basis, \nto work together to resolve that issue. I think we have done that in an \neffective way.\n  I am also pleased that the amendment which we have just offered and \nwas accepted and cosponsored by the Senator from Idaho. We have worked \nwith the Senator from Idaho and others, including the Senator from \nKansas, Senator Roberts, in discussions on a wide range of income \nissues dealing with family farmers. The reason I sought recognition is \njust to make one final point; that is, this amendment now becomes part \nof the agricultural appropriations bill. It then goes from the Senate \nto a conference with House of Representatives. That is likely, between \nnow and sometime in September, as this agricultural crisis continues to \nemerge, to occur in a way that may require some changes and some \nadjustments. We all understand that.\n  But I think this is an enormously important and a helpful first step \nto say to family farmers who are struggling that we recognize that this \nis, indeed, a crisis and we want to respond to that crisis.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his leadership, and the \nSenator from Arkansas for his leadership as well, and I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, who is as determined and effective and tough \na legislator as there is to work with. I am pleased to have joined him \nin working on this amendment as well.\n  I think this is an important step, and it will be viewed as good \nnews--not necessarily the final answer, but good news by family \nfarmers, that on a bipartisan basis the Congress recognizes a crisis \nand is prepared to respond effectively to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDaschle, Senator Harkin, Senator Baucus, Senator Hollings, and Senator \nWellstone all be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also thank my colleague who is in the \nChair, Senator Roberts, for his good advice to us as we proceeded with \nthis effort. I want to tell him that we look forward to working with \nhim as we try to craft a bipartisan, long-term solution to the problems \nthat we face. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Montana, Mr. Burns, be added as a cosponsor to the Conrad \namendment that was previously offered and agreed to by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are now moving toward the point where \nwe are wrapping up the consideration of amendments on the agriculture \nappropriations bill. A number of Senators have advised the managers \nthat they do not intend to offer amendments that they had originally \nproposed to the bill. We are encouraged by that, and with some effort I \nthink the Senate can complete action on this bill very soon. We are \nawaiting the arrival in the Chamber of Senators who have suggested that \nthey will offer amendments. We encourage them to come to\n\n[[Page S8293]]\n\nthe floor, offer those amendments, and let's debate them. If we can \nagree to them, we will recommend that to the Senate. We appreciate very \nmuch the cooperation and assistance of all Senators who have been \nhelpful to us in this effort.\n\n\n                1998 LOUISIANA DROUGHT AND CROP DISASTER\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I call to the Senate's attention the \nserious and significant drought which has occurred in Louisiana this \nyear. The combination of a prolonged lack of rainfall and persistent \nhigh temperatures have resulted in a natural disaster of historic \nproportions. For those affected, damages have been hard-hitting.\n  As we debate the 1999 agricultural appropriations bill and amendments \nto it which respond to severe agricultural distress throughout the \nnation this year, caused by weather-related damages and low commodity \nprices, I urge my colleagues to keep in mind the situation in \nLouisiana.\n  On June 18 of this year, Governor M.J. ``Mike'' Foster and \nCommissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Bob Odom wrote to Agriculture \nSecretary Dan Glickman about the drought in Louisiana.\n  Though adequate production records were not yet available at the time \nof their letter, Governor Foster and Commissioner Odom told Secretary \nGlickman substantial losses were expected in the state and that they \nexpected to be requesting a disaster declaration as soon as adequate \nproduction information could be obtained.\n  Various row crops and pine and hardwood seedlings have been affected \nin Louisiana by the drought, they said. Cattle have been affected \nbecause of severe hay and pasture shortages. Poultry losses also have \noccurred due to the high temperatures.\n  Illustrative of the drought's historic character, they pointed out \nthat records have been set for the least amount of rainfall received in \nthe month of May, with rainfall records going back more than 100 years.\n  Though Congressionally-authorized programs are in place at USDA to \nrespond to disasters, I urge the Senate to be prepared to respond \nfurther and promptly as conditions and impacts would worsen.\n  Mr. President, we know that production disruptions brought about by \nthe drought will cause economic disruptions for producers. In addition, \nthe communities in which our producers live also will be affected. It \nis for these reasons that I urge close attention to crop disasters and \nlow prices and a readiness to act as warranted.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, earlier today I voted for Senator \nGrassley's Sense of the Senate amendment that urges prompt action on a \nnumber of trade, tax, and regulatory issues in order to help the \nAmerican farm community. I think our farmers are experiencing serious \nproblems, and I believe that prompt action on many of the initiatives \ncontained in the Grassley amendment will help expand U.S. agricultural \nexport markets and improve farm profits.\n  The amendment Senator Grassley put before the Senate recommended that \nthe Senate act on S. 2078, the Farm Ranch Risk Management Act, which I \nhave cosponsored. It urges action to provide full funding for the \nInternational Monetary Fund; I believe action to increase the capital \nof the IMF is essential to address the economic crisis in Asia and the \ncurrent situation in Russia, both of which have enormous impacts on \nU.S. agriculture. It urges Congressional approval legislation to \ncontinue normal trading relations with China, which I also support. It \ncalls for estate tax reform, reduced regulations on farmers, and use of \nthe Commodity Credit Corporation and Export Enhancement Program at the \nDepartment of Agriculture, all of which are worthy of prompt attention \nby the Senate.\n  Notwithstanding my support for the general objective of Senator \nGrassley's amendment, however, I do have one major reservation \nconcerning his amendment, and that has to do with fast-track trade \nnegotiating authority.\n  Senator Grassley's amendment urges providing the President with new \nfast-track negotiating authority. I oppose giving the President that \nauthority at this time, for both practical and philosophical reasons. \nAs a practical matter, fast-track, and any agreements it might \nultimately lead to, will only provide benefits to American agriculture \nin the distant future, not in the near term. In fact, the only possible \ntrade agreement on the horizon is with Chile, and that agreement, even \nif it were put into place tomorrow, would be unlikely to have any \nsignificant impact on the economic health of American agriculture.\n  Moreover, granting the President fast-track authority is not \ncurrently warranted because of the total lack of consensus on American \ntrade policy for the future. Large parts of the rest of the world \ncannot discern any consistent set of underlying principles governing \nU.S. trade policy decisions. Congress and the Administration have not \ncome to an agreement on a trade policy framework, and in the absence of \nthat framework, decisions are all too often made on an ad hoc basis.\n  Granting the President fast-track authority requires the Congress to \ndelegate much of the trade authority given the legislative branch by \nour Constitution to the President. It is no less a delegation of \nCongressional authority than the line-item veto. Fast track is \ntherefore an issue of the utmost importance institutionally and \nConstitutionally to the Congress. In the absence of real consensus on \ntrade policy within both the executive branch and the Congress, I \ncannot and do not support this kind of diminution of Congressional \nauthority over trade.\n  My support for the general objectives of the Grassley amendment does \nnot represent any change in my view of the fast-track issue. In the \nabsence of a consensus on a new trade policy architecture that includes \nnot only the Congress and the President, but also American agriculture, \nlabor, the business community, and the American people generally, I \noppose providing the President with new fast-track negotiating \nauthority.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I voted for the Grassley sense of the \nSenate amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill because I \nsupport nine of its ten provisions.\n  I do not support the provision stating that we should enact the bill \nS. 1269, which reauthorizes fast-track trading authority for the \nPresident.\n  It is premature and disruptive to endorse fast-track legislation now, \nbefore resolving questions about its effect on jobs and the \nenvironment. These are very controversial and complicated problems, and \nso far we have not figured out how to deal with them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nbody an issue which is percolating under the surface as we move toward \nthe end of this week; that is, the question of the financing of the \nTeamsters Union elections which were financed by tax dollars, and which \nelections may be held again for which there has been a request to \nfinance them again with tax dollars.\n  The last time we went down this road, the Teamsters Union ran an \nelection which was overseen by the U.S. attorney in New York with the \nassistance of the Justice Department. And the U.S. Marshals I believe \nwere also involved in it. The taxpayers of this country spent $17 \nmillion to oversee this election. The election was then reviewed. It \nwas determined that the election had been fraudulently run, that it had \ncorruptly proceeded, and that it was basically an election which had to \nbe voided by the Federal judge who was overseeing the election.\n  So for the $17 million of tax money which we invested in order to get \na fair and honest election in the Teamsters\n\n[[Page S8294]]\n\nUnion, the taxpayers got a dishonest, corrupt, and fraudulent election.\n  That is bad enough. What is even worse is that the taxpayers had to \npay in the first place to oversee a union election.\n  This is the largest union in the United States, I believe, relative \nto membership. It is a very wealthy union. It is obviously a union \nwhich has had some significant problems over the years, both with its \nleadership and with the management, and especially with its pension \nfunds for its rank and file. But it clearly is a union which has the \nfinancial strength to pay the cost of oversight of its elections to \nassure that the rank-and-file membership of the union get a fair and \nhonest election.\n  I personally felt sorry for the membership of the Teamsters Union \nwhich has been put through this election which has been so fraudulently \nmanaged. But I also think that the taxpayers have to be concerned. We \nhave to be concerned about the taxpayers. Why should the taxpayers of \nthis country be asked to pay for the cost of overseeing a union \nelection for a union which is so wealthy? Clearly, for any oversight \nthat occurs, the cost should be borne by the union itself. I should \nthink it would want to in order to obtain an honest and fair election. \nBut no, that didn't happen.\n  In the last election, the taxpayers came up with $17 million, which \nwas clearly wasted. Have we been reimbursed for that? Have the \ntaxpayers been reimbursed for that $17 million? No, we haven't. I \nrealize that in Washington $17 million seems like a meager sum, but I \nhave to tell you, it is a lot of money.\n  There are a lot of people in New Hampshire both who are union members \nand who are nonunion members, who work very hard and who work all year \nlong to pay their taxes. And if you were to add up their taxes, you \nwould find it didn't meet $17 million. I suspect that is probably for \n5,000 or 6,000 people in the State of New Hampshire the tax burden for \na year. I am not sure. That is a guess. But I suspect it is a large \nnumber of people who work all year paying their taxes so they can be \nput into this union election, which is then fraudulently run. And we \ndidn't get the money back.\n\n  Now they come to us again. They say, ``We need another--we don't know \nwhat the final figure might be.'' But initially they need another $8 \nmillion of tax money in order to run this second election. Fool me \nonce, and it is your fault. Fool me twice, and it is my fault. Clearly, \nit is the taxpayer who is being taken down the road. If the Congress \nallows this to happen again, it is the Congress that is being taken \ndown the road, and as a result we are not carrying out our obligation \nto support the taxpayers.\n  So for us to pay another $8 million--it may end up being much more \nthan that. It may be $20 million in order to support another union \nelection after we haven't been reimbursed for the $17 million we spent \nin the last election, which was basically totally mismanaged. It is \ninconceivable. It is inappropriate. It makes no sense. Fortunately, \nthat is my view. Unfortunately, there are a number of people around \nhere who have a different view.\n  The White House wants us to spend this money. The Justice Department \nwants us to spend this money. The Speaker of the House wants to spend, \nI guess, this money. A number of Members of our own body want to spend \nthis money. But to get this money, they have to, at least in theory, \ncome to the committee that I chair and get me to authorize and \nreprogram to do it.\n  I want to go on record as to why I am not doing it. I am not going to \nreauthorize that reprogram because I am not going to go back to New \nHampshire and be walking through a factory somewhere, or on a farm \nsomewhere, or in a small software company somewhere, and have one of my \nconstituents come up to me and say, ``You know, last year I paid X \ndollars in taxes, and you just sent it to run a corrupt election for \nthe Teamsters. What are you doing with my money? Aren't you supposed to \nbe taking care of that money down there? Aren't you supposed to be my \nfiduciary? Aren't you supposed to be overseeing it so it doesn't get \nwasted?''\n  If I approve this transfer, my answer to them would have to be, I am \nnot doing my job, that I am not fulfilling my obligation to protect the \ntaxpayers from the fraudulent misuse of their funds.\n  The Teamsters Union has the financial wherewithal to pay the cost of \noverseeing its own elections. The last election was such an abysmal \nfailure from the standpoint of integrity, from the standpoint of \nappropriateness of an election process, that it is absolutely \ninexcusable that the Court, that the Justice Department, that the White \nHouse, or that anyone else would come to us again and say, Taxpayers, \nwe are going to go down this road one more time. We are going to take \nyou on this ride one more time. We are going to spend your money one \nmore time to run another election for a union which has proven itself \nto be so corrupt in the manner in which it runs elections.'' It is just \nbeyond my comprehension how we can pursue that course of action. But \nthat seems to be the desire of a number of members in this body and a \nnumber of members of the other body, of the White House and of the \nleadership of the Justice Department. However, if they are going to do \nit, they are going to do it without my support, and I will do \neverything I can in this body to make sure that those tax dollars are \nnot spent in this way.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today marks the 211th anniversary of one of \nthe more momentous, but little-understood, perhaps, events in our \ncountry's history. I will just take a few minutes to remind ourselves \nof that event and to consider just how the course of this Nation's \nhistory might have been forever altered if not for what transpired on \nJuly 16, 1787.\n  It should be of special significance to Members of this body, because \nit was, fortunately for us, that those who attended the Philadelphia \nConvention were some of the ablest, brightest figures of the time; in \nfact, of any time. Ah, Mr. President, to have been a fly on the wall at \nthat gathering! Truly, this was a gathering graced by an accumulation--\nnay, an abundance--of wisdom, learning, grace, and dignity of a like \nnot seen since the conclaves at Mt. Olympus! From Virginia alone, there \nwere Washington, James Madison, George Mason, and Edmund Randolph; from \nMassachusetts, Elbridge Gerry and Rufus King; from Pennsylvania, James \nWilson, Gouverneur Morris and Benjamin Franklin; and from New York, \nHamilton. Here was a constitutional dream team for the ages! And what a \nstarting five! What foe could resist a lineup featuring Wilson's full-\ncourt vision, Madison's patience and tactical prowess, Hamilton's \naggressive offense, Franklin's experience, and George Washington's \ndominating presence in the center, as the one who presided over the \ngathering.\n\n  These five were just the tip of the iceberg. Fifty-five men in all \npresented themselves at the Convention, representing every State, save \none--Rhode Island. And with passion and gusto they soon set about \ndevising a plan to guide the country past the shoals and rocks and \nstorms that beset it and into a new sea of tranquility and prosperity.\n  Nowadays, many of us overlook the tremendous physical and mental \neffort that were expended in drafting the Constitution. In reading this \nshort document--here it is, I hold it in my hand--in reading this short \ndocument, with its precise and careful phrases, it is easy to forget \nthe toil, the sweat, the frustration, the shouting, the argumentation, \nthe thinking, speechifying, and the pleading that went into its \ncreation during that hot Philadelphia summer. For progress was \nunavoidably slow, and the greatest sticking point--``the most \nthreatening that was encountered in framing the Constitution,'' \naccording to Madison--was the question of whether States should be\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\nrepresented in Congress equally or on the basis of population.\n  This question was far from academic, of course. In order to create a \nConstitution acceptable to the States, the delegates needed to assuage \nthe fears of the small States that they would be swallowed up in a more \ncentralized union. The smaller States looked to Virginia, \nMassachusetts, and Pennsylvania, with fear and with distrust. The small \nStates feared that a Congress based on population would soon fall under \nthe sway of the large States. New Jersey's delegates declared that it \nwould not be ``safe''--the word is theirs, not mine--they would not be \nsafe to allow Virginia 16 times as many votes as Delaware. They \nrejected the Virginia Plan, which was presented by Governor Edmund \nRandolph, with its legislature of two houses, and instead proposed a \nCongress with a single legislative chamber in which the States had an \nequal vote.\n  The Continental Congress, of course, had been a single Chamber, a \nunilateral legislative branch. It was followed by the Congress, under \nthe Articles of Confederation, again, one body. It was legislative, \nexecutive and, to some considerable part, judicial all in one. There \nwas no Chief Executive in the form of an individual. It was the \nCongress under the Confederation.\n  Days, and then weeks, of prolonged and acrimonious debate failed to \nresolve the issue. Some suggested redrawing State boundaries so that \nall the States would be of roughly equal size. The Convention \nconsidered, and then failed to agree upon, equal representation of \nStates in the lower House of Congress. Several times, Connecticut \nadvanced a proposal, initially made by Roger Sherman, calling for equal \nrepresentation of States in the Senate. This, too, failed to win \nsupport. Madison--James Madison--labeled it unjust. Massachusetts' \nRufus King angrily announced that he would not, could not, listen to \nany talk of equal representation in the Senate. James Wilson declaimed \nthat the small States had nothing to fear from their larger brethren in \nthe large States. To this, Delaware's Gunning Bedford retorted, ``I do \nnot, gentlemen, trust you!'' and warned his colleagues that the small \nStates might themselves confederate or even find ``some foreign ally of \nmore honor and good faith who will take them by the hand and do them \njustice.'' Bedford was roundly rebuked for his words, but the threat of \nforeign alliances lingered in the stale and sticky summer air. There \nwas no air-conditioning, much like it was in this Chamber up until \n1929, when air-conditioning first came to this Chamber.\n\n  Efforts to resolve this question ``nearly terminated in a dissolution \nof the Convention''--it came that close; the effort to resolve this \nquestion--according to Luther Martin of Maryland, whose own \nimpulsiveness and heated language did little to calm matters. \nWashington, that charismatic sphinx who presided over the Convention \nbut kept his thoughts mostly to himself, confided to Hamilton in July \nthat he ``almost despaired'' of success. And Sherman of Connecticut \nlamented that ``[i]t seems,'' he said, ``we have got to a point that we \ncannot move one way or another.''\n  On Monday, July 16--Monday, July 16--some 2 months after the \nConvention began--the question was finally resolved. Perhaps it was \nfear of failure that led the delegates to settle, for they knew that \nthe country's future was in their hands--their hands. Perhaps it was \nexhaustion, for they had already spent many long days and weeks in \nearnest debate. It may have been because of the heat that had tormented \nthem for so long. Maybe that finally broke that day. Or perhaps the \nopen exchange of opinions, that wrenching but vital process of \nquestioning, debating, and argumentation--that process had successfully \nwhittled away extraneous detail and opinion to arrive at an essential \nverity. Franklin had described the Convention as ``groping . . . in the \ndark to find political truth''; perhaps they had at last stumbled upon \nit. In any event, this day, 211 years ago, the delegates agreed that \nCongress would be composed of a Senate with equal representation for \neach State and a House based on proportional representation. This was \nthe Great Compromise, as it was, and has ever since been, called.\n  Perhaps, Mr. President, we would do best to avert our mind's eye from \nthe horrors that might have befallen this country had the framers not \nstruck the Great Compromise. Perhaps we would be better off simply to \nthank them, and to also thank Providence, for the miraculous document--\nthe miraculous document; there it is in my hand--the miraculous \ndocument that is our Federal Constitution. Perhaps . . . but one thing \nis clear; without the Great Compromise, the Senate as we know it would \nnot exist.\n  Without that compromise, without that Great Compromise, the \nConstitution might not even exist; the Senate, as we know it, you can \nbe sure, would not exist. For this body was conceived that day, 211 \nyears ago today, in Philadelphia when the framers agreed to an upper \nHouse of Congress in which each State--each State--had an equal number \nof votes, each State had equal representation. This is the forum that \nwas born on that day. This is the body--the unique; the body sui \ngeneris--that was born on that day, the Senate of the United \nStates. But for the Great Compromise, the Senate--that beloved \ninstitution to which so many of us have dedicated our lives, our hopes, \nour reputations, our strength, our talents, our visions--might never \nhave seen the light of day, let alone played an often pivotal and \ndramatic role in our national history over the course of more than two \ncenturies.\n\n  Mr. President, we would all do well to recall from time to time that \nthe chamber in which we sit owes its existence to a remarkable instance \nof compromise and conciliation.\n  Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Senator Thad Cochran of \nMississippi, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia might never have \nmet, might never have known one another, might never have had an \nopportunity to work together in the interests of our respective \nconstituencies, in the interests of this great Republic.\n  When next we in the Senate are unable to reach agreement--when we \nfind ourselves plagued by seemingly insurmountable obstacles--when we \nbecome frustrated at the obduracy and narrow-mindedness of our \nopponents--perhaps then, we should remember that minds far more \nintelligent, visions far more far seeing, persons far more learned--Ah, \nthat learned group of men, they knew about the classics. They knew \nabout Rome and Athens, Persia, Polybius, Plutarch. They knew about \nMontesquieu. They knew about the colonial experience, the history of \nEngland, the history of the ancient Romans.\n\n  They were able to find common ground on a matter of far greater \nimport and controversy than much of what we discuss here today. And we \nshould then think to ourselves that just maybe we, too, can find some \ncompromise, some meeting of the minds such as our framers found on that \nday so long ago in Philadelphia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise to express my profound gratitude \nto my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for \nalways injecting a meaningful, penetrating history lesson such as we \nhave just been subjected to. It had not occurred to me that it has been \n211 years since those magnificent days in Philadelphia brought us this \nsacred document we call the Constitution which has made us the longest \nliving democracy on Earth, under a Constitution that is the longest \nliving organic law under which any nation has ever lived.\n  I have made speeches on the floor time and again about what I call \nthe trivialization of the Constitution. When one considers since \nCongress first convened there have been over 11,500 efforts to amend \nthis document, over 11,500 resolutions introduced in the House and the \nSenate to amend the work of Madison, Franklin, Hamilton and Adams, and \nall those great minds which, as the distinguished Senator knows, the \ngreat scholar Arthur Schlesinger called the greatest assemblage of \npolitical genius ever under one roof--I don't quarrel with that for an \ninstant.\n  As you have so eloquently pointed out, those men were schooled in the \nart and the nobility of government. They were historians and they were \nlawyers, but they were brilliant men. They knew there would be \ncharlatans coming down the pike, trying to trivialize\n\n[[Page S8296]]\n\nthe Constitution. I remember some since I came to the Senate.\n  I am very pleased to say that I will, at the end of this year, have \nbeen a Member of this body for 24 years. I voted for one constitutional \namendment the first year I was in the Senate, and it was a mistake. I \nam often asked by some member of the press, ``Do you regret some of \nyour votes?''\n  Of course I do; I am not infallible. If I were doing it over again, I \ndon't know which ones offhand, but if I went through my record, there \nwould be votes I would change. And one amendment to the Constitution \nwhich I supported--which, in my opinion today, was dead wrong--I will \ntell you, was the Equal Rights Amendment. We didn't need a \nconstitutional amendment to provide women with equal rights. We did \nthat in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and it has been working just \nfine. We did not have to tinker with the Constitution to do it.\n  I believe my staff has told me I have voted 38 times against \nconstitutional amendments. I think I want that on my epitaph. And, \nwhile noble men may disagree on this, I do not intend before I leave \nthe Senate to cast a vote to change the Bill of Rights. The Bill of \nRights--I defer to my colleague--I think they were ratified in 1791. \nBut when the framers left Philadelphia, it was understood that James \nMadison was going to compose these 10 amendments to the Constitution. \nThese are today called our Bill of Rights. That is the first ten \namendments to the Constitution, which provide us freedom of the press, \nfreedom of religion--we have more freedom of religion than most of us \nare taking advantage of now--and freedom of speech.\n  Sometimes when I read stories in the press, I think, surely there is \nsome way we can change the freedom of the press clause in the \nConstitution to stop this sort of irresponsible reporting. But I am not \ngoing to do that, because I don't think you can do it without creating \na lot more problems than you will solve.\n  Senator Byrd, if I had my way, no youngster would graduate from \ncollege without a fundamental, profound understanding of the \nConstitution. And precious few of them are graduating with that \nknowledge today.\n  Congress deserves a lot of credit. Oh, we take a lot of slings and \narrows in this body about knuckling under the special interests, the \nvoters, and the money, and all that sort of thing, but does it not \nspeak well for the Congress that, out of 11,500-plus efforts to change \nthe Constitution, we have only seen fit to do it 27 times? And that \nincludes the first block of 10, called the Bill of Rights, in 1791. You \ntake the 10 in the Bill of Rights out; that leaves 17 times we have \nactually amended the Constitution. And you remember, we decided we \nwouldn't drink, and later we decided we would drink; you take those 2 \nout and there are only 15 times. That is pretty amazing, is it not?\n  We are importing workers. You heard the debate here just recently \nabout how we are going to allow 75,000 to 95,000 high-tech personnel \nfrom abroad, special visa status to come to this country to work. I \ndidn't vote for that bill, incidentally. I still think it was a \nmistake. But one of the things that troubles me about that is why we \nare going all out in this country to train people to be computer \nexperts or high-tech gurus. Yet this poor document, the Constitution--\nwhich is next to the Holy Bible in sacredness to me--youngsters are \ngraduating from college, and they don't know who James Madison is --the \nfather of the Constitution.\n  Now, I don't want to denigrate any of my colleagues, but I have to \nlook very carefully at somebody today who thinks he can improve on the \nwords of James Madison. I can assure my colleagues and my constituents \nback home that I will leave here this fall still only having voted for \nonly one constitutional amendment in my 24 years here.\n  So, Mr. President, I might just quit on this one note. If I were \ngoing to confess to this body the one thing about the Constitution that \ndisturbs me more than anything else--it was a good idea in its time, \nbut I am troubled about it now--that is the fifth amendment requirement \nof grand juries. The States have long since pretty much eliminated \ngrand juries. But the grand jury system was guaranteed for serious \noffenses in the Fifth Amendment because they wanted a jury of your \npeers to make the decision to indict, not the King.\n  As a matter of fact, the authors of the Constitution intended to make \nsure that we had no more kings, and they succeeded very admirably. We \nhave had 42 Presidents, I guess, and no kings, since 1787. But I will \nsay this. Their idea was that you could trust the people with your \ndeciding fate and your innocence or guilt a lot more than you could the \nCrown or anybody representing the Crown.\n  And, so, the grand jury system had the noblest of intentions. But I \nwould be remiss if I didn't relieve myself of this thought for the \nbenefit of whoever wants to listen. I can tell you, what is going on \nwith the grand jury system in this country right now is dangerous--\ndangerous in the extreme. I am not suggesting we change the \nConstitution to do away with grand juries, but I am saying that the \ngrand jury system needs some control and it needs reforming. I have \nintroduced legislation which will do that.\n  Well, Mr. President, this conversation has been the highlight of my \nday. I hadn't thought lately about that hot July in 1787 in \nPhiladelphia. It was so hot and George Washington was so intent on \neverything being secret, they closed the windows and they almost \nsuffocated just to make sure that nothing of the deliberations was \nheard on the street. But what a lucky people we are to have the honor \nand the privilege of living in this great country of ours because of \nthose men. Some of them fought in the Revolution, sacrificed their \nfamilies to fight in the Revolution. And they went there and provided \nus with this magnificent document.\n\n  I thank the Senator again for raising our awareness level on that \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we might pause tomorrow, July 17, to \nremember that it was on July 17, 1789, 2 years later, that the Senate \nof the United States passed the Judiciary Act. The Senate was not \nexpected to originate legislation. That didn't mean it could not, but \nit was anticipated that the House would originate about all the \nlegislation and the Senate would tamper with it, improve it, refine it, \nand so on.\n  But in the U.S. Senate, on July 17, 1789, history will always mark \nthe passage of the Judiciary Act, which created the judicial system. \nOliver Ellsworth was a key player in that matter. He later became Chief \nJustice of the United States. But he was never as a justice what he was \nas a legislator. Oliver Ellsworth. It all causes one to marvel at how \nthat first Senate came to grips with these problems and legislated for \nthe first time on so many of these things. And it was in that first \nCongress that the two Houses learned to work together and have \nconferences on bills, where they resolved the differences between the \ntwo Houses.\n  Our forebears were remarkable men. That was a remarkable time in \nhistory. I will never fail to believe that Providence had its hand in \nthe destiny of this country when those marvelous things happened in \nPhiladelphia. When one pauses to think about it, the real miracle--and \nthere were many miracles that happened there--was when men of different \nminds and different experiences, different temperaments, viewpoints, \nand attitudes, were able to mold their opinions and give and take, \ncompromise, and come to a conclusion. That was a miracle in many ways.\n\n  It seems to me that the greatest miracle of all was the convergence \nof circumstances and people that took place with the Convention. \nPerhaps 5 years earlier it would not have happened, because the country \nhad not yet fully experienced all of the weaknesses and shortcomings of \nthe Articles of Confederation. A consensus had not yet formed as to the \nnecessity for a new Constitution. Its experiences under the Articles \ntaught it many things to avoid in this new Constitution. And it was \nfortunate that the Convention was not delayed until 5 years later, as \nwe consider the events that occurred in France with the French \nRevolution and all of the horrors that took place there with the \nexecution of King Louis XVI.\n  The fruit ripened just at the right time. That, to me, showed the \nhand of Providence, and that was somewhat of a miracle in itself.\n  I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8297]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I join my friend from Arkansas in \nthanking the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his comments \ntoday. It is always a pleasure to hear him recount the history of our \ncountry. In doing so, I can't help but remember the time and effort and \ndiligence he put to the task of writing the ``History of the U.S. \nSenate,'' which we have in our offices and others have had an \nopportunity to enjoy and appreciate over the last several years. It is \none of the remarkable acts of scholarship that has been turned in by a \nU.S. Senator and probably ranks No. 1 in the list of books written by \nactive Members of the U.S. Senate, for all of which I think we owe a \ndeep expression, and sincere expression, of gratitude to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there is just one final little anecdote \nthat I would like to share with the Senate.\n  When my former colleague, Senator Pryor, left the Senate last year, \nhe went home to the University of Arkansas to teach. He is sort of a \nroving professor. He taught one day at the school of business, and the \nnext day the school of agriculture, and so on. He was at the law school \none day. He said that some smart law student got up and said, ``Why \ndon't you deliver a lecture someday on the comparison of our democracy \nand the Athenian democracy?'' Senator Pryor said he didn't know what to \ndo. So he went back to his office and he called the Senate historian \nand he told him what he was up against. The historian said, ``You are \nlucky. Senator Byrd has just delivered about 15 speeches on Athenian \ndemocracy.'' He sent those to him, and he said everybody in the \nuniversity thinks he is an Athenian scholar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8294-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8297-S8330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

FOOD SAFETY INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In addition to the amounts made available \n     under other provisions of this Act, there are appropriated, \n     out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, \n     to carry out activities described in the Food Safety \n     Initiative submitted by the President for fiscal year 1999--\n       (1) $98,000 to the Chief Economist;\n       (2) $906,000 to the Economic Research Service;\n       (3) $8,920,000 to the Agricultural Research Service;\n       (4) $11,000,000 to the Cooperative State Research, \n     Education, and Extension Service;\n       (5) $8,347,000 to the Food Safety and Inspection Service; \n     and\n       (6) $37,000,000 to the Food and Drug Administration.\n       1. Amendment of the No Net Cost Fund assessments to provide \n     for collection of all administrative costs not previously \n     covered and all crop insurance costs for tobacco. Section \n     106A of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, 7 U.S.C. \n     1445-1(c), is hereby amended by, in (d)(7) changing ``the \n     Secretary'' to ``the Secretary: and'' and by adding a new \n     clause. (d)(8) read as follows:\n       ``(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subsection or other law, that with respect to the 1999 and \n     subsequent crops of tobacco for which price support is made \n     available and for which a Fund is maintained under this \n     section, an additional assessment shall be remitted over and \n     above that otherwise provided for in this subsection. Such \n     additional assessment shall be equal to: (1) the \n     administrative costs within the Department of Agriculture \n     that not otherwise covered under another assessment under \n     this section or under another provision of law; and (2) any \n     and all net losses in federal crop insurance programs for \n     tobacco, whether those losses be on price-supported tobacco \n     or on other tobaccos. The Secretary shall estimate those \n     administrative and insurance costs in advance. The Secretary \n     may make such adjustments in the assessment under this clause \n     for future crops as are needed to cover shortfalls or over-\n     collections. The assessment shall be applied so that the \n     additional amount to be collected under this clause shall be \n     the same for all price support tobaccos (and imported tobacco \n     of like kind) which are marketed or imported into the United \n     States during the marketing year for the crops covered by \n     this clause. For each domestically produced pound of tobacco \n     the assessment amount to be remitted under this clause shall \n     be paid by the purchaser of the tobacco. On imported tobacco, \n     the assessment shall be paid by the importer. Monies \n     collected pursuant to this section shall be commingled with \n     other monies in the No Net Cost Fund maintained under this \n     section. The administrative and crop insurance costs that are \n     taken into account in fixing the amount of the assessment \n     shall be a claim on the Fund and shall be transferred to the \n     appropriate account for the payment of administrative costs \n     and insurance costs at a time determined appropriate by the \n     Secretary. Collections under this clause shall not effect the \n     amount of any other collection established under this section \n     or under another provision of law but shall be enforceable in \n     the same manner as other assessments under this section and \n     shall be subject to the same sanctions for nonpayment.''\n       2. Amendment of the No Net Cost Account assessments to \n     provide for collection of all administrative cost not \n     previously covered and all crop insurance costs. Section 106B \n     of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 1445-2, \n     is amended by renumbering subsections ``(i)'' and ``(j)'' as \n     ``(j)'' and ``(k)'' respectively, and by adding a new \n     subsection ``(i)'' to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section \n     or other law, the Secretary shall require with respect to the \n     1999 and subsequent crops of tobacco for which price support \n     is made available and for which an Account is maintained \n     under this section, that an additional assessment shall be \n     remitted over and above that otherwise provided for in this \n     subsection. Such additional assessment shall be equal to: (1) \n     the administrative costs within the Department of Agriculture \n     that are not otherwise covered under another assessment under \n     this section or under another provision of law; and (2) any \n     and all net losses in federal crop insurance programs for \n     tobacco, whether those losses be on price-supported tobacco \n     or on other tobaccos. The Secretary shall estimate those \n     administrative and insurance costs in advance. The Secretary \n     may make such adjustments in the assessments under this \n     clause for future crops as are needed to cover shortfalls or \n     over-collections. The assessment shall be applied so that the \n     additional amount to be collected under this clause shall be \n     the same for all price support tobaccos (and imported tobacco \n     of like kind) which are marketed or imported into the United \n     States during the marketing year for the crops covered by \n     this clause. For each domestically produced pound of tobacco \n     the assessment amount to be remitted under this clause shall \n     be paid by the purchaser of the tobacco. On imported tobacco, \n     the assessment shall be paid by the importer. Monies \n     collected pursuant to this section shall be commingled with \n     other monies in the No Net Cost Account maintained under this \n     section. The administrative and crop insurance costs that are \n     taken into account in fixing the amount of the assessment \n     shall be a claim on the Account and shall be transferred to \n     the appropriate account for the payment of administrative \n     costs and insurance costs at a\n\n[[Page S8298]]\n\n     time determined appropriate by the Secretary.Collections \n     under this clause shall not effect the amount of any other \n     collection established under this section or under another \n     provision of law but shall be enforceable in the same manner \n     as other assessments under this section and shall be subject \n     to the same sanctions for nonpayment.''\n       3. Elimination of the Tobacco Budget Assessment. \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the provisions of \n     Section 106(g) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, 7 \n     USC 1445(g) shall not apply or be extended to the 1999 crops \n     of tobacco and shall not, in any case, apply to any tobacco \n     for which additional assessments have been rendered under \n     Sections 1 and 2 of this Act.\n       Section 4(g) of the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 714b(g)) is amended in the first sentence by \n     striking ``$193,000,000'' and inserting ``$178,000,000''.\n       Amend the figure on page 12 line 20 by reducing the sum by \n     $13,500,000.\n       Amend page 12 line 25 by striking ``law.'' and inserting in \n     lieu thereof the following: ``law, and an additional \n     $13,500,000 is provided to be available on October 1, 1999 \n     under the provisions of this paragraph.''\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my cosponsors on this amendment are \nSenators Leahy, Kennedy, Torricelli, Durbin, Wellstone, Mikulski, and \nMurray. I want them all added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment that I just offered would \nrestore $66 million for the President's Food Safety Initiative, the \nfunding of which I believe should be a national priority. I understand \nthe constraints faced here on this subcommittee on spending. But food \nsafety is an increasing problem in this country. As the President has \npointed out, I think we ought to make food safety a priority. If there \nis one thing we all do, it is that we all eat. And there are few things \nmore important than knowing that the food you are going to eat isn't \ngoing to make you sick.\n  So this amendment really is to ensure that the health and safety of \nAmerican consumers is protected, and protected even better than it has \nbeen in the past.\n  Again, Mr. President, I don't know the reason why this is happening. \nBut more and more frequently we are getting outbreaks of pathogens and \nfoodborne illnesses in this country.\n  Just last month, in June of 1998, there were 12 outbreaks of \nfoodborne illnesses in this country. Here is the chart that depicts \nthat. I know there are more dots here than 12. But there are 12 \ndifferent outbreaks. Some outbreaks occurred in more than one State. So \nwe had 12 different outbreaks. It affected consumers in 41 States and \ncaused more than 7,000 illnesses.\n  That is in the month of June of this year. That is one month. That is \njust the tip of the iceberg. It is estimated that there are millions of \ncases and over 9,000 deaths per year in this country from foodborne \nillnesses, including a lot of kids who need dialysis, or kidney \ntransplants, after eating food contaminated with what now has become a \nwell known pathogen, E. coli 0157H7. We all know that kids get it. They \nget deathly ill from it. Many die. Those who do not go on kidney \ndialysis have kidney transplants.\n  Here is the interesting thing. This pathogen, E. coli 0157H7, we all \nread about. And you can talk to persons on the street and they know \nabout E. coli 0157H7. It didn't even exist 20 years ago. So we are \nseeing new mutations. Twenty years ago, E. coli 0157H7 didn't even \nexist, and today thousands of people are getting sick and dying from it \nthroughout the United States.\n  The E. coli 0157H7 are the blue dots. The white dots, the green dots, \nand all these others--about six different ones here--E. coli 0157H7 \noutbreaks throughout the country in June.\n  One other outbreak, which affected hundreds of people in 12 States, \ninvolved an unusual strain of Salmonella that came in breakfast \ncereals. That is the one in the red dots here you can see all over the \nUnited States.\n  I happen to be a cereal eater. I have eaten cereal--Cheerios, \nWheaties, and everything else--since I was a kid, obviously, and I am \nsure everyone else has. If there is one thing that you think is really \nsafe, it is cereal. It is dry. It is roasted, toasted, baked, or \nsomething. You get it in a box, you open it, put it in the bowl, put \nmilk on it, and you think it is safe. This is the first time that we \nhave ever had Salmonella occur in a dry cereal. Usually you get \nSalmonella in raw eggs, or things like that, but not from cereal.\n  So, as I said, there is something happening that we have not seen \nbefore in terms of the kinds of foods and the numbers of outbreaks and \nthe new pathogens that are affecting our country.\n  I always like to ask people when I talk about this in meetings in \nIowa and other places. I say, ``How many people here have ever gone out \nto a restaurant to eat and you come home, you have had a nice meal out, \nyou watch the evening news, you go to bed, and at 2 o'clock in the \nmorning you wake up and there is a railroad train going through your \nstomach, and you make a bee-line for the bathroom?''\n  Usually people start laughing. But they are nodding their heads. A \nlot of those aren't even reported. And people are a little sluggish the \nnext day, they don't feel quite right the next day, productivity goes \ndown, but after 24 hours they are over it and move on. That is what I \nmean. A lot of these aren't even reported, but it happens to people \nevery single day.\n  If that happens to me, and I get a little upset stomach, I get a \nlittle sick, a little diarrhea the next day, or I feel a little down, I \nmove on, think what happens to a kid. What about a child? What about \nsomeone 12, 13, or 10 years old? They are affected a lot worse than \nthat. Or an elderly person whose immune system may not be as strong as \nsomeone my age. They are the ones who are getting hit harder and harder \nby these foodborne pathogens.\n  This is really an appropriate time to be talking about this, during \nthe middle of a hot summer, because there is another interesting thing \nabout foodborne pathogens.\n  In 1997, and we know in previous years the same is true, the number \nof foodborne illnesses always peaks in the summer, and they come down \nin the winter. May to September is when we get our peak. Pathogens \nflourish on the foods and any foods that aren't handled properly in the \nsummer heat. So during the summertime, we see the number of incidents \nof foodborne pathogens going up. So this is a proper time to be talking \nabout it, in the summer months.\n  We can reduce the number of foodborne illnesses that we have in this \ncountry.\n  We can reduce the incidence and severity of foodborne illnesses, and \nthe Food Safety Initiative that the President announced will provide \nfunding for necessary inspection, surveillance, research, and education \nactivities at both the USDA and the FDA to improve the level of food \nsafety in this country.\n  I will go over each one of those. First, inspection. The amendment \nthat I sent to the desk provides for increased spending to improve \ninspection. Now, what kind of inspection are we talking about? Well, \nthe FDA inspects the 53,000 domestic food processing plants on the \naverage of once every 10 years. That is right, on the average of once \nevery 10 years, FDA inspects the plants that can our fruits, can our \nvegetables, handle our produce and fresh fruits and things like that--\nabout once every 10 years. Right now, FDA inspects only about 2 percent \nof imported produce, although consumption of these products is \nincreasing and imported produce has been linked to several outbreaks of \nillnesses in recent years. So only 2 percent of imported produce is \neven inspected by the FDA.\n  This amendment funds 250 new inspectors at FDA for this purpose. It \nwill also fund a program at USDA to implement the new inspection \nprocedures for meat inspection in State-inspected meat and poultry \nplants. Right now, we have a Federal system. We also have State-\ninspected meat and poultry plants, and this amendment would help fund \nthe implementation of these new--HACCP, as it is called--meat \ninspection systems in our State-inspected meat and poultry plants.\n  So that is the first part, inspection.\n  The second part has to do with research and risk assessment. The Food \nSafety Initiative seeks new funds for research and risk assessment. The \nfunding will lead to new rapid-testing methods to identify pathogens \nbefore they can be spread far and wide. Funding for on-farm testing \nwill help determine where simple solutions such as vaccines can make \nmajor improvements in the safety of food. So risk assessment and \nresearch can point to\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\npractical solutions that will get to it early on and make high-risk \nfoods a lot safer--I mean foods that are handled a lot, foods that are \nused a lot in the summertime, maybe are handled and cooked outdoors, \nthat type of thing.\n  The third aspect of this amendment deals with education. This \namendment calls for funding for education programs for farmers, food \nservice workers, and consumers. I might just point out that consumer \nfood safety education is crucial as traditional homemaker education in \nschools and at home is increasingly rare. Educating food service \nworkers is also important as more and more of us eat out or eat take-\nout foods.\n  The last part is surveillance. In the case of these outbreaks in \nJune, extensive investigations were necessary before tainted products \ncould be identified and recalled. The Food Safety Initiative provides \nnew funds for the USDA and FDA to coordinate with the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention in identifying and controlling outbreaks \nof illnesses from food; in other words, get better surveillance out \nthere to coordinate with CDC, USDA, and FDA--and that is not taking \nplace right now--so that if you do have an outbreak, you can contain it \nand keep it in one locality without it spreading to other States. And \nthat is really important.\n  I will take this chart and again put it up here to show the outbreaks \nthat happened in June. What you can see is, you have an outbreak of E. \ncoli here in one State, and you see it spreading to other States, the \nsame strain, the same packages. Why would it be in Ohio, then in \nKansas, and then out here in Utah? Why would it be in those States all \nat the same time? We know how fast we move food around this country. \nYou could have something slaughtered, processed, produced, and packaged \nin one State and 24 hours later it is being eaten halfway across the \ncountry. That is why you need good surveillance. If you find something \nthat has happened in one locality, you can coordinate with the CDC down \nhere in Atlanta, GA, and put the brakes on right away. We don't have \nthat kind of in-depth coordination and surveillance right now, and this \namendment would provide that.\n\n  Last October at a hearing before the Senate Ag Committee, numerous \nproducer, industry, and consumer groups called on the Federal \nGovernment to increase resources for food safety in research, \neducation, risk assessment, and surveillance. I thought I might just \nquote a couple of these.\n  Mike Doyle, Ph.D., on behalf of the American Meat Institute, the \nGrocery Manufacturers Association, National Broiler Council, National \nFood Processors Association, and the National Turkey Federation, \ntestified last October, and he said:\n\n       The problem we should be facing is how to prevent or reduce \n     pathogens in the food supply. Research, technology and \n     consumer education are the best and most immediate tools \n     available. Government can be most helpful by facilitating the \n     aggressive use of these tools to find new ways to protect \n     consumers.\n       A strategic plan for a prevention-oriented, farm-to-table \n     food safety research technology development and transfer that \n     engages the resources of the public and private sector must \n     be developed and fully funded.\n\n  Alan Janzen on behalf of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n  Gregg Page, President, Red Meat Group, Cargil, Inc., on behalf of the \nAmerican Meat Institute, said:\n\n       Congress can help ensure that there is reality in the laws \n     and regulations governing food safety by endorsing \n     educational activities focused on proper cooking and handling \n     practices and a comprehensive, coordinated and prioritized \n     approach to food safety research.\n\n  C. Manly Molpus, Grocery Manufacturers of America, in a letter dated \nJanuary 19, 1998, said:\n\n       With new, emerging food pathogens, FDA must have the \n     resources to recruit scientists and fund research and \n     surveillance. Increased resources will mean better, more \n     focused and planned scientific research programs.\n\n  So we have a lot of comments from the industry about the need to make \nsure that this Food Safety Initiative is, indeed, fully funded.\n  Now, lastly, let me just point out where we get the offset for this \namendment. The offset has several components. The principal one would \ncomplete the job of getting the U.S. taxpayer out of the business of \nsupporting the production of tobacco. It is a common question I hear: \nIf smoking is so bad and we are trying to get this tobacco bill passed \naround here, then why is the Government subsidizing the production of \ntobacco?\n  Well, it is not supposed to be. Under the 1982 No Net Cost Tobacco \nlegislation, the cost of the tobacco price support program is covered \nby assessments made by tobacco companies and growers. But that is only \nfor the price support program. These assessments do not cover the cost \nto the taxpayer of crop insurance on tobacco, nor do they cover the \nadministrative costs of the tobacco program or the various other \ntobacco-related activities at the USDA. The total cost of these USDA \ntobacco activities is about $60 million a year. Under this amendment, \ntobacco companies will cover the cost of these USDA tobacco activities. \nAfter all, it is the tobacco companies that benefit from having a \ndependable supply of tobacco available to them.\n  So I think it is about time that we close this last little loophole \nand have the tobacco growers and companies pay the $60 million that the \ntaxpayers are paying today.\n  So that is the first part of the offset. The second one is that we \nget $15 million from the mandatory CCC computer account. These funds \nare available to the USDA to be spent for data processing and \ninformation technology services. Cutting this account will in no way \nreduce the ability of the USDA to prepare for the Y2K problem at all. \nSo there is $15 million from this computer account.\n  And, lastly, we cut $13 million from the ARS buildings and facilities \naccount. Again, we do not propose to eliminate any building projects. \nRather, we propose to delay the money that would be obligated but not \nspent during the fiscal year 1999.\n  In other words, the money would be obligated, but it would not be \nspent. All projects would be allowed to continue development and \nplanning of these facilities. But there is no point in appropriating \nmoney in fiscal year 1999, money that will not be spent, when there is \na critical need for food safety funds to fund the Food Safety \nInitiative.\n  I see two of my colleagues on the floor who have worked very hard on \nthis Food Safety Initiative, who are strong supporters of it. I yield \nthe floor at this time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kevin Mulry, \na Brookings fellow in my office, be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring consideration of the Harkin amendment on the agriculture \nappropriations bill, S. 2159.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I make a second unanimous consent request, if there is no \nobjection from the chairman, the Senator from Mississippi, since it \ndoes not appear there is another Senator on the floor, I ask unanimous \nconsent to follow the Senator from New Jersey in making remarks in \nsupport of the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Harkin \namendment to fund President Clinton's Food Safety Initiative. In \nsupporting this effort to fund food safety in our country, I must admit \nto some surprise about the debate. Through the years in this Congress, \nwe have had controversial debates with legitimately and strongly held \ndifferent views. This is a difference of opinion that I just do not \nunderstand.\n  It is now estimated that there are 9,000 Americans per year losing \ntheir lives because of food safety. There is a rising cost in human \nlife and suffering because of compromises in the quality of food \nconsumed in America. In a nation where we are accustomed to automobile \naccidents and crime, the leading reason in our country to visit an \nemergency room is because of food that you purchased and consumed. It \nis not\n\n[[Page S8300]]\n\nan insubstantial cost to our economy. Mr. President, 6.5 million people \nsuffering from foodborne illness; $22 billion in cost to our economy.\n  Two years ago, on a bipartisan basis, across philosophical lines as a \nnational community, we came to recognize that this cost was not \nsustainable and mostly was not necessary. This Congress began to fund, \nunder President Clinton's leadership, an initiative to ensure the \nquality and safety of our Nation's food supply. We are now about to \nenter into the second year of that program, which has included hiring \nmore inspectors, enhancing surveillance and early warning, increasing \nresearch into pathogens like the E. coli bacteria, and to develop more \nfast, cost-efficient, and more modern detection methods. The second \nyear is about to begin, but a preliminary judgment has been made on the \nbudget of the Government to abandon the effort: No research, no new \ntechnology, no new inspectors--nothing.\n  It would be a legitimately held view to come to the floor of this \nSenate and say, ``The President's plan has been tried and has been \nevaluated, it is understood, but there is a better idea.'' There may be \nbetter ideas. There is no monopoly of wisdom in constructing this plan. \nBut to argue, in the U.S. Senate, in the face of this rising problem, \nthat the better answer is to do nothing, confounds logic. I do not \nunderstand it--governmentally or politically.\n  The American people may be under the impression that their food \nsupply is safe. It is certainly true by world standards; compared with \nmany nations, it is safe. But it is not what they believe. Mr. \nPresident, 9,000 deaths is unconscionable, but it is not even the full \nextent of the problem. Some years ago, like most Americans not \nrecognizing the full extent of this problem, I heard testimony from a \nconstituent of mine named Art O'Connell. His 23-month-old daughter, \nKatie, had visited a fast-food restaurant in New Jersey. The next day \nshe wasn't feeling well. Two days later she was in a hospital. By that \nnight her kidneys and her liver began to fail. A day later, she was \ndead.\n  I thought it was about as bad a story as I could hear, and then in \nthe same hearing I heard mothers and fathers from around America whose \nchildren had also been exposed to the E. coli bacteria, and realized \nthat sometimes the child that dies can be the fortunate child. The E. \ncoli bacteria will leave an infant blind, deaf, paralyzed for life. In \nthe elderly, it can strike more quickly and also result in death.\n  It is a crisis in our country, but it is one that will not solve \nitself. Indeed, it is estimated over the next decade, the death toll \nand the suffering from foodborne illness in America will increase by 10 \nto 15 percent per decade.\n  There are, to be certain, a number of reasons--the sources of food \nsupplies, a more complex distribution system, failures to prepare food \nproperly, and almost certainly because of rising imports of food. Food \nimports since 1992 have increased by 60 percent. Yet, notably, \ninspections have fallen by 22 percent. There are 53,000 potential sites \nin America involved in the production of food for the American people--\n53,000. The United States has 700 inspectors. To place this in context, \nin the State of New Jersey where we operate a gaming industry, in \nAtlantic City, we have 14 casinos. We operate with 850 inspectors. What \nmy State government in New Jersey is doing to assure that the roulette \nwheels and gaming tables of Atlantic City are safe for gamers, the \nUnited States of America is not doing for the food supply of the entire \ncountry. Mr. President, 700 inspectors for this country.\n  To be honest, I do not argue that, even if Senator Harkin's amendment \nis accepted, that the Members of this Senate can face their \nconstituents honestly and claim that this problem is being solved, no \nless managed. It would, in truth, require much more. Over the years, in \nworking with Senator Durbin, we have outlined legislation that is far \nmore comprehensive, in my judgment, much more attuned to what is \nrequired--to create a single food agency to replace the current 12 \nGovernment agencies involved in food safety, to remove agencies whose \nprincipal mission is to prevent the consumption and sale of food from \ninspection--to remove an inherent conflict of interest in the \nmanagement of the Nation's food supply; and certainly to give the \nDepartment of Agriculture a mandatory recall authority so the moment we \nknow there is a problem and health is endangered, we can eliminate the \ndistribution problems.\n  All these things are required, but we are asking for none of that \ntoday. All that Senator Harkin is asking is to fund at the commitment \nlevels we decided on a year ago, to do the second half of a 2-year \nprogram to provide for the inspections, the technologies of this food \nsafety program.\n  Mr. President, many of us years ago learned of a different period in \nAmerican history through the words of Upton Sinclair in his writing, \n``The Jungle.'' At a time when the Federal Government was not doing \nlittle to ensure the safety of our food supply for our people, it was \ndoing nothing.\n  Most Americans will be surprised to learn that, as they read as a \nstudent of Upton Sinclair, the technology of food inspection has not \nreally changed in these several generations. The principal instrument \nused by the U.S. Government to ensure that meat is safe is the human \nnose of an inspector. The second line of defense is his eyesight. As \nfood comes down the assembly line, assuring that it is safe is based on \nthe instinct of those inspectors, albeit inspecting 2 percent of the \nNation's imported food supply.\n  Part of this program is to advance the technologies which we are \nusing in every other aspect of American life, the extraordinary \ntechnologies of our time which uniquely, incredibly and inexplicably \nare not being used on a very item of life and death of our citizens--\nour food supply. This program will develop and advance those \ntechnologies.\n  New pathogens are being found all the time. The E. coli bacteria \nitself is changing. This program will research to understand those \npathogens, to use our technology to defeat them in biomedicine.\n  As the Senator from Iowa has said, we also need enhanced \nsurveillance. Because we live in a time when the food supply of one \nState can appear in another State within hours, a single source of \ncontaminated food can be across America in days. We need to track it \nthrough surveillance to find it and eliminate it.\n  Of course, as I suggested, we need more inspectors to also ensure the \npresence of the Government is there.\n  All we are doing is attempting to fulfill what the American people \nbelieve they already have. Most Americans, if you were to ask them \ntoday, would tell you: ``Yes, there's a Federal inspector where that \nmeat is produced, those fruits and vegetables, that syrup, they are \nthere, and we are using the best technology and we are understanding \nthe pathogens.'' We are asking that this Senate help fund that which we \ncommitted to 2 years ago and that which the American people already \nbelieve exists.\n  Finally, there is ample time for us to disagree on many issues. There \nare legitimate concerns about which we can differ. If ever there was an \nissue about which we could come together in common cause, this is that \nissue. This is not an expansion of Government power, it is a power \nwhich the Government has had for all the 20th century. It is not \ndraining significant resources we do not have. It is $100 million in a \nmodest program.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Harkin, Senator Durbin and Senator \nKennedy in offering this amendment. I hope we can receive an \naffirmative vote and proceed with this program and avoid all that \nsuffering, which is just so unnecessary, and begin to turn the corner \non dealing with this very important problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first I thank my colleague from New Jersey \nfor his fine statement, as well as my colleague from Iowa. The Senator \nfrom New Jersey and I have introduced legislation which attempts to \nstreamline this entire process. It is mind-boggling to try to come to \ngrips with the many different agencies and laws that apply to food \nsafety inspection in America. Though that is not the object of the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa, it is something which I hope on \nanother day the Senate will address. To\n\n[[Page S8301]]\n\nthink that there are some six different Federal agencies with the \nresponsibility of food inspection, some 35 different laws and a crazy \nquilt of jurisdiction which not only wastes taxpayers' dollars, but \ncreates risk for consumers is unacceptable.\n  What we address today is more immediate, different than a change of \njurisdiction within agencies. It is to address the immediate need to \nassure the consumers of America that its Government is doing all in its \npower to protect them at their family tables.\n  This issue first came to my attention about 3 or 4 years ago. I \ncertainly heard about the E. coli outbreaks in Jack-in-the-Box and the \nothers that were well publicized, but I received a letter when I was a \nMember of the House of Representatives from a lady in Chicago. I didn't \nrepresent the city, but she sent me a letter when she heard we were \ndebating modernizing our food inspection system.\n  In this handwritten letter, Nancy Donley of Chicago told the tragic \nstory of going to the local grocery store to buy hamburger for her 6-\nyear-old son Alex, coming home and preparing it. Alex ate the hamburger \nand within a few days was dead, dead from E. coli-contaminated \nhamburger, which led to one of the most gruesome episodes one can \nimagine.\n  Your heart breaks to think of a mother and father standing helplessly \nby a hospital bed wondering what is taking the life away from this \nlittle boy whom they love so much. She tells in graphic detail how \nAlex's body organ by organ shut down until he finally expired because \nof contamination in a food product.\n  It brought to my attention an issue which I had not thought about for \na long time, because you see, unlike some Members of the Senate, I have \nsome personal knowledge when it comes to this issue, not just because I \neat, which all of us do, but 30 years ago, I worked my way through \ncollege working in a slaughterhouse in East St. Louis, IL. I spent 12 \nmonths of my life there, and I saw the meat inspection process and the \nmeat processing firsthand.\n  I still eat meat, and I still believe America has the safest food \nsupply in the world, but I am convinced that we need to do more. The \nworld has changed in 30 years. The distribution network of food in the \nUnited States has changed. When I was a young boy, it was a local \nbutcher shop buying from a local farmer processing for my family. Now \nlook at it--nationwide and worldwide distribution, sometimes of a great \nproduct but sometimes of a great problem. That some contaminated beef \nlast year led to the greatest meat recall in our history is just a \nsuggestion of the scope of this problem. A contamination in one plant \nin one city can literally become a national problem.\n  This chart that Senator Harkin of Iowa brought before us doesn't tell \nwhat happened across the United States in 1 year. It tells us what \nhappened in 1 month, June of 1998. These were the outbreaks and recalls \nin the United States of America. I am sorry to say, with the possible \nexception of New York, my home State of Illinois was hit the hardest, \nfor you see, we had over 6,000 people in the Chicago area who were \nfelled by some food-related illness that might have been associated \nwith potato salad--6,000 people. We are still searching to find exactly \nwhat caused it.\n  We had a hearing with Senator Collins of Maine just a few days ago in \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee which took a look at the importation \nof fruits and vegetables. She focused--and I think it was an excellent \nhearing--on Guatemalan raspberries that came into the United States \ncontaminated with cyclospora, and, of course, caused illnesses for many \npeople across the United States.\n  The fascinating thing, the challenging part of that testimony was \nthat if you look at our inspection process today, there is no way for \nus to detect the presence of that bacteria, nor is it easy for any \ndoctor to diagnose a person as having been stricken by that illness.\n  As we trace those imports in the United States of fruits and \nvegetables, we find that we face a new challenge in addition to this \nbroadening distribution network. It is a challenge where our appetites \nhave changed, and where we enjoy the bounty of produce from all over \nthe world. So our concerns which used to be focused on the United \nStates and partially on imported fruits and vegetables have expanded \ndramatically. Now we worry about imported fruits and vegetables from \nthe far corners of the world.\n  We worry about contaminations which we never heard of before which \ncould, in fact, affect literally millions of Americans. The challenge \nof food inspection is changing dramatically.\n  Let me give you another illustration about what is happening. Most of \nus can recall, when we were children, when mom would bake a cake or \nmake cookies, and she finished putting it all together, and you were \nstanding dutifully by waiting for the cookies or the cake, she would \nhand you the mixing bowl--and you would reach in with a spoon or \nspatula and taste a little bit of the dough, cake batter, whatever it \nmight be. As you see, I did that many times; and I appreciated it very \nmuch.\n  You know, now that is dangerous. You know why it is dangerous? \nBecause of the raw eggs that are part of the mix. It used to be that \nthe salmonella was traced to the shell of the egg, so if the shell fell \nin the batter, you would say, ``Oh, that's something we need to be \nconcerned about.'' But, sadly, within the last few years they have \nfound the salmonella inside the egg. So you can never be certain \nhanding that mixing bowl to a tiny tot in the kitchen that you are not \ninviting a foodborne illness that could be very serious.\n  Things are changing. We need to change with them. When President \nClinton stepped forward and said, ``America's concerned about this \nproblem and American families realize they can't protect themselves as \nindividuals, they're counting on us to do the job,'' he challenged us \nto fund it. Sadly, we are not funding it in this bill.\n  That is why the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Torricelli, and I are offering this amendment to increase the \nfunds.\n  What will we do with them?\n  First, increase the number of inspectors. We clearly need more people \non the borders taking at look at the process and the fresh food coming \ninto the United States. I have been there. I have been to Nogales, \nMexico, Nogales, AZ. I have seen that border crossing.\n  I have followed the FDA inspection all the way from the trucks to the \nsamples taken into the laboratory in Los Angeles, CA, to be tested; and \nI can tell you that, though it is good, it is far from perfect.\n  In most instances, by the time they have tested that sample of fruits \nor sample of vegetables, and if they find anything wrong with it, it is \nlong gone, it is already on the grocery shelves somewhere in America. \nOh, they are going to be more watchful the next time around, but they \ncannot protect us with the resources presently available.\n  President Clinton said we can do more, and we should do more. We also \nneed to look into this whole question of surveillance. As we noted \nhere, this distribution system around the Nation really calls on us to \nmove quickly. If we find a problem at a processing plant in my home \nState of Illinois, we need to know very quickly whether or not it has \nbeen spread across the United States so that recalls can take place.\n  We need more research, too, research on these foodborne illnesses, \nhow they can be averted and avoided. I think we can achieve that, as we \nshould. The Senator from New Jersey had the most telling statistic: \n53,000 different food production sites around America, 700 inspectors. \nWe will never have an inspector for every site. We certainly can do \nbetter than we have at the present time.\n  Let me also say that the offset that the Senator from Iowa is \noffering to us is a very good one. I am personally aware of it because \na large part of it represents an amendment which I have offered for \nseveral years, first in the House and then in the Senate. It answers a \nquestion which virtually all of us, as politicians--Senators and \nMembers of Congress--face.\n  How many times I have gone into a town meeting and someone raises \ntheir hand and says, ``Senator, let me ask you a question. If you tell \nus that tobacco is so dangerous, why does the Federal Government \nsubsidize it?'' Well, I will tell you, there is not a very good answer \nto that question.\n\n[[Page S8302]]\n\n  This amendment being offered by the Senator from Iowa finally puts to \nrest and answers that question. We are going to stop subsidizing the \ngrowing of tobacco in America. We are going to stop asking taxpayers \nacross the United States to pay for a subsidy to the tobacco-growing \nindustry.\n  I have offered this amendment before. I have never had a better use \nof it than what the Senator from Iowa is offering today. Take the \ntaxpayers' money now being invested in the cultivation and growth of \nthis deadly product, tobacco, take that money, put it into food safety.\n  There is a real justice to this amendment and what the Senator is \noffering so that we can say to people, we are not only stopping this \nFederal subsidy of the cultivation of tobacco, we are trying to protect \nchildren, the elderly, and those who have some health problems that may \nmake them particularly vulnerable. So I heartily support the offset \nwhich is being offered by the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to make it clear for the Record that the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, has been the leader in going after this \naspect of the taxpayer funding of tobacco at USDA for years. So I just \nthank the Senator for letting me capitalize on that and use this money \nthat he has tried so valiantly over the years to stop--to use that for \nthis offset for the Food Safety Initiative.\n  I appreciate the Senator's support and his willingness to let us use \nthe offset that he has been trying to kill for years, because it really \nis unfair for the taxpayers of this country to spend $60 million every \nyear in support of USDA activities that go to help grow more tobacco in \nthis country. If they want to do it, let the tobacco companies fund it \nthemselves. I thank the Senator for his years on this effort in this \nregard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say to the Senator from Iowa, I am happy to join \nhim in this effort. We could not think of a better investment of this \nmoney than to take it away from the promotion of a product which causes \nso much death and disease and put it into the kind of health initiative \nwhich the Senator from Iowa has suggested.\n  Let me just say this: Mark my words. Within a few weeks we will read \nin the newspapers again of some outbreak of food contamination and food \nillness. We will be alarmed and saddened by the stories of the \nvulnerable--the children, the elderly, and those who are in a frail \nmedical condition who have become victims because of it.\n  Each of us, in our own way, if it affects our State will express our \noutrage, our disappointment; and we will promise that we will do \nsomething about it. Well, let us be honest. This is the amendment that \nmight do something about it. We can give these speeches--and we will--\nbut the real question is, Are we prepared to back up our concern in \nfront of a television camera with our votes on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate?\n  The Senator from Iowa is offering us an opportunity to really be \ncertain that the American people understand what our commitment is to \nthis important issue. I thank him for his commitment. I am happy to \njoin him as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges during the debate on the agriculture appropriations bill be \ngranted to Diane Robertson, Stacey Sachs, and Mary Reichman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in thanking my friend and \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and Senator Durbin, and others, \nfor providing the leadership in what I consider to be one of the most \nimportant amendments introduced as part of this legislation. I hope \nthat we will be successful, because it addresses a problem that has \nbeen outlined by my colleagues on the floor of the Senate about what \nhas been happening in our food supply over recent years.\n  What we have seen, Mr. President, over the period of the last 5 \nyears, has been the doubling of imported food into the United States. \nWe expect that the food that has come into the United States will \ndouble again over the next 5 years.\n  We are finding that a third of all of the fruit, and over half of the \nseafood consumed in this country is being imported into the United \nStates. And those figures are going to grow over the next 5 years. At \nthe same time, we have seen a significant reduction in resources \ndedicated to inspections. Over the period of the last 5 years, there \nhas been a 22-percent reduction of support for inspections and food \nsafety in the Food and Drug Administration.\n  The Department of Agriculture has primary responsibility for meat and \npoultry. The Food and Drug Administration has primary responsibility \nfor inspection of all other food. The increase in imports in these \nother food categories--produce, seafood, etc.--inspected by FDA would \nbe one factor which could justify the increase that is included in the \nHarkin amendment. But that really does not tell the whole story, Mr. \nPresident.\n  To understand the whole story, we have to understand the very \ndramatic changes which have taken place in terms of our food supply.\n  For example, let's look at E. coli, which occurs naturally in our \nbodies. In the last 20 years, E. coli has mutated to be more virulent \nand even deadly. This was illustrated today by my friend and colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, and illustrated by the food disease \noutbreaks that we have seen from January to July of 1998.\n  We are not just saying that the appropriations haven't kept up with \nthe need, as important as that is, and that ought to justify it, but \nthere are dramatic differences in the eating habits of the American \npeople. More people are eating out. More people are eating products \nthat are coming from different countries. More Americans are storing \ntheir food over longer periods of time. All of this is having an impact \nin terms of the increased risk from foodborne pathogens and the \nincreased occurrence of foodborne illness.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that foodborne diseases are much, \nmuch more dangerous today than they were 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 10 \nyears ago. You are getting a change in quantity and the severity of the \nillnesses, the virulence of foodborne pathogens and their impact on \nhuman beings.\n  Antimicrobial resistance contributes to this phenomenon, and those in \nthe pharmaceutical industry see it every single day. They believe that \nthis is one of the very significant new phenomena in the whole area of \nhealth science. It is reflected in the severity of these illnesses. \nThey are deadly today. They don't just give you a stomach ache; they \nkill you.\n  That is why I believe this amendment is of enormous importance. We \nneed to have the kind of support that this amendment provides, to make \nsure that we, as Americans, are going to have the safest food supply in \nthe world. We do. But it is threatened. For us not to understand the \nrisk is foolishness. I believe this amendment, with its offsets, is \njustifiable and of enormous importance.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his leadership in this area. I \ncommend him for his legislation and for the seriousness with which he \nhas approached it and for his constancy in pursuit of it. We are very \nmuch in your debt.\n  Even with this, Mr. President, I think all of us have a \nresponsibility of watching, and watching carefully, what is happening \nto our food supply as we move ahead in these next months and years. \nTragically, if we fail to do this, and we see the kind of tragedies \nthat are bound to take place, we will have, once again, I think, in an \nimportant way, failed to meet our responsibilities to provide \nprotections for the American people in the most basic and fundamental \nway.\n  Every day, more Americans are stricken with food poisoning. Children \nand the elderly are especially at risk.\n  Outbreaks of foodborne illness are increasing. The toxicity of \nbacteria is increasing. Yet resources to combat these festering \nproblems are decreasing. Without additional resources, FDA and the \nDepartment of Agriculture cannot act effectively to prevent these \nillnesses. The American public deserves better.\n\n[[Page S8303]]\n\n  In the last two months: over 400 people became ill and 74 were \nhospitalized in 21 states from Salmonella in dry cereal; 6,500 people \nin Illinois became ill from salad contaminated with E. coli; 40 people \nbecame ill and almost half were hospitalized because of an outbreak of \nE. coli in cheese; and over 300 people became ill in six states from \nbacteria in oysters.\n  These cases are a small sample. According to the Congressional \nGeneral Accounting Office, foodborne illnesses affect up to 80 million \ncitizens a year and cause 9,000 deaths. Medical costs and lost \nproductivity are estimated at $30 billion. This is not a problem that \nwe can ignore.\n  Michael Osterholm, state epidemiologist for the Minnesota Department \nof Health, condemned the lack of action after a recent outbreak in the \nstate. He said that, ``If we don't do better, and we don't give the FDA \nmore money, more events like this are going to happen. Right now, we \ndon't seem to have the resources or the will to keep something like \nthis from happening again. As long as we don't, we will have other \noutbreaks.''\n  The old wisdom does not apply. You can't just cook your food more \nthoroughly to avoid these illnesses. Harmful bacteria are appearing in \nvirtually all food products--juice, lettuce, even cereal.\n  Our amendment will provide $73 million in additional funds to support \ngreater monitoring, education, research, and enforcement to address \nthis growing problem.\n  We have the ability to prevent most foodborne illnesses. Improved \nmonitoring allows earlier detection and an earlier response to \noutbreaks. Increased food inspections are needed to keep unsafe food \nout of our stores and off our dining room tables.\n  Expanded research is needed to detect and identify dangerous \norganisms likely to contaminate food. The need is especially great with \nrespect to imports of fresh produce and vegetables.\n  Our amendment will provide the resources needed to perform these \nessential activities. It will mean 150 new inspectors for FDA to focus \non food imports, which have more than doubled since 1992. Yet during \nthat same period, FDA resources devoted to imported foods dropped by 22 \npercent. As a result, FDA now inspects less than 2 percent of imported \nfood. Clearly, we have to do better.\n  Our amendment would also provide funds to enhance ``early warning'' \nand monitoring systems needed to detect and respond to outbreaks. These \nsystems will also provide information to prevent future outbreaks. \nEarly detection and control are essential to ensure the safety of every \nAmerican.\n  In addition, our amendment will fund research essential to understand \ndangerous organisms in food. Many cannot be identified today. Others \nhave developed resistance to traditional methods of preserving food. \nStill others have developed resistance to antibiotics. Clearly, \nadditional research is needed to protect the food supply.\n  We have broad support for this amendment. The food industry, consumer \ngroups and the public all favor increased funding. Food safety affects \nevery American every day.\n  Without additional resources, we will continue to see the escalation \nof these outbreaks. Congress must act to ensure the safety of the food \nsupply for all Americans. The American people deserve to know that the \nfood they eat is safe, no matter where it is grown, processed, or \npackaged.\n  I thank the Senator and urge our colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nkind words. But more than that, I want to thank him for his efforts \nthrough the years to make sure we had a Food and Drug Administration \nthat was on the side of consumers in this country, a strong Food and \nDrug Administration that made sure that we could have confidence when \nwe went to the drugstore or to the grocery store to get our food, drugs \nand medicine, that they would indeed be safe. I want to thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his leadership in that area and thank \nhim for his kind and generous support of this amendment.\n  Everything he said is right on mark. It is not just the consumers, I \nsay to my friend from Massachusetts. I earlier had some comments from \npeople representing the Grocery Manufacturers Association, the \nCattlemen's Beef Association, the Broiler Council, the National Food \nProcessors Association, all of whom basically said we need better \nsurveillance, we need better risk assessment, we need better education \nout there. That is what this amendment does. It is the processors, the \nwholesalers--everyone recognizes that this is a new phenomenon, as the \nSenator from Massachusetts said, something new we have not experienced \nin the past. Everyone recognizes the need to get on top of this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Biologically, we have E. coli in our bodies, and humankind has always \nhad E. coli, but it was not the deadly strain we are seeing today. \nTwenty years ago we were not even aware of the E. coli O157:H7 strain \nthat is deadly, and we increasingly see this deadly strain. How many \nmore outbreaks do we have to have before we act?\n  This is why I think this amendment is so important, because of the \nincreased danger that these outbreaks pose for our people. Particularly \nvulnerable are the children and the seniors. With the offset that you \nhave proposed, I cannot understand the reluctance to protect the \nconsumer, rather than taking our chances.\n  I find it difficult to understand why we wouldn't have it accepted.\n  Mr. HARKIN. You are right about E. coli. I counted up in June of this \nyear, this last month, and we had six E. coli outbreaks of food \npoisoning in this country, of a strain of E. coli that didn't exist 20 \nyears ago. It wasn't there. And now it is here. It is not only making \npeople sick, but killing kids.\n  There are new pathogens that become more virulent. The surveillance \nsystems we have in place and the risk assessment and the other \ninspection systems we have--the FDA, as the Senator knows, only on \naverage inspects our food processing plants once every 10 years.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is less than 2 percent of the imported products that \nare being inspected; 2 percent. We are seeing a doubling of the \nimported foods that are coming into this country and from a greater \nnumber of countries around the world. We are looking at less than 2 \npercent and the number of imports will be doubling.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wonder how many consumers know that only 2 percent of \nall the produce they eat that comes from outside this country is ever \ninspected--2 percent. The rest of it, who knows what is on that stuff \nwhen it comes to this country. The consumers don't know this. And as \nthe Senator said, it will go up in the future. We will get more and \nmore of that produce from other countries. That is why this is really \nneeded.\n  I thank the Senator for his support and his comments on this.\n  Mr. President, there is an editorial that appeared in today's Los \nAngeles Times that I was just made aware, calling on us to do something \nabout food safety. Obviously, they probably didn't know about my \namendment. But they did say.\n\n       . . . the U.S. Senate can take a big step to combat food \n     contamination by restoring all or most of the $101-million \n     initiative the Clinton administration has proposed to \n     improve food safety. The money would go to hire new safety \n     inspectors, upgrade technologies, and bring coherence to \n     disjointed oversight.\n       So far, The Senate has allocated only a piddling $2.6 \n     million for the initiative at the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture and nothing at all at the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n\n  The editorial went on to say that we needed more funding. I will \nquote the last paragraph of the editorial:\n\n       Food safety is an unassailable cause. There are some things \n     that only government can do, and guaranteeing the \n     wholesomeness of our food supply is one of them.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Los Angeles Times \nof this morning, Thursday, July 16, 1998, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Starving Food Safety\n\n       Americans now enjoying their summer picnics may suffer a \n     glimmer of anxiety over recent outbreaks of food-borne \n     illness: 6,500 people became sick in Illinois last month \n     after eating commercial potato salad, and E. coli bacterial \n     contamination occurred in fruit juice and lettuce that \n     originated in California. Today, the U.S. Senate can take\n\n[[Page S8304]]\n\n     a big step to combat food contamination by restoring all or \n     most of the $101-million initiative the Clinton \n     administration has proposed to improve food safety. The money \n     would go to hire new safety inspectors, upgrade technologies \n     and bring coherence to disjointed oversight.\n       So far, the Senate has allocated only a piddling $2.6 \n     million for the initiative at the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture and nothing at all at the Food and Drug \n     Administration. The shame of this penny-pinching is that it \n     comes when lawmakers are spending like drunken sailors \n     elsewhere, for instance in the pork-laden transportation \n     bill.\n       The need for better food safety oversight could not be \n     stronger. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that this \n     year 9,000 Americans will die and millions will fall \n     seriously ill because of tainted foods, numbers that have \n     been growing. CDC officials aren't sure why those statistics \n     are rising, though they suspect part of the reason may be \n     improved detection and the increase in imported foods bearing \n     bacteria and other pathogens to which Americans have little \n     resistance. Food imports have doubled in the last seven years \n     and are expected to increase by one-third in the next three \n     years.\n       The administration's Food Safety Initiative would get at \n     this problem first by hiring new inspectors. Less than 2% of \n     imported food is inspected now because the FDA's budget has \n     not grown along with imports. Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), \n     the chairman of the Senate committee that decided not to fund \n     the initiative at the FDA, suggested that some of the FDA's \n     duties be delegated to states and local governments, but the \n     increasing movement of food across state lines and national \n     borders argues for just the opposite: a coordinated national \n     strategy.\n       National planning, for instance, is the only way to \n     successfully deploy new technologies like DNA fingerprinting, \n     which within hours allows federal inspectors to trace the \n     genetic signature of, say, a dangerous bacterium on apples \n     marketed in the West back to the farm where the fruit was \n     harvested in Maine. Funding the initiative would enable \n     federal agencies to continue efforts to install such \n     technology in sites around the country and train workers to \n     quickly identify and track food pathogens. And Congress needs \n     to consider pending bills to give the FDA and the USDA the \n     power to recall food and to create a single food safety \n     agency to consolidate scattered oversight.\n       Food safety in an unassilable cause. There are some things \n     that only government can do, and guaranteeing the \n     wholesomeness of our food supply is one of them.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one other thing. I listened to the \ncomments made by the Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, when he \nvery poignantly told the story of the young child who died in Illinois. \nI just point out again that these outbreaks are growing with rapidity \nand showing up in the oddest of places. For example, last month, dozens \nof children got sick--again, with this E. coli 0157H7--in Atlanta after \nswimming in a public pool.\n  Many of these children spent time on dialysis for kidney failure. \nThis was just last month. Now, the infection they got was the same \nstrain of E. coli that came from a local ground beef recall in an \noutbreak in Atlanta 2 weeks earlier. So 2 weeks earlier, there was an \noutbreak of E. coli from a ground beef recall, and now it shows up in a \nswimming pool 2 weeks later. Children in five States were infected from \nthis ultimately foodborne illness. So it started out as a foodborne \nillness and then it got into a swimming pool. Dozens of kids got sick \nand some spent time on kidney dialysis.\n  So that is how virulent some of these strains have become. Not only \ndo they show up in the food, they are so virulent that not even the \nchlorine in the swimming pool could kill it.\n  Again, Mr. President, I think this amendment deserves widespread \nsupport. I point out again that the President asked for $101 million to \nfully fund his food initiative. I wish we could do it. We should do it. \nBut because of the problem with offsets and points of order and getting \n60 votes, we had to look around to find legitimate offsets that we \ncould use. As I said, we found offsets for $66 million. So this brings \nthe funding up to $66 million. It is not up the full $101 million, but \nit brings it to $68 million. Those offsets, of course, were the money \nthat we got from taking away the Federal Government's subsidizing of \ntobacco, $15 million from the CCC computer account, and $13 million \nfrom the ARS buildings and facilities account.\n  I want to make a couple of things very clear before I close my \ncomments. I have heard some talk around that there is some new \nenforcement authority here. I want to make it clear that there is no \nnew enforcement authority in my amendment.\n  Secondly, there are no new user fees for the meat industry--not one \nbit of user fees for the meat industry in this amendment.\n  In the bill now, there is $2.6 million for this Food Safety \nInitiative. The House only put in $15 million. The President asked for \n$101 million. The amount that this amendment would increase it to would \nbe $66 million.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, last month, more than 4,000 \nIllinoisans were sickened by an illness that was ultimately traced to \npotato salad contaminated by E. Coli bacteria. A few weeks ago, \nthousands of boxes of breakfast cereal were recalled after an outbreak \nof salmonella in the cereal infected more than 200 people, including \nresidents of Illinois. In fact, according to the Center for Science and \nthe Public Interest, the number of FDA-regulated food products that \nhave been recalled due to contamination has increased fivefold over the \npast ten years.\n  Health officials say that food poisoning causes more than 30 million \nillnesses and thousands of deaths annually. Consequently, the American \npeople are increasingly concerned about the safety of our food supply. \nIn 20th century America, this is unacceptable. No American should have \nto fear their food.\n  That is why I support this amendment offered today by Senator Harkin \nto restore funding for the President's Food Safety Initiative. This \namendment will provide $93 million to strengthen efforts by the United \nStates Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration \nto address food safety issues.\n  The amendment provides $33 million to recruit more scientists in the \nwar against food dangers, and for developing new technologies for \ncombating hazardous pathogens. $28 million is provided to check food \nimports at the border, increase seafood safety, and boost fruit and \nvegetable inspections. Twelve million is provided for consumer \nawareness campaigns so that children, cooks, and those who handle food \nat summer festivals can learn safer ways to prepare and handle food.\n  This is not the first proposal to come before Congress that addresses \nfood safety. Many of our colleagues have introduced legislation to \nrespond to this growing problem. Senator Harkin has introduced S. 1264, \nwhich I have cosponsored, that would increase the ability of the USDA \nto recall tainted meat and poultry products. My distinguished colleague \nfrom Illinois, Senator Durbin, has introduced a bill to consolidate and \ncoordinate federal food safety improvements that are currently \nscattered among a labyrinth of agencies. My colleague from Maryland, \nSenator Mikulski, has proposed increasing FDA oversight on foreign \nproduce.\n  Regrettably, however, no significant action has occurred on these \nbills in this Congress. Meanwhile, the outbreaks of food illnesses are \non the rise nationwide. Mr. President, we can do better. There is a \ntime to debate, and a time to act, and today, Congress has a real \nopportunity to act. Let us pass this amendment and strengthen our \nfederal food protection system so that the citizens of our country need \nnot worry each time they reach for a scoop of picnic potato salad, a \nhome-grilled hamburger, or a morning bowl of cereal. Doing nothing is \nnot an option, and that is why I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking Chairman Cochran \nand his staff for pulling together this appropriations bill under very \ndifficult circumstances. Not only was there a very low allocation, but \na number of the requests were based on assumed revenue from new fees. \nUnder these circumstances, Senator Cochran and Senator Bumpers did an \nadmirable job balancing all the agriculture programs.\n  However, today we are calling attention to an urgent need in our \ncountry: the increasing outbreaks of food poisoning across the country. \nAlmost a year ago we witnessed one of the largest beef recalls in U.S. \nhistory. Fortunately, what could have been a national health disaster \nwas caught early and stopped. But the underlying problem remained. To \naddress this problem the Administration requested $96 million in new \nfood safety funds for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Food \nand Drug Administration to reduce the hazards associated with bacteria, \nviruses and parasites in our food\n\n[[Page S8305]]\n\nsupply. Although I realize the budget allocation constrains us from \nfunding this full amount, I join Senator Harkin to offer an amendment \nto fund the most urgently needed proposals of the Food Safety \nInitiative.\n  Mr. President, there are many problems that arrive on Congress's \ndoorstep that we can do little about. This is a problem we can--and \nshould--address. And we need to address this problem now. A year after \nthe 25-million pound beef recall we are still seeing headlines about \nnew outbreaks. Each year more than 30 million Americans suffer a \nfoodborne illness, and 9,100 die. The cost to the nation is anywhere \nfrom $5.6 billion to more than $22 billion.\n  This is a national problem, ranging from cheese and egg contamination \nin the Pacific Northwest to tomatoes in Minnesota to shellfish and \nstrawberries in the South. E. coli outbreaks in recent years have also \nbeen traced to contaminated sprouts, lettuce, salami and other \nproducts. Two summers in a row, in 1996 and 1997, thousands of \nillnesses were linked to imported raspberries containing a parasite, \nCyclospora, that is not found in this country.\n  After each one of these scary outbreaks, the American public is left \nasking the same questions--questions that the programs to be funded by \nthis amendment and the President's Food Safety Initiative will help \nanswer: How do these viruses move so swiftly through our food system, \nhow can they be prevented, and where might they show up next?\n  The United States enjoys the safest food supply in the world, but we \ncan and should do better. Americans know the risk to our food supply is \ngrowing. Recent covers of Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report and \nnewspapers across the country have asked if we can continue to trust \nour food supply. As a nation, we cannot afford an erosion of the \npublic's trust in the safety of our food.\n  More than 44 percent of Americans think our food supply is less safe \nthan 10 years ago. FDA-regulated plants are only inspected on average \nonce every 10 years. FDA import inspections have declined dramatically \nin just the last four years, so that now less than two percent of FDA-\nregulated imported food is subject to any type of inspection.\n  Our amendment will increase inspections of imported food. It will \nfund development of improved inspection practices to detect threats to \nour food supply earlier and stop massive outbreaks from occurring.\n  Most of us as adults have had a case of food poisoning. Anyone who \nhas had food poisoning can imagine how much worse it is for a child. \nThink of what it is like when these outbreaks of e-coli, which can be \ndevastating to adults, but can be critical and even life-threatening to \nchildren.\n  Every one of us has a stake in this, whether we are involved in \nproducing or consuming these food products, or whether or not we are \nparents who have to worry about what we are feeding our children. Ask \npeople back home: Is there anything that is going to affect you more \nseveral times a day than the safety of the food you eat? Nothing else \nwill. This is something we can and must do.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this is an interesting part of the \nPresident's budget. When we reviewed it, we noticed, first of all, that \nover $400 million in new user fees were proposed by the President to be \nassessed on the food and poultry processing plants all around the \ncountry to generate money to pay for the inspections that are performed \nin those plants by Federal employees. This was a proposal for a change \nin the law and the legislation.\n  Our committee, of course, doesn't have jurisdiction to change the \nlaw. We simply appropriate the money, consistent with existing law. And \nso without the jurisdiction to make those changes, our committee could \nnot consider that as a part of our bill. The legislative committees in \nthe House and Senate have not acted on these proposed user fee \nimpositions, and so there are no funds available to be allocated, as \nthe President proposed, to pay for the Food Safety and Inspection \nService of the Department of Agriculture.\n  Nonetheless, our committee approved and suggested in our legislation \nto fund increases in the Food Safety and Inspection Service's account. \nSo our appropriation that is recommended by this committee for Food \nSafety and Inspection Service activities amounts to $605,149,000, as \ncompared with the administration's request for funding the Food Safety \nand Inspection Service of $149,566,000. That is more than $350 million \nin additional funding that this committee has proposed than what the \nPresident recommended be appropriated for that activity.\n  Now, when you generate that kind of fund in your proposed budget, you \nhave an opportunity to spread those proposed dollars around and spend \nit elsewhere. That is what the President has done, and that has made up \nfor his so-called Food Safety Initiative--and more. The Food Safety \nInitiative--so-called ``new initiative''--calls for the expenditure of \nabout $100 million in new funding added to a variety of different \nprograms in the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  Our committee is not critical and not, in any way, opposing these \nincreased expenditures in the initiatives that the President has \nrequested. Our budget allocation didn't give us the luxury, though, of \nan additional $350 million. Our allocation doesn't presume any increase \nin funding for discretionary programs this year--no increase. We are \nall operating under the Balanced Budget Act restrictions, under the \nallocation that is provided to subcommittees like the Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee. So if we increase something, we have to \ntake the money from other accounts.\n  So we did provide not only the full amount needed to continue the \ninspections of meat and poultry inspectors throughout the country, with \nno new increase--no new user fees, no new taxes on those plants. But we \nalso provided increases in funding for the Agriculture Research \nService, Food Safety Research Program, and for the Food and Nutrition \nService, Food Safety Grant Program. These are additions over last \nyear's levels. We were able to find other offsets in the budget to \naccommodate those increases.\n  So I suggest that the committee has been responsive to the need to \ncontinue to upgrade the quality and the aggressiveness of our Food \nSafety Research and Inspection Programs. We think, of course, that \nthere can be more done, it can be a more efficiently operated system.\n  For that reason, some of us on the Governmental Affairs Committee are \nactively participating in the investigation that is chaired by the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, who is looking into \nthe issues presented on the imported foods--fruits and vegetables, \nprimarily--that have to be inspected under the jurisdiction of the Food \nand Drug Administration. She has done a wonderful job leading the staff \nof that committee to try to find out what the options are for improving \nthose activities, making sure that they are doing as good a job as can \npossibly be done to accommodate the needs resulting from the huge \nincreases in imported foodstuffs that are coming into the country. \nThese are enormous challenges.\n  I don't think anybody has the magic solution to the problem. I think \non both sides of the aisle we are very interested in solving the \nproblems that are presented. We have heard some very impressive \nspeeches made today on that subject. We can continue to make speeches. \nBut I think we should continue to work together--that is what I suggest \nwe do--with the administration, with the Congress, to try to do the \nbest possible job.\n  I think the American people can be reassured that an enormous amount \nof effort and an enormous amount of money is being invested to achieve \nthat goal. If you add up the total of all of the dollars that are \nappropriated, we are spending more money to not only inspect the meat \nand poultry that is being processed in this country, but fruits and \nvegetables as well. Research and education programs, how to handle \nfoodstuffs, and at the farm on how to produce the foods so they will be \nfree from contamination, an enormous amount of effort is being \ninvested.\n  So we hope this amendment can be accepted by the Senate, frankly. \nOffsets have been identified in a number of areas. We have tried to get \nthe administration's reaction to these offsets. We haven't heard from \nthem on\n\n[[Page S8306]]\n\nsome of them. We have checked with the Congressional Budget Office to \nsee if this amendment violates the Budget Act. We have been assured \nthat it does not.\n  So because we are going to have to continue to work to resolve our \ndifferences with the House, there may be some adjustments in which the \nHouse insists. But we will work very hard to make sure that when we \ncome back from conference to the Senate with our conference report that \nit will reflect a genuine effort and a sizable investment of \ndiscretionary funds in the food safety area, both for the Department of \nAgriculture's activities and the Food and Drug Administration's \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, I know of no other Senators who have requested an \nopportunity to speak on the amendment. I am prepared to go to a vote \nand suggest that we agree to the amendment.\n  Incidentally, I have been authorized to express the support for that \nrecommendation from the Senator from Arkansas who is the ranking member \nof the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VII, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. NOTIFICATION OF RECALLS OF DRUGS AND DEVICES.\n\n       (a) Drugs.--Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(o)(1) If the Secretary withdraws an application for a \n     drug under paragraph (1) or (2) of the first sentence of \n     subsection (e) and a class I recall for the drug results, the \n     Secretary shall take such action as the Secretary may \n     determine to be appropriate to ensure timely notification of \n     the recall to individuals that received the drug, including \n     using the assistance of health professionals that prescribed \n     or dispensed the drug to such individuals.\n       ``(2) In this subsection:\n       ``(A) The term `Class I' refers to the corresponding \n     designation given recalls in subpart A of part 7 of title 21, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor regulation.\n       ``(B) The term `recall' means a recall, as defined in \n     subpart A of part 7 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, \n     or a successor regulation, of a drug.''.\n       (b) Devices.--Section 518(e) of such Act (21 U.S.C. \n     360h(e)) is amended--\n       (1) in the last sentence of paragraph (2), by inserting \n     ``or if the recall is a class I recall,'' after ``cannot be \n     identified''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) In this subsection, the term `Class I' refers to the \n     corresponding designation given recalls in subpart A of part \n     7 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor \n     regulation.''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 705(b) of such Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 375(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or gross'' and inserting ``gross''; and\n       (2) by striking the period and inserting ``, or a class I \n     recall of a drug or device as described in section 505(o)(1) \n     or 518(e)(2).''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is a very straightforward proposal and \nis similar to legislation that was offered by my colleague in the other \nbody, Congressman Shays of Connecticut. This amendment deals with the \nissue of defective pharmaceutical products and medical devices that \nhave been recalled by the manufacturer.\n  We almost had a very tragic case in Connecticut several months ago \ninvolving recalls, which provoked this piece of legislation. A child in \nConnecticut, a young boy by the name of Matthew McGarry, has food \nallergies to peanuts and needs a device known as an Epi-Pen to \ncounteract the severe reactions--seizures or even death--that could \nresult if he inadvertently eats certain foods. The Epi-Pen that Matthew \nrelies on was recalled by the manufacturer because it was found to have \nsubstantial leaks in it, rendering it ineffective.\n  Matthew was fortunate that his school nurse, Betty Patterson, heard \nof the recall and immediately notified his parents, Karen and William \nMcGarry, that they needed to replace the product. Had she not heard of \nthe recall and had young Matthew had an attack, he very well could have \ndied. The family is very well aware that a tragedy was averted.\n  His family and other Connecticut families brought this to the \nattention\n\n[[Page S8307]]\n\nof Congressman Shays and myself and suggested this would be an \nappropriate area for some thoughtful legislation to require that \nconsumers be notified when dangerous products are taken off the \nmarket--a requirement not currently found in law.\n  Consumers have the right to be notified when the cars they drive or \nthe toys their children play with are unsafe. Shouldn't they have the \nsame right when it comes to drugs and devices found in every family's \nmedicine cabinet?\n  The recall process presently relies almost exclusively on the good-\nfaith efforts of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers. Most of the \ntime it works very well to protect consumers. However, a recent spate \nof recalls involving these Epi-Pen devices--first in October of 1997 \nand most recently in May of this year--has highlighted the need to \nbetter ensure that consumers, when appropriate, are directly informed \nthat a drug or device may be dangerous.\n  An Epi-Pen is a device, as my colleagues, I am sure, are aware, that \ninjects epinephrine and is used by children with severe food allergies \nto counteract life-threatening reactions. Due to a defect in the \nmanufacturing process, some lots of the device were found to leak the \nencapsulated drug, potentially leaving patients with an amount of the \ndrug insufficient to counter an allergic response.\n  A class I recall of the product was issued, indicating a reasonable \npossibility that the use of the product could cause serious health \neffects or death. Despite the severity of the defect, the recall \nnotification failed to notify consumers whose children relied on these \nproducts, either because the retailers did not pass along the \nnotification in a timely fashion or because the retailers themselves \nreceived notification days after the recall was first issued.\n  In an effort to provide the public with better and more timely notice \nof the most serious recalls, this amendment will, for the first time, \nexplicitly require the Food and Drug Administration to ensure that \nconsumers receive prompt notification of class I recalls.\n  How the directive will be accomplished will be left up to the FDA. We \ndon't mandate a specific approach. The FDA could, for example, \nencourage distributors and pharmacies to employ more effective and \nrapid notification technologies, a shift that some in the industry are \nalready advocating. We do not micromanage the notification process. We \nare just suggesting that better mechanisms be put in place to give \nconsumers who use these products and rely on them a higher degree of \nconfidence.\n  I hope my colleagues can support this straightforward amendment. I \nhope that my colleagues will recognize that if we do not take up this \nissue now, we run the risk that some other child won't be as lucky as \nMatthew and will suffer serious harm. For those reasons, Mr. President, \nI urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand that since the Agency already has authority \nunder the devices statute to require both recalls and notifications, \namending these provisions to refer only to Class 1 recalls could be \ninterpreted as limiting the Agency's existing authority. Am I correct \nthat your intent is not to limit the Agency's existing authority, \neither with respect to recalls or notification?\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct. What I intend by the amendment is to make \ncertain that in the case of every Class 1 recall FDA does provide \nnotice to the public. I certainly would not want to do anything to \nsuggest that such authority does not now exist, or that such authority \ndoes not exist for Class 2 and Class 3 recalls, or other actions as \ndeemed appropriate for public notice by FDA. I just want to make \ncertain that they use their authority in all Class 1 recalls.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator be willing to set his amendment aside \ntemporarily to allow the Senator from Virginia to proceed?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Dodd \namendment be temporarily laid aside to allow Senator Robb, who has been \nwaiting patiently for about 3 days, to offer his amendment--it should \nnot be long--and that immediately upon the adoption or disposition of \nhis amendment, we return to the Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arkansas and the distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3177\n\n     (Purpose: To waive the statute of limitations barring certain \n    discrimination complaints against the Department of Agriculture)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \n     Hollings and Ms. Moseley-Braun, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3177.\n\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, for over a year now I have been working with \nmany minority farmers to address the problem of discrimination at the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture. I am pleased that we have finally found \na\n\n[[Page S8308]]\n\nway to provide relief to these farmers. I thank, in particular, the \nSenator from Mississippi for his efforts and commitment to work out the \ndetails of this important amendment.\n  This amendment will provide long overdue relief for many minority \nfarmers who were the victims of systematic and egregious discrimination \nby USDA officials--discrimination which has been acknowledged by \nSecretary Glickman and the USDA.\n  This amendment, which is very similar to language which has already \npassed in the House, seeks to remedy this problem by imposing a new \nstatute of limitations for farmers who experienced discrimination \nbetween 1981 and 1996 and who filed complaints to seek redress.\n  As I discovered about a year or so ago, many farmers were denied \ncredit opportunities and were discriminated against when seeking \nhousing loans, and obtained no relief from USDA when they complained of \nsuch discrimination.\n  These farmers filed discrimination complaints with the USDA's Office \nof Civil Rights in the early 1980's. However, they were never told \nthat, in 1983, the Office of Civil Rights at USDA was abolished. \nFurthermore, they had no notice that their claims were not even being \ninvestigated despite being led to believe otherwise.\n  These farmers are barred, only by the statute of limitations, from \nobtaining relief from this mistreatment. Whether it is a racial slur or \na denial of credit opportunities, discrimination is unconscionable and \nit is intolerable, and it is particularly appalling when such \ndiscrimination is exhibited by Government officials--officials employed \nby our Government to serve all Americans, as was the case with the \nUSDA.\n  Studies, reports, and task forces in 1965, 1970, 1982 and 1990, have \nall documented the same inherent problems at USDA--continued \ndiscrimination and mistreatment of minority and socially disadvantaged \ncustomers.\n  It is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office that the relief \nfor these farmers' claims is approximately $15 million in fiscal year \n1999 and $42 million over the next 3 years. That means that the \nCongressional Budget Office believes that the Government legitimately \nowes $15 million in order to provide relief to farmers who were \ndiscriminated against by our Government officials.\n  The statute of limitations is now the only obstacle standing in the \nway of these farmers getting the relief they deserve. And this \namendment simply removes that obstacle.\n  Inexplicably, the discrimination that many minority farmers suffered \nat the hands of USDA officials still has not been punished or \nmitigated. This amendment will mitigate for the farmers who were \ndiscriminated against.\n  Too many farmers and communities have been affected by this travesty, \nMr. President. I am pleased that the U.S. Senate has chosen not to \nremain silent.\n  In reaching a resolution, I particularly thank Senator Cochran, \nSenator Bumpers, Senator Grassley, Senator Lugar, and their staffs, and \nmy staff for their hard work. I also thank Secretary Glickman and his \nstaff at USDA and the staff at the Department of Justice for their \ncommitment and hard work on this amendment.\n  Finally, I especially acknowledge and thank the White House for its \nunwavering support of this amendment and of these farmers. While it has \nbeen a challenge to work on the spending issues, and reach agreement on \nthe offsets, I believe the result was well worth the effort. What we \nhave done today, Mr. President, is right, just, and long overdue.\n  With that, I yield the floor and seek action on the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in deciding on the offsets for this \namendment, one of the offsets for $5 million in savings is from funds \nthat would be used by the Department of Agriculture for information \ntechnology. These funds are provided through the Commodity Credit \nCorporation. I have a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture \nresponding to that offset and suggesting that the Department supports \nit. I want to be sure that we understand one provision in this letter \nand its implications. He says:\n\n       The statute of limitations waiver is one of my highest \n     priorities in this legislation, and this amendment and its \n     offset have my support. If enacted, USDA will not seek to \n     restore the computer spending reduction through future \n     appropriations.\n\n  With that understanding, Mr. President, I am able to support the \namendment. It has been my intention to assist the author of the \namendment in his effort to get this passed in the Senate.\n  What it does is to waive, as a legal defense, the statute of \nlimitations that had run on claims that were going to be filed, or that \nhad been filed by certain persons who claim to be the victims of \ndiscrimination by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n  This amendment does not guarantee that everybody who has a claim on \nthe basis of discrimination is going to win or is going to prevail if \nthe Department decides to resist. It gives the Department, though, an \nopportunity to negotiate those claims, to make decisions about which \nones are meritorious and which ones are not.\n  But it does not permit the Department to use as a defense the fact \nthat the statute of limitations has run. It was a peculiar and unique \nstatute of limitations when it was first granted under the authority of \nprevious legislation. It permitted claims to be filed on this basis \nwithin a window of opportunity of about 2 years. Most of them fell \nwithin this 2-year period.\n  Some farmers did not understand that they had to file a claim in \nwriting and go through certain steps in order to keep that statute from \nrunning, and so there was a lot of misunderstanding about the fact that \nthis statute had been imposed and limited to the duration within which \nclaims could be filed.\n  Some lawsuits have been filed now contesting the statute. This is an \neffort to say to those claimants that we are not going to let you have \nyour claim fail on the basis of not having complied with that early 2-\nyear statute of limitations. So that is going to be removed. Your claim \nwill be decided now on its merits. And that is up to the Department; \nand that is up to the claimants.\n  That is my understanding of the amendment. I congratulate the Senator \nfor his initiative and his hard work in getting us to this point. We \nsupport the amendment and hope the Senate will approve it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me again echo the very eloquent words of the \nchairman, and for the purposes of the Record state this has been sort \nof a festering sore down at the Department of Agriculture for some \ntime. I know the President is personally--very personally--interested \nin the extension of the statute of limitations so nobody who has a \nmeritorious claim will be denied that claim simply because he did not \nunderstand the intricacies affecting his claim.\n  By the same token, I think it is well, for the Record, to say--and I \nthink this is precisely what has been said by the chairman; I will \nsimply repeat it--we are not making a judgment on the merits of a \nsingle claim. We are simply saying that if you have a claim that has \nmerit, we are going to give you a chance to present it; and hopefully \nit will be decided in a very judicial way and a justifiable way.\n  So with that little caveat, I congratulate Senator Robb. He has \nworked diligently to try to find offsets in order to offer this. He has \ndone a magnificent job. I thank the Department of Agriculture and the \nWhite House for their cooperation.\n  With that, on this side of the aisle we are prepared to accept the \namendment, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from \nArkansas for their long-suffering understanding and help on this \namendment.\n  I add, lest anyone be concerned--or to add to the discussion which \nwas right on the money--that any claims that exceed $75,000 will \nactually be reviewed by the Justice Department. So in addition to the \nclaims being reviewed by the Department of Agriculture, the Justice \nDepartment would review a claim in excess of that particular amount. \nThis gives an additional screen for claims that might be\n\n[[Page S8309]]\n\nviewed as excessive in any way, shape or form. But the bottom line is, \nas both Senators have suggested, this removes an impediment that \notherwise would bar a meritorious claim. And it does nothing more than \nthat.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe letter from Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman to me that I \nreferred to be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Department of Agriculture,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and \n         Related Agencies, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Thad: During the Senate's consideration of the fiscal \n     year 1999 agricultural appropriations bill, I understand the \n     Senate may consider an amendment waiving statute of \n     limitations preventing the Department of Agriculture (USDA) \n     from properly resolving certain civil rights complaints. I \n     understand further, to offset the additional spending that \n     would result from such a provision, the amendment may reduce \n     spending for Farm Service Agency and other USDA information \n     technology funded through the Commodity Credit Corporation by \n     as much as $5 million.\n       The statute of limitations waiver is one of my highest \n     priorities in this legislation, and this amendment and its \n     offset have my support. If enacted, USDA will not seek to \n     restore the computer spending reduction through future \n     appropriations.\n       I appreciate your consideration of my views and your \n     support for this amendment.\n       With best personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Dan Glickman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3177) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROBB. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3176\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me return to the amendment to mention \nseveral people here who deserve a great deal of credit for bringing \nthis issue to the attention of Congressman Shays and myself.\n  Betty Patterson is the nurse at St. Theresa's School in Trumbull, CT. \nThere are thousands and thousands of school nurses all across America \nwho probably don't get enough credit for the work and job they do every \nday, caring for our children while they are away at school. It was \nBetty Patterson who came across the notification that the EPI-PEN had \nbeen recalled, and knew that one of the students in the St. Theresa \nschool, Matthew, would need to get a safe and effective replacement.\n  First, I want to congratulate Betty Patterson for the tremendous job \nshe did.\n  Second, I'd like to commend Karen McGarry, Mathew's mother, who, \ndiscovering that her pharmacist had not notified his patients, \ncontacted the Connecticut Post, a major newspaper in my home State of \nConnecticut, to look into the matter. And I'd like to commend Michael \nMayko of the Connecticut Post who wrote stories on this incident and \ndid the checking to discover that there was no Federal law or State law \nthat required that consumers be notified. So I want to thank him for \ndoing so much to highlight this important story.\n  Of course, I want to thank Matthew himself, who is one of 1.47 \nmillion people in this country who suffer from severe allergies and \nmust rely on products like the Epi-Pen, for telling his story.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to once again restate that this amendment \nsimply says that the Food and Drug Administration, when working with \nmanufacturers to plan a class I recall, should take all appropriate \nmeasures to ensure that consumers are directly and promptly notified. I \nthink most would agree this should be a commonsense requirement.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will feel \nconfident in supporting this amendment. I don't seek any recorded votes \non it. If the majority and minority can accept it, I am prepared to \nconclude the debate and go to other amendments. I don't know what their \npleasure is.\n  I see my distinguished floor manager rising. I yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished floor manager.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's indulgence. We \nare trying to get the reaction of the Food and Drug Administration and \nthe legislative committee that has jurisdiction over this subject. I \ndon't have an answer from them yet as to whether they want me to move \nto table the amendment or try to amend it to make it consistent with \ntheir wishes, or to suggest that we accept it.\n  The Senator said that a Member of the House, the other body, has \noffered this as an amendment over there. Has it been passed in a \nfreestanding bill, or is it on this bill, does the Senator know?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, I am informed the bill has been \nintroduced by Congressman Shays, whom I know my colleague and friend \nfrom Mississippi knows. I don't believe they have moved the bill over \nthere.\n  By the way, we have checked with the FDA and the words they use--we \nhave included and incorporated the comments of the FDA in the \nlegislative proposal.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleagues want to move to another amendment, I am \nmore than happy to set this aside.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that the Dodd amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside while we deal with some amendments that are \nagreed to, at the conclusion of which, we will automatically return to \nthe Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut for his agreement to set aside his amendment while we \nproceed to other business so we can near the time we are ready to \nconclude action on this bill. We hope that will be soon.\n  We have nine amendments that I think have been cleared on both sides. \nMy proposal would be that we consider them en bloc and that they be \napproved en bloc, and statements relating to the amendments be printed \nin the Record, and that motions to reconsider the votes and to table \nthe motions to reconsider be considered as passed. That will be my \nrequest. I want to be sure that we do have the list, and I will read \nthe list for the benefit of my comanager of this bill.\n  There is a Brownback amendment on the census of agriculture, a Levin \namendment on tree assistance, an amendment for Senators Kerrey and \nRoberts on farm policies studies.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, would the Senator yield just a moment. \nWhat was the Levin amendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Levin amendment is regarding tree assistance--\ndisaster assistance for tree plants.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have fire blights.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. It is fire blights.\n  A Graham amendment for country-of-origin produce labeling, a Bumpers \namendment relating to sense of the Senate on program funding levels, a \nFeingold and Jeffords amendment on small farms, a Dorgan amendment \nrelating to planting penalty limitation, a Craig and Lugar amendment on \nbiodiesel fuel, and a Bumpers amendment on Rural Housing Service Award.\n  We had cleared a Hatch amendment on interstate meat distribution, and \nwe understand a question has been raised by a colleague.\n  We understand the question has been answered, so we can now add the \ntenth amendment to the list, by Senator Hatch, interstate meat \ndistribution plan, and a colloquy that would go along with that.\n  Those are 10 amendments that have been cleared on this side. If the \ndistinguished comanager of the bill agrees, I am prepared to offer a \nunanimous consent request that they be considered en bloc and agreed to \nen bloc.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President all of those amendments have been cleared \non this side.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3178 through 3187, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those \namendments that I read in the list be considered en bloc, agreed to en \nbloc, that motions to table the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S8310]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] proposes \n     amendments No. 3178 through 3187, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments agreed to en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3178\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Secretary of Agriculture to improve the Census \n    of Agriculture by eliminating redundant questions and removing \n                               penalties)\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7   .

Mr. President, this amendment would require Country of \nOrigin labeling of perishable agricultural commodities imported into \nthe United States. I offer this amendment to ensure that Americans know \nthe origin of every orange, banana, tomato, cucumber, and green pepper \non display in the grocery store, and to improve the safety of food \nconsumed by all Americans.\n  In March of 1996, shoppers throughout California and nineteen other \nstates discovered that the produce they had brought home from the \ngrocery store was accompanied by an uninvited and unwelcome guest--\ncyclospora, a harmful parasite that invades the small intestine and \ncauses extreme diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, and severe muscle \naches.\n  Immediately, the federal government's Center for Disease Control \n(CDC) sprang into action. The agency traced the illness to contaminated \nGuatemalan raspberries and directed consumers to avoid buying fruit \nfrom the Central American nation until the outbreak could be \ninvestigated, contained, and eradicated.\n  Americans take this kind of urgent health directive seriously. But \nmillions of shoppers found that their hands were tied against following \nthe CDC's instructions. In 49 states, consumers discovered that grocery \nstores were not required to post where their fresh fruits and \nvegetables had been grown. The information required to prevent other \nAmericans from getting sick simply wasn't available.\n  Florida was the exception. For nearly twenty years, Floridians \nshopping at their local Publix, Winn Dixie, Food Lion, and other \ngrocery stores have been able to make educated choices about the food \nproducts they purchase for their families. In 1979, in my first year as \nGovernor, I proudly signed legislation to make country-of-origin labels \ncommonplace in produce sections all over Florida.\n  Country-of-origin labelling is not new to the American marketplace. \nFor decades, ``Made In'' labels have been as visible as price tags on \nclothes, toys, television sets, watches, and many other products. It \nmakes no sense that they are nowhere to be found in the produce section \nof grocery stores in the vast majority of states.\n  President Clinton has unveiled a number of food safety initiatives \nover\n\n[[Page S8311]]\n\nthe past several months. Although his plans commendably call for strict \nsafety measures in the growing and harvesting of domestic fruits and \nvegetables, and establish the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nas another line of defense against potentially contaminated imported \nproduce, they do not empower individual shoppers with the knowledge \nthey need to make educated choices in the produce section.\n  As the Guatemalan case illustrated, that is a dangerous omission. The \ncurrent lack of identifying information on produce means that Americans \nwho wish to heed government health warnings about foreign products or \nwho have justifiable concerns about other nations' labor, \nenvironmental, and agricultural standards are powerless to choose other \nperishibles.\n  Contrary to many claims opposing this legislation, compliance with a \ncountry of origin law would be of minimal cost to our nation's \nretailers. Both Publix and Winn Dixie have estimated that compliance \ncosts most individual grocery stores less than $10 each month. The \ntotal cost for more than 25,000 retail stores in Florida is less than \n$195,000 annually.\n  That's a small price to pay for consumers' peace of mind, and to \npreserve the concept of choice that is the foundation for our nation's \nfree market system. Any first-year economics student knows that the \nlaws of supply and demand do not work unless consumers have adequate \ninformation about goods and services for sale. Fruits and vegetables \nare no exception.\n  In addition, a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that \ntwenty-six of our key trading partners, including Guatemala, require \ncountry of origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables. By adopting \nthis amendment, our law will become more consistent with the laws of \nour global trading partners, and would not constitute an unfair barrier \nto trade.\n  Giving consumers greater confidence in the produce they buy should be \na central part of our nation's efforts to improve food safety. Congress \ncan take a major step toward meeting that goal by enacting this \namendment, and restoring American shoppers' ability to make an informed \ndecision.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3182\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that unauthorized user \n fees submitted in the President's budget have resulted in shortfalls \n                        for specified programs)\n\n       Findings.--\n       The President's budget submission includes unauthorized \n     user fees; It is unlikely these fees will be authorized in \n     the immediate future; The assumption of revenue from \n     unauthorized user fees results in a shortfall of funds \n     available for programs under the jurisdiction of the \n     Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \n     and Related Agencies Subcommittee;\n       That among the programs for which additional funds can be \n     justified are:\n       Human Nutrition Research;\n       The Food Safety Initiative activities of the USDA and the \n     FDA;\n       the wetlands Reserve Program;\n       the Conservation Farm Option Program;\n       the Farmland Protection Program;\n       the Inspector General's Law Enforcement Initiative;\n       FDA pre-notification certification;\n       FDA clinical pharmacology;\n       FDA Office of Cosmetics and Color;\n       the Rural Electric loan programs;\n       the Pesticide Data Program;\n       the Rural Community Advancement Program;\n       civil rights activities; and\n       Fund Rural America.\n       Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that: In the event \n     an additional allocation becomes available, the above \n     mentioned programs should be considered for funding.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3183\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to establish and \n maintain within the Department of Agriculture an Office of the Small \n                            Farms Advocate)\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. --.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment \naimed at preserving America's small farms. This amendment costs nothing \nand was inspired by a recommendation included in the January, 1998 \npublication of the National Commission on Small Farms.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that America's small farms are \nstruggling. Their struggle is detailed in ``A Time to Act'', the report \nissued by the National Commission on Small Farms, which outlines the \ncrisis small farmers will face as they enter the next century.\n  Mr. President, 94% of the farms in America are small farms, yet they \nreceive only 41% of all farm receipts. Simply put 6% of our farms \ncollect 59% of the receipts. Also, data shows that, on average, these \nfarms actually earn a negative return on equity. Mr. President, many \nfeel that one cause of the problem is that USDA does not emphasize the \nneeds of small farms in its strategic plans, partly because Congress \ndoes not require that emphasis. References to small farms appear seldom \nin USDA policy and Congress is to blame. Lets use this opportunity to \nright a wrong and attempt to preserve small farms throughout the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the Feingold amendment will turn the USDA's attention \nto the plight of the small farmer. This amendment directs the Secretary \nof Agriculture to establish an Office of the Small Farms Advocate \nwithin six months of enactment of the underlying bill. This office will \nbe headed by an Administrator who will be appointed by the President \nand who will report directly to the Secretary of Agriculture. This \noffice will be created without going outside current budget or \npersonnel resources. The Office of the Small Farms Advocate will ensure \nthat USDA and its programs work to meet the needs of today's small \nfarmers.\n  The Office of the Small Farms Advocate will accomplish this by: \nworking with all USDA agencies to ensure that they consider the needs \nof small farmers; providing formal input on major programmatic and \npolicy decisions by USDA agencies; developing a plan to enhance small \nfarm program delivery at USDA; and being a constant advocate for small \nfarms and small farm policies.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that it is not my intention to create \nanother layer of bureaucracy--it is my intention to coordinate USDA \nprograms to meet small farmer needs and make the bureaucracy more \nresponsive.\n  Mr. President, this amendment will not increase USDA's authorized \nbudget, but instead directs USDA to use its current financial and \npersonnel resources. Finally, this amendment does not increase the \nnumber of political appointees within the Department of Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, day after day, season after season, we are losing \nsmall farms at an alarming rate. In the United States, we have 300,000 \nless farms than\n\n[[Page S8312]]\n\nwe did in 1979. In 1980, there were 45,000 dairy farms in Wisconsin. In \n1997, there are only 24,000 dairy farms. That is a loss of more than 3 \ndairy farms a day--every day for 18 years. And it does not begin to \nmeasure the human cost to families driven from the land. As small farms \ndisappear, we are witnessing the emergence of larger agricultural \noperations. This trend toward fewer but larger dairy operations is \nmirrored in most states throughout the Nation.\n  For many of the rural communities of Wisconsin, small family-owned \nfarms are the key component of the community. They provide economic and \nsocial stability. The reduction in the number of small farms has hurt \ntheir neighbors as well and deprived the merchants on Main Street of \nmany lifelong customers. We need a system in which small farms can be \nviable and the work of the producer can be fairly rewarded.\n  Mr. President, many feel federal policy and federal investments focus \nalmost solely on the needs of larger scale agricultural producers--\nneglecting the specific research needs of small producers. Small \nproducers need more Federal research and extension activity devoted to \nthe development of these alternatives. It is my hope that this new \noffice at USDA will be committed to help develop and promote production \nand marketing systems that specifically address the needs of small \nfarms. This bias has hamstrung small farmers, depriving them of the \ntools they need to adapt to changes in farming and the marketplace and \naccelerating the trend toward increased concentration.\n  Mr. President, this country's small producers should not be forced to \nbecome larger in order to remain competitive. Bigger is not necessarily \nbetter. Maintaining the economic viability of small operations has \nbenefits beyond those gained by farmers and the communities in which \nthey reside; they can also provide environmental benefits. For example, \nas operations expand, manure storage and management practices become \nmore costly and more burdensome for the operator and raise additional \nregulatory concerns associated with runoff and water quality among \nState and Federal regulators. Federal policy that helps small operators \nto remain competitive and profitable without dramatic expansion will \nhelp minimize these concerns. And in fact, M. President, expansion is \noften counterproductive for small operations, requiring them to take on \neven greater debt. Unfortunately, federal agriculture policy has put \nmany producers in a situation where they must choose to expand their \noperations or throw in the towel. Farmers should not be forced into \nthat position. We must provide the tools necessary for farmers to \nsurvive and prosper regardless of the size of their operation.\n  We all congratulated the USDA when it convened the National \nCommission on Small Farms in July 1997. We applauded the appointment of \nfarmers, ranchers, staff of nonprofit farm and farmworker advocacy \norganizations, Extension professionals, current and former public \nofficials, and philanthropic foundation program staff. We all held up \nthe final report as our signal to rural America that we were going to \ndo something. M. President, we haven't done anything yet. The \nCommission important report and recommendation have fallen by the \nwayside. It would be a travesty if the U.S. Government spent taxpayer \nmoney on a worthwhile project such as this--then didn't act on those \nrecommendations. This amendment is the first step in our commitment to \nnot preserve a large sector of our agriculture community, and an \nimportant piece of America's heritage.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this no-cost, pro-farmer amendment \nand yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3184\n\n   (Purpose: To limit the penalty for an inadvertent violation of a \n         contract under the Agricultural Market Transition Act)\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 7--.

Mr. President, renewable alternative fuels benefit \nenergy security, the environment, and our overall economy. The \namendment being offered today by Senator Craig and myself is critically \nimportant to soybean farmers across the country, and will do a great \ndeal to give the ag economy a shot in the arm in states which produce \nsoybeans.\n  Since the Farm Bill took affect two years ago, soybean prices have \ndropped 15 percent, costing soybean producers in South Dakota about a \nhundred million dollars in lost revenue. The Craig/Johnson amendment \ncould help offset these losses by boosting soybean prices an average of \n11 cents a bushel and generating about $10 million in additional \nrevenue for South Dakota soybean farmers and more than $300 million for \nsoybean farmers nationwide without costing taxpayers one dime.\n  This amendment makes changes to the Energy Policy Act of 1992. As \nmost know, EPACT was enacted to stimulate the research and development \nof technologies which can potentially shift the focus of national \nenergy demand away from imported oil and toward renewable or \ndomestically produced energy sources. One component of energy \nconsumption on which EPACT focuses is significantly reducing the amount \nof imported oil used by the transportation sector. The stated goal in \nEPACT is to replace 10 percent of petroleum by the year 2000 and 30 \npercent by the year 2010 with alternative fuels.\n  This amendment is necessary because unfortunately, EPACT's current \nmandates and incentive structure essentially exclude some alternative \nfuels, such as biodiesel, from being an option for controlled fleet \nowners and operators. Further, the amendment will aid in the \nachievement of EPACT's goals of strengthening America's energy security \nthrough the substitution of domestically produced alternative fuels for \nimported petroleum products in the transportation sector. The latter \npoint is important because this country is making extremely poor \nprogress toward meeting the petroleum displacement goals of EPACT, and \neven federal fleets are not in compliance with the requirements of this \nstatute.\n  However, it is my understanding that Senators Bumpers and Rockefeller \nhave some concerns about the impact the amendment will have on other \nalternative fuels currently eligible under EPACT. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes, Senator Johnson, I do have some concerns about the \namendment. However, I am prepared to accept the amendment today if I \ncan secure a commitment from the Senator from South Dakota to sit down \nand address my concerns between passage of the Senate's legislation \ntoday and completion of action by the conference committee. Can I have \nthat commitment from you, Senator Johnson?\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Certainly, and I very much appreciate your willingness \nto work with me on this issue. Senator Rockefeller, would you be \nwilling to accept the amendment today knowing that we will be sitting \ndown between now and the completion of the conference committee to work \nout a compromise to address your concerns?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. While you are correct that I have concerns about \nspecific provisions in the amendment, I also have concerns about the \nprocess by which we have taken up this issue. One of my top legislative \npriorities since coming to Congress has been the promotion of \nalternative fuels, and I am concerned that today's action is only a \nband-aid on a program which needs major surgery. However, I am prepared \nto accept the amendment today with the commitment to work together in \nthe coming weeks to find a compromise to address my concerns.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Senator Rockefeller. I look forward to \nworking with you on this specific issue in the coming weeks, and on the \nlarger issue of more effectively promoting the use of all alternative \nfuels in the coming months and in future congresses. I also want to \nthank Senator Craig and Chairman Cochran for their leadership on this \namendment, and look forward to working with them during the coming \nweeks to find a compromise on this important issue prior to completion \nof action by the conference committee.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3186\n\n  [The text of the amendment will appear in a future issue of the \nRecord.]\n\n\n                           amendment No. 3187\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a plan to \nCongress for the lifting of the ban on interstate distribution of state \n                            inspected meat)\n\n       The Secretary of Agriculture shall present to Congress a \n     report on whether to recommend by March 1, 1999, lifting the \n     ban on the interstate-distribution of state inspected meat.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nRoberts be added as a cosponsor to the biodiesel amendment, amendment \nNo. 3185.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I and my colleague from Vermont Senator \nJeffords, would like to engage Senator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, \nSenator Graham, and Senator Mack in a colloquy regarding Senator \nGraham's disaster assistance amendment. I can certainly sympathize with \nwhat Senator Graham and Senator Mack are trying to do tonight with this \namendment, and I support their amendment. The fires that have struck \nFlorida in recent weeks have shocked people from across the country, \nand undoubtedly the damage to agriculture in the state has been severe. \nHowever, I would like to bring attention to the fact that a number of \nother states have also suffered significant damage from natural \ndisasters in recent months. My own state of Vermont suffered \nsignificant flooding early this month. Eight of the state's fourteen \ncounties were declared disaster areas. Other parts of the country are \nalso suffering agricultural damage including areas of the west and \nsoutheast which are suffering serious drought conditions. Damage from \nthese disasters is still being determined, however by the time we go to \nconference with the House on the Agriculture Appropriations bill, we \nwill have a better idea about the extent of those damages. I hope that \nat that point we can revisit this disaster assistance and adjust the \nfunding levels to reflect the full extent of agricultural damage from \nnatural disasters being suffered by farmers throughout the country.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to join Senator Leahy in expressing my \nhope that we can revisit the issue of disaster assistance funding in \nconference. Senator Leahy and I toured the damage in Vermont following \nthe flooding there earlier this month, and the damage for farmers in \naffected areas was indeed severe. Those farmers are going to need \nassistance and I hope that we will be able to provide it in this bill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree with the Senators from Vermont that there are \nareas of the country suffering agricultural damage as a result of \nnatural disasters and the needs of these areas should be addressed. The \nAdministration should review the damage estimates from affected areas \nand request any emergency funding required to address those additional \nneeds.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am in full agreement with Senator Cochran. While the \nneed of farmers in Florida is clear and pressing, other farmers are \nalso suffering as a result of the many disasters which have struck the \ncountry this year. The final conference agreement on this provision \nshould reflect the full extent of damage to farmers in all affected \nregions of the country.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the support of Senator Cochran and Senator \nBumpers for our amendment and agree that it would be appropriate to \naddress any additional needs of farmers from other disaster-stricken \nregions in conference.\n  Mr. MACK. I would like to join my colleagues in agreement that \nappropriate action to meet the needs of farmers in disaster-stricken \nareas throughout the nation should be taken in conference.\n\n\n        wildlife services division of APHIS aerial safety study\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Senator Cochran, I would like to discuss recent problems\n\n[[Page S8315]]\n\nthat have been facing the Wildlife Services aerial program.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I understand that the Wildlife Services \nDivision of APHIS has recently completed a full, independent review of \ntheir aerial program.\n  Mr. BURNS. That's absolutely correct. As you know, Wildlife Services \nprovides a broad range of services across the country and the aerial \noperations program is a key component of these services. In fact, \ndistribution of rabies vaccine baits by Wildlife Services occurred \nearlier this year in Texas, Ohio, New Hampshire and other states. These \nactivities help protect pets, children and others from the spread of \nrabies.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I understand that the aerial program plays a large role \nin wolf recovery efforts in the Rocky Mountain West.\n  Mr. BURNS. That's right. The aerial program helps researchers track \nradio-collared wolves so we learn about wolf movements, habitat needs \nand feeding patterns. Without the aerial program it would be much more \ndifficult to tranquilize and relocate wolves preying on domestic \nlivestock. And, in the event of a wolf persists on killing livestock, \nit enables the program to efficiently remove the specific problem \nanimal.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. But there have been problems?\n  Mr. BURNS. Yes. Despite a historically solid safety record, a series \nof aircraft accidents in the past two years including four fatalities \nof pilots, have prompted Assistant Secretary Mike Dunn to call for a \nfull outside review.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. What were the conclusions of this review?\n  Mr. BURNS. The review found that not enough resources are being \ndevoted to maintaining the safety of the program. Because of increasing \ndemand for their aerial services, the program directs most of their \nresources into program delivery. This, coupled with ongoing budget \nconstraints have limited the ability of the program to keep pace with \ndeveloping technology and training in aircraft operations.\n  It is my understanding that the House has provided funds to address \nthis situation. I hope the Senate conferees on this bill will review \nthe findings of this study in the conference to assess whether \nadditional funding is justified.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate your bringing this study to our attention \nand we will look into this situation prior to conference.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from South Dakota yield for purposes of a \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I am happy to enter into a colloquy with the Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator and I have been working together on the Meat \nLabeling Act of 1998 for some time. Might I ask, what is the Senator's \nunderstanding of the Act's impact on meat prepared and served by a \nrestaurant?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. It is my understanding, as the sponsor of the \nlegislation, that it would have no impact what-so-ever on meat prepared \nand served by a restaurant. It is not our intent to require labeling of \nmeat prepared and served by a restaurant.\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is also my understanding and intent. I thank the \nSenator for his clarification.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment to the \nAgriculture Appropriations Bill, number 3150. This amendment would \nprovide increased funding for research activities to improve counter-\nnarcotic efforts.\n  I realize that the Subcommittee faced a very difficult challenge with \nthe level of the funding allocation this year. While I am disappointed \nthat it has been impossible to fund this project at this time, I wish \nto call the attention of the members of the Subcommittee to this \nimportant proposal. I believe it makes sense for the future of the \nagriculture industry.\n  This project would increase efforts to use biotechnology in the \ncontrol of narcotic plants. This research would also enhance \ntraditional agriculture production practices, supplying an important \ntool in weed control. Biotechnology research promises an economical \nsolution to the spread of noxious weeds and other pests that threaten \nboth public and private land across the nation.\n  I believe this type of research holds great potential for success in \nthe war on drugs. Related efforts are underway in private industry, but \nthere is great need to increase our efforts. This project would be an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the Subcommittee Leadership, Senator \nBumpers and Chairman Cochran for their efforts to find funding for this \nprogram. And I hope it will be possible for the Subcommittee to give \nthis project strong consideration in the future.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank Senator Baucus for agreeing to look at funding \nthis project in the future. I look forward to working with him on that \neffort.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you Senator Bumpers, and thanks to the Chairman, as \nwell for his assistance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Would the distinguished Senator from Mississippi yield \nfor the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with me on an issue of some \nconcern to food packagers and to the general public?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am pleased to yield to the Senator from Iowa for the \npurpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As my colleague, the distinguished Chairman of the \nSubcommittee may know, I have been advised that the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA) authorized a new \nstreamlined pre-market notification system for food packaging \nmaterials. The current regulatory process involves significant delays, \nresulting in lost sales and decisions not to bring new products to \nmarket that would improve food safety and protect the public health.\n  The new notification system will substantially reduce the length of \nthe FDA review process and allow the introduction of advanced packaging \nmaterials. The Agency will still, however, receive all of the \ninformation needed to establish the safety of packaging materials and \nwill continue to be able to keep unsafe materials off the market.\n  I also have been advised that FDAMA requires that certain funding \ncriteria be met for the program to take effect as scheduled on April 1, \n1999.\n  The Act calls for funding of the pre-market notification program at a \nlevel of $1.5 million in FY 1999. I note that the counterpart \nlegislation passed by the House Appropriations Committee currently \nprovides for the sum of $500,000. It is my hope that the distinguished \nChairman of the Subcommittee will further address this issue in \nconference in order for the FDA to implement this important reform as \nintended by Congress.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I agree with my colleague that the implementation of \nthis program would expedite the introduction of improved food packaging \nmaterials and will give every consideration to this issue in the \nConference Committee.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think we can announce that additional \namendments have now been cleared on both sides of the aisle. There are \n4 amendments. Three of them are Coverdell-Cleland amendments, the \nSenators from Georgia. One involves a prohibition on loan guarantees. \nAnother involves a definition of ``farmland.'' A third involves \ndisaster loan collateral requirements. A fourth Amendment is for \nSenator Harkin, and it involves the WIC amendment, and it includes a \ncolloquy.\n  If my distinguished friend from Arkansas can verify that these have \nbeen cleared on his side of the aisle, we are prepared to proceed to \nask that they be considered en bloc and agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. May I ask the floor manager, what was the last \namendment?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. The Harkin amendment on the WIC program, together with a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That has been cleared on this side.\n\n\n               Amendments No. 3188 through 3191, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I send four amendments to the desk, en \nbloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are prepared to accept the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Iowa. We have made a strong effort to provide adequate \nfunding in this bill in order to maintain WIC participation within the \nbudgetary constraints we have faced.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I certainly appreciate the efforts of the distinguished \nChairman to fund WIC adequately within the limitations of the bill. \nHowever, analysis supporting the Administration's budget request \nindicates that the amount provided will not be sufficient to maintain \nWIC participation at the level it is expected to reach at the end of \nthis fiscal year. Because of the success of WIC. I believe it is \nimportant to do whatever we can to ensure that WIC participation does \nnot fall for lack of funding. My amendment provides a portion--but much \nless than all--of the additional appropriation the Administration \nbelieves is necessary to avoid a reduction in WIC participation during \nfiscal 1999.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I certainly want to provide adequate funding to maintain \nWIC participation. We felt that we were providing sufficient funding in \nthe bill to accomplish that. I would also note that I am concerned \nabout the effect of the offset in the Senator's amendment on the level \nof commodities that may be purchased and provided to schools for the \nNational School Lunch Program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I acknowledge the doubts the Chairman has about the \naccuracy of the WIC budget request. Also, as the Chairman knows, I \nshare his strong support for the School Lunch Program and for supplying \ncommodities to it. I do have a letter from Secretary Glickman stating \nmy amendment would not have an adverse effect on the School Lunch \nProgram. I would be pleased to work with the Chairman and Senator \nBumpers to obtain a more thorough understanding of the needed level of \nWIC funding and of the effects of the offset prior to conference on the \nbill.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the willingness of the Senator to work with \nus on these questions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chairman very much for his cooperation on \nthis amendment and look forward to working with him further on the \nmatter.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

TEEN ANTI-TOBACCO ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Increase in Funds.--The amount described for salaries \n     and expenses of the Food and Drug Administration under title \n     VI shall be increased from $1,072,640,000 to $1,172,640,000.\n       (b) User Fee.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall, not \n     later than 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and annually thereafter assess and collect from each \n     manufacturer of tobacco products a user fee for the conduct \n     of teen anti-tobacco activities by the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n       (c) Amount.--With respect to each year, the user fee \n     assessed to a manufacturer under subsection (b) shall be \n     equal to an amount that bears the same ratio to $150,000,000 \n     as the tobacco product market share of the manufacturer bears \n     to the tobacco market share of all tobacco product \n     manufacturers for the year preceding the year in which the \n     determination is being made.\n       (d) Deposits.--Amount collected under subsection (b) shall \n     be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury.\n       (e) Appropriation.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     in each fiscal year, and there are appropriated, an amount \n     equal to the amount deposited into the Treasury under \n     subsection (d) for that fiscal year, to be used by the Food \n     and Drug Administration to carry out teen anti-tobacco \n     activities under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.\n       (f) No Requirement for Payment.--The Secretary shall not \n     require that a manufacturer pay a user fee under this section \n     for any tobacco product for any fiscal year if the Secretary \n     determines that the tobacco product involved as manufactured \n     by the manufacturer is used by less than 0.5 percent of the \n     total number of individuals determined to have used any \n     tobacco product as manufactured by all manufacturers for the \n     year involved.\n       (g) Final Determination.--The determination of the \n     Secretary as to the amount and allocation of an assessment \n     under subsection (b) shall be final and the manufacturer \n     shall pay such assessment within 30 days of the date on which \n     the manufacturer is assessed.

Mr. President, I hope we don't have to take too long on \nthis. I know Senator Reed wants to speak. I don't know that too many \nothers want to speak on this amendment. It is a very important \namendment. It is simple and straightforward. It simply says that the \nlaws we have that make it illegal to sell tobacco products to kids \nshould be adequately enforced. To do that, the amendment I have just \nsent to the desk provides full funding for the ongoing anti teen \nsmoking program at the FDA, which is funded through the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill. It pays for this with an assessment fee on tobacco \ncompanies that equals about $25 per teen smoker. The amendment does \nnothing more or less than that.\n  It in no way is intended to be a substitute for action on \ncomprehensive tobacco reform. I am hopeful we will still have it. It \ndoes not speak for the issue of FDA authority over tobacco products. It \ndoes not impact on tobacco company advertising. And it does not impact \non tobacco farmers. It simply provides the money necessary to continue \nan ongoing program, a program that is already in effect, but to do it \nin a way that is effective.\n  This amendment is virtually identical to the amendment that Senators \nChafee, Reed, I, and others, offered last September, which passed this \nbody by a vote of 70 to 28 last September.\n  The bill before us provides $34 million for the FDA antiteen smoking \ninitiative. That was the money that we put in there last September. \nThat was the 70 to 28 vote that added the $34 million. But $134 million \nis needed to assure that the effort is fully effective. This was the \namount requested by the President, and it is basically the same as was \nrequested in the Commerce Committee tobacco bill.\n  So, again, the amount that is in this amendment is what was requested \nby the President, and it is about the same\n\n[[Page S8318]]\n\nas was requested in the Commerce Committee bill that was voted out of \nthe Commerce Committee. Our amendment basically increases the amount in \nthe bill for this purpose from $34 million to $134 million for next \nyear.\n  As I said, it is fully offset by establishing an assessment fee on \ntobacco companies based on their share of the tobacco market. Because \nof budget scoring rules, it is necessary to collect this assessment \ntotaling about $150 million to provide for an additional $100 million \nneeded.\n  For example, if the total tobacco market in the United States this \nyear is $100 billion, and let's say, for example, Philip Morris has 60 \npercent of that share, they would pay 60 percent of the $150 million, \nor $90 million. So the assessment on the tobacco companies is based \nupon their percentage of the total tobacco market in the United States. \nAs I mentioned, this roughly equates to about $25 per teen smoker.\n  Mr. President, the amendment, again, returns us to the most \nfundamental question of our long and ongoing debate on tobacco. The \nfundamental question is whether we are serious about helping America's \nkids avoid the deadly addiction of tobacco use, and whether we are \nprepared to continue and adequately fund an existing program designed \nto deter illegal sales to children.\n  As I mentioned last year, this body overwhelmingly affirmed increased \nfunding of the FDA use of the antitobacco initiative with a strong \nbipartisan vote, as I said earlier, of 70 to 28. That was a vote on the \nChafee-Reed-Harkin amendment on September 3 of 1997.\n  For Senators' elucidation, this is basically the same amendment. It \njust takes it from $34 million to $134 million. In other words, it \nfully funds the program so it can be effective. Plainly and simply, \nthis amendment is about America's kids and protecting them from the \ndisease, suffering, and death caused by smoking and nicotine addiction.\n  With a death toll of more than 400,000 each year, smoking kills more \nAmericans than AIDS, alcohol, motor vehicles, fires, homicides, illicit \ndrugs, and suicide all combined. Mr. President, this is a chart that \nmost graphically illustrates why tobacco is the No. 1 killer in America \ntoday. As I said, you can add up all of this--alcohol deaths, \naccidents, suicides, AIDS, homicides, illegal drugs, fires--and they \ndon't equal the 418,690 deaths caused by tobacco last year.\n\n  It is an epidemic. It is an epidemic that begins with underage \nsmoking. We know from the documents that have been released to the \nvarious court cases in the States involving the tobacco companies now \nthat they have targeted young people. We know from their documents that \n90 percent of adult smokers began at or before the age of 18. We know \nthat for years the tobacco companies have targeted young people to \nsmoke--not older people. They target young people because they know if \nthey can get these young people hooked by the time they are 18, they \nhave got them hooked.\n  Again, all I ask is look at the advertising the tobacco companies \nuse. It is always young people. It is Joe Camel. It is young people. It \nis young people on the beach. They are having a lot of fun. And it is \ndesigned to get young people. It is not designed for old fogies like \nme. It is designed for the young people. All you have to do is look at \nthe ads the tobacco companies put out there, and you will know they are \ntrying to get young people hooked.\n  Today, like every other day, 3,000 young Americans will begin \nsmoking--3,000; 1,000 of them will die every single day. That is more \nthan three jumbo jets full of our children crashing every day. At \ncurrent smoking rates, 1 million American kids under 18 who are alive \ntoday will die from slow suffocation due to a smoking-related disease. \nThey will die hooked up to machines and craving nicotine. And teenage \nsmoking rates are still climbing.\n  There is a chart that shows the rate among high school seniors. It is \nat a 17-year high. It has been shooting up ever since the early 1990s. \nWe are now at a 17-year high for youth smoking. The addiction is very \nreal. Almost half of all the kids who experiment with as few as three \ncigarettes go on to become regular smokers.\n  More than half of the kids who smoke daily said that they smoked \ntheir first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking in the morning. I \nfound that hard to believe. But then I am not a smoker. But I drove \nfrom my house one morning. My daughter goes to a local public school \nout in Virginia. About 7 o'clock in the morning I drove her to school. \nShe had a lot of stuff she had to take. I put her in the car and drove \nher down to school. You drive down there, and you see all of these kids \nwalking down the streets and on the street corners before they go into \nschool at between 7 and 7:15 in the morning smoking cigarettes. I could \nhardly believe it at that early hour.\n  Then I see that more than half of them smoke their first cigarette \nwithin 30 minutes of waking in the morning. All you have to do is go to \nany local school about halfway down the street before the school and \nwatch the kids walking to school and you will see that this is true.\n  More than 90 percent of kids who smoke or use spit tobacco experience \nat least one symptom of nicotine withdrawal when they try to quit. When \nthey say you have a choice to smoke or not, once these kids are hooked, \nI tell you, they don't have much of a choice.\n  Compared to the comprehensive tobacco legislation that we need, this \namendment makes just a small investment in the future of our children. \nBut even this small investment will pay off in longer lives and better \nhealth for millions of Americans. Since each dollar spent to implement \nFDA regulations has been shown to result in at least $48 worth of \nhealth and social benefits, it is a sound investment that we can make.\n  Let me review briefly what this amendment will fund at FDA. Right now \nFDA, as I said, has about $34 million in this fiscal year 1998. That is \nbecause of the amendment that was adopted here last September by an \noverwhelming vote of 70 to 28. They are using these funds to fund \ncontracts with 45 States and local jurisdictions to carry out the \nenforcement of minimum age restrictions for tobacco purchases and to \nrequire photo ID checks.\n  The FDA initiative also includes funding to provide information to \nretailers and the public to help retailers comply with the rules and \nnot sell tobacco to kids.\n  This excerpt that I have from an FDA brochure indicates some of the \neducational information that the FDA is using to show why it is \nnecessary to have a photo ID check. Which one is 16? Is it Melissa or \nis it Amy?\n  If they walked into a store, would the clerk know which one was under \n18? Well, to eliminate the guesswork, FDA requires retailers to card \nanyone who is under 27.\n  Melissa here is 16 and Amy is 25. So, again, you really do not know, \nand that is why we need a good information campaign to make sure that \nretailers know what they are up against in requiring these ID checks.\n  This year, FDA's current tobacco enforcement budget will fund 200,000 \ncompliance checks. So the money that we voted here last fall, Mr. \nPresident, will fund about 200,000 compliance checks nationwide. That \nmay sound like a lot, but it only covers one-fifth, one out of five or \n20 percent, of the Nation's tobacco retailers. So four out of five \naren't even covered.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services has estimated that three-\nfourths of the approximately 1 million tobacco outlets in this country \nsell tobacco to children--three out of four. The Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention estimates that minors illegally purchase 256 \nmillion packs of cigarettes each year resulting in almost $500 million \nin sales. Just think of that. Over $500 million a year flow into the \ntobacco companies from the illegal sale of tobacco. Let me repeat that: \n$500 million flow into the tobacco companies every year just from the \nillegal sales of tobacco to young people.\n  What are we asking for in this amendment? We are asking for $134 \nmillion. And they are making $500 million just off of the illegal sales \nto minors.\n  The Surgeon General has concluded that children are able to buy a \npack of cigarettes or a tin of spit tobacco 67 percent of the time \nwithout once ever being asked for proof of age. The amendment we have \nsent to the desk will more than double the number of annual compliance \nchecks that can be\n\n[[Page S8319]]\n\nconducted and increase to 60 percent the coverage of tobacco outlets \nnationwide. Right now, it is only 20 percent. At least this amendment \ngets it up to 60 percent of the retail outlets that will be covered \nnationwide.\n  This year, the FDA is able to fund very limited outreach efforts to \neducate retailers, parents and the public about access and advertising \nrestrictions. With the $34 million that we provided last fall, FDA is \nconducting radio, billboard and newspaper outreach campaigns, but only \none city per State for 4 weeks out of every year is covered. So the $34 \nmillion we put in last year, just think about it, goes to only one city \nper State for 4 weeks out of every year. Now, contrast that to what the \ntobacco companies spend to push their product. Over $13 million every \nday, over half a million dollars per hour; that is what the tobacco \nindustry is spending every minute around the clock on tobacco \nadvertising and promotion, a whopping $5 billion--that is with a B--$5 \nbillion a year that they spend. What we are asking for is $134 million \njust to get information out to conduct ID checks, to cover just a few \nmore cities and a few more States.\n  This amendment we have sent to the desk will allow FDA to conduct \nnational education and outreach efforts at a level more commensurate \nwith the problem.\n  Increased funding at the level we have in our amendment would double \nthe media exposure and double the number of markets used to communicate \nimportant information about restrictions on access to tobacco and \ntobacco advertising to retailers and to the general public. \nComprehensive merchant education programs combined with community \neducation and strong enforcement programs have been shown to \nsuccessfully reduce illegal underage sales by 24 percent.\n  So you can think of this amendment in another way. How would you like \nto cut down on illegal underage sales of tobacco by 24 percent next \nyear? Well, we all say we do. We all say we want to cut back on teenage \nsmoking. Here is a proven way, an ongoing program. We are starting no \nnew program. We are not starting any new bureaucracy, no new laws. All \nwe are taking is an existing program and funding it a little more \nadequately. And we could reduce the illegal underage sales by 24 \npercent. So it is not a new bureaucratic program.\n  At least $75 million of the money will go out to State and local \njurisdictions for enforcement. At least $35 million will be used to \neducate retailers and the public about the rules so that retailers can \ncomply. The point of rules is not to punish anyone. It is to prevent \ntobacco from being sold to kids.\n  I just might add that this photo ID check and the minimum age rules \nwere fully upheld by the Federal District Court in Greensboro, NC.\n  So to recap, this amendment simply provides funding, full funding for \nthe ongoing FDA antiteen smoking program. The bulk of the $100 million \ngoes to States and localities to enforce the rules, and it pays for the \nincrease through an assessment on tobacco companies based on their \ntotal market share. So, in other words, the largest tobacco companies; \nthat is, large based on their market share, pay more of the $150 \nmillion. The smaller companies, of course, would pay less.\n  As I said, a very similar amendment was supported by 70 Senators last \nSeptember. So if we are prepared to stand with America's kids and their \nparents to take even the most basic step of effectively enforcing the \nrules against illegal sales of tobacco, this is the way to do it. By \nstopping these illegal sales, we can help our children avoid an \naddiction that will destroy their health and take their lives. This \namendment will do that. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I see my cosponsor and colleague from Rhode Island is in the Chamber. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Harkin's \namendment. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  As the Senator indicated, last year this Senate strongly supported a \nvirtually identical measure which would increase the enforcement \nability of the Food and Drug Administration dramatically. We all know \nthat in every State in this country it is illegal for children to buy \ncigarettes, but we also know it is very easy for children to buy \ncigarettes from vending machines and retail outlets. And last year, \nthere were a staggering total of 256 million packs of cigarettes sold \nto children under the age of 18. That is an enormous amount of \ncigarettes, as Senator Harkin indicated, roughly $500 million, a huge \nmarket, a very lucrative market. And we all know if we don't take \neffective steps to provide for the enforcement of existing State laws \nand education of children and, just as importantly, the retail \nsalespeople, this staggering total will go on and on and on, with \ndreadful consequences to the health of our children.\n  Our effort today is to provide the resources to ensure that illegal \ntobacco sales to children are stopped if at all possible. Our amendment \nwould fully fund the FDA's youth in our tobacco efforts by raising an \nadditional $100 million by imposing a user fee on tobacco companies \nbased on their market share. The pending bill, the bill that we are \nconsidering today, provides only $34 million, which is roughly one-\nquarter of the request submitted by the administration, to fully and \neffectively enforce the tobacco laws in the United States against sales \nof tobacco products to children.\n  Let's put this total in perspective, that we are asking for, this \n$100 million. It has already been eclipsed by the amount of money spent \nby the tobacco industry in advertising against comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation this year in the U.S. Senate. Just, in fact, a few moments \nago in the cloakroom, I saw another advertisement being run by the big \ntobacco companies. They have already spent much more than that in \ntrying to prevent effective legislation that will curtail teen smoking \nin the United States.\n  Another aspect we should consider: This $100 million is just roughly \n2 percent of the $5 billion that the industry spends each year in \nadvertising its products, and, as we well know and has been well \ndocumented, too much of this advertising is directed at children.\n  We have to in some way, some small way, counteract this constant \nfusillade of advertising aimed at children, and one way we can do it \ntoday--far short of the comprehensive debate that we had weeks ago--one \nway we can do it is ensuring FDA has the resources to adequately \nsupport State efforts to suppress childhood access to tobacco products.\n  In terms of the money we are requesting, a total of over $100 \nmillion, it is also small compared to the health consequences of \ntobacco smoking in the United States. It has been estimated that over \n$50 billion a year is drained from our health care system because of \ntobacco and its effect on children. As Senator Harkin so well \nindicated, this is a pediatric disease; it begins with young people. \nMr. President, 90 percent or more of individuals who begin to smoke do \nso before they are 18 years of age. Smoking begins around 12 or 13 year \nold. Regular smokers are regular smokers by the time they are 14. It is \na pediatric disease. It is costing us billions of dollars a year, and \nwe have to take effective steps to stop it. This is one way that we can \ndo it, one way I hope we can do it.\n  We know, too, enforcement of these laws is a significant way of \ncurtailing access to tobacco products for children and, we hope, \ncurtailing their exposure to tobacco and nicotine. One of the \nsignificant aspects of this amendment is, it will allow the FDA to put \nmore resources into State efforts to curtail access to tobacco products \nby young people.\n  We all were lobbied heavily by different groups--industry groups and \npublic health groups--about the comprehensive legislation. There is not \none group that came into my office, be they public health advocates or \nindustry representatives, that did not emphatically and unhesitatingly \nsay, ``We are in favor of strong enforcement of existing laws that \ncurtail teen smoking. We want this. We will do this.'' Now we have an \nopportunity to fulfill their desire by giving resources to the FDA to \nensure that these laws are strictly and effectively and efficiently \nenforced.\n  We are talking about a situation in which we can provide resources to \nbolster the laws that are already on the books. As I indicated, as my \ncolleague\n\n[[Page S8320]]\n\nindicated, every State in this country curtails teen smoking. Every \nquarter of this country speaks out against underage smoking. It is not \njust public health advocates, it is the industry. Everyone says this is \nwrong. Yet, unfortunately, we are seeing a tremendous rise in smoking \namong teenagers. It is rising dramatically. It has increased by over a \nthird since 1991. It is one of the unfortunate health statistics \nrelated to children in America today. Again, unless we take effective \nsteps, it will continue to rise.\n  We know that most young people buy their cigarettes themselves. This \nis not some great conspiracy where adults are out supplying kids. These \nare young people walking into these stores or getting access to a \nvending machine and buying it themselves. We know we can cut down this \nabuse, we know we can cut down this access, if we have stronger, better \nlaws. More enforcement, though, of the existing laws, is certainly the \nfirst place to start.\n  FDA evidence indicates, if we thoroughly enforce the compliance laws \nof the United States, we can significantly reduce teenage smoking. We \ncan do it without entering into some of the more extensive proposals \nthat were entertained just weeks ago here. We can do it by providing \nthe resources of the FDA to support the States so they can both educate \ntheir salespeople in retail categories and also to ensure that we are \nchecking on what they are doing.\n  This is a terribly lucrative product. Talking to convenience store \nowners, many of them indicated this is the most lucrative product they \nhave in their stores in terms of the margin on the sales they make. \nThere is tremendous incentive to backslide, to ignore the regulations, \nto do anything you can to make these sales, to do anything you can to \navoid the laws against selling tobacco products to minors. Unless we \ncheck them, unless we supervise them, unless we give real incentives to \nthe States to do that, that is exactly what will happen, because that \nis exactly what is happening today.\n  We have to, I think, find a way, not just each year coming to this \nfloor and arguing for additional resources, but in the future I hope we \ncan find a way to permanently fund sufficient resources to fully \nimplement State laws and other provisions that will curtail the access \nto tobacco products by young people. But today we have the opportunity, \nthe real opportunity, to provide more resources so we can do in deeds \nwhat we all say in words we want done: To stop young people from buying \ntobacco products, to give them a chance to grow up, to give them a \nchance later, if they wish, as adults, to make a decision about \nsmoking.\n  This is the moment for us to stand up and to literally put our money \nwhere our mouth is. I urge passage of the amendment, and I yield back \nmy time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this is the wrong time for a debate on \ntobacco taxes. No one is opposed to food safety, but I'm not so \nenthusiastic about a plan that raises taxes on already cash-strapped \ntobacco farmers to pay for new USDA bureaucrats.\n  Farmers all over the country are hurting, and we're pledging to help \nthem, but this amendment will continue to hold up our work on this \nbill.\n  We all know that this is just politics because the House will ``blue \nslip'' the bill.\n  This is certainly the wrong time to make things worse for tobacco \nfarmers--the real effect of this amendment. This is a misguided attempt \nto tax small farmers to pay for the Clinton Administration's new \nspending proposals.\n  Mr. President, like farmers everywhere, tobacco farmers are hurting. \nThe southeast is dry. We don't know how much tobacco the companies will \nbuy. We shouldn't be passing any amendments that make their lives any \ntougher. This will do just that.\n  So, the tobacco farmer is about to get hit--again. Like he has been \nthroughout this tobacco debate, the farmer is forgotten.\n  The farmer will get hit with lower prices for his tobacco as the \ncompanies try to hold the line on costs.\n  What happened to all the talk about helping farmers, the demands for \naction?\n  Instead, this amendment proposes to throw up another hurdle in their \nway, another obstacle to making the payments, in order to fund \nPresident Clinton's new spending.\n  The companies will take this tax out of the price paid to the farmer. \nThis will cost some farmers their farms. Like a lot of farmers, they \nare on the edge, and we certainly shouldn't pass legislation to make it \nworse.\n  American tobacco is the most expensive in the world, and the tobacco \ncompanies may respond to higher costs with increased use of imported \ntobacco.\n  Let me say it again: the tobacco farmer can't afford another drop in \nincome. His production quota keeps dropping, but the loan balances keep \ngrowing.\n  This amendment is an attempt to score political points. Let's not \nplay political games at the expense of good public policy.\n  Further, this amendment initiates a tax measure in the Senate. The \nfederal budget is 1.6 trillion dollars, but this amendment would raise \ntaxes, yet again, on small farmers to pay for more bureaucrats.\n  It's wasteful and unconstitutional.\n  Tax and spend. Tax and spend.\n  I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of \nthe agriculture appropriations subcommittee for their work.\n  This is a critical bill for my State and includes a number of \nimportant provisions for my farmers. I am reluctant to interfere with \nit, but if this amendments passes, I will be forced to do so on behalf \nof those very farmers.\n  I will personally call the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee \nand alert him to ``blue slip'' this bill.\n  This amendment is anti-farmer, Mr. President. We just passed a Sense \nof the Senate resolution declaring our intent to help farmers. We just \nadded an amendment for disaster assistance that will aid farmers in my \nState.\n  How we can turn around and pass an anti-farmer amendment like this \ntoday? It's not right, Mr. President.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Harkin amendment, \nwhich fully funds the Food and Drug Administration's youth anti-smoking \ninitiative at $134 million.\n  These FDA rules were upheld by a Federal court in Greensboro, North \nCarolina last year. They prohibit the sale of tobacco to minors, and \nrequire retailers to check the photo identification of consumers who \npurchase tobacco products if they look 27 years old or younger. Of the \n$134 million which President Clinton requested in his FY1999 budget, \n$75 million will go to the States for enforcement, and $35 million will \ngo for education and outreach to retailers to ensure compliance with \nthese regulations.\n  The pending bill provides only $34 million for this important \ninitiative--$100 million less than President Clinton requested. The \nfunding level in this bill is clearly inadequate. States will be able \nto check only 20% of tobacco retailers to ensure that they are not \nillegally selling tobacco products to minors. The additional $100 \nmillion in the Harkin amendment will increase that coverage to 60% of \nretailers.\n  By establishing a minimum age to purchase tobacco products, and by \nrequiring photo ID checks of young buyers, this initiative can make a \nsignificant difference in reducing youth smoking. Teenage tobacco use \nin the United States has clearly reached epidemic proportions. \nAccording to a report in April by the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, smoking by high school students rose by nearly a third \nbetween 1991 and 1997. Among African-Americans, smoking has soared by \n80%. More than 36% of all high school students smoke--a 19-year high.\n  Once people are hooked on cigarette smoking as children, it is very \ndifficult for them to quit as adults. Ninety percent of current adult \nsmokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. In other \nwords, if people reach age 18 without having smoked, they are unlikely \nto begin smoking as adults.\n  Even more disturbing is that teenagers under-estimate the \naddictiveness of nicotine. Studies have found that 86% of teenagers who \nsmoke daily and try to quit smoking are unsuccessful.\n  Big Tobacco has known this fact for years. The tobacco companies are \nfully aware that if they do not persuade children to take up smoking, \nthe industry will collapse in the next generation. That's why the \nindustry has targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising \nand promotional giveaways. They promise popularity, maturity,\n\n[[Page S8321]]\n\nand success for those who take up smoking.\n  Evidence from the tobacco industry's own files indicates their \nblatant and cynical marketing to kids. A 1975 Philip Morris report by \nresearcher Myron Johnston described how Marlboro became the most \npopular cigarette brand among young smokers. According to Mr. Johnston:\n\n       Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been \n     attributable in large part to our high market penetration \n     among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old. . . . My own \n     data, which includes younger teenagers, shows even higher \n     Marlboro market penetration among 15 to 17 year olds. . . . \n     The teenage years are also important because those are the \n     years during which most smokers begin to smoke, the years in \n     which initial brand selections are made, and the period in \n     the life-cycle in which conformity to peer group norm is \n     greatest.\n\n  An R.J. Reynolds memo written before the introduction of the Joe \nCamel marketing campaign emphasized that ``younger adult smokers are \ncritical to R.J. Reynolds' long-term profitability. Therefore, RJR must \nmake a substantial long-term commitment of manpower and money dedicated \nto younger adult smoking programs.''\n  It's no coincidence that shortly after R.J. Reynolds launched its Joe \nCamel campaign in 1988, Camel's share of the youth market skyrocketed \nfrom less than 1% to 33% in the 1990s.\n  An undated Lorrilard memo stated boldly what we have known all along \nabout Big Tobacco, that ``the base of our business are high school \nstudents.''\n  Because the tobacco companies have cynically marketed their deadly \nproducts to children, it is essential for the Senate to take strong \naction to prevent cigarettes from getting into the hands of children. \nChildren and adolescents have little trouble purchasing tobacco \nproducts directly from retailers today. Studies have found that nearly \n70% of the time that children and adolescents attempt to buy cigarettes \nfrom retailers, they succeed. If these youngsters have any problem at \nthe counter, they go to a vending machine, where they can successfully \npurchase cigarettes 90% of the time.\n  According to Professor Joseph DiFranza of the University of \nMassachusetts Medical Center, ``If $1 billion in illegal sales were \nspread out evenly over an estimated one million tobacco retailers \nnationwide, it would indicate that the average tobacco retailer breaks \nthe law about 500 times a year.''\n  The Harkin amendment will prevent thousands of children from lighting \nup their first cigarette. It is a reasonable step to prevent youth \nsmoking that has the strong support of the American public. I urge the \nSenate to approve it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, first, we should not be legislating on \nappropriations bills. We are getting to a point that we cannot pass \nappropriations bills for all the legislation that is on the \nappropriations bills, especial something of this magnitude.\n  I understand how easy it is to talk emotionally about children, but \nthere are two things wrong with this amendment. One, it is not \nrelevant, because under the unanimous consent agreement that these \nwould be relevant amendments, this is not. So you have a point there. \nSecond, there is a budget point of order that will be made against the \namendment, and therefore we should go ahead and, I guess, get rid of \nit.\n  But this is just nibbling again. The bill I wanted to try to get \nthrough here did not go. I wanted to take care of my farmers a little \nbit, but no one seems to think about those. It makes it a little bit \nhard to take. But the amendment invites us to reopen the tobacco \ndebate, and I do not think this is the time or the place. What is next, \nliability limitations? That would be quite a debate. What next, tax \nincreases? That would be a real debate. What next, new programs? That \nis what we have here, new programs.\n  We began debating this bill on June 18, 4 weeks ago. It is time we \nstopped considering legislative amendments that go way beyond the scope \nof this bill.\n  I received, and I guess all my Democratic colleagues received:\n  Support Harkin amendment to fund FDA's ongoing teen antitobacco \ninitiative. This is no anti-teen-smoking initiative, when you get right \ndown to it. The amendment fully funds the FDA youth and anti-tobacco \nefforts by imposing a tobacco industry user's fee of $100 million, or \napproximately $25 per child who uses tobacco products. How do you know \nthat? It is really not $100 million. The amendment says $150 million. \nAre we into that phrase now, ``a haircut''--you have to raise $150 \nmillion to get $100 million? Anyhow, the information I got was it was \n$100 million. I read the amendment and it says $150 million.\n  This is a tax on adults. This is a tax on adults. It says the tobacco \nproduct market share. It has nothing to do with how many teens smoke. \nWe hear about ``spit tobacco.'' The HHS set a level, by the year 2000, \nof no more than 4 percent of those between 12 and 17 would be using \nspit tobacco. The rate today is 1.9. The industry is doing a wonderful \njob--twice the amount that was set by HHS by the year 2000, without any \nimposition by this legislative body. So now we are putting a tax on \nadult smokers, trying to fog it up with teen programs.\n  Mr. President, I understand what is going on. This is a new tax being \ndescribed as a $25-per-kid tax without any basis. It started out with a \nsurvey. That is a terrible way to tax. It has nothing to do with youth \nsmoking or how many youth are smoking. This is a $150-million tax \nincrease as assessed based on the share of the adult market--not \nteenagers, the adult market. It was based on the adult use of the \nproduct and taxes adult use of the product. It should not be on an \nagricultural bill.\n  The amendment raises taxes, not by $100 million that we have heard, \nbut $150 million. It is based on a terrible public policy. We should \nnot be raising taxes on an agriculture appropriations bill anyhow. This \namendment should be defeated, maybe not for its purpose, but for its \nprocedure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the arguments made by my \nfriend and colleague from Kentucky. I want to try to clear it up, if I \ncan, and say to my colleague from Kentucky that we do not reopen the \ntobacco program. This has nothing to do--or tobacco debate.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I did not say anything about the tobacco \nprogram.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry, I misspoke. The Senator said something that \nit is going to reopen the tobacco debate.\n  Mr. FORD. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This doesn't do it.\n  Mr. FORD. You are already doing that. You are in the tobacco \nindustry. You are attacking the tobacco industry, and it is all about \ntobacco.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. FORD. You have the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will get into a discussion with the Senator on this \nbecause this amendment--it kind of all wraps up because the Senator \nfrom Kentucky also said this shouldn't be on an ag appropriations bill. \nHe also said we should not have a new program. This is not a new \nprogram, it is an ongoing program. It is funded under agricultural \nappropriations because we fund the FDA. That is exactly where we fund \nthe FDA.\n  This amendment doesn't start anything new. It takes an existing \nprogram at the FDA and expends the money. That is what an \nappropriations bill does. We are not legislating on an appropriations \nbill. There is no legislation here, I say to my friend from Kentucky. \nWe are only increasing the money.\n  Mr. FORD. You are legislating a tax, and it isn't limited to 1 year, \nit is ongoing.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I respond again to the Senator from Kentucky that there \nare other assessments and user fees in this bill. So why should the \ntobacco companies be exempt from an assessment? There are, I point out, \na number of other assessments on industry in this ag appropriations \nbill. So this is nothing new and startling.\n  Again, we are not reopening the tobacco debate. This amendment was \noffered last summer, last September, and was voted on, and it carried \nby a vote of 70 to 28.\n  That amendment raised $34 million. What is different between that \namendment and this amendment is, this amendment raises an additional \n$100\n\n[[Page S8322]]\n\nmillion. I know what the Senator is going to say about the 150. I want \nto explain that.\n  Mr. FORD. I know about the haircut, but in the amendment it is $150 \nmillion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And I will explain why that is.\n  Mr. FORD. It is still $150 million out of the taxpayer's pocket.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The reason it is is because if we put an assessment, I \nsay to the Senator from Kentucky--if we put an assessment on the \ntobacco companies to pay into this, that assessment they can deduct \nfrom their taxes. They deduct it from their taxes. And so in order to \nscore it to get the $100 million that we need to fully fund the FDA \nyouth ID check, we have to assess the $150 million because they get to \nwrite that off on their taxes. To get to $150 million, we have to do \nthe $100 million assessment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield just for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I sure will yield for a question.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am trying to get some idea as to where we are on time so \nwe can notify Members when we can expect a vote. Is the Senator going \nto need more time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. No, I don't need more time. I am going to finish this up.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will take 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't need any more time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--I am \nbeginning to see the natives circling around here. We hoped we could \nhave finished this bill at 4 o'clock this afternoon. I urge my \ncolleagues, we know the issue. There is going to be a point of order \nmade, and I hope that point of order will proceed. We need to conclude \nthis bill. We have other work.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield for a question without losing \nmy right to the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask the leader, this side would like to have a couple \nminutes to respond. I have a possible suggestion of having the vote at \n7 o'clock and dividing the time equally.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that we have 15 \nminutes remaining on this issue, equally divided--half and half--and we \nhave the vote on the point of order at 7 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time I consume \nright now.\n  This is not a new program, it is ongoing. We are not opening any \ndebates. We had an amendment last fall for $34 million. This adds $100 \nmillion more on it. We had to for the scoring. They get $150 million \nand they can deduct it from their taxes. The reason it is on ag \nappropriations is that it should be here because it has to do with FDA; \nit is funding and it is money. That is what an appropriations bill is \nall about. We are not legislating on an appropriations bill.\n  Again, 70 Senators last September voted for this amendment. Seventy \nSenators on both sides of the aisle voted for $34 million. This bumps \nit up to $100 million to fully fund the youth ID check nationwide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. We have \ndebated this issue before, but I will make a couple comments because \nmaybe some of my colleagues are not aware of what this amendment has.\n  This amendment has $150 million of a new tax, and unlike any other \ntax that we passed that I am aware of, this allows the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to conduct a survey. And from that survey, \nshe is going to raise--she being Secretary Shalala at this point--is \ngoing to raise $150 million.\n  I find that incredible. If the Senator wants to raise the cigarette \ntax, raise the cigarette tax; say we are going to have an excise of so \nmany cents per pack, and that is fine, that is legitimate. But to say \nwe are going to have a survey that basically is going to be deemed to \nbe accurate and give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the \npower and authority to raise that tax is absurd. It is terrible tax \npolicy.\n  Then it is to enforce, what? The FDA regs. The FDA regs, some people \nare acting like they are sacrosanct, like they are good. FDA regs \ndealing with ID check, which I heard my colleague bragging about, have \nthe Federal Government involved in enforcing ID checks up to age 27.\n  It is illegal to smoke up to age 18, but we are going to have the \nFederal Government setting up an enforcement mechanism to find out if \npeople 26 years old are buying cigarettes. And if they don't check an \nID--if you have a convenience store or something and you don't ask what \ntheir age is when they are 26 years old, you are in violation of the \nregulation, and you can be fined up to $10,000. That is the FDA reg \nthat he is wanting to give FDA more power to enforce.\n  Do we really want to give the Federal Government enforcement powers \nto be checking the IDs of young adults up to age 26, and if you do not \ncomply, you can be fined up to $10,000? I think that is absurd. Equally \nas bad is to give the Secretary of Health and Human Services taxing \nauthority, to be able to raise $150 million.\n  I think they are two of the worst pieces of policy I have seen. We \nhave debated tobacco at length. I am willing to do some things to \ndiscourage tobacco consumption. All this would do would be to encourage \nbureaucracy at FDA. I urge my colleagues to support the point of order \nby the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, have I been yielded time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes left.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Four.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 4 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Iowa and commend him for raising this issue \nand for presenting a way--that has been thus far deterred from becoming \nlaw--of reducing teen smoking. That is the mission here. We have \nalready seen the leadership kill the comprehensive tobacco bill. So in \nthe wake of the tobacco bill's death, the only existing nationwide \nprogram to reduce the teen smoking of cigarettes is an FDA rule. The \nFDA program needs this additional funding.\n  We went through extensive debate. I do not know whether the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma is still on the floor, but he voted for this when we \nconsidered it before. Those who oppose this funding once again stand to \nsay no to protecting our kids, to trying to reduce teenage smoking. \nThey are standing directly or inadvertently with the tobacco industry.\n  Mr. President, the FDA rule prohibits--nationwide--the sale of \ntobacco products to anyone under the age of 18. Without sufficient \nenforcement money, the rule is unnecessary because it will lack the \nteeth to force retailers to comply.\n  Friends of big tobacco have already blocked our attempt to pass a \ncomprehensive effort to reduce teen smoking, and now what we will see \nis tobacco's influence once again prevailing here. They are going to be \nable to thwart our existing efforts to control teenage smoking.\n  What is their mission? Their mission is to get 3,000 kids every day \nto buy a pack of butts that is going to ruin their health in not too \nmany years. So the money that we approve today is a bargain compared to \nwhat we will be forced to spend in later years in treating smoking-\nrelated illnesses.\n  Mr. President, this is a fairly simple issue. If we adhere to what we \nsay is our code of conduct--and that is to reduce teen smoking--then \nthe rest of this debate is superfluous, I must tell you. Yes, we ought \nto try to find a way\n\n[[Page S8323]]\n\nto pay for it that is as directly connected to the FDA rule as \npossible. That is what we have attempted to do here.\n  But whether or not you are supporting this amendment has little to do \nwith the funding issue; it has to do with whether or not we really \nbelieve that stopping teen smoking is a good objective. I hope that we \nwill see that in a vote that is soon to come, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes 39 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield myself 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is the second amendment we have had \ntoday on this bill that has, in essence, raised tobacco taxes and spent \nthe money. I want our colleagues to understand that both parties can \nplay this game. If we are going to continue, by bits and pieces, to \nraise tobacco taxes and spend the money, we are going to raise tobacco \ntaxes and give the money back to the working men and women of America \nby cutting their taxes.\n  I think we are making an absolute sham out of the appropriations \nprocess. I think we need to stop this kind of business. I am confident \nwe are going to sustain the point of order against this amendment. But \nI want to put people on record, if we are going to continue to raise \ntobacco taxes and spend the money, then I am going to move--and I am \nsure others will join in that effort--to take that same money and cut \ntaxes for the working men and women of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 57 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand some point of order is going \nto be raised, I assume by the Budget chairman, I suppose, on this; and \nthen we will have a vote to override the Budget Act. But don't get \ncaught up in all of that. That is not what it is about. What it is \nabout is whether this Senate wants to effectively fund an ongoing \nprogram to enforce the rules that keep kids from illegally buying \ncigarettes. That is all it is.\n\n  We voted on this last September. Seventy Senators voted for it--$34 \nmillion. We are bumping it up to $100 million, that is right. Where are \nwe getting it from? The tobacco companies. Yes, it is an assessment. \nBut they do not have to pass it on. They do not have to have it as a \ntax or whatever. But they have to pay it based upon their market share.\n  So don't get all caught up in whether this is going to be a tax on \ntobacco companies or this budget point of order. That is nonsense. This \nis a vote on whether or not we will fund the FDA's program to \neffectively cut down on teenage smoking in this country. That is all it \nis. And it pays for it by getting an assessment from the tobacco \ncompanies based upon their market share.\n  Tobacco companies would have to put in $150 million, of which they \nget a tax deduction, so we get the $100 million to fund it. That is a \ndrop in the bucket to what the tobacco companies make every year. \nSurely--surely--this Senate can go on record as sticking up for the \nkids and making sure we have the money to adequately enforce the FDA \nrule so our kids do not become addicted to cigarettes. That is all this \nissue is--no more, no less; plain and simple. Which side are you going \nto be on when we cast this vote on a so-called budget point of order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am for the kids, but I am also for \npassing an appropriations bill that helps all the farmers in the United \nStates and puts into play the entire agricultural program of this \ncountry.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, the other day I came to the floor and talked \nabout, how much longer are we going to spend debating the cigarette tax \nand various expenditures under that program? I made a mistake, I told \nthe listeners that we had 2 weeks. We had 4 weeks to debate these \nissues. Now we are scheduled to pass appropriations bills that will \nkeep our Government running and more and more, for some reason, we \nleave it to everybody here to speculate--the other side continues to \noffer amendments, be it on the tobacco issue or some other program that \nhas nothing to do with the appropriations process, that delays it and \nthen puts in motion things that actually put the bill in jeopardy.\n  The Senator just spoke and said this was not a budget issue. Let me \ntell you, it is a budget issue. It is a budget issue to the tune of \n$100 million being added to the expenditure side of a balanced budget \n5-year plan, because under the Budget Act you cannot count taxes \nagainst expenditures like this. So we are breaking the budget to the \ntune of $100 million--$100 million.\n  It seems to this Senator we ought not to be doing that when we just \ngot a 5-year agreement in place. And so it is subject to a point of \norder. The Senator can say it is technical. I say it is real.\n  In addition, I say this approach of imposing taxes--and this is a tax \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office--should not be taking \nplace on appropriations bills that are already late. Mark my word, the \nPresident of the United States will be giving the Republican \nleadership--he will be saying to them, ``You can't get your work done. \nYou didn't get the appropriations done.''\n  Let me tell you, this violates the spending caps that we agreed to--\nplain and simple. I do not believe we ought to do that on this bill \nwhen that chairman spent weeks and weeks in his committee trying to not \nbreak the caps. We come along with an amendment, and it sounds nice, \nsounds kind of sexy politically, but essentially it is reopening the \ndebate that we had for 4 solid weeks here on the Senate floor.\n  Now, for all the reasons I stated, but more important, because the \nBudget Act so provides, I make a point of order against the pending \namendment under section 302(f) of the Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. President, let me say, I believe the Senate ought to stand up and \nsay we are not going to break the budget here. We are going to stand on \nthis point of order of substance and deny the efficacy of this \namendment because it can't sustain the 60 votes required.\n  I make the point of order and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Motion to waive Budget Act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to waive the Budget Act and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive Budget Act. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 208 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Glenn\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is sustained \nand the amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was rejected.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to an issue \nthat is very important to our livestock producers and small \nmeatpackers. I know that my colleagues are aware of the difficulties \nthe livestock industry has faced in recent years. In an effort to find \nsolutions for small farmers and livestock producers, the Secretary of \nAgriculture called three separate commissions: The Advisory Committee \non Agricultural Concentration, the National Commission on Small Farms, \nand the National Advisory Committee on Meat and Poultry Inspection. \nEach of these commissions has recommended that the ban restricting the \ninterstate distribution of state-inspected meat be lifted. For that \nreason I have introduced, along with Senators Feingold, Thomas, \nBrownback, Landrieu, Burns, Enzi, and Roberts, S. 1291, The Interstate \nDistribution of State-inspected Meat Act. This proposal would lift the \nban on interstate distribution of state-inspected beef, pork, and \npoultry, which are the only products in the United States that face \nsuch a restriction. This measure is endorsemed by the Farm Bureau, the \nFarmers Union, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the \nAmerican Sheep Industry Association. This issue is one of both fairness \nand common sense, and I believe it merits consideration by the Senate.\n  I'd like to ask the distinguished Chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee if he would hold hearings in the Agriculture Committee on \nthis proposal sometime in the near future, so we could promptly \nconsider the measure next year.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I would like to say to my good friend from Utah that I am \naware that this issue has arisen in the past and that it is an \nimportant one. I agree with Senator Hatch that the measure deserves a \nhearing in the near future, and I would be happy to work with him to \nthat end.\n  Mr. HATCH. I appreciate the willingness of the Chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee to give this legislation a hearing, and I believe \nit will make for an interesting one. I look forward to working with the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana and the Agriculture Committee on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah and the \nChairman of the Agriculture Committee for working this out. I believe \nthe best procedure for addressing this issue would be through the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. The $57.2 \nbillion in new budget authority that this bill proposes will benefit \nmillions of Americans, both urban and rural. In addition to funding \nfood and nutrition programs such as Food Stamps, WIC, and the school \nlunch program, the bill funds almost $1.7 billion worth of badly needed \nagricultural research and extension programs to improve the \nproductivity of our farmers as well as the nutritional value of our \nfood supply. It allocates $1 billion for farm assistance programs such \nas farm ownership and operating loans. It helps restore and protect our \nfarmlands and watersheds by designating $792 million for conservation \nprograms. It ensures the safety of our nation's food and medicine by \nallocating $952 million to the Food and Drug Administration. Finally, \nby providing $2.1 billion for rural development programs, the bill \naddresses one of my long-standing priorities--implementing and \nmaintaining basic community infrastructure. This bill will bring water \nand sewer systems to 840 small rural communities. It will allow almost \n62,000 of rural America's working families to purchase homes, and, by \nproviding funding for the construction or rehabilitation of 6,900 \nrental units, this budget addresses the desperate need for affordable \nhousing in America's heartland.\n  For my own state of West Virginia, this bill provides an increase of \n$1,250,000 for research on Cool and Cold Water Aquaculture at Leetown, \nWest Virginia which includes $1,000,000 to initiate trout genome \nresearch. The bill also provides an increase of $300,000 for the \nAppalachian Fruit Research Station at Kearneysville, West Virginia to \nimprove profitability of this important part of the West Virginia farm \nsector.\n  In addition to these and other research programs important to my \nstate, this bill also includes a number of important conservation \nmeasures. Among these include assistance for the Knapps Creek watershed \nproject, flood control in the Tygart River and Upper Tygart Valley \nwatershed, continuation of the important Potomac Headwaters project, \nfunding the grazing lands initiative in West Virginia, and many other \nprograms important for West Virginia farmers, rural communities, and \nprotection of our environment.\n  The chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee, \nSenators Cochran and Bumpers, are very knowledgeable of the many \ncompeting interests that require funding in this bill. They are to be \ncommended for their ability to craft a bill that meaningfully addresses \nthe challenges confronting our farmers, rural communities, and the Food \nand Drug Administration, given the budgetary constraints within which \nthey had to work. I applaud their efforts and that of their staff: \nGalen Fountain and Carole Geagley for the minority and Rebecca Davies, \nMartha Poindexter, and Rachelle Graves for majority.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with \nlanguage included in the House version of the agriculture \nappropriations bill that could have the effect of depriving rural \nworking poor families of perhaps the only source of information they \nhave on the federal Earned Income Tax Credit.\n  In my own state of Illinois, for tax year 1996, over 750,000 working \nfamilies received this critical tax relief. The EITC lifts \napproximately 4.6 million children out of poverty each year while \nencouraging work. The tax credit helps a substantial number of low-\nincome working households in rural areas. A 1996 information bulletin \npublished by the USDA Economic Research Service (No. 724-02) noted the \nimportance of the EITC for rural working families: ``The earned income \ntax credit (EITC) has become a major source of support for low-income \nrural workers and their families, especially in the South, where the \nrural poor are concentrated. Program benefits for rural areas are \nexpected to total about $6 billion in 1996 . . . providing benefits to \nan estimated 4.5 million low-income rural workers and their families.''\n  Unfortunately, report language included in the House's FY 1999 \nagriculture appropriations bill could deter and discourage important \neducational work done by CES offices. The language questions the \nappropriateness of CES involvement in informing families in their local \ncommunities about the EITC. This language could prompt many CES offices \nto discontinue their efforts to educate eligible workers about the tax \ncredit. If that occurs, substantial numbers of low-income working \nfamilies in rural areas could lose an important source of information \nabout federal tax relief for which they qualify.\n  In Illinois, Coop Extension Services offices in 22 counties or \ncommunities (many rural) have been working to alert eligible working \nfamilies to the EITC. The University of Illinois-Urbana Cooperative \nExtension Service provides programs to low-income working parents and \nstudents, including a teen parent welfare-to-work program in the high \nschools of East St. Louis. It published a notebook, ``The Easy Way to \nPrepare Your 1996 Individual Income Tax Return,'' for distribution to \nprogram participants. The notebook contains simplified tax return \ninstructions, including how to determine eligibility for the EITC and \ncalculate the amount of the credit. The program surveyed participants, \nand found that only a third of the participants had filed a tax return \npreviously, but 86 percent filed a return after their training. A third \nof the participants were found to be eligible for the EITC.\n  The House language is simply not acceptable and should be rejected by \nthe Senate conferees on the agriculture appropriations bill.\n\n\n                         Market Access Program\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about my\n\n[[Page S8325]]\n\namendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill that was adopted last \nnight by the Senate. This amendment requires the Secretary of \nAgriculture to make important information about the Market Access \nProgram (MAP) and its expenditures available to the Congress and to the \nGeneral Accounting Office (GAO).\n  It is no secret that I am no fan of this program, Mr. President. I \nwould have rather eliminated funding for the Market Access Program \ncompletely, as we attempted to do with an earlier amendment. \nUnfortunately, this wasteful program's corporate handouts survived, but \nthe reporting amendment adopted by the Senate will at least give \nauditors the tools they need to thoroughly investigate the impact of \nthis program.\n  As I pointed out earlier on the floor of the Senate, the claims that \nare continually used to justify MAP and extend its life have been \ncalled into question by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in a study \npublished last year. The report, which was requested by the Chairman of \nthe House Budget Committee, John Kasich, evaluated claims that MAP \nbenefits the U.S. economy, boosts the agriculture sector, and helps \ncounter competitor nations' agricultural export assistance programs.\n  The GAO could not find evidence to authenticate any of these claims.\n  In fact, the GAO assailed the lack of accountability within the \nMarket Access Program and the general lack of clear and complete data \navailable for their analysts.\n  With major questions left unanswered, the GAO has been unable to \nproduce an honest and useful evaluation of the program that could help \nCongress and program administrators choose policies that will provide \nthe most benefits to the United States.\n  In the conclusion to its report on the Market Access Program, GAO \nsuggested that ``Congress may wish to direct USDA to develop more \nsystematic information on the potential strategic value of U.S. export \nassistance programs.''\n  That is exactly what this amendment will do.\n  My amendment requires the Secretary of Agriculture, in consultation \nwith the Comptroller General of the United States, to submit a report \nthat analyzes the costs and benefits of the program in compliance with \nOMB guidelines and treats resources as fully deployed, two of the GAO's \nmain criticisms of earlier program analyses for MAP and other export \nassistance programs.\n  The amendment would require the USDA to estimate the impact on the \nagriculture sector as well as on U.S. consumers, while also considering \nthe costs and benefits of alternative uses of the funds currently \nallocated to MAP.\n  Another requirement calls for an analysis of increases in exports, \ncontrolling for outside influences, such as exchange rates and \ninternational market conditions, that can have a great influence on \ninternational trade.\n  Finally, the Department is required to evaluate the sustainability of \npromotion efforts in the absence of government subsidies, an important \nquestion that has not been asked throughout the life of these programs.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would have liked to eliminate the funding for \nMAP altogether and turn to other, proven programs to increase the \nstrength of our agriculture sector, but this amendment moves in the \nright direction by opening up the inner workings of MAP and making this \nprogram more accountable.\n  I am hopeful that using these recommendations to gather additional \nuseful information in a report to Congress will finally establish what \nbenefits can truly be attributed to MAP and will help us make informed \ndecisions about this program.\n\n\n                         The Meat Labeling Act\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the Senate has \naccepted the Meat Labeling Act of 1998 as an amendment to S. 2159, the \nAgricultural Appropriations Bill of 1998 which provides appropriations \nfor FY 1999 for the United States Department of Agriculture, the Food \nand Drug Administration, and other related agencies.\n  As we all know, we can easily determine which country manufactured \nthe automobiles we drive through country of origin labeling. We can \neasily tell where our clothing was made by simply looking at the label \nor tag on our shirts or trousers. And also, we can easily determine \nwhere our computers, stereos, and telephones were made by simply \nlooking at the products' label. But, surprisingly, when we go to the \ngrocery store to purchase meat products for our families to eat, we \nhave no idea where that meat originated.\n  Throughout my service in the United States Congress, I have been a \nstrong believer in country of origin labeling for products--whether it \nbe for automobiles, clothing, technological, or food products. I have \nbeen an especially strong supporter of country of origin labeling for \nmeat products because of its common-sense nature, its benefits to \nranchers, farmers, and consumers, its strong bipartisan and \nagricultural group support, its cost-free benefit to taxpayers as \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and its trade friendly \nprovisions.\n  After many years of effort to pass meat labeling legislation, we have \nfinally succeeded. I would like to thank Senator Craig for his strong \nsupport and willingness to work with me, as well as Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member \nBumpers.\n  In April of 1997, I introduced, along with Senators Craig, Daschle, \nBurns, and Baucus S. 617, the Meat Labeling Act of 1997, which would \nrequire that beef and lamb products be labeled for country of origin so \nconsumers can make the choice to buy meat produced from livestock \nraised on American ranches and farms.\n  Since my introduction of S. 617, the Meat Labeling Act of 1997, \nreceived the strong bipartisan support of 16 of my colleagues--8 \nDemocrats and 8 Republicans. Also, it has enjoyed the enthusiastic \nsupport of every major agricultural organization including the National \nFarmers Union, the American Farm Bureau, the National Cattlemens Beef \nAssociation, and the American Sheep Institute.\n  The amendment that has been accepted by the Senate, the Meat Labeling \nAct of 1998, has the same country of origin labeling spirit in mind but \nhas been modified slightly from S. 617. My amendment requires beef and \nlamb meat products to be labeled as imported and allows for voluntary \nlabeling of those beef and lamb products for their country of origin.\n  The Meat Labeling Act of 1998 is designed in the following way. My \namendment requires beef and lamb meat products to be labeled as \nimported beef or imported lamb, and it permits imported beef and lamb \nto bear a label identifying the country-of-origin. US beef and lamb \nwould also bear labels of designation. Finally, beef and lamb products \nblended with beef or lamb from the US and another country would bear a \nblended label.\n  Also, the Meat Labeling Act of 1998 creates a voluntary labeling \nstudy for ground beef or lamb. As you may know, ground beef (hamburger) \nand lamb are the remains of meat carcasses after they are utilized for \nthe prime cuts. My legislation recognizes the difficulties in \ndetermining the exact country of origin status of the ground beef or \nlamb and therefore, does not mandate it to be labeled for country of \norigin immediately.\n  Instead, my legislation is designed to allow a study of the impact \nand costs to producers, processors, and consumers of labels for ground \nbeef or lamb. After one year of voluntary labeling, the United States \nSecretary of Agriculture will then take six months to determine the \ncosts, benefits, and impacts of voluntary labeling and if the Secretary \ndeems it to be cost effective and beneficial to all involved then the \nlabeling of ground beef and lamb will become effective.\n  As we all know, America's ranchers and farmers are very proud of the \nfine beef and lamb products they produce. This legislation reflects \nthat pride our ranchers and farmers have in their products. In fact, \nranchers and farmers throughout South Dakota tell me over and over that \nwhen America's consumers have a choice between US beef or imported \nbeef, consumers will chose US beef because of its quality and its \nnutritional value.\n  The benefits to consumers are many. First of all, consumers have the \nright to know where their food is produced because of prices, quality, \ntaste, safety, etc. If passed, this legislation will finally permit the \ncompetitive free market to determine the demand and price of beef and \nlamb meat products through consumer choice.\n\n[[Page S8326]]\n\n  Also, a national survey in December 1995 found 74 percent of \nconsumers favored labeling; 51 percent would buy American produce, even \nif it cost more than imports of equal quality and appearance. \nFurthermore, an April 1997 survey conducted in Florida showed that 96 \npercent consumers surveyed strongly agreed that food products should \nhave a country of origin.\n  Clearly, this evidence shows that American consumers want country of \norigin labeling for the food they eat.\n  Labeling is affordable. Preliminary estimates from USDA show that \nlabeling meat may cost an estimated 20 CENTS per customer per year.\n  This legislation is consistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade (GATT.) Most of our major trading partners, including Canada, \nJapan, Australia and the EU, require country of origin labeling for \nproduce and meat products. This legislation simply levels the playing \nfield for our producers and consumers.\n  Clearly, the Meat Labeling Act of 1998 is broadly supported by \nAmerican producers and consumers. It enjoys strong bipartisan support \nin Congress, is endorsed by every major agricultural organization, \nincurs zero costs to taxpayers, and benefits consumers in numerous \nways.\n  I would like share from you part of a recent letter I received from \nthe major agricultural organization supporting my legislation:\n  ``Consumers demand quality and consistency, and producers are \ncontinually working to meet consumer demands. With the current system, \nthere is limited ability to identify the source of product that does \nnot meet consumer demands. Import labeling will help differentiate \nproducts in the retail meat case and increase competition among product \nlines. With labeling, consumers will have the ability to make informed \ndecisions when purchasing meat and meat products an the relative value \nof meat from different product lines will be determined through \ncompetitive forces in the marketplace.''\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the following documents be \nprinted in the Record: A letter addressed to me from the National \nFarmers Union, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, and the American Sheep Industry \nAssociation, a July 15, 1998, letter from the National Consumers League \nthe largest and oldest consumer organization in the United States, and \na September 16, 1997 editorial from the Sioux Falls Argus Leader.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     July 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: The following organizations urge you \n     to join the bi-partisan co-sponsorship and support for the \n     ``Meat Labeling Act of 1998,'' to be substituted for the \n     original S. 617 language and offered as an amendment to the \n     Senate agricultural appropriation bill.\n       Industry leaders from each organization testified before \n     the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \n     to urge support for legislation to require labeling of \n     imported meat. The ``Meat Labeling Act of 1998'' will address \n     frustrations among U.S. producers who question why livestock \n     imported into the U.S. for immediate slaughter are allowed to \n     be marketed as U.S. product. In short, the bill will ensure \n     truth in labeling. The legislation does not establish trade \n     barriers to limit the ability of countries to export meat to \n     the U.S. and does not violate U.S. obligations under \n     provisions of international trade agreements. It is our \n     understanding that the proposed legislation is consistent \n     with U.S. responsibilities and commitments to the GATT and \n     NAFTA.\n       During 1997, beef imports were equal to about 9 percent of \n     total U.S. beef production. Most of this imported beef was \n     blended into ground beef or processed beef products or sold \n     at the retail meat case as U.S. product. In addition to beef \n     imports, nearly 1.1 million live cattle were imported from \n     Canada directly to U.S. packing plants during 1997. Although \n     all of the value-added production took place in Canada, once \n     these cattle were processed in U.S. packing plants they \n     effectively became U.S. beef. Imported lamb on a volume basis \n     has increased from just over 7 percent of the U.S. lamb \n     supply in 1993, to 20 percent in 1997. During the first \n     quarter of 1998, lamb imports reached 25 percent and when \n     computed on a carcass equivalent basis made up approximately \n     one-third of the total lamb supply in the U.S.\n       Consumers demand quality and consistency, and producers are \n     continually working to meet consumer demands. With the \n     current system, there is limited ability to identify the \n     source of product that does not meet consumer demands. Import \n     labeling will help differentiate products in the retail meat \n     case and increase competition among product lines. With \n     labeling, consumers will have the ability to make informed \n     decisions when purchasing meat and meat products and the \n     relative value of meat from different product lines will be \n     determined through competitive forces in the marketplace.\n       The following organizations greatly appreciate your \n     leadership in this effort. We look forward to working with \n     you to enact this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Farm Bureau Federation.\n     American Sheep Industry Association.\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association.\n     National Farmers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    National Consumers League,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: The National Consumers League, the \n     nation's oldest nonprofit, consumer advocacy organization, \n     supports the requirement to label imported meat and meat food \n     products. As consumption and reliance on imported meat \n     increases, it is vital that consumers are afforded the utmost \n     levels of protection to prevent food-borne illness. One of \n     the most effective means to achieve this goal is through \n     consumer knowledge. Clear and accurate labeling of the \n     country of origin of meat is an important step to providing \n     consumers with such knowledge.\n       Labeling is a powerful tool to inform consumers about the \n     origins of the food they eat. While America's meat supply is \n     considered the safest in the world, a large portion of the \n     meat Americans consume is from other countries. By labeling \n     meat, consumers will have an informed choice and a right to \n     know the product's origin.\n       We thank you for providing strong leadership on this issue. \n     We look forward to working with you to continue to ensure \n     that American consumers enjoy the safest possible food \n     supply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Brett Kay,\n     Program Associate, Health Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Sioux Falls Argus Leader, Sept. 16, 1997]\n\n              Consumers Have Right to Know Origin of Meat\n\n       Many U.S. consumers assume the meat they purchase at the \n     grocery store is produced by American farmers, but that's not \n     necessarily so.\n       Imported meat inspected abroad under standards set by the \n     U.S. Department of Agriculture goes on the shelves unlabeled \n     with reference to the country of origin, just as U.S. meat \n     does.\n       Consumers have a right to know where the meat they buy \n     comes from. Just about every other item in stores is so \n     labeled.\n       A bill introduced by U.S. Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D., would \n     require country-of-origin labeling of meat at retail outlets.\n       Lawmakers may be hesitant to pass the law for fear of \n     drawing ire from trading partners that might suffer from \n     xenophobic consumers. They should consider the history of \n     other imported products. Labeling certainly hasn't hurt the \n     market for Japanese cars, French perfume or apples from New \n     Zealand.\n       The recent recall of 25 million pounds of suspect ground \n     meat by a Hudson Foods plant in Columbus, Neb., shines a \n     glaring light on the importance of knowing sources of meat. \n     The E. coli contamination is thought to have originated at a \n     slaughterhouse--but where?\n       The uncertainty is unfair to producers and packers that run \n     tight ships, because consumers who can't determine the \n     origination of a problem will consider all sources a \n     possibility.\n       A meat-labeling law would best require wholesale buyers to \n     record the sources of meat they purchase by company name as \n     well as location.\n       Meaningful meat labeling would hold producers both in \n     foreign countries and in the United States accountable for \n     the quality and safety of their products.\n       Consumers, livestock producers and reputable packers should \n     all be clamoring for a law to identify the origin of meat.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of \nAgriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for fiscal year \n1999.\n  The Senate-reported bill provides $56.7 billion in new budget \nauthority (BA) and $40.8 billion in new outlays to fund most of the \nprograms of the Department of Agriculture and other related agencies. \nAll of the funding in this bill is nondefense spending. This \nSubcommittee received no allocation under the Crime Reduction Trust \nFund.\n  When outlays for prior-year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the Senate-reported bill totals $55.2 billion in BA \nand $47.5 billion in outlays for FY 1998. Including mandatory savings, \nthe Subcommittee is at its 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays.\n\n[[Page S8327]]\n\n  The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee 302(b) allocation \ntotals $55.2 billion in budget authority (BA) and $47.5 billion in \noutlays. Within this amount, $13.7 billion in BA and $14.1 billion in \noutlays is for nondefense discretionary spending.\n  For discretionary spending in the bill, and counting (scoring) all \nthe mandatory savings in the bill, the Senate-reported bill at the \nSubcommittee's 302(b) allocation in BA and outlays. It is $43 million \nin BA and $24 million in outlays above the President's budget request \nfor these programs.\n  I recognize the difficulty of bringing this bill to the floor at its \n302(b) allocation. I appreciate the Committee's support for a number of \nongoing projects and programs important to my home state of New Mexico \nas it has worked to keep this bill within its budget allocation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nSenate Budget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.

Mr. President, I raise the visibility of a little-known, \nbut praiseworthy, program--the Nutrition Education and Training \nProgram. I am speaking today in defense of this program, which now \nseems to be on life-support, and in dire need of resuscitation. For \nthose who are not aware, the Nutrition Education and Training Program, \nNET, is a direct grant-to-States program which provides the nutrition \neducation and food service training component of the Child Nutrition \nPrograms. Under NET, all funds are distributed to the States. States \nand local governments leverage these limited resources into effective \nand innovative education and training programs for children, food \nservice personnel, and parents. I know in my own State of Vermont, the \ncreativity and innovation of the NET staff has provided unique and \nvaluable nutrition materials that are relevant to thousands of \nVermonters. Over the past 20 years, NET has promoted an infrastructure \nand quality standards that support local schools in providing \nnutritious meals and improving the health and nutrition behavior of our \nNation's children. State and local NET coordinators have been \nresponsible for much of the local success of the nutrition education \neffort.\n  NET programs are intended to teach children about the nutritional \nvalue of foods and the relationship between food and health. The \nprogram is also intended to provide nutrition education for teachers \nand training in nutrition and food service management for school food \nservice personnel, and to facilitate development of classroom materials \nand curricula. This is done through a State Nutrition Education \nCoordinator who identifies the needs of the State--this is important--\nthe program is not one size fits all, full of restrictions and mandates \nfrom Washington, but rather a cooperative program that is tailored to \nState needs.\n  Sadly, I am here today to report on the dire funding status of NET. \nIn fiscal years 1997 and 1998, NET has struggled along at a level of \nonly $3.75 million--this is a far cry from the original program in \n1978-79 of $26.2 million--giving each State a level of 50 cents per \nchild. The fiscal year 1999 House appropriations bill funds NET at only \n$3.75 million and the Senate bill provides nothing--putting all funds \ninto Team Nutrition at $10 million. This low level of funding has \ndiminished NET's effectiveness and threatens its viability to provide \nnutrition education to the nearly $9 billion Child Nutrition Programs \nit supports.\n  A few years ago, as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I \nsupported a change in the law to provide NET with a guaranteed $10 \nmillion per year to provide important Nutrition Education activities. \nThis level is not a budget-busting amount, and is in fact the amount \nthe President requested in the fiscal year 1999 budget for this \nprogram. Unfortunately, in the rush toward welfare reform in 1996, \nNET's status as a mandatory program was rescinded, and the funding \nlevels for NET have been problematic ever since.\n  I urge when the Conference on the Agriculture appropriations bill \nconvenes that NET be provided adequate funding. The Child Nutrition \nPrograms are absolutely critical to our Nation's future. Along with \nthose benefits, we must give our children the chance to choose the \nright foods, to select a diet suited for them based on the facts and \nnot on the latest billion-dollar junk food advertising.\n\n\n                   Nutrition for the Elderly Program\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in order to engage the \nchairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nCochran in a brief colloquy regarding the need for increased funding \nfor the nutrition for the elderly program, contained in this bill. \nSenior nutrition programs are our best defense against elderly hunger \nand malnutrition. The House has provided $10 million more than the \nSenate for this program which helps our elderly, low-income seniors \nhave good, nutritious meals. This increased funding would restore funds \nfor both meals on wheels and meal sites by $10 million to $150 million \nto their FY96 levels.\n  The Senior nutrition program provides grants to states so that local \norganizations can prepare meals delivered to elderly persons in both \ncongregate settings or in their homes. Many poor seniors rely on these \nprograms as their primary source for nutrition. Unfortunately, 41% of \nMeals on\n\n[[Page S8328]]\n\nWheels programs have a waiting list. As the senior population grows, \nthese waiting lists will only increase without adequate funding both \nlocal and federal for home-delivered meals programs. The average \nbeneficiary for senior nutrition programs is 77 years old and 90% of \nbeneficiaries live on income below 200% of the poverty level. 40% live \non incomes below the poverty level. These poor seniors really need this \nprogram. I hope that the House level of funding will alleviate some of \nthese waiting lists.\n  Studies conducted at the University of Florida found that over 66% of \nbeneficiaries of senior nutrition programs are at moderate to high risk \nfor malnutrition. In addition, these senior nutrition programs not only \nmake good social policy sense, but they also make good fiscal policy \nsense. Every $1 spent on this nutrition program saves $3 in federal \nMedicare, Medicaid, and veterans' health care costs, since malnourished \npatients stay in the hospital nearly twice as long as well-nourished \nseniors, costing $2,000 to $10,000 more per stay. HHS Secretary Shalala \nhas called these elderly nutrition programs ``a bargain for the federal \ngovernment''.\n  This program also provides cash assistance to state agencies to help \nstore and donate food to low-income seniors.\n  Home-delivered meals programs highlight positive values through \nvolunteerism and community support. It is this type of cost-effective, \nfederal-local partnership that Congress should be encouraging. This \nlevel of funding is endorsed by the National Council of Senior \nCitizens, the Grey Panthers and the Meals on Wheels Association of \nAmerica.\n  4 million seniors live in poverty in this, the richest nation in the \nworld. Another 16 million live near the poverty level. Our seniors are \ngoing hungry because we cut funding for this seniors nutrition program \ntwo years ago. Now is the time to restore this funding to its FY96 \nlevels in conference.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the Senator from Illinois. As Senator Durbin \nknows, the committee has worked hard over the past several years to \nmaintain this very important program. I will work with my colleagues in \nconference to see that the House level of funding is available for \nseniors. With the greying of America, the need for this program has \nclearly increased and as the Senator from Illinois has stated, many of \nthese meals on wheels sites have long waiting lists. I thank the \nSenator from Illinois for bringing this issue to our attention.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to make an announcement here of \nhow we are going to proceed for the balance of the night.\n\n\n           Senator Sam Brownback Receives Golden Gavel Award\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to recognize the distinguished \nSenator that is the Presiding Officer at this time. He is another one \nof our Members that has reached that magic mark of 100 hours as \nPresiding Officer. Senator Brownback has done an outstanding job in \npresiding and handling the gavel. He has earned the Golden Gavel Award.\n  This is a tradition that started several years ago, and it helps make \nthis institution work as it should. And I would like to extend a sense \nof appreciation to Senator Brownback for his time as the Presiding \nOfficer.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Since the 1960's, the Senate has recognized those dedicated Members \nwho preside over the Senate for 100 hours with the Golden Gavel. This \naward continues to represent our appreciation for the time these \ndedicated senators contribute to presiding over the U.S. Senate--a very \nimportant duty.\n  Senator Brownback spent a significant amount of unscheduled time in \nthe chair during last night's votes and still insisted upon meeting his \npresiding duties today. For his ongoing commitment to presiding, we \nthank him and extend our congratulations on receiving the Golden Gavel \nAward.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators with \nregard to the schedule tonight, I understand the Senate will be voting \nvery shortly now on final passage of the agriculture appropriations \nbill. The managers have worked out the Dodd amendment, and we will be \nshortly ready to go to final passage.\n  Following that vote, the Senate would then resume consideration of \nthe HUD-VA appropriations bill. There is an amendment pending to that \nappropriations bill, which I understand may be withdrawn. But it is my \nhope and the intent of the managers--I was just talking to Senator Bond \nand Senator Mikulski--that we would get time agreements on amendments \nthat are pending, and finish all debate on all amendments tonight, and \nthen the votes that would be required would be in the morning at 9:30.\n  We would then go to the legislative appropriations bill during \nFriday's session.\n  So votes could be expected on Friday's session at 9:30 with one other \npossible vote.\n  I am hoping maybe that the legislative appropriations bill will not \nhave any complicating issues and that it could be handled by a voice \nvote, or with only one vote.\n  I would like to finish it all tonight. But the managers have a number \nof amendments they have to work through.\n  So what we would have, then, as we now see it, is final passage on \nagriculture, go to HUD-VA, and we have one issue that may be resolved, \nwhich would then not require a vote, and then we would go on to the \namendments.\n  So it is possible that after this next vote, the next recorded vote \nwill not be until 9:30 in the morning. We will do everything we can to \nnot go late tomorrow and certainly not later than 12 o'clock. But \ncooperation from Senators on both sides will allow us to actually \nfinish it up by 10 o'clock or 10:30 tomorrow.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This is the last vote?\n  Mr. LOTT. We have one other issue we have to get clarified. This \ncould be the last vote, but right now we could have one more right \nafter this one. And we will clarify that in the next few minutes and \nnotify all Senators.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Is there a unanimous consent pending?\n  Mr. LOTT. There is no unanimous consent request pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3192\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President we are now on the Dodd amendment. We had \nasked for the yeas and nays. We now have been able to work out that \namendment and agreed to take that amendment to conference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays be vitiated with that \nunderstanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3192, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a \nmodification of my amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3192), as modified, is as follows:\n       In the amendment strike all after the first word and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. NOTIFICATION OF RECALLS OF DRUGS AND DEVICES.\n\n       This section shall be referred to as ``Matthew's Law''.\n       (b) Drugs.--Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(o)(1) If the Secretary withdraws an application for a \n     drug under paragraph (1) or (2) of the first sentence of \n     subsection (e) and a class I recall for the drug results, the \n     Secretary shall take such action as the Secretary may \n     determine to be appropriate to ensure timely notification of \n     the recall to individuals that received the drug, including \n     using the assistance of health professionals that prescribed \n     or dispensed the drug to such individuals.\n       ``(2) In this subsection:\n       ``(A) The term `Class I' refers to the corresponding \n     designation given recalls in subpart A of part 7 of title 21, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor regulation.\n       ``(B) The term `recall' means a recall, as defined in \n     subpart A of part 7 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, \n     or a successor regulation, of a drug.''.\n       (c) Devices.--Section 518(e) of such Act (21 U.S.C. \n     360h(e)) is amended--\n       (1) in the last sentence of paragraph (2), by inserting \n     ``or if the recall is a class I recall,'' after ``cannot be \n     identified''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S8329]]\n\n       ``(4) In this subsection, the term `Class I' refers to the \n     corresponding designation given recalls in subpart A of part \n     7 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, or a successor \n     regulation.''.\n       (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 705(b) of such Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 375(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or gross'' and inserting ``gross''; and\n       (2) by striking the period and inserting ``, or a class I \n     recall of a drug or device as described in section 505(o)(1) \n     or 518(e)(2).''.\n       This section shall take effect one day after date of this \n     bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been vitiated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been vitiated.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say briefly, if I may, for purposes \nof the Record on this amendment, I want to express my gratitude to the \nmanagers of the underlying bill, the agriculture appropriations bill, \nfor their support on this, as well as my colleague from Vermont, \nSenator Jeffords, and Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts.\n  There may be some technical questions that have to be addressed in \nconference.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we please have order in the Chamber.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there may be some technical questions that \nwe will have to address in conference, and I have agreed, if that is \nthe case, I would certainly strongly support those corrections, but I \nam deeply grateful for support of this amendment and ask unanimous \nconsent it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3192), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the first-degree amendment \nis agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3176), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have reached the point where we are \nprepared to recommend approval of two other amendments that we have \ncleared on both sides. It is my understanding we have. And I ask my \ncolleague from Arkansas if he is prepared to recommend the passage of \nour amendment that we are offering for Senators Baucus, Leahy, and \nSessions, and then an amendment offered in behalf of Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the first amendment that the chairman \nmentioned has been cleared on this side. The amendment by Senator \nCoverdell has not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3194\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the amendment that I suggested had been \ncleared is one that is offered by Senators Bumpers and myself for \nSenators Baucus, Leahy, and Sessions. I understand that amendment has \nbeen cleared on both sides. I send that amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for himself and \n     Mr. Bumpers, for Mr. Baucus, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Sessions, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3194.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, line 11, strike ``$50,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$51,400,000''.\n       On page 14, line 17, strike ``$432,082,000'' and insert \n     ``$432,982,000''.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment would provide additional \nfunding for three new special research grants, as follows:\n  Food safety (Alabama) $300,000;\n  Brucellosis vaccine (Montana) $150,000; and\n  Food Science Center (Vermont) $150,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3194) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I know of no other requests for \nrecognition.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd be listed as a \ncosponsor on the Bumpers sense-of-the-Senate resolution on program \nfunding levels which was previously adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Did the clerk read the bill for the third time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the House bill.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4101) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All after the enacting clause of H.R. 4101 is \nstricken, and the text of S. 2159, as amended, is inserted in lieu \nthereof.\n  The question is on the third reading of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 4101), as amended, was ordered to a third reading and \nwas read the third time.\n  Mr. COATS. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 97, nays 2, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 209 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--97\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--2\n\n     Kyl\n     Santorum\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Glenn\n       \n  The bill (H.R. 4101), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n  [The text of the bill was not available for printing.

The Senate insists on its amendment, requests \na conference with the House, and the Chair appoints the following \nconferees.\n  The Presiding Officer [Mr. Sessions] appointed Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nSpecter, Mr. Bond, Mr. Gorton, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Burns, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Bumpers, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kohl, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8330]]\n\nLeahy, Mrs. Boxer and Mr. Byrd conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I express my sincere appreciation to all \nSenators for their assistance and cooperation in the consideration of \nthe agriculture appropriations bill. In particular, I thank my \ndistinguished colleague and good friend from Arkansas, who has served \nfor 20 years as a member of this committee and was helping manage the \nagricultural appropriations bill for the last time in his Senate \ncareer. He has been not only a very good friend but very helpful, \nthoughtful, intelligent and effective as a Senator in this capacity, \nhelping shape this legislation during the time we have had the \nopportunity to work together as members of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I am going to miss him very much. The Senate is going to miss Dale \nBumpers. He is one of the most astute, articulate and effective \nSenators serving in the Senate today.\n  I want Senators to know, too, that at my request, this bill includes \na general provision to designate the United States National Rice \nGermplasm Evaluation and Enhancement Center in Stuttgart, AR, the Dale \nBumpers National Rice Research Center.\n  In my judgment, Senator Bumpers is the father of this center. He has \nhelped guide the development of the research there in this important \nagriculture sector. I think it is very appropriate and I was pleased \nthat the subcommittee included that in our committee print. It was \napproved by the full committee and is included in the bill that was \npassed by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I also say that without the wonderful assistance of \nmembers of our staff and the other members of our subcommittee, the \npassage of this bill would not have been possible.\n  I particularly praise the hard work and effective work of the chief \nclerk of our subcommittee, Rebecca Davies. Those who have assisted her \nhave also turned in exemplary performances, and I appreciate very much \nall of their work. They are: Martha Scott Poindexter, Rachelle Graves, \nHunt Shipman, who is a member of my personal staff and legislative \nassistant for agriculture and other issues, and our summer intern, \nHaywood Hamilton, from Albin, MS, who we are glad to have with us in \nour office this summer.\n  Those who worked closely with Senator Bumpers on the Democratic side: \nGalen Fountain, his chief assistant on this subcommittee we have come \nto know and appreciate over a period of time, and we are grateful for \nhis excellent assistance; Cornelia Teitka, who is a designee allocated \nto us as a resource from the Department of Agriculture, has been very \nhelpful in the handling of the legislation; Ben Noble and Carole \nGeagley also have assisted them from Senator Bumpers staff. We thank \nthem all. We appreciate very much everyone's good efforts in the work \non this bill.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I extend my congratulations and appreciation \nto the managers of this very important agriculture appropriations bill. \nMy colleague from the State of Mississippi, Senator Cochran, always \nexhibits patience and real leadership on this important legislation. I \nthank him for what he does. And also to Senator Bumpers, I think it is \nabsolutely appropriate that this National Center on Rice Research be \nnamed after Senator Bumpers. He certainly has labored in the vineyards \non rice and also on the agriculture appropriations bill.\n\n  So thank you both for the work that you have done.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the majority leader yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I join with the majority leader in complimenting the \nmanager, the very distinguished Senator from Mississippi, as well as \nour ranking member. This will be the last bill our ranking member will \nmanage, at least on the appropriations side. He may have other \nresponsibilities in other committees, but on this bill it will be his \nlast bill. We will miss his managerial skills, his remarkable sense of \nhumor, and the ability that he demonstrates each and every day to work \nwith all of us. So I compliment both of them and thank them for their \nfine work tonight.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8297-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8330-S8374]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now resume the HUD-\nVA appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2168) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     for sundry independent agencies, commissions, corporations, \n     and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Daschle amendment No. 3063, to amend the Public Health \n     Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     of 1974 to protect consumers in managed care plans and other \n     health coverage.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to \nthe HUD-VA appropriations bill, all first-degree amendments must be \noffered and debated tonight, and if votes are ordered with respect to \nthose amendments, they occur, in a stacked sequence, beginning at 9 \no'clock in the morning--I want to emphasize to our colleagues, we are \nbeginning a little earlier than normal; it will be 9 o'clock; and we \nwill go right to the stacked sequence, with 2 minutes of debate prior \nto each vote for explanation, as has been requested and is the normal \npractice--and that all succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Now, Mr. President, I know that there are several \namendments that need to be worked through. I see that Senator Wellstone \nis here on the floor ready to go. And I believe we can get some time \nagreements on other issues.\n  Does the manager, Senator Bond, wish to comment?\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I believe Senator Nickles was prepared to go, and I \nknow that Senator Wellstone wants to go right after that. But I believe \nbefore we move forward, I need to yield to the distinguished minority \nleader who has to deal with this. It was our understanding from the \ndiscussions that Senator Nickles would move forward on a major \namendment he has, and then I would hope we would be able to turn to \nSenator Wellstone.\n  With that, let me yield to the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And I believe we are making progress in \nsetting up a procedure by which at some point in the not too distant \nfuture--I think the prospects are greater tonight than they have been \nin some time--we might have a good debate on the Patients' Bill of \nRights. Because I believe that these negotiations are proceeding \nsuccessfully, I withdraw the pending amendment on HUD-VA with an \nexpectation that we will come to some successful conclusion at a later \ndate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Might I make a request for 1 second?\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to follow the Nickles \namendment, so I can go back to the office and come back.\n  Mr. BOND. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the minority \nleader for allowing us to get back to this VA-HUD bill. We have had \ngood discussions on it. We have had a very important amendment debated \nat length on\n\n[[Page S8331]]\n\nthe space station. This is always one of the important points that we \nhave to debate on the VA-HUD bill.\n  We have had great cooperation from Senators on both sides. I think we \nhave narrowed the list of amendments. And we hope to be able to accept \nand include in the managers' amendment many of the things that have \nbeen raised by our colleagues.\n  We are now waiting for Senator Nickles to come forward to debate an \namendment on the FHA limits. But we do have a number of amendments we \ncan accept while we are waiting.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3195\n\n       (Purpose: To increase funds for VA homeless grant and per \n     diem program)\n  Mr. BOND. First, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Cleland, and Senator Mikulski and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Mr. \n     Cleland, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3195.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 18, add the following new provisos prior to \n     the period: ``: Provided further, That of the funds made \n     available under this heading, $14,000,000 shall be for the \n     homeless grant program and $6,000,000 shall be for the \n     homeless per diem program: Provided further, That such funds \n     may be used for vocational training, rehabilitation, and \n     outreach activities in addition to other authorized homeless \n     assistance activities''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment would provide, within the \n$17.2 billion medical care appropriation, $20 million for VA's homeless \ngrant and per diem program. The amendment would make these funds \navailable for vocational training, outreach, shelter, and other \nimportant activities to aid homeless veterans in a comprehensive \nmanner.\n  This should help meet the needs of the 275,000 veterans who are \nestimated to be homeless on any given night of the year. Together with \nfunds already included in the bill, we will have provided $100 million \nin VA homeless assistance. This is a critical need. I commend the other \nSenators who worked on supporting this. I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman and \nRanking Member for their outstanding leadership on this important piece \nof legislation. Given the hard work that went into this bill, I wanted \nto first express my appreciation for what they have done. I am reminded \nof the old phrase ``too many cooks spoil the broth.'' Sometimes the \nlegislative branch might be thought of in that way. As I offer this \namendment, I have attempted to be mindful not to ``spoil the broth.''\n  As the former head of the Veterans Administration, the veterans \nportion of this bill continues to be near and dear to my heart. I am \nextremely pleased to see that the Appropriations Committee under the \nleadership of Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski has increased funding \nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs by over $1.5 billion when \ncompared to last year's budget. This represents a real increase in \nfunding even when inflation is factored in. Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski are true friends of America's veterans, and we thank them.\n  The amendment I have offered attempts to fill a void that exists with \nrespect to services for veterans. When I was head of the Veterans \nAdministration, it was clear to me that the VA could not be everywhere \nat all times. We relied heavily on other government agencies and \nprivate entities in our attempt to assure that all veterans could \nobtain the benefits they were entitled to and the assistance they \nneeded. Today, in an era of balanced budgets, we cannot depend solely \non federal dollars to solve every problem. The era of balanced budgets \nbrings with it the era of partnership.\n  The VA must continue to partner with other entities to fulfill its \nmission. For instance, in this year's Defense Authorization bill, I \nhave authored language which would strongly encourage the VA to partner \nwith the Department of Defense to provide health care for our nation's \nmilitary personnel, their dependents, military retirees, and veterans.\n  Today, I am advocating much stronger partnering between the VA and \nthe private sector to fill the basic needs of our nation's veterans. \nThe Homeless Providers Grant and Per Diem Program was established in \n1992 to fund the development and operation of transitional housing for \nhomeless veterans who are free of alcohol and drugs. Over 2,000 beds \nhave been made available under this program. Over $21 million has been \nappropriated for this purpose.\n  Unfortunately, the current program is completely inadequate in the \nface of the overwhelming need which exists for housing for homeless \nveterans. The VA estimates that over 275,000 veterans are currently \nhomeless on any given night. In a given year, over 500,000 veterans \nfind themselves homeless at some point. In Atlanta, Georgia, nearly \n10,000 veterans are in need of homeless assistance. This is clearly \nunacceptable. A mere 2,000 beds, while important, would not meet the \nneeds of one state, let alone the entire nation. The program does not \ncome close to fulfilling the entire need. Currently at approximately $7 \nmillion, it represents less than two-hundredths of a percent of the \nentire VA budget.\n  The amendment I have offered would set aside $20 million for the \nHomeless Providers Grant and Per Diem program. This would nearly triple \nthe amount available for this program. It would also insure that funds \nare available for rehabilitation, vocational training, and outreach. \nThese are critical elements because the list of successful programs \nhave demonstrated that helping veterans become drug and alcohol free \nand employable is the best way to insure that they not find themselves \nhomeless again. Furthermore, it is important to provide for successful \noutreach to veterans in need to insure that veterans are able to take \nadvantage of the services, both public and private, that are available \nto them.\n  Several groups have contacted me since I was elected to the Senate to \nseek support for the veterans assistance projects they are trying to \nestablish or expand. I would like to take a few moments to describe two \nsuch programs.\n  Last year, the Georgia Military College conducted a pilot program in \nwhich veterans voluntarily undergoing drug rehabilitation were offered \na college course. The program was paid for through the proceeds of a \ngolf tournament sponsored by the Atlanta Veterans Administration \nMedical Center. Eighteen veterans participated in the original program. \nIn light of the initial success, the Georgia Military College seized on \nthe idea of expanding the program not only to provide for education but \nto offer additional counseling and to provide shelter for the \nparticipants. The College is in the process of establishing a 5-year \nprogram aimed at improving the lives of Georgia's homeless veterans. \nThis is the type of program that can truly make a difference. Instead \nof a ``band-aid'' approach, it offers true skills training, and the \ntransitional housing these veterans need to be able to continue with \nthe program.\n  The National Veterans Foundation offers perhaps one of the most \nimportant services a nation can provide to our veterans in need--a \nhuman voice. The Foundation was founded by Floyd ``Shad'' Meshad in \n1985 to help veterans recover from the pain of war. It has aided over a \nquarter of a million veterans, funding housing, legal services, job \ntraining, counseling, and rehabilitative programs. A major focus of the \nFoundation is its toll-free Information and Referral Line. Shad Meshad \nrefers to it as a ``Clearing House'' to direct veterans and their \nfamilies to the assistance they need. It is a real human voice on the \nother end of the line, not a recording. Over the years, the National \nVeterans Foundation has logged thousands of calls. Unfortunately, this \ncritical outreach program is only available during business hours, \nMonday through Friday. Our veterans deserve the kind of service \nprovided by the National Veterans Foundation--but they deserve it 24 \nhours a day, 7 days a week.\n  These are just two of the types of programs that deserve the support \nof the VA. In my view, it is only lack of resources which currently \nlimits that support. It should be made clear that what we are talking \nabout is not the old give-away of federal funds. This is not new \n``corporate welfare.'' I was introduced to the Homeless Providers\n\n[[Page S8332]]\n\nGrant and Per Diem program fairly recently. I was surprised to learn \nthat the Veterans Administration does not currently have a \ncomprehensive grant program that could fund meritorious projects, but \nit does have this program. I believe the Homeless Providers Grant and \nPer Diem Program combined with a future comprehensive grant program \nwill leverage federal dollars with private, state, and local money to \ncreate a multiplier effect that will aid our nation's veterans for \nyears to come. It is my intent to introduce legislation in the future \nto provide the necessary statutory authority to establish a \ncomprehensive grant program that goes beyond the current homeless \nassistance program.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski for their cooperation and support for this amendment. Without \ntheir leadership, this amendment would not be possible. I look forward \nto working closely with them in the future to further assist our \nnation's veterans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to concur with Senators \nCleland and Bond on this amendment. It will increase by $13 million the \namount for the homeless grants for the VA. Nobody who fought to save \nour country should be out on the street. These men have borne the \npermanent wounds of war, some of which have caused deep-seated \nemotional problems--unable to find a job.\n  What I like about the VA homeless program is, it not only provides a \nshelter but tries to get them focused on starting a new way of life. We \nhave an outstanding one in Maryland. I am proud of it. And I look \nforward to accepting this amendment and say hats off to try to give the \nvets a new lease on life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3195) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3196\n\n    (Purpose: To require entities that operate homeless shelters to \n     identify and provide certain counseling to homeless veterans)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for Mr. McCain, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3196.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 93, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       Sec. 423. (a) Each entity that receives a grant from the \n     Federal Government for purposes of providing emergency \n     shelter for homeless individuals shall--\n       (1) ascertain, to the extent practicable, whether or not \n     each adult individual seeking such shelter from such entity \n     is a veteran; and\n       (2) provide each such individual who is a veteran such \n     counseling relating to the availability of veterans benefits \n     (including employment assistance, health care benefits, and \n     other benefits) as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     considers appropriate.\n       (b) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of \n     Housing and Urban Development shall jointly coordinate the \n     activities required by subsection (a).\n       (c) Entities referred to in subsection (a) shall notify the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs of the number and identity of \n     veterans ascertained under paragraph (1) of that subsection. \n     Such entities shall make such notification with such \n     frequency and in such form as the Secretary shall specify.\n       (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an entity \n     referred to subsection (a) that fails to meet the \n     requirements specified in that subsection shall not be \n     eligible for additional grants or other Federal funds for \n     purposes of carrying out activities relating to emergency \n     shelter for homeless individuals.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment will assist homeless veterans \nby requiring the federally funded homeless shelters report to the \nVeterans' Administration the number of homeless veterans they serve, \nand it seeks to ensure that these homeless veterans be provide \ninformation regarding the availability of veterans benefits.\n  The amendment will improve the Federal Government's database on \nhomeless veterans and will help homeless veterans know about programs \nwhich can help them address critical needs. It has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  I urge its adoption, and yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the VA/HUD \nAppropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1999. The amendment will assist \nhomeless veterans and seek to eliminate some of the suffering of those \nless fortunate Americans who served their country in the military.\n  This amendment will develop better methods for identifying veterans \nwho utilize federally funded homeless shelters so that they can be \neducated about veteran benefits to which they are entitled, including \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs health care. A homeless shelter which \nreceives federal funding would be required to inquire if a person, man \nor woman, entering the shelter is a veteran. This information would be \nused solely to assist in tracking the number of homeless veterans and \nproviding counseling to the veteran regarding all available benefits, \nincluding job search, veterans preference rights, and medical benefits. \nAdditionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development will coordinate these activities and \nspecify a schedule for notifying the Department of Veteran Affairs of \nthe status of these homeless veterans. It is the intent of this \namendment to require homeless shelters to follow this procedures if \nthey are to be eligible for additional Federal grants.\n  Today, there is no easy or accurate way to track the number of \nhomeless veterans in the United States. I find this astonishing. We \njust celebrated Independence Day, and this country owes a great deal to \nthe men and women who bore arms to keep America free. It is astonishing \nto me that there would be no mechanism or process set up to accurately \ntrack or keep national records on homeless veterans. The Department of \nVeterans Affairs estimates the number of homeless veterans to be \nbetween 275,000 and 500,000 over the course of a year. Conservatively, \none out of every three individuals who is sleeping in a doorway, alley, \nor box in our cities and rural communities has worn a uniform and \nserved our country. Mr. President, the time is right, right now, to \ngive a helping hand.\n  Of the figures the Department of Veterans Affairs does acknowledge, \nhomeless veterans are mostly male; about three percent are women. The \nvast majority are single; most come from poor, disadvantaged \ncommunities; forty percent suffer from mental illness; and half have \nsubstance abuse problems. More than seventy-five percent served our \ncountry for at least four years and Vietnam veterans account for more \nthan forty percent of the total number estimated.\n  Mr. President, there are many complex factors affecting all \nhomelessness: extreme shortage of affordable housing, poverty, high \nunemployment in big cities, and disability. A large number of displaced \nand at-risk veterans live with lingering effects of Post Traumatic \nStress Disorder (PTSD) and substance abuse, compounded by a lack of \nfamily and social support networks.\n  I do not mean to be critical of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or \nthe Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in offering this \namendment. To a certain degree the Department of Veterans Affairs is \nresponsive in taking care of some homeless veterans. But the ones that \nare receiving critical medical treatment and veterans benefits are \nthose who know that such programs exist. It is incumbent on our \ngovernment to reach out to all homeless veterans. However, to do that, \nthere must be a process in place.\n  Homeless veterans need a coordinated effort, between the Secretaries \nof Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, that provides \nsecure housing and nutritional meals, essential physical health care, \nsubstance abuse aftercare and mental health counseling. They may need \njob assessment, training and placement assistance. To those that may \nargue that this is a new entitlement program, I\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\nwould say that these rights and benefits currently exist for veterans \ntoday. Why would we as a nation not do everything in our power to \nprovide this help for those less fortunate veterans.\n  Mr. President, our veterans deserve no less. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this amendment and support our veterans.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, no one can speak for the veterans the \nway a former POW can. I wish to be associated with the remarks of \nSenator McCain and move the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3196) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3197\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funds for the Primary Care Providers Incentive \n                         Act, once authorized)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Rockefeller and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] for himself, Mr. \n     Rockefeller and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3197.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, line 18, add the following new provisos prior to \n     the period: ``: Provided further, That of the funds made \n     available under this heading, $10,000,000 shall be for \n     implementation of the Primary Care Providers Incentive Act, \n     contingent upon enactment of authorizing legislation''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. This amendment has been cleared on both sides and would \nprovide $10 million within the VA medical appropriation for the Primary \nCare Providers Incentive Act contingent upon authorization.\n  Senators Mikulski and Rockefeller have been working to create a \nprogram to facilitate the employment of primary care personnel at the \nVA, including an education debt reduction program which Senator \nMikulski has long been interested in establishing. This program is \nintended to improve the recruitment and retention of primary care \nproviders, a very important element in the service to the VA.\n  The Primary Care Providers Incentive Act seeks to update VA's \neducational assistance programs for prospective employees, particularly \nin areas where recruitment has been difficult. I urge the authorizing \ncommittees to act expeditiously on this important program.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield to my distinguished colleague from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this does attempt to recruit the very \nbest and brightest in the field of primary care to the VA. I proposed \nthe debt reduction program, a student debt reduction program, back in \n1992.\n  Now, why do I approach this as debt reduction rather than \nscholarships? The scholarship program is very worthwhile, but there are \nmany very talented people who have already graduated. They have a \nsubstantial student debt from studying either nursing or other primary \ncare practices. What the $5 million would do would go towards reducing \ntheir student debt if they would enter VA services; they would get a \nyear's worth of debt reduction for a year's worth of service.\n  This way, we know they have completed their training, they have \npassed their licensing requirement, they are as fit for duty as the \nveterans they will serve. That is why we approached it from that policy \nstandpoint. It also joins with the outstanding efforts being made by \nSenator Rockefeller to also develop other tools.\n  I concur in the amendment, and I urge its adoption and ask it be \naccepted unanimously.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am delighted that $10 million to \nfund S. 2115, the Department of Veterans Affairs Primary Care Providers \nIncentive Act, has been provided through a managers' amendment to the \nVA/HUD appropriations bill. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of \nthe VA/HUD Subcommittee, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, for their \ncooperation in making this possible.\n  The new scholarship and educational debt reduction programs that are \ncontained in S. 2115 are designed to revitalize the Health \nProfessionals Education Assistance Program at VA. This program was \noriginally intended to help VA to recruit and retain health \nprofessionals, but it has atrophied in recent years, despite an ongoing \ndemand for educational financial aid by health professionals employed \nby or interested in working at VA. This funding will help breathe new \nlife into the educational assistance programs, and provide much needed \nincentives to improve recruitment and retention of primary care \nproviders.\n  The VA health care system is in the midst of a major reorganization \nthat is simultaneously reducing the current workforce and creating the \nneed for more primary care health professionals. VHA's five-year \nstrategic plan includes the activation and/or planning of nearly 400 \ncommunity-based outpatient clinics, to be staffed by primary care \nhealth professionals. Yet hiring of these professionals and retraining \nof current employees, to prepare for these changes, has lagged behind \nthe planning process. The Primary Care Providers Incentive Programs \nthat will be funded through this amendment will motivate current \nemployees to get training in new areas of need by providing \nscholarships, and assist in the recruitment of new primary care \nproviders by helping to pay off student loans.\n  VA needs educational assistance programs such as these to effectively \nrecruit and retain trained primary care health professionals. In VA \nhospitals and clinics, some of the most difficult positions to fill are \nthose of nurse practitioners, physical therapists, and occupational \ntherapists. In my own state of West Virginia, for example, at one of \nthe VA hospitals, there has been a vacancy for an occupational \ntherapist for over 12 years! Two of the VA hospitals have no physical \ntherapists at all. This is simply unacceptable.\n  The plain fact is that starting salaries in the VA are not \ncompetitive with those in private practice. The Education Debt \nReduction Program gives the VA a financial recruitment tool that will \nbe an enormous help in making the VAMCs more competitive for these \nmuch-needed and highly skilled individuals. In fact, one of the most \nfrequently asked questions by prospective new employees is whether or \nnot VA has a debt reduction program. Clearly, this program will answer \na critical need.\n  But improving recruitment is only half of the story. Retention of \ntrained people is equally important. Funding the employee incentive \nscholarship program can help solve this very real problem. Eligibility \nis limited to current VA employees, providing a way for vulnerable \nindividuals to protect themselves against future RIFs by acquiring \ntraining in the new areas of need. This will go a long way toward \nimproving staff morale at the VA, which has been severely undermined in \nthe last few years due to the necessary streamlining that resulted from \nsignificant budget cuts.\n  The educational assistance programs in S. 2115 are a valuable \ninvestment, enhancing morale of the VA health care providers in the \nshort term, while building a workforce that matches VA's needs and \nimproves veterans' health care in the long run. In the coming months, I \nwill be working with my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs to authorize these worthwhile programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3197) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S8334]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3198\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation)\n\n  Mr. BOND.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor his support for this amendment.\n  The National Fallen Firefighters Foundation has done an absolutely \noutstanding job. I think it bears out the wisdom of the Congress in \nestablishing it. The services they are now providing to the families of \ndeceased firefighters are really exemplary. We have had many \ncommunications from spouses, from children, from parents, of how much \nthe activities of the Fallen Firefighters Foundation mean to them.\n  They have enlisted very significant support from the private sector \nfor their activities. These changes are technical in nature in order to \nenable the foundation to carry out its responsibilities with greater \nefficacy and greater efficiency.\n  I didn't want to let this opportunity pass without underscoring the \ntremendously fine work that is being done by the National Fallen \nFirefighters Foundation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur with the remarks of my \ndistinguished Senator. He has really done the heavy lifting on this \npolicy issue. I want to thank him for doing this. I absolutely concur \nwith the direction in which we are going. I think it will be an \nimportant memorial and a way to staff it properly.\n  I urge this amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3198) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I will get started on this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Might I ask for clarification? I ask the Senator which \namendment he has that he wants to discuss.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is the amendment that will restore benefits to \nveterans for smoking-related diseases.\n  Mr. President, this amendment which I now send to the desk is on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Murray and Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] for himself, \n     Mrs. Murray, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3199.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, my amendment would restore benefits to \nveterans with smoking-related diseases. How would we do that? It is \nsimple. The TEA 21 highway program canceled the disability benefits \nthat veterans would have received under existing rules and procedures, \nand it used that money instead to pay for more highway projects. My \namendment would simply return the favor. It would repeal that offset \nfrom the highway bill.\n  Let me go through the procedural history of this to review how we got \nto where we are today. This offset first appeared in the President's \n1999 budget request. The administration, I think, wildly overestimated \nthe cost of benefits for smoking-related disabilities. But this money \nwas then taken from veterans and it was used elsewhere. There is a \ntremendous amount of indignation in the veterans community over this, \nand there should be. Congress decided to play the same game. In the \nbudget resolution they agreed to deny benefits to veterans and use the \nmoney\n\n[[Page S8335]]\n\nelsewhere just like it had been done by the administration. But the \nbudget priorities were a little different. The savings were used for \nhighway projects. That didn't happen on the Senate side, but by the \ntime it came back from the House, that is what happened. That was the \nmajor reason I voted against that bill.\n  The appropriate place to repeal this offset and restore veterans' \nbenefits would have been in the technical corrections to the TEA 21 \nhighway bill. Senator Rockefeller and I intended to offer an amendment \nwhich would have done just that, but we never got a chance because that \namendment was folded into another conference report so we could never \nget an up-or-down vote. We all know that conference reports, as I just \nsaid, cannot be amended.\n  As I have said before on the floor, it is only right that we should \nhave a clean vote on this issue. This is not only a question of \nveterans, it is a question of accountability. There is simply no excuse \nfor hiding behind procedural gimmicks to avoid responsibility. Some \nhave said we have already voted on this bill, or we have already voted \non this question, but I don't think that is true.\n  Let me explain. The two votes we had on the budget resolution did not \ndeal directly with this question. Senators got a chance to pretend they \nwere for veterans and against the offset, knowing that 5 minutes later \nwe could cast a vote in the opposite direction.\n  We had some camouflage about doing a study sometime in the future. \nBut I think we all recognize it was only a study. And the vote on the \nIRS reform bill was not a clean up-or-down vote; it was only a \nprocedural vote, a point of order. We need to have a clean vote up or \ndown, no subterfuge, no trickery. It is not enough to take these \nbenefits away from veterans. Congress will add insult to injury by not \nhaving a clean up-or-down vote on this question.\n  I think veterans should take a clear position on this issue, and that \nshould go on the Record. Now, some may object to this amendment because \nit is legislation on an appropriations bill, or they may think that \nthis appropriations bill is the wrong place to remedy this particular \nproblem. Let me remind my colleagues that this offset was a \njurisdictional raid to begin with. Transportation conferees stole the \nmoney without ever going through the Veterans' Affairs Committee. This \nwas originally the Veterans' Affairs Committee. If we now repeal this \noffset through the Veterans' Affairs Committee, we will have to pay for \nit by taking even more money away from veterans. The highway bill took \nthat money away. It was not taken away by the Veterans' Committee. \nNobody wants to do that. Nobody wants to take more funding away from \nveterans.\n  There are a few misconceptions that I would like to clear up. First \nand foremost, compensation for veterans with smoking-related illnesses \nwas not a new program. It was not an expansion of a program. It was a \nbenefit to which disabled veterans were entitled to under existing law. \nVeterans who had become addicted to tobacco because of their service in \nthe military had the right to apply for disability. The highway bill \ntook that right away.\n  It is a very tough test that the veterans have to meet. Only 300 have \npassed it. These were not special rules, either. Those veterans had to \nmeet the same legal and evidentiary requirements as for any other \nservice-connected disability. They had to prove that their addiction \nbegan in the military service. They had to prove that their addiction \ncontinued without interruption. They had to prove that their addiction \nresulted in an illness. They had to prove that their addiction resulted \nin a disability.\n  There is another thing that ought to be pointed out tonight. We are \nnot really talking about $17 billion here. Let's be clear about it. OMB \nfirst came up with that figure based on an estimate of 500,000 claims \ngranted every year. But over the past 6 years, a grand total of only \n8,000 veterans have applied, and only 300 of those claims have been \ngranted. CBO came in with a lower, but still high, estimate of $10.5 \nbillion. But the TEA 21 conferees needed more money, so they took \nadvantage of the higher OMB number to pay for a huge increase in \nfunding for highways.\n  The administration's cost projections are based on many, many \nunknowns. More importantly, OMB is assuming VA will grant 100 percent \nof all claims but, to date--listen to this, colleagues--VA has granted \nonly 5 percent of the claims. The test veterans have to meet is simply \nmuch harder than OMB seems to think.\n  There are a number of other unknowns with the administration's \nmethodology. On the percentage of veterans who currently smoke or are \nheavy smokers, VA experts made what we consider to be a questionable \nassumption that veterans who smoke more than 100 cigarettes in their \nlifetime would have the same disease rates as smokers; the percentage \nof veterans who may file claims for tobacco-related illnesses that are \nalready receiving compensation for those or other conditions; the rate \nat which the VA can adjudicate these claims. There are lots of \nassumptions I would question.\n  Let me get right down to the very nitty-gritty of what this amendment \nis about. My first choice would be to keep the old rules for deciding \ndisability claims--the ones we had before the TEA 21 highway bill. I \ndon't see why Congress should go out of its way to deny disability \nbenefits to veterans. Don't we have better places to look for spending \noffsets? Back in World War II, these veterans had free and discounted \ncigarettes included in their rations, and those packs didn't even have \nwarning labels on them. Soldiers were encouraged to smoke to relieve \nthe stress of military strain. And now some of them are suffering the \nconsequences and they are not getting the compensation. That is what is \nso outrageous about what we have done, and that is what this amendment \nintends to correct.\n  The second choice--even if Congress does decide to deny these \nbenefits, I find it hard to understand why this money should be taken \naway from veterans' programs. I believe, at the very least, it should \nstay with veterans. It is quite one thing to argue, look, though they \ndeserve this compensation, they have to meet strict criteria to get \nthis compensation. We handed cigarettes out like candy and we know \nveterans became addicted. They should have been entitled to this \nbenefit. It is quite one thing to take away the compensation benefit, \nwhich we have done; it is adding insult to injury to not at least have \nto put that money, scored by OMB and CBO, back into veterans' health \ncare.\n  That is why I come to the floor and I speak with so much indignation \nabout this. That is why Senator Murray from Washington and Senator \nMcCain from Arizona join me in this amendment. If this offset proposal \nhad been considered in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, as it should \nhave been, I doubt that it would have seen the light of day. But if it \nhad passed the committee, those savings would have remained within the \ncommittee's jurisdiction. Those savings would have been plowed right \nback into veterans' programs. That would have been my second choice.\n  So let me be clear again. The first choice: This compensation should \nhave gone to the veterans. This is an injustice; it really is. \nSecondly, if we weren't going to do that, it should have stayed in the \nVeterans' Committee. I can tell you that committee would have at least \nmade sure that this money would have been invested in veterans' health \ncare. Only because it is late at night and because there are other \ncolleagues who have amendments--trust me, I think I can talk, without \nnotes, for 2 hours about the holes right now--gaping holes--in \nveterans' health care, in the financing and delivery of veterans' \nhealth care.\n  After all, we are running out of excuses for underfunding veterans' \nprograms. Remember, for many years, Congress used deficit reduction as \nan excuse. That was the justification for flat-lining the VA budget in \nthe 1997 budget deal. By the way, the flat-line budget is not going to \nwork. It doesn't take into account inflation. It doesn't take into \naccount all of the veterans now living to be 85--an ever-aging veterans \npopulation. It won't work. But now the deficit is gone and we can no \nlonger claim that there are no offsets available. The first time an \noffset comes down the pike, and it is a real whopper, Congress \nimmediately whisks it away to pay for other programs--\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\nprograms that obviously have a much higher priority.\n  I can't imagine how Congress can make its budget priorities any \nclearer. I have to tell you that if our priority is to live up to our \ncommitment to veterans, then I believe we should have 100 votes for \nthis amendment.\n  The VA-HUD appropriations bill does include a significant $222 \nmillion increase over the President's request in funding for veterans' \nhealth care. I thank my colleagues, the Senators from Missouri and \nMaryland, for their very fine leadership.\n  Let me bring something to my colleagues' attention. As the Veterans \nAffairs' Committee wrote in its letter to Appropriations, an increase \nof over $500 million is necessary to maintain the current level of \nservices. My argument is that not only did we not give the veterans the \ncompensation they would have gotten if we hadn't raided--really, what \nwas their funding for their addiction, for their illness--but to add \ninsult to injury, if we didn't do that, we should have at least put it \ninto veterans' health care because we are not properly funding health \ncare for veterans in this country. Before the budget deal, we just \nsimply did not take into account the inflation that is taking place. \nThe budget is not enough.\n\n  Finally, let me be clear about what this amendment will do and what \nit will not do.\n  First of all, this amendment does not cancel or deny any \ntransportation projects. Those projects are already in law. This \namendment would not affect them in any way.\n  Second, this amendment that I have introduced with Senator Murray and \nSenator McCain would not trigger a budget sequester. It includes the \nsame protection against sequestration, the same budget gimmickry that \nwas included in the TEA 21 bill.\n  It may be argued that this amendment would be using the surplus to \npay for veterans' benefits. I would argue that the highway bill was \nspending the surplus because it was using an unreasonably high estimate \nfor this offset. That is going to happen whether or not we repeal that \noffset.\n  But to the extent we do restore previous law on veterans' disability \nbenefits and waive the Budget Act--I am asking colleagues to waive the \nBudget Act--the cost is not going to be anywhere near $17 billion. I \nwant to be clear about that.\n  In the summer of 1997, the VA said it wouldn't be able to process \nmore than a couple billion dollars worth of claims over 5 years.\n  Mr. President, and colleagues, let me just summarize. I have decided \nto really try to be brief. There is a lot that I feel strongly about, \nand there is a lot that I would like to talk about. But I think my \ncolleagues from Missouri and Maryland were gracious enough to let me \ncome to the floor with this amendment and get to work on it.\n  I summarize this way. This amendment would restore benefits to \nveterans with smoking-related diseases. This amendment that I introduce \non behalf of myself and Senator Murray and Senator McCain does what we \nshould have done--to have provided this funding for compensation to go \nto veterans for smoking-related disease. We did not do that through a \nwhole lot of gimmickry and a whole lot of zigs and zags. We took that \nfunding away from veterans.\n  My second choice would have been to have at least invested this \nfunding into veterans' health care.\n  We have got so many needs for those that are 85, and elderly \nveterans; so many needs for veterans that are walking around and \nstruggling with PTSD; so many needs for more drop-in centers; so many \nneeds to fill the gaps in our current VA health care system. And we \ndidn't put the money into the veterans' health care.\n  Then, finally, I want to make real clear what this will do and what \nit will not do.\n  I don't want anybody to be able to say that we are now going to \ncancel any transportation projects. That is not what this amendment \ndoes.\n  I don't want anybody to say it is going to trigger a budget \nsequester. It has the same protection that we had against \nsequestration.\n  I don't want anybody to argue that we will waive a budget order, that \nwe will have to go into a surplus. We have a huge surplus. We put the \nsurplus into the highways. Now, I am just saying take it back, even \nthough you don't take it from the highways, because you have already \nfunded that. You should at least take that money that belongs to the \nveterans that should have gone to them directly for compensation.\n  I don't think we can avoid an up-or-down vote on this any longer. We \nshould have a clear up-or-down vote. We should all be accountable. I \nfeel very strongly about this, and I hope that I will receive very \nstrong support for this amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Alaska has another \namendment. I was going to say that I believe the Senator from New \nMexico, the chairman of the Budget Committee, will raise a point of \norder tomorrow. As the Senator from Minnesota knows, the Senator from \nMaryland and I have supported his position. There will be a Budget Act \npoint of order.\n  But I ask for the yeas and nays on Senator Wellstone's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to thank \nSenator Wellstone for his cooperation in this debate, and for his \nwillingness to stay on the floor. I also appreciate his remarks. I know \nthe passion that the Senator from Minnesota has on behalf of veterans. \nHe spoke in behalf of atomic veterans, and in behalf of a group of \nveterans in his own State that have been ignored. He has spoken for the \nhomeless, for the mentally ill veterans, and also for the need for \nlong-term care for the veterans. I thank him for that.\n  Mr. President, when we debated both the highway bill and the budget \nbill, I supported the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that we not raid \nthe veterans' medical care. Thence, when we voted on the highway bill, \nI voted for final passage, but was very clear saying we should not fix \nAmerica's potholes on the backs of America's veterans and their needs \nfor health care, many of whom bear the permanent wounds of war.\n  I thank the Senator for raising this issue again. I want the Senator \nfrom Minnesota to know that I support his policy position on this. I, \ntoo, believe that promises made should be promises kept to the \nveterans, and we should find other ways of funding that highway bill.\n  I look forward to further work with him on this topic.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support, as an \noriginal cosponsor of the amendment offered by Mr. Wellstone to the VA/\nHUD Appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 which will rightfully \ntransfer approximately $10.5 billion back to the Department of Veterans \nAffairs for veterans programs. I understand from the managers of the \nbill that the vote on this critical amendment will not occur until \ntomorrow. I would have voted for this provision if I was not called out \nof town on a prior commitment. Furthermore, I urge my colleagues to \nshow their support for veterans and vote for this measure.\n  On July 8, 1998, I submitted for the Record a statement regarding \nveterans' health care activities for tobacco-related illnesses and \ndisabilities. At that time, I had every intention to offer an amendment \nto the VA/HUD Appropriations bill that would restore the $10.5 billion \nin funding that was so egregiously and eagerly taken from our nation's \nveterans to fund pork-laden highway programs in the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 1998 (ISTEA). Unfortunately, there was \nsimply no possibility that this amendment would be adopted, simply \nbecause of the inflexibility of the Appropriations Committee's \nallocation of funds between the Transportation and VA/HUD Committees.\n  Because of the arcane rules of the Senate, I and my cosponsors are \nprecluded from righting this profound wrong that has been perpetrated \nagainst those who have served and sacrificed for our country. I am not \nsure that our efforts will be more successful this evening, but I do \nknow, that it is\n\n[[Page S8337]]\n\nthe right thing to do. This issue is far from dead.\n  It is important, I believe, that my colleagues fully understand the \nfacts regarding the funding shortfall for veterans health care and \ncompensation for tobacco related diseases.\n  First, the Department of Veterans Affairs critical funding shortfall \nis a result of President Clinton's legislative proposal to Congress to \ndisallow service-connected disability or death benefits based on \ntobacco-related diseases arising after discharge from the military. \nCongress, eager to fund pork-laden highway programs, then transferred \nnearly $10.5 billion to the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1998 (ISTEA), H.R. 2400, earlier this year. This \negregious act was fully supported by President Clinton.\n  Second, on April 2, 1998 the Senate voted for an amendment sponsored \nby Senators Domenici, Lott, and Craig on the Balanced Budget Act which \ntransferred approximately $10.5 billion over five years from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for veterans' tobacco-related diseases \nto the ISTEA bill for transportation related projects. I voted for this \namendment, in part, because I believed that the tobacco companies, \nrather than the taxpayers, should bear the burden for tobacco-related \ndiseases caused partially by smoking and using other tobacco products \nwhile they were in military service. Military service did not force \nservicemembers to smoke, but I acknowledge that for morale reasons, the \nservices made cigarettes available for free or at inexpensive prices. \nThe services also give servicemembers condoms and birth control pills \nat no cost to military personnel, but that does not mean that they want \nour men and women in uniform to be promiscuous.\n  Third, on the tobacco bill, I sponsored legislation that would \nprovide not less than $600 million per year to the Department of \nVeterans' Affairs for veterans' health care activities for tobacco-\nrelated illnesses and disability and directed the Secretary of \nVeterans' Affairs to assist such veterans as is appropriate. The \namendment would have provided a minimum of $3 billion over five years \nfor those veterans that are afflicted with tobacco-related illnesses \nand disability. Additionally, the amendment would have provided smoking \ncessation care to veterans from various programs established under the \ntobacco bill.\n  Now that the tobacco bill has been returned to the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee, I feel more compelled to rectify this \nsituation. As a conferee on the ISTEA bill, I refused to support and \nsign the ISTEA Conference Report. I opposed the ISTEA Conference Report \nfor a number of reasons, particularly because of my objections to \nshifting critical veterans funding to support pork barrel spending in \nthis massive highway bill. It seems that the Congress has no hesitation \nin breaking budget agreements, when it suits their own purposes to do \nso, to spend far more on transportation than agreed to in the balanced \nbudget plan. What's worse, it seems that the Congress has no problem \nwith robbing from veterans, whose programs have been seriously under \nfunded for years, to pay for this luxury.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, the facts are clear with respect to \ntobacco related health care costs and the impact on veterans:\n  Tobacco-related diseases, for example, include cancers of the lip, \noral cavity, and pharynx; esophagus; pancreas; larynx; lung; bladder; \nkidney; coronary heart disease; cerebrovascular disease (stroke); \nvarious circulatory diseases; and chronic bronchitis.\n  The Department of Veteran Affairs' (VA) fiscal year 1997 expenditures \nfor health care for veterans with tobacco-related illnesses are \nestimated to be $2.6-$3.6 billion.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the VA treated 405,000 patients with at least \none tobacco-related illness.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the VAs' average cost per patient with at least \none tobacco-related illness was $8,800.\n  In fiscal year 1997, patients with tobacco-related illnesses \naccounted for over 6.5 million visits to the VAs' health care \nfacilities.\n  The projected additional health care costs for tobacco related-\nillnesses for the VA are estimated to be $2.9 billion over the next \nfive years.\n  The projected additional health care costs for tobacco related-\nillnesses for the VA are estimated to be negligible for fiscal year \n1999.\n  The projected cost for tobacco claims in fiscal year 1999 is about \n$500 million based on the number of claims that could be processed. \nProcessing time for claims is expected to increase with an influx of \ntobacco claims.\n  Our nation's veterans should not be excluded from payments by tobacco \ncompanies for health care costs associated with tobacco-related \ndiseases. The failure to address the tobacco-related health care needs \nof our men and women who faithfully served their country in uniform \nwould be wrong. Congress cannot continue to rob from veterans, whose \nprograms have been seriously under funded for years, to pay for these \nand other special interest projects.\n  Mr. President, our veterans deserve no less. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this amendment and support our veterans. Thank you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if there is more comment on this \namendment, I will wait. I ask my colleague from Alaska whether he \nintends to move on to another amendment, or comment on this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in response to my friend, it would be \nmy intent to ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside so I \ncan offer mine.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, other colleagues may want to speak to \nthat. I will take 2 minutes, I say to all of my colleagues.\n  I would like to thank the Senator from Maryland for her very kind \nremarks. I have to say that I will not go now through the technical \npart of what happened. I am telling you that this was a real injustice. \nWe sort of went on record saying we wouldn't do this, and we have done \nit. We shouldn't have. This amendment restores that funding to where it \nshould go.\n  I wish to say to my colleagues that we have a huge surplus. We really \nessentially took some of that money and put it in the highways. We \nshouldn't have. We got the highways. But we left the veterans out in \nthe cold. They know that. All of these veterans organizations know \nthat. I will say this tomorrow again. All these veterans know that. \nSenator Murray, Senator McCain, and many of my colleagues know it as \nwell.\n  I hope that there will be very strong support for this, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, because, again, the money should have gone to deal \nwith the problem, to deal with veterans who really are struggling with \nillness based upon addiction to tobacco, and, if not, it should have \ngone into the veterans' health care. It should not have gone, as my \ncolleague from Maryland said, to pay for additional highways, which is \nwhat happened.\n  So let's correct a wrong. Please. Let's have a very strong vote on \nthis tomorrow morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3200\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3200.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.  . VIETNAM VETERANS ALLOTMENT.\n\n       The Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1600, \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n\n     open season for certain native Alaskan veterans for allotments\n\n       Sec. 41. (a) In General.--(1) During the eighteen month \n     period following promulgation of implementing rules pursuant \n     to paragraph (6), a person described in subsection (b) shall \n     be eligible for an allotment of not more than 160 acres of \n     land under the Act of May 17, 1906 (chapter 2469; 34 Stat. \n     197), as such Act was in effect before December 18, 1971.\n       (2) Allotments selected under this section shall not be \n     from existing native or non-native campsites, except for \n     campsites used primarily by the person selecting the \n     allotment.\n       (3) Only federal lands shall be eligible for selection and \n     conveyance under this Act.\n       (4) All conveyances shall be subject to valid existing \n     rights, including any right of\n\n[[Page S8338]]\n\n     the United States to income derived, directly or indirectly, \n     from a lease, license, permit, right-of-way or easement.\n       (5) All state selected lands that have not yet been \n     conveyed shall be ineligible for selection under this \n     section.\n       (6) No later than 18 months after enactment of this \n     section, the Secretary of the Interior shall promulgate, \n     after consultation with Alaska Natives groups, rules to carry \n     out this section.\n       (7) The Secretary of the Interior may covey alternative \n     federal lands, including lands within a Conservation System \n     Unit, to a person entitled to an allotment located within a \n     Conservation System Unit if--\n       (A) the Secretary determines that the allotment would be \n     incompatible with the purposes for which the Conservation \n     System Unit was established.\n       (B) the person entitled to the allotment agrees in writing \n     to the alternative conveyance; and\n       (C) the alternative lands are of equal acreage to the \n     allotment.\n       (b) Eligible Individuals.--(1) A person is eligible under \n     subsection (a) if that person would have been eligible under \n     the Act of May 17, 1906 (chapter 2469; 34 Stat. 197), as that \n     Act was in effect before December 18, 1971, and that person \n     is a veteran who served during the period between January 1, \n     1968 and December 31, 1971.\n       (c) Study.--The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n       (1) conduct a study to identify and assess the \n     circumstances of veterans of the Vietnam era who were \n     eligible for allotments under the Act of May 17, 1906 but who \n     did not apply under that Act and are not eligible under this \n     section; and\n       (2) within one year of enactment of this section, issue a \n     written report with recommendations to the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources in the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations \n     and the Committee on Resources in the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (d) Definitions.--For the purpose of this section, the \n     terms `veteran' and ``Vietnam era'' have the meanings given \n     those terms by paragraphs (2) and (29) respectively, of \n     section 101 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I think we have given the amendment to \nboth of the floor leaders.\n  The simple reality of this amendment is that this affects a group of \nnative Alaskans--Aleut, Eskimo, and Indian--who served in uniform \nduring the Korean or Vietnam war, and as a consequence of that service \nwere unavailable and not in the State at the time when they would have \nhad the opportunity to take advantage of an individual allotment, which \nwas authorized under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, allowing the \ncollection of up to 160 acres of nonmineral, vacant, unappropriated, \nunreserved land in Alaska to any qualified Alaska Native head of a \nhousehold.\n  What happened during that timeframe between 1968 and 1972, which is \nthe 3 years that are explicitly addressed in this amendment, is that \nthe authorization for the selection ended. So what we have here is the \npassage of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act in 1971 that \nterminated this selection opportunity, and there were a number of \nAlaska Natives serving in the military who did not have an opportunity \nto take advantage of the 160 acres that were due them under the 1906 \nlaw.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is fair to say that we do not have a scoring \non this. We hope to have one tomorrow. It is fair to say also that \nscoring would be very insignificant because this is land where they \ntraditionally have fished, they have hunted, they have subsisted, and \nit is not land in areas of sensitivity relative to parks, wilderness \nareas, and wildlife areas. In all candor, it is also appropriate to say \nthat the Department of Interior will be in opposition to it from the \nstandpoint of any public land transferring to any individuals, even the \nindigenous people who were given by congressional action the right to \nthe selection of this land.\n  Now, it is also fair to reflect on the fact that Alaska contains \nabout 365 million acres. We are talking about authorization for those \nvalid recipients of land in an amount less than 300,000 acres. So it \nwould be equivalent to dropping, if you will, a tack in the State of \nVirginia in relationship to the footprint.\n  I recognize the effect that anything of significant scoring would \nhave on this bill. We do not want to jeopardize the bill. I have talked \nto the floor manager. It is my hope that we can get an accurate scoring \nthat reflects reality. It is also my hope that we recognize this truly \nbelongs in the category of veterans issues. I am on the Veterans' \nCommittee. I have been on that committee for 18 years. These veterans \nsimply were unable to take advantage of the opportunity because they \nwere serving in the Armed Forces.\n  So the amendment would restore the right of the Vietnam era Alaskan \nNative veterans to apply for these allotments as a right that they were \ndenied only because they were serving in the uniform of our Nation.\n  The Amendment calls for the same standards that were in effect under \nthe Allotment Act to be used to evaluate the new applications. \nAdditionally, it calls for DOI to develop rules to implement this bill \nin consultation with Alaska Natives.\n  This amendment allows the Department of the Interior ample time to \npromulgate regulations needed to carry out the provisions of this \namendment.\n  The amendment protects the current valid rights of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The amendment also addresses the concerns of the administration about \npossible Veteran allotments within Conservation System Units.\n  If an Allotment is within a Conservation System Unit The Secretary of \nthe Interior is authorized to offer other lands to the allottee.\n  I think this is a fair solution as these veterans had rights to these \nlands long before they were ever made part of a CSU.\n  This amendment is appropriate on this bill as it addresses a specific \nproblem incurred by Veterans of the Vietnam war who are Alaska Natives \nand were denied a privilege offered other Alaska Natives, for the sole \nreason that they were overseas defending our freedom.\n  I know the administration would like to see this amendment \n``tightened'' to include a smaller class of veterans and I think that \nis plain wrong.\n  Where our veterans are concerned I think we should always err on the \nside of greater participation as without every one of them we would not \nbe here today as free people.\n  On a per capita basis, Alaska Natives represent the largest group of \nminorities serving in active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  It is my intention to ask for the yeas and nays tomorrow sometime, \nbut I hope to have the opportunity to have further discussion with the \nfloor managers on the scoring unless they have specific questions for \nme at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska presents a very \ncompelling case. As a Senator interested in that area, I can see the \nimportance of the case he makes. The problem is, this deals with a \nsubject matter over which this subcommittee does not have primary \njurisdiction, and therefore I would have to say, No. 1, I cannot \ncomment on or respond properly to the views of the appropriate \nappropriations subcommittee, nor could I respond to the questions that \nmight be raised by the authorizing committee.\n  The Senator has advised us that we do not have the scoring from CBO. \nHe has assured us it will be minimal. Frankly, this bill is very close \nto our limits, and if the scoring turns out to push us over the \nallocations, we will have to raise a Budget Act point of order.\n  So I urge the Senator to talk with the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee--the chairman and ranking member, and the chairman and \nranking member of the appropriations subcommittee, and seek their \ncounsel on it. We will be happy to have a vote on it or to deal with it \ntomorrow. While it does involve veterans, the subject matter is not one \nwhich is within the expertise of this subcommittee, and we do need to \nhear from the other appropriations subcommittees and the authorizing \ncommittee on it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to the floor manager, I appreciate \nhis understanding. I don't want to jeopardize activities of the \ncommittee. If there is a significant scoring, I will be willing to \nwithdraw the amendment. But if it is a significant scoring, I would \nappreciate your consideration. If I may leave it at that, I would \nreserve the right--it would be my intention to have it listed on the \npending amendments. I will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BOND. I would be happy to join in asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S8339]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will address it in the morning. I thank the floor \nmanagers, the gentlelady from Maryland, and the gentleman from \nMissouri.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I concur in the remarks of Chairman \nBond. It sounds as if it is a worthwhile endeavor, a complex issue, and \nnot necessarily appropriate to our subcommittee. So we await further \ninformation in the morning to see what are the appropriate next steps. \nI concur that the Senator always has a right to ask for a vote on his \namendment. So we will just wait to hear what we hear on the scoring and \nwhat the Interior subcommittee chairman and ranking member say.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3201\n\n         (Purpose: To provide class size demonstration grants)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, just briefly, my amendment accomplishes \nthree things: It provides States some modest funding to promote one of \nthe single most effective reforms we can make to improve the education \nof our children, and that is smaller class size; it eliminates a \nnotorious piece of corporate welfare in the budget; and it reduces our \nbudget deficit by $2.1 billion over the next 5 years.\n  The amendment authorizes a limited number of innovative demonstration \ngrant programs to assist States in their efforts to reduce public \nschool class size and to improve learning in the earliest grades.\n  My State of Wisconsin has been a leader in the effort to reduce \npublic school class size, and this amendment is modeled after \nWisconsin's successful pilot program, the so-called Student Achievement \nGuaranty in Education, or the SAGE Program.\n  Mr. President, we have been very proud of this program. It has worked \nwell, and I think a model for it on the national level would be \nextremely helpful.\n  The amendment is fully offset by cuts in a wasteful and unnecessary \nFederal subsidy that benefits research and development for the world's \nlargest aircraft manufacturer. We can fully fund this important SAGE \nProgram and still reduce the Federal budget by more than $2.1 billion \nover 5 years if this amendment is adopted.\n  As we near the end of the 105th Congress, I fear that Congress will \nsomehow go home having done nothing to reduce public school class size. \nMy amendment approaches this issue without expanding the deficit and it \neliminates an expensive corporate subsidy.\n  Briefly, passage of this amendment will save $2.2 billion by dealing \nwith certain research efforts that have the explicit goal of \nmaintaining the company's market share in the global aircraft market.\n  For the information of my colleagues, this company has reported \nprofits in excess of $5 billion over the last 5 years, and I don't \nthink there is any justification for this kind of subsidy. It flies in \nthe face of free-market economics and it wastes billions of our \nconstituents' tax dollars.\n  My distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, in \nspeaking out against this subsidy, said, ``The market system is much \nmore efficient at creating jobs and opportunities than the Government \nis.''\n  So I urge my colleagues to take his heed and eliminate this form of \ncorporate welfare. As I noted before, we would produce in our amendment \na $2.1 billion net deficit reduction over the next 5 years. To some of \nus, we may sometimes feel we are belaboring the obvious, but I feel \nconstrained to point out that we still do have a deficit in our Federal \nbudget and that this amendment will be very helpful in that regard.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, for deferring to me briefly so I could have the \nopportunity to speak about this amendment and offer it. In light of the \nunderstanding that the Senate wants to move forward on this bill, let \nme, in a moment, withdraw my amendment, but indicate I hope to offer it \non another appropriations bill later this year.\n  With that, Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 3201) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin. We are now ready for the amendment by the Senator from \nOklahoma. The Senator from Rhode Island has an amendment to go after \nthis one. I ask the Chair to recognize him after this amendment has \nbeen dealt with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3202\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the bill with respect to single family maximum \n               mortgage amounts, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Kohl, \nMack, Allard, Feingold, DeWine and Faircloth, I send an amendment to \nthe desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for himself, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Mack, Mr. Allard, Mr. Feingold, Mr. DeWine and Mr. \n     Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 3202.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 53, strike lines 9 through 25 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 219. INCREASE IN FHA SINGLE FAMILY MAXIMUM MORTGAGE \n                   AMOUNTS AND GNMA GUARANTY FEE.\n\n       (a) FHA Single Family Maximum Mortgage Amounts.--Section \n     203(b)(2)(A) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1709(b)(2)(A)) is amended by striking ``38 percent'' and \n     inserting ``48 percent''.\n       (b) GNMA Guaranty Fee.--Ssection 306(g)(3)(A) of the \n     National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1721(g)(3)(A)) is amended by \n     striking ``No Fee or charge'' and all that follows through \n     ``or collected'' and inserting ``A fee or charge in an amount \n     equal to not less than 12 basis points shall be assessed and \n     collected''.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, before I describe the amendment, first I \nwould like to just express my appreciation to my colleagues, Senator \nBond from Missouri and Senator Mikulski from Maryland. I have the \npleasure of serving with them on the Appropriations Committee, on this \nsubcommittee, and I enjoyed the work on this subcommittee. This \nsubcommittee is a hard committee because it deals with so many \nagencies. It is not easy. It is not just one agency. The bill is \ncommonly VA-HUD and other agencies. It includes EPA, the Science \nFoundation, NASA and so on. So it requires an enormous amount of work \nby staff and by Senators to try to stay on top of all the demands, and \nthe multitude of requests by the agencies and Senators who are involved \nwith them. So I compliment them for their work.\n  Mr. President, I agree with most of the things they have in their \nbill, although I have some questions about the cost of the bill, but I \nwill may raise that at another time. I notice in the committee report \nthe bill has about a $5 billion increase in requests compared to last \nyear. I do not know of any other appropriations bill that has that kind \nof increase. I am going to have to check into that, but that is not \nwhat I raise tonight. I may vote against the bill because of the $5 \nbillion compared to last year's level. I am concerned about that, but I \nam going to do my homework on that.\n  The reason I am rising to introduce this amendment is because in the \ncommittee bill it increases the FHA loan limits and increases them \nrather significantly. For those who are not familiar with this, FHA, \nthe Federal Housing Administration, insures mortgage loans. These \nmortgages are 100 percent guaranteed by the Federal Government. It was \nstarted many, many years ago, and its purpose was to expand housing in \nareas where people maybe could not afford it. It had a noble purpose. \nWe had a housing shortage. We had people who could not get money, could \nnot borrow money. The private sector markets were not there and money \nwas not available to assist people to buy a home.\n  One of the basic, fundamental principles we have in this country is \nwe want people to be able to buy their own homes. We want people to be \nable to own their own homes, not just rent, we want people to own their \nown homes. So the Federal Government assisted in this program with the \nFederal Housing Administration.\n  But we have limits. We have guiding principles that say, if we are \ngoing to have the Federal Government insure home loans to individuals, \nthey basically be limited to about 95 percent of the median home price \nfor that area. It kind of makes sense. You should not be able to get \n100 percent Federal insurance for home loans far in excess of the value \nof homes in the area. That does not make sense.\n  There is in effect, base amounts or a bottom amount so every county \nacross the country would not fall below a particular amount. And then \nthere is also a cap. We ought to have some kind of limit. We should not \nhave the Federal Government insuring loans very expensive homes. I see \nmy colleague from Rhode Island. There are some areas of Rhode Island, \nat least one area there,\n\n[[Page S8341]]\n\nwhere there are probably all million-dollar homes.\n  Mr. REED. That is in Massachusetts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Maybe that is in Massachusetts, I am not sure. But the \nFederal Government should not be insuring those million dollar homes. \nSo we have a maximum limit to make sure the federal government doesn't \ninsure million dollar homes. The bottom loan limit is $86,000 this \nyear. Last year, it was $81,000, so it has increased. The top limit it \nis $170,000. So you have limits set at 95 percent of the median value \nof homes, but everywhere in this country is going to have at least this \nbase limit, $86,000. Right now, current law, you can get a home Loan, \ninsured 100 percent by the Federal Government, guaranteed by the \ntaxpayers, in an amount equal to $86,000. In some areas, the higher \nprice home areas, up to $170,000.\n  The committee increased both of those limits. They increased the base \namount from $86,000 to $109,000. And they also increased the top limit \nfrom $170,000 to $197,000--almost $200,000. Our amendment strikes the \nincrease in the top limit.\n  I hope my colleagues would say, wait a minute, $170,000 is enough for \nthe Federal Government to insure. Shall we really go up to $200,000? \nLast year, it was $160,000, so, because it is tied to a percentage of \nthe Freddie Mac conforming loan limit, it already goes up from last \nyear's level in the top areas, from $160,000 it goes to $170,000. Isn't \nthat enough? But, no, the committee said let's go on up to almost \n$200,000.\n  The purpose of this program was to assist low-income people, or \npeople who could not get loans to be able to get a loan with a Federal \nguarantee; a loan that is guaranteed by taxpayers 100 percent. But now \nthe committee is going all the way up to $200,000? I think that is too \nhigh. I do not think that was the purpose of the program.\n  The Secretary of Housing called me two or three times and said, \n``Can't we do this?'' I disagreed with him. He wanted to do it on the \nhighway bill, and I respect the Secretary of Housing, but I said, ``No. \nThat is bad public policy.'' They tried to get this put in the highway \nbill and I disagreed with him and we were successful in stopping it. \nNow the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee is doing it.\n  Our amendment does not touch the bottom increase. I might tell my \ncolleagues, I think we should. I did not want to increase the bottom \namount, but I also know how to count votes. I didn't have the votes to \nprevent the increase in the bottom limit. I hope we will have the votes \nto not increase the top limit. I hope we will keep the Federal Housing \nAdministration targeted to lower income individuals. You have to have a \npretty good income in order to be able to afford a $200,000 mortgage. \nIs that the purpose of the Federal Government, to insure loans and \nmortgages up to $200,000? I don't think so. I don't think that is why \nFHA was created.\n  What brought us here? The Secretary of Housing wants to increase the \nloan limits. I guess there was a Housing Affairs letter, an internal \nindustry newsletter that quoted a HUD official saying, ``The increase \nin the loan limit is vital to the President's nationwide home ownership \ncampaign, and if it passes Congress, it will surely translate into \nvotes in the next Presidential campaign.''\n  I'm not sure that is why we have this increase. I just don't think \nthat is what the Federal Government should be doing. I might mention \nthe administration wanted to take it up to $227,000, so maybe I should \nthank my colleagues from Maryland and Missouri because they did not go \nto $227,000. They did not accede to the President's request. The \nPresident wanted to take it to $227,000 nationwide. That is a quarter \nof a million dollars. That was the administration's proposal. To me, \nthat is absolutely wrong and we should not do that.\n  What kind of a job has FHA been doing? Have they done such a great \njob that we should be encouraging them to make more and more loans? I \nmight mention, when you are having a Federal insured loan, you are \ncrowding out private sector loans. Shouldn't the private sector be \nmaking loans? If we are talking about loans of $200,000, shouldn't the \nprivate sector be making those loans with the risk that is involved? Or \nare we going to have the Federal Government do it and have the \ntaxpayers at risk? I think the private sector should do it. If somebody \nwants to build or buy a $200,000 home, great, I hope they do. But I \ndon't think the taxpayers should be at risk for it.\n  I have a young son who is working. When he looks at his paycheck he \nsays, ``Hey, Dad, thank you very much. You guys are taking a big chunk \nout of my check. Thank you very much.'' I don't think we should put his \ntax dollars at risk for somebody having a $200,000 home. He doesn't \nhave one. My daughter doesn't have one. Why in the world should we be \nputting them at risk to be guaranteeing $200,000 loans? I don't think \nwe should be doing that. But we are getting ready to do it in this \nbill. So I think that is a serious mistake.\n  Is FHA doing such a great job? They have three times the default rate \nof conventional loans. They are not doing that great if they have a \ndefault rate running at 8.4 percent, three times the national rate in \nconventional loans.\n  They have a smaller downpayment, which means a much greater risk. If \nyou have a loan with FHA, I believe the loan-to-value ratio is 96 \npercent. That is far lower than conventional loans, so you have a lot \nmore risk and three times the default rate.\n  FHA is not doing such a great job. We have a system that really \nencourages lenders to make FHA-insured loans, and that is another part \nof our amendment. We try to take some of the incentive away from \nlenders steering home buyers into FHA. Right now the system is really \nloaded, really geared towards FHA. You get a 100 percent Federal \nguarantee if you go FHA, and if you happen to be in the business of \nlending, you are going to get a much better deal going through FHA than \nyou do through the private sector.\n  In our amendment, we also change the point level dealing with Ginnie \nMae. We raise the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee from 6 basis points to 12. I \nmight mention, under most conventional loans, servicing fees to lenders \nare usually about half, about 25 points, but under current law, FHA, it \nis 44 points.\n  What does that mean? If you are servicing a $100,000 loan, under a \nconventional mortgage you will get about half of those 50 basis points, \nor $250 on a $100,000 mortgage. If you do it for FHA, you get $440, a \nmuch better deal if you go with the Government-guaranteed loan. There \nis a much lower downpayment, and the Federal Government is going to \nguarantee it 100 percent. There is a real encouragement for people to \nsteer home buyers into FHA. The Government is going to take care of it.\n  I might mention, that has had a catastrophic effect in many, many \nneighborhoods. This is sad.\n  Let me read a little summary. And, Mr. President, I will have several \narticles printed in the Record from people who studied this issue far \nmore than I. But this is from a report that was done by the Chicago \nArea Fair Housing Alliance policy paper dated March of 1998, and it \ntalks about the two faces of FHA. I will read a couple points:\n\n       The Chicago Area Fair Housing Alliance has conducted \n     studies which indicate that when FHA lending is concentrated, \n     it has disastrous effects on these areas of concentration, \n     resulting in undue levels of blight and disinvestment.\n\n  It goes on. It says:\n\n       Yet our research clearly indicates that a pattern of FHA \n     lending that limits housing opportunities contributes to \n     segregation, perpetuates a myth of race as a contributor to \n     community disinvestment and ultimately leads to community \n     decline itself. The racially discriminatory effects of FHA \n     single-family programs have been known to HUD for more than \n     25 years. However, HUD has failed to take its share of \n     responsibility for the role FHA plays in the destruction of \n     these communities.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       FHA has allowed itself to be a direct contributor to \n     community disinvestment and decline.\n\n  We should be ashamed of ourselves. In other words, FHA in many areas \nhas done more damage than good and has contributed to the decline of \nmany, many neighborhoods.\n  This didn't come from Don Nickles, from my research, this came from a \ngroup, the Chicago Area Fair Housing Alliance.\n  Mr. President, I will point out a few other comments that were made \nby people who have studied this issue, again, far more than I, just for \nthe information of our colleagues, so they can see what a lot of people \nhave said, that raising the FHA loan limits is not the right thing to \ndo.\n\n[[Page S8342]]\n\n  There is a letter from the Cato Institute, dated July 16, 1998. I \nwill read a section.\n  Mr. President, it says:\n\n       I wish to remind you that in the late 1980s the FHA lost \n     over $2 billion of taxpayer funds when it became \n     overextended. I fear that we may soon be facing the same \n     problem today.\n       It is also worth noting that the FHA already has a very \n     poor lending record. At a time when the average conventional \n     mortgage default rate hovers between 2 and 3 percent, FHA \n     incredibly has an 8.4 percent default rate. I am very fearful \n     that the FHA is becoming a ticking timebomb that will explode \n     in the taxpayers' laps.\n\n  That was by Stephen Moore.\n  Americans for Tax Reform--I will highlight one page:\n\n       The time has long passed since potential homeowners needed \n     drastic federal intervention to qualify for affordable loans. \n     With today's home ownership at an all-time high and with an \n     innovative private mortgage market meeting the needs of \n     homeowners across the bracket, logic would strongly suggest \n     scaling back the FHA.\n\n  The bill we have before us doesn't scale back the FHA, Mr. President, \nit expands it, and expands it rather dramatically.\n  The Heritage Foundation issued an executive memorandum, dated July \n16, 1998. I will read a short part of it:\n\n       If ultimately enacted into law, these provisions--referring \n     to the expansion, raising the loan limits--would expand the \n     federal government's role even deeper into the residential \n     mortgage market, provide windfall profits to a select group \n     of mortgage financiers, undermine the viability of private \n     mortgage insurers, and expose the U.S. taxpayers to a costly \n     bailout for an already faltering FHA insurance fund.\n       According to budget data provided to Congress by HUD, the \n     FHA's 1997 property acquisitions through foreclosure were up \n     117 percent, or a staggering $2.3 billion, from initial \n     projections.\n\n  I might mention, if my memory serves me correct, in 1997, FHA \nforeclosed on $5 billion worth of properties. This is not a success \nstory in housing.\n  I will read from a different group. I have read from the Heritage \nFoundation, from the Cato Institute, and from a taxpayers group. Those \ngroups are usually perceived to be free enterprise, conservative think-\ntanks and institutions.\n  This is from the Consumer Federation of America. It doesn't fall into \nthe above category. It says:\n  ``I am writing to express our strong support for your amendment''--\nthe amendment by myself, Senator Kohl and others--``to the HUD \nAppropriations bill when it comes to the Senate floor.''\n  The amendment eliminates a proposed increase in the high-cost FHA \nloan limit, which will keep FHA focused on the moderate-income home \nbuyers it was created by Congress to serve.\n  It continues:\n\n       Your amendment discourages lenders from inappropriate \n     behavior by bringing the fee they make on FHA loans more in \n     line with private sector fees--without any increase in the \n     cost of an FHA loan to consumers.\n\n  They are right. Again, I reiterate, one of the things that we did in \nadjusting the guaranty fees on Ginnie Mae, going from 6 points to 12 \npoints, will be to bring down the staggering servicing fees to the \nlenders from 44 basis points to 38. That is not much, but it moves it \ncloser to being in line with the private marketplace. The marketplace \nis a lot closer to 25 basis points. Right now this very high fee is a \nreal incentive for people to steer loans to FHA. We shouldn't have a \nFederal policy making it more profitable for people to send their loans \nFHA insurance with the Federal Government guaranteeing the loans. That \ndoesn't make sense, but that happens to be current policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters and statements from the Cato \nInstitute, from the Americans for Tax Reform, and the National \nTaxpayers Union, as well as the Consumer Federation of America, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Cato Institute,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I just wanted to write you to thank \n     you for your efforts to block any increase in the top FHA \n     loan limit this year. With the FHA already holding over $300 \n     billion of loans in its portfolio, it is the height of fiscal \n     folly to be substantially increasing the size of the FHA loan \n     portfolio, particularly since this policy would mostly affect \n     higher income homebuying. Taxpayers are already at great risk \n     of default, especially if the housing market goes into \n     slowdown. I wish to remind you that in the late 1980s the FHA \n     lost over $2 billion of taxpayer funds when it became \n     overextended. I fear that we may soon be facing the same \n     problem today.\n       It is also worth noting that the FHA already has a very \n     poor lending record. At a time when the average private \n     mortgage insurance claims rate hovers between 2 and 3 \n     percent, FHA incredibly has an 8.4 percent default rate. I am \n     very fearful that the FHA is becoming a ticking timebomb that \n     will explode in taxpayers' laps. just as the savings and loan \n     bailout required billions of dollars of taxpayer rescue funds \n     in the late 1980s.\n       There is no reason that a federally subsidized agency \n     should compete with the private market place, when private \n     companies are quite adequately serving market need. The \n     primary effect of increasing the FHA loan limit will be to \n     divert homebuyers from PMI insurance to FHA insurance.\n       I'm enclosing a recent article of mine on FHA policy as \n     well as my recent testimony before the Banking Committee. My \n     position has been and continues to be that we ought to move \n     aggressively towards privatizing the FHA, not expanding it.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                    Stephen Moore,\n     Director of Fiscal Policy Studies.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Americans For Tax Reform,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I am writing to applaud your efforts \n     to reject the provision in the FY 99 VA/HUD Appropriations \n     bill that unnecessarily hikes the current Federal Housing \n     Administration (FHA) loan limits to $197,490 in high-cost \n     areas and to nearly $109,000 in lower-cost markets. Though \n     lower than the $227,150 nationwide limit requested by the \n     Administration, the new limits put forth in the Senate bill \n     would substantially hinder the private market's ability to \n     provide adequate mortgage capital and subsequently place the \n     taxpayer at a higher risk of losses.\n       In what may have seemed like a plausible solution to \n     solving mortgage debt defaults during the Great Depression, \n     today's FHA loan program has changed little to meet the \n     current structure of the market. The time has long passed \n     since potential homeowners needed drastic federal \n     intervention to qualify for affordable loans. With today's \n     home ownership at an all-time high and with an innovative \n     private mortgage market meeting the needs of homeowners \n     across the income bracket, logic would strongly suggest \n     scaling back the FHA.\n       Instead of limiting such loan programs, however, the \n     Clinton Administration wants to increase the guaranteed loan \n     rate for the most affluent homeowners, making it possible for \n     higher-income individuals who cannot qualify for credit in \n     the private market to obtain taxpayer-insured loans. Why \n     should Americans, at any level of income, run the risk of \n     paying higher taxes to cover the potential mortgage defaults \n     of higher-income individuals with poor credit ratings?\n       The FHA loan program, which requires minimal payments yet \n     loses $4 billion per year, has a default rate of three times \n     the national average in comparison to the private sector. \n     Lacking any credible economic wisdom, we must assume that the \n     Clinton Administration will use the taxpayer-funded loans to \n     harvest votes.\n       The Congress should not place American taxpayers at a \n     higher risk of losses by increasing FHA's loan limits. \n     Americans for Tax Reform, and the undersigned groups, in \n     support of limiting the tax burden on all Americans, \n     considers such an increase as fiscally irresponsible and a \n     gross intrusion into the private market. On behalf of all \n     taxpayers, we applaud your efforts to defeat this provision.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Grover G.

Utt, Ph.D.)\n\n       As Congress moves to consider the House and Senate \n     appropriations bills for the Departments of Housing and Urban \n     Development (HUD) and Veterans Affairs (VA), lawmakers will \n     have to consider provisions to raise the maximum mortgage \n     amount that can be backed by the Federal Housing \n     Administration (FHA) insurance fund. If ultimately enacted \n     into law, these provisions would expand the federal \n     government's role even deeper into the residential mortgage \n     market, provide windfall profits to a select group of \n     mortgage financiers, undermine the viability of private \n     mortgage insurers, and expose the U.S. taxpayers to a costly \n     bailout for the already faltering FHA insurance fund.\n       Since early this year, the FHA has been confronting much-\n     higher-than-expected loan defaults and insurance claims. \n     According to budget data provided to Congress by HUD, the \n     FHA's 1997 property acquisitions through foreclosure were up \n     117 percent, or a staggering $2.3 billion, from initial \n     projections. The FHA further announced that it anticipated \n     this higher rate of foreclosure to continue,\n\n[[Page S8343]]\n\n     and that it was revising 1998 foreclosed property acquisition \n     estimates upward from an initial $1.9 billion to almost $4 \n     billion. The FHA's declining confidence in the quality of its \n     mortgage insurance portfolio has been justified by events. In \n     the first quarter of 1998, despite the booming economy and \n     rising employment throughout the United States, the FHA's \n     delinquency rate reached an all-time high of 8.35 percent, \n     meaning that nearly one in ten FHA borrowers were behind in \n     their payments. This compares with a default rate of just \n     2.91 percent on conventional mortgages, the market on which \n     the FHA seeks congressional approval to encroach.\n       Apparently having learned little from the devastating \n     collapse of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s and \n     the subsequent scandals that revealed shoddy underwriting \n     standards in billions of dollars of mortgages, some Members \n     of Congress are proposing that the FHA be allowed to insure a \n     greater share of the market by moving into riskier, higher-\n     valued mortgages. They also are recommending that the FHA's \n     minimum down-payment requirement be reduced from its already \n     inadequate levels. Minimal down-payment requirements under \n     current law allow the FHA to insure 99.6 percent of a \n     $100,000 loan, leaving little or no equity cushion to protect \n     FHA reserves in the event of loan default and/or foreclosure.\n       HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo has proposed that the FHA \n     maximum loan limit be increased to $227,150 throughout the \n     country, and that FHA's already generous down-payment \n     requirements be made even more generous. House and Senate \n     appropriators have agreed to propose much of what Cuomo is \n     asking for: upping the regional cap on the minimum loan \n     from $86,000 to $109,000, raising the maximum cap from \n     $170,000 to $197,000, and allowing borrowers to make an \n     even smaller down payment.\n       If enacted into law, these changes would worsen an already \n     deteriorating situation within the FHA's insured portfolio by \n     exposing it to disproportionately greater risks. With FHA \n     out-of-pocket losses typically running at a rate equivalent \n     to 30 percent of the value of the loan on the foreclosed \n     property, the unanticipated foreclosed property acquisitions \n     in 1997 and 1998 could lead to additional losses of $1.26 \n     billion against the FHA's reserves.\n       Rather than placing the taxpayer at far greater risk of \n     having to pick up the tab on foreclosed FHA-backed mortgages, \n     a better alternative for Congress to consider is an amendment \n     to the Senate bill that will be offered by a bipartisan \n     coalition composed of Senators Don Nickles (R-OK), Herbert \n     Kohl (D-WI), Connie Mack (R-FL), Wayne Allard (R-CO), and \n     Russell Feingold (D-WI). Their amendment would raise the \n     floor on the maximum-size mortgage the FHA can insure from \n     the current $86,000 to $109,000 to target first-time and \n     moderate-income home buyers more accurately while also \n     eliminating much of the windfall corporate welfare benefits \n     FHA mortgages bestow on some mortgage financiers. Whereas \n     conventional mortgages allow mortgage originators to keep \n     just 20 to 25 basis points in servicing fees, the FHA \n     currently allows them 44 basis points, which largely explains \n     the real estate industry's enthusiasm for the further \n     federalization of the market. Under the bipartisan \n     coalition's plan, these excessive servicing fees would be cut \n     back to 38 basic points, with the 6-basis-point difference \n     applied to the Government National Mortgage Association, a \n     part of HUD that repackages and reinsures FHA and VA \n     mortgages for final sale to investors.\n       Although the bipartisan coalition's amendment is a step in \n     the right direction, an even better alternative would be for \n     Congress to reject any expansion of the FHA's scope and \n     instead hold oversight hearings to determine the reason the \n     FHA and the mortgage originators that use the program have \n     done such a consistently poor job of maintaining the \n     financial integrity of a program that could be of \n     considerable value to first-time home buyers. By failing to \n     achieve underwriting standards common in the conventional \n     mortgage market, the existing management of the FHA has \n     exposed the U.S. taxpayer to the risk of a costly bailout and \n     made it likely that many more FHA home buyers will face the \n     humiliation and financial loss of foreclosure.\n       [Ronald D.

Congress should not increase FHA's loan limit to \n     enable borrowers making as much as $75,000 a year to use a \n     government program to buy a home.\n       The amendment also is a step in the right direction in \n     lowering lender incentives to steer borrowers to FHA-insured \n     mortgages when they may not be the best financing option. \n     Lenders now make nearly twice the amount servicing FHA loans \n     than they do servicing conventional loans. Your amendment \n     discourages lenders from inappropriate behavior by bringing \n     the fee they make on FHA loans more in line with private \n     sector fees--without any increase in the cost of an FHA loan \n     to consumers. Lowering lenders' fees on FHA loans even \n     further would serve as a more effective disincentive for such \n     anti-consumer lender action.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stephen Brobeck,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Taxpayers Union,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On behalf of the 300,000-member \n     National Taxpayers Union (NTU), I am writing to applaud your \n     opposition to any increase in FHA mortgage insurance \n     ceilings.\n       The Federal Housing Administration was created in 1934 to \n     fill a void in the marketplace created by the Depression. Its \n     aim has been to assist lower income families in obtaining \n     their first home through mortgage insurance and lower down \n     payments. Thanks to the enormous economic growth experienced \n     in America since World War II, first time homeowners' \n     reliance of FHA subsidized loans has fallen from 50% of the \n     market during the 1950s, to the current level of only 10%. \n     Yet, instead of trumpeting the success in lowering the number \n     of Americans reliant upon government assistance to enter the \n     housing market, the Clinton Administration is seeking to \n     expand this entitlement to the wealthiest 14% of American \n     households.\n       Now, some in Congress are pushing a ``compromise'' that \n     would raise the top FHA limit to $198,000 and the base FHA \n     limit to $109,000 (up from $86,000). This ``compromise'' will \n     expand FHA benefits to the richest 16% of Americans and will \n     direct FHA away from low and moderate income borrowers.\n       Defenders of the FHA note that the agency provides an \n     important resource to lower-income families and minorities \n     who wish to purchase a home. NTU fails to see how low income \n     families will be served by FHA loans to those in the middle-\n     to upper-class income range. This is especially curious since \n     approximately 90% of Americans at this income level already \n     own a home or have owned a home in the past. In most cases, \n     families in this income bracket who cannot obtain private \n     mortgages are trying to purchase homes out of their price \n     range. Apparently, supporters of raising the ceilings will \n     not be happy until every wealthy American owns a home at \n     government expense.\n       In fact, the evidence suggests that low income families \n     would actually be hurt by increasing the mortgage ceiling. A \n     recent GAO report shows that in 1994, the FHA insured only \n     24% of all loans made to minorities, 20% of all loans to low-\n     income families, and 21% of all loans to first time buyers--\n     all of whom the FHA was supposedly created to help. Under the \n     current system, the only means FHA has to direct loans to \n     these target groups is through the loan insurance ceilings. \n     Raising the ceilings would direct even less FHA assistance to \n     these presumably needy groups. Who can defend lessening \n     federal entitlements to the poor and minorities in order to \n     expand benefits to the richest Americans?\n       This move also represents an unnecessary government \n     intervention into the private sector--which could have \n     disastrous results. As a document prepared by the House \n     Banking Committee notes:\n       ``Since the FHA pays mortgage lenders significantly higher \n     servicing fees than either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac (.44% of \n     a loan value compared to .25%) and the agency assumes the \n     total risk, allowing the FHA to expand into this market would \n     skew the incentives of mortgage lenders against dealing with \n     private entities to no justifiable public end.''\n       In other words, the federal government would crowd private \n     mortgage insurers out of the home mortgage business, leaving \n     the government as the main mortgage insurer for most \n     Americans. What's next? The official U.S. Government Visa \n     card? This represents a clearly unneeded and harmful \n     intrusion into the private sector by the federal government \n     and should be stopped.\n       In fact, there is some question as to whether the FHA is \n     even necessary in today's market. Presently, home ownership \n     is at an all time high of 65.7%. In 1997 alone, there was a \n     27.7% surge in minority home ownership. Clearly, the days \n     when most Americans couldn't afford their own home are over.\n       While the need for the FHA has been decreasing, there has \n     been a serious increase in mismanagement at the FHA. In fact, \n     as recently as last year, the GAO designated the FHA as \n     ``high-risk.'' Within the last year, FHA was forced to change \n     its adjustable rate mortgage program as a result of high \n     losses caused by weak underwriting. A report prepared by the \n     House Banking Committee notes that:\n       ``[I]n 1997, the FHA fund paid 71,599 claims, an 18% \n     increase from the previous year. These foreclosures occurred \n     despite reforms to the FHA fund, the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990, a record low levels of \n     unemployment, increasing real wages, historically low \n     mortgage interest rates, and a period of sustained economic \n     prosperity since 1993. According to the Mortgage Bankers of \n     America, FHA delinquencies have\n\n[[Page S8344]]\n\n     risen by 23% since 1988. During that same period, Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Single Family Mortgage Guaranty Program \n     delinquencies rose at a much lower rate (only 9%) and \n     conventional mortgage delinquencies actually fell by 8%.''\n       Plainly, wise lending practices are not being followed by \n     the FHA. What the FHA needs is reform, not expansion.\n       To put it simply, Washington wants to expand an inefficient \n     federal program that barely helps those it is intended to \n     help in order to provide an entitlement to the richest 14% of \n     American families--done at the expense of low income and \n     minority families.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an editorial that was in the Wall Street Journal \non June 8 of this year talking about vote building, which is an \nexcellent editorial that talks about how this policy will hurt areas, \nlarge cities, blighted areas, and how this policy will increase, \nunfortunately, the plight of many, many neighborhoods, as well as the \nexposure to taxpayers.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [The Wall Street Journal, June 8, 1998]\n\n                            Review & Outlook\n\n\n                             vote building\n\n       It seemed like a worthy idea at the time. In 1934, when \n     Congress created the Federal Housing Administration, half the \n     nation's mortgage debt was in default. It was felt some \n     entity was needed to help home buyers who couldn't qualify \n     for conventional mortgages. Today, home ownership's at an \n     all-time high and an innovative private mortgage market keeps \n     coming up with new products to extend credit to low and \n     moderate income home buyers. Logic suggests scaling back the \n     FHA: instead, the Clinton Administration wants to make it \n     easier for the affluent to qualify for 100% taxpayer-insured \n     loans. This is intriguing.\n       FHA's share of the mortgage market has fallen to 9.1% in \n     1996 from 13.1% in 1990. This has prompted Housing and Urban \n     Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo to propose a plan he says \n     will let the FHA ``maintain its market share'' by increasing \n     its maximum loan amount to $227,150, a one-third increase \n     over current levels.\n       Not only would this reorient the program to higher-income \n     borrowers who don't need government help to purchase a home, \n     but it would increase the taxpayer risk of loans going sour. \n     Democratic Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin notes that the \n     default rate on FHA lending, which requires minimal down \n     payments, is almost three times as high as in the private \n     sector. This year, the FHA is losing $4 billion in loan \n     defaults.\n       Even at current loan levels, the FHA is having a perverse \n     effect on neighborhoods. The Chicago Area Fair Housing \n     Alliance issued a study this month that found the FHA's 100%-\n     backed loans offer service fees that are twice as large as \n     those for privately insured loans and that encourage mortgage \n     lenders to create loans likely to fail. The result is \n     clusters of abandoned and boarded-up homes in marginal \n     neighborhoods. ``Large inventories of FHA foreclosed, vacant \n     and deteriorating properties are found concentrated in \n     minority and racially changing areas,'' the study concluded. \n     ``It is this blight that creates the impression that racial \n     change causes neighborhood decline.''\n       There are better ways to open the housing market. Financing \n     isn't the only restraint on supply; there are politically \n     created obstacles. In 1991 a commission headed by then-HUD \n     Secretary Jack Kemp called for removing unnecessary barriers \n     to the creation of housing. New studies have estimated that \n     in high-priced California, where many new FHA loans would be \n     made, the amenity and code requirements can boost prices as \n     much as $60,000 a home.\n       Despite the taxpayer risks inherent in increasing the FHA \n     loan limit, the Clinton Administration is trying to sell the \n     expansion as a revenue raiser. Added premiums from FHA \n     mortgage insurance would add some $1 billion to the Treasury \n     over five years.\n       But it may also be an attempt to use a taxpayer-funded \n     program to harvest votes. The April 17 issue of the Housing \n     Affairs Letter, an internal industry newsletter, quoted a HUD \n     official as saying, ``The increase in the loan limit is vital \n     to the president's nationwide homeownership campaign, and if \n     it passes Congress, it will surely translate into votes in \n     the next presidential campaign.'' Former HUD Secretary Kemp \n     calls raising FHA loans limits a ``classic Clinton-Gore \n     strategy: courting suburbanites with proposals that they \n     could rationalize through the prism of politics, but couldn't \n     defend as sound policy.''\n       Under ideal conditions, a political playpen like the FHA \n     would be privatized and local governments encouraged to fine-\n     tune their zoning and code requirements to help home buyers \n     now frozen out of high-priced markets. But so long as that \n     doesn't happen, it makes little sense to expand FHA loans to \n     people with upper-middle-class incomes.\n       Who should be eligible for FHA loans? Why not restrict such \n     loans only to those families in the 15% tax bracket. If the \n     Clinton Administration wants to help more people buy homes, \n     it can lower the number of people subject to the steeper 28% \n     bracket, and at the same time provide them with more money to \n     meet the loan payments and avoid default. But with its more \n     upscale ``reform,'' it appears that the White House prefers \n     buying votes the old-fashioned way.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have a letter from Jack Kemp, who was \nformer Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, dated July 15, 1998. \nI will read one short paragraph. He says:\n\n       Your amendment will also stop a brash move by the \n     administration to push the FHA further and further away from \n     its core mission of supporting the home ownership dreams of \n     low- and moderate-income American families, a noble mission \n     that has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress.\n       The drive to raise the FHA loan limit to $197,000 is \n     motivated by a desire for votes in the fall elections. It \n     would take an income of about $75,000 a year to qualify for \n     such a loan, or the top 16% of wage earners.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     SH-133 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: I am writing to you today to support \n     your efforts to stop yet another attempt by the federal \n     government to expand its power, harm those it intends to \n     serve and trample on the private sector mortgage market. As \n     you know, I have opposed raising the FHA loan limits at all. \n     And the provision in the current HUD/VA Appropriations Bill \n     raising the limits to the proposed level would expose the \n     federal taxpayer to $10 billion in contingent liability. It \n     also would increase economic incentives for mortgage lenders \n     to steer borrowers to the FHA program even though it may not \n     be the best financing option. Therefore, I cannot support \n     raising the FHA loan limits a single dollar.\n       However, if you have concluded that the provision has \n     sufficient support to pass, I believe your amendment to raise \n     Ginnie Mae's guarantee fees from 6 to 12 basis points goes a \n     long way toward making a bad idea a livable one. And on its \n     own merits, I believe you have an excellent proposal. Without \n     costing a homebuyer an extra cent, your amendment removes the \n     incentive for mortgage companies to unnecessarily direct \n     buyers toward FHA loans. Currently, lenders make twice as \n     much in servicing fees from FHA loans than they do in \n     servicing conventional loans. Even though they require lower \n     downpayments, FHA loans are more costly to the borrower over \n     the life of the loan. By reducing lenders' fees for servicing \n     FHA loans, lenders will have less incentive to steer \n     borrowers to these higher cost FHA loans when they might have \n     qualified for cheaper conventional financing.\n       Furthermore, the point must be made that without your \n     amendment, the contingent liability on the American people \n     will increase by $10 billion. With FHA delinquencies already \n     at an all-time high, an economic slowdown or recession could \n     render the FHA insurance fund insolvent and that contingent \n     liability would come due.\n       Your amendment also will stop a brash move by the \n     administration to push the FHA further and further away from \n     its core mission of supporting the homeownership dreams of \n     low- and moderate-income American families, a noble mission \n     that has enjoyed bipartisan support in Congress.\n       The drive to raise the FHA loan limit to $197,000 is \n     motivated by a desire for votes in the fall elections. It \n     would take an income of about $75,000 a year to qualify for \n     such a loan, or the top 16% of wage earners. Among these \n     borrowers, 86% are homeowners today. It would make more sense \n     to target families making less than $50,000, 40% of whom own \n     their home, and can use the FHA program at today's levels.\n       I applaud you for your efforts to sensibly raise money for \n     housing programs and keep the FHA program true to its mission \n     of serving low- and moderate-income Americans.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n                                                        Jack Kemp.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me just conclude by stating that I regret coming in \nand opposing my friends and colleagues from Missouri and Maryland on \nthis issue. But if my memory serves, several years ago the Senator from \nMaryland and I wrestled with this issue on the floor of the Senate.\n  At that time there was an effort for people to raise the limits. I \nsaid, ``Wait a minute. Why are we having the Federal Government \nguaranteeing more and more loans?'' Home ownership, I might mention, in \nthis country is at an all-time high. I think that is great. Most of \nthat is done in the private sector. It just so happens FHA is losing \nits percentage share as the private sector has exploded. I think that \nis good.\n  I think this increase is an effort by the Secretary of Housing to \nsay, ``Wait a minute. We want the Federal Government to be making more \nloans.'' I also think it is also driven by a desire to generate more \nmoney for the Government. Because as you increase the loan\n\n[[Page S8345]]\n\nlimits, you increase the fees, and so on, and that allows the \nGovernment to spend more money.\n  I will not get too technical on the budget, but if the committee \nraises money through fees and so on, that allows them to stay within \nthe ``budget caps'' because they get an offset for the increase in \nfees, and as a result, by increasing the fees both on the bottom and \nthe top, the committee is going to get about an extra $80 million a \nyear over and above the budget that we agreed to last year, that the \nPresident signed. I am not saying it is not within the rules of the \nCongress. I am just saying I think it is an attempt to have more money \nto spend. I personally am somewhat troubled by that.\n  Under existing law, loan rates on both the low end and the top end \nhave already increased. They increased on the low end from $81,000 to \n$86,000. This committee bill increases it to $109,000. We do not touch \nthat. I think maybe we should, but we do not.\n  Our amendment just says we should not increase the top limit from \n$170,000--keep in mind, last year's was $160,000--to $197,000. A \n$10,000 increase in Federal Government loan guarantees in the high \nincome areas, surely that is enough. The committee wants to take it \nalmost $200,000. I think that is a serious mistake. I think that takes \nFHA away from its core mission. FHA's mission was to help low- and \nmoderate-income people, not the wealthiest 15 percent of society.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment. We will be \nvoting on it early tomorrow morning. I think it is very important that \nwe protect taxpayers from greater risk, and that we keep FHA focused on \nlow and moderate income home buyers. I thank my colleague from \nWisconsin for his leadership and support on this amendment, his \ncoauthorship of this amendment, as well as my colleague, Senator Mack, \nfrom Florida, who happens to be chairman of the authorizing committee. \nI also want to thank Senators Faircloth, Allard, and Feingold for their \nsupport in trying to eliminate this expansion of the higher income \nlimits for FHA.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is always good to see our former \ncolleague on the VA-HUD committee come to the floor to talk about the \ndifficult issues. We certainly appreciate his kind comments.\n  The VA-HUD-Independent Agencies is a very challenging and interesting \narea. He raised the question about the increase in spending; and to \nexplain that will perhaps give my colleagues some idea why this is such \na complex area.\n  The total spending includes--total spending is about $93 billion--\nincludes $22 billion in mandatory spending for veterans administration \ncategories. That is about a $4 billion increase over fiscal year 1998. \nThe increase is attributable largely to the following--about a $1.5 \nbillion increase in veterans administration, primarily mandatory \nspending, things over which our subcommittee has no control.\n  In addition, there is, HUD figures, about $2.6 billion over last \nyear's figure. And that is because money was taken from section 8 \ncontracts earlier in the year to pay for a supplemental. This is the \nbudget that is always raided. And the broader Appropriations Committee \nhas raided these section 8 contracts. That would be good except for the \nfact that the cost of renewing section 8 contracts in HUD continues to \nescalate.\n  In fiscal year 1997, we needed $3.6 billion in budget authority to \nrenew existing section 8 contracts. Because we had moved to shorter and \nshorter term contracts, from multiyear contracts down to 2-year and 1-\nyear contracts, it then shot up to $8.2 billion in budget authority for \nfiscal year 1998, the current year; and it jumps to $11.1 billion in \nfiscal year 1999. That is the result of the length of the contracts.\n  But it means, in order to continue providing the same assistance we \ndo currently under section 8, we have to have about $2.9 billion more \nin budget authority for fiscal year 1999 than we did for fiscal year \n1998. If you say we do not want to increase it, it means, in essence, \nthat we are going to have to take away section 8 housing contracts and \nkick people out. That is just a simple choice.\n  I must oppose the amendment of my good friend from Oklahoma to strike \nthe increase in FHA mortgage insurance limits for high-cost areas and \nto offset that with an increase of 6 basis points to the fees that \nGinnie Mae charges for servicing costs.\n  The first point we need to make is that the FHA mortgage insurance \nincrease is a bipartisan proposal, a bipartisan congressional proposal, \nthat enjoys wide support from both Republicans and Democrats in this \nbody. I do not see this modest increase as growing government. Rather, \nthe FHA mortgage increase represents an approach to fill a gap that \nallows Americans of modest means--moderate-income Americans--to own \ntheir own homes, one of the great American dreams for all families.\n  The FHA was established in 1934 as a result of nearly impossible \nlending conditions during the Great Depression, and in over 60 years \nthe public-private partnership of FHA and private lenders has enabled \nmore than 25 million families to realize the dream of home ownership. \nMoreover, the FHA Mortgage Insurance Program supplements and \ncomplements the role of private mortgage insurance by assisting \nfamilies who do not have adequate resources to meet the private \nmortgage markets' downpayment requirement, which is often 20 percent of \nthe mortgage amount.\n  While the private mortgage insurance market has made tremendous \nstrides in providing new products to assist families in purchasing \nhomes, many families would be unable to purchase their home without the \nbenefit of FHA mortgage insurance. In brief, the Senate VA-HUD fiscal \nyear 1999 appropriations bill provides modest increases in the FHA \nmortgage insurance limits, raising the floor from 38 percent of the \nFreddie Mac conforming loan limit, or about $86,000, to 48 percent of \nthe conforming loan limit, or some $109,000. It establishes a new \nceiling for high-cost areas from the existing 75 percent of the \nconforming loan limit, or some $170,000, to 87 percent of the \nconforming loan limit, or some $197,000.\n  And let me indicate where these higher loan limits would be \nimplemented. Right now--this is a chart which shows the United States. \nThe colors of the chart indicate where the low rate, the base limit, is \nin place. These are the areas in blue. This is where the base lending \nrate would go from $86,000 to roughly $109,000.\n  The green areas on here are 95 percent of the local median.\n  The high-low rate, the one which is being challenged in this \namendment which is raised to $197,000, would be in these few red areas \non the East Coast--essentially, Boston, New York, Washington, DC area, \nDenver, CO, and California along the coastline. The rest of the country \nis not affected by the increases in the higher-end loan limit.\n  I think the legislation seeks to strike a reasonable balance to \npromote additional home ownership and would allow home ownership for \nsome 30,000 families, 20,000 in high-cost areas and 10,000 basically \nnonurban areas. In particular, these new FHA mortgage insurance limits \nwill help in nonurban areas where the price of new housing has \nescalated beyond the capacity of first-time home buyers to use FHA \nmortgage insurance to buy a house in some areas because the FHA lower-\nlimits financing is not available for construction of first homes for \nfamilies of workers with lower wages.\n  The problem is that the existing FHA mortgage insurance limits do not \nreflect the higher cost of new homes. New homes cost more than existing \nhomes because of the cost of materials and labor. In addition, there \nare many other expenses. For example, the cost to develop new housing \nsubdivisions is expensive because of the cost of utility hookups, \nenvironmental requirements, local taxes and surcharges for things like \nschools, roads, fire protection, as well as the cost of buildable land. \nCurrently, the median price for a new home is $142,000, while the \nmedian price for an existing home is $126,500, for a $15,500 \ndifference.\n  Now, this difference is very important for Missouri as well as the \nrest of the Nation. Home ownership in housing construction has been and \nalways will be a locomotive for the U.S. economy. In addition to the \njobs created through\n\n[[Page S8346]]\n\nthe development of new housing, many nonurban areas in particular will \nbe able to provide the affordable housing that is so critical to \nattracting new business and to maintaining existing businesses.\n  I have talked with people in areas just outside the metropolitan \nKansas, MO area, in areas of north Missouri, where they are benefiting \nfrom new jobs coming into the area but they are strangled because the \nnew jobs bring in people who can't get housing. They can't get \naffordable housing. This is one of the critical needs for people in \nthose areas so that they can continue to create jobs and see their \ncommunities grow. They need to have affordable housing. I am hoping \nthat the raising of the lower limit will enable them to get FHA \nfinancing and build new homes.\n  Now, I don't want to confuse anyone. As I said, Senator Nickles' \namendment does not seek to reduce the increase to the FHA mortgage \ninsurance floor, the one I was just talking about, as provided in the \nVA-HUD 1999 appropriations bill. Senator Nickles' concern, as well as \nthose of his colleagues, is that the proposed new mortgage insurance \nlimit of $197,000 for high-cost areas is too high. In particular, in a \n``Dear Colleague'' letter, Senators Nickles, Mack, Allard, Kohl, and \nFeingold state that to qualify for a mortgage of $197,000, a family \nwould need an income of at least $75,000. Well, $197,000 is a lot of \nmoney for a house. That cost, however, is the reality in many areas and \nit needs to be addressed.\n  In addition, I think it is fair to say that $75,000 is not an \nextraordinary amount of income for a family. For example, it means that \na two-income family, a schoolteacher and a firefighter, will be able to \nlive in a community in which they serve. This is important. I do not \nthink we should lose sight of the importance of mixed-income \ncommunities while providing opportunities for home ownership.\n  Moreover, as part of Secretary Kemp's FHA reform initiative as \nenacted in the National Affordable Housing Act, Price Waterhouse \nconducts an actuarial review of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund \non an annual basis. From the perspective of actuarial soundness, NAHA \nmandated a fund to achieve a capital ratio of at least 2 percent by \nfiscal year 2000. However, the fund reached a capital ratio of 2.81 \npercent in fiscal year 1997 and is expected to reach 3.21 percent by \nfiscal year 2000. Moreover, the projected economic value of the Mutual \nMortgage Insurance Fund was $11.3 billion at the end of fiscal year \n1997. This represents a more than $14 billion increase in the value of \nthe fund since Secretary Kemp's reforms in 1990, when it was a negative \n$2.7 billion.\n  In addition, the FHA Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program is \nself-sustaining, has not cost the American taxpayer any money in its \nentire existence. Insurance premiums and loan loss recovery proceeds \npay for all costs incurred in the administration of the program, \nleaving sufficient reserves from an actuarial perspective to pay all \nfuture claims.\n  I note that Senators Nickles, Mack, and Faircloth have developed a \nnumber of very worthwhile reforms to the FHA mortgage insurance program \nwhich have been agreed to and will be included in the next managers' \namendment. As with my colleagues, I remain concerned over HUD's \ncapacity to administer its many programs, including its FHA mortgage \ninsurance programs. These FHA management reforms would require that \neach lender provide a comparison of FHA mortgage funding with three of \na lender's most frequently employed mortgage loan structures, an annual \nstudy by GAO on steering by lenders to FHA, and a requirement that HUD \nsubmit an initial report within 60 days annually on how HUD plans to \ncorrect mortgage problems in the FHA Single Family Mortgage Insurance \nProgram.\n\n  Finally, I have concerns about any changes to the Ginnie Mae \nservicing structure. I have been advised that any change in the \nservicing fee will likely result in increased home ownership costs to \nfamilies, with estimates that it could cost consumers some $250 million \nper year and price some 15,000 home buyers out of the market each year.\n  I have a letter from a significant group of veterans organizations \nthat I will place at the end of my statement for the Record from the \nAMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Non Commissioned Officers \nAssociation, Blind Veterans Association, and Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, saying that any increase in Ginnie Mae fees will result in an \nadded cost to lenders which will invariably be passed on to VA loan \nrecipients. We estimate that even just a 6-basis-point increase in the \nGinnie Mae guarantee fee will cost VA borrowers over $67 million \nannually, with a typical veteran paying over $250 in upfront closing \ncosts. With the veterans already struggling to afford their first \nhomes, this cost increase would be devastating.\n  I expect the argument of my colleagues will be that lenders currently \nreceive a fee for servicing FHA-insured mortgages of 38 basis points, \nalmost double the fee that lenders receive for servicing loans in the \nprivate sector. For example, as opposed to the 38 basis points lenders \nreceive in service fees under FHA, lenders receive between 20 and 25 \nbasis points for servicing fees associated with conventional mortgages \nguaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Nevertheless, Ginnie Mae \noperates significantly different from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nparticularly when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take on the responsibility \nthat all security holders receive their payments, whereas the servicer \nis responsible for the pass-through on a Ginnie Mae security, and where \na servicer fails, it is no longer permitted to participate in a Ginnie \nMae program. That is a significant responsibility and merits additional \nfees.\n  I send this letter of July 14 to the desk. It happens to be addressed \nto the distinguished occupant of the Chair. This is a letter from \nAMVETS, Disabled Veterans, Non Commissioned Officers, Blind Veterans, \nand the Association of Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Wayne Allard,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Allard: The Senate is scheduled to consider \n     the FY 99 VA/HUD Appropriations bill, S. 2168 in the next few \n     days. As organizations that share a deep commitment to our \n     nation's veterans, we ask that you oppose any amendments to \n     increase the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee. Specifically, this fee \n     increase would mean added costs to veterans taking out VA \n     mortgages. Quite simply, this policy would make homeownership \n     more expensive for veterans.\n       Because VA mortgages are typically placed into mortgage-\n     backed securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, the VA home loan \n     program is linked to the capital markets. This link means \n     lower cost mortgage funds for veteran borrowers. Ginnie Mae, \n     which charges lenders a fee for the guaranty, makes the whole \n     process possible.\n       However, any increase in Ginnie Mae fees will result in an \n     added cost to lenders, which will invariably be passed on to \n     VA loan recipients. We estimate that even just a six basis \n     point increase in the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee would cost VA \n     borrowers over $67 million annually--with the typical veteran \n     paying over $250 more in up-front closing costs. With many \n     veterans already struggling to afford their first homes, this \n     cost increase could be devastating.\n       Please vote against any amendments to increase the Ginnie \n     Mae guaranty fee.\n           Sincerely,\n     AMVETS.\n     Disabled American Veterans.\n     Non Commissioned Officers Association of the USA.\n     Blinded Veterans Association.\n     Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I urge my colleagues, when the vote is held on this very \nimportant amendment tomorrow morning, that they oppose this amendment. \nI believe the time has come to provide this modest increase in the loan \nlimits, and I hope our colleagues will support the committee in this \neffort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles. As my \ncolleagues know, this amendment would strike the increase to the high-\nend FHA loan limit included in the VA/HUD bill.\n  FHA is intended to fill an important mission--helping low- and \nmiddle-income Americans purchase their first\n\n[[Page S8347]]\n\nhomes--helping those who are not served by the private market.\n  For this reason, our amendment leaves the proposed increase to the \nlow-end FHA loan limit in place, ensuring that in the vast majority of \nStates across the country--97 percent of the counties in the United \nStates--the loan limit will be more than sufficient for low- to \nmoderate-income people to purchase homes of their own.\n  But we should all be reminded that any decision to raise the loan \nlimits on the high end should be approached with caution. FHA loans are \n100 percent insured by the Federal Government. If a home owner goes \ninto default, it is the taxpayer, not the lender, that bares the risk. \nAnd that's no small risk--FHA default rates are three times higher than \ndefaults on conventional mortgages. Last year, foreclosures on FHA \nhomes resulted in over $5 billion in claims.\n  There is no reason to extend that risk on behalf of home buyers who \nare already well-served by the private market. Raising the high end \nlimit and expanding FHA to cover expensive homes may very well \njeopardize the health of the entire program. Higher priced home loans, \nespecially when combined with the relatively low downpayments required \nby FHA, default more often--and obviously cost more when they default. \nRaising the high end limit would clearly place the Federal Government \nin competition with the private sector, needlessly expose taxpayers to \nmore risk, and give upper income home buyers access to mortgage credit \nthey don't need.\n  Changing the high end limit will steer the program away from working \nfamilies--at a higher cost to taxpayers--with more devastation to the \ncommunities that hold abandoned, foreclosed-upon FHA properties.\n  With this amendment, we have the chance to ensure that the program \nstays focused on borrowers who legitimately need help and also to \ncreate a strong, healthy FHA that works for everyone--home buyers, \nlenders, and the taxpayers.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Nickles amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Nickles, Senator Kohl and Senator Mack in supporting this \namendment to strike language raising the ceiling on mortgage limits \ninsured by the Federal Housing Administration.\n  Mr. President, the appropriations bill we are currently considering \nincludes language that would raise the ceiling on the Federal Housing \nAdministration's loan limit from the current level of 75% of the \nconforming loan limit--approximately $170,000--to 87% of the conforming \nloan limit, which is approximately $197,000.\n  Mr. President, it is--quite frankly--astounding to me that Congress \nis considering action that would raise the FHA loan limit. In a time \nwhen Congress needs to be focusing on balancing the budget, it is truly \nironic to me that some members seem to want to increase the burden to \ntaxpayers by expanding a government program into an area already well-\nserved by the private sector. In case you or any of our colleagues is \nwondering, a $197,000 loan translates to a house worth over $200,000. \nTo afford such a house, a family would have to have annual earnings of \nover $75,000--an income level that only about 16% of American families \nare at. I don't know about you, Mr. President, but in Wisconsin, we \ndon't consider folks who own $200,000 homes to be ``needy.'' These \nupper-income families are already well-served by the private market.\n  Mr. President, the arguments against raising FHA loan limits are \noverwhelming: HUD's own FY 1999 Budget proposal predicts a 100% \nincrease in the default rate for 1998--totaling $4 billion. The very \nsame Committee Report seeking to raise the loan limits also \nacknowledges, and I quote, ``concern[s] about HUD's capability to \nmanage the FHA mortgage insurance programs and the potential exposure \nof the Federal Government if there is an economic downturn.'' Since \n1990, while the mortgage delinquency rate in the conventional market \nfell by 8%, the FHA delinquency rate rose by 23%. FHA backs 100% of \nevery loan it insures, and so those delinquencies and defaults are \nborne 100% by taxpayers. It would seem to me, Mr. President, that those \nwho seek to increase FHA's loan-limits are sending a strong message \nthat they are willing to let American taxpayers pick-up the tab.\n  Mr. President, I have here a letter from the National Taxpayers Union \nto Congressman Bob Livingston, Chair of the House Appropriations \nCommittee. The letter, which I would ask be inserted in the record, \nsums-up--I think very nicely--the manifold concerns with increasing the \nloan limit ceiling:\n\n       Defenders of the FHA note that the agency provides an \n     important resource to lower-income familes and minorities who \n     wish to purchase a home. NTU fails to see how low-income \n     families will be served by FHA loans to those in the middle-\n     to upper-class income range . . . Apparently, supporters of \n     raising the ceilings will not be happy until every wealthy \n     American owns a home at government expense.\n\n  It would seem to me, Mr. President, that rather than raising the FHA \nloan limits, Congress needs to be thinking critically about what steps \nwe can take to improve the actuarial safety and soundness of FHA \nprograms so that it can continue to help working families purchase \ntheir homes. Rather than expanding the program for the benefit of \nupper-income borrowers and special interest groups, we ought to be \nthinking about how we can make sure those working families of modest \nmeans are truly being served by the existing FHA programs.\n  Mr. President, the amendment my colleagues and I are introducing \ntoday would remove language raising the FHA loan limit ceiling and \nincrease the Ginnie Mae guaranty fee by 12 basis points. I believe that \nraising the loan limit ceiling to $197,000 is fiscally irresponsible, \nunnecessarily expands a government program into an area already well-\nserved by the private sector, and distracts the FHA from its mission to \nserve lower-income home-buyers. I hope my colleagues will give careful \nconsideration to these concerns and support our amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Nickles \namendment. The simple fact is that the Nickles amendment would greatly \nreduce the availability of FHA loans, which have helped millions of \nfirst-time, low-income and minority home buyers share in the American \ndream of home ownership. S. 2168, before us, currently includes a \nprovision that would expand the FHA loan limits in high-cost markets \nonly--in high-cost markets only--from a current cap of $170,000 to a \nnew cap of $197,000 in such high-cost markets. My able colleague from \nMissouri earlier indicated on a map where those markets would be \nlocated.\n  Now, the committee's proposal represents, I think, a very significant \nand appropriate compromise to the administration's request. The \nadministration's request was to institute a single, nationwide loan \nlimit of $227,000. The committee did not go down that path. The \ncommittee, instead, went down the path of raising the lower limit \nwhich, interestingly enough, this amendment does not try to strike, \napparently, according to my colleague from Oklahoma, because of just \npolitical realities of the matter, and also raise the high-cost limit, \nmaintaining that distinction. I think it represents a very significant \ncompromise. I urge my colleagues to support the committee and to reject \nthe amendment.\n  Now, we are experiencing a time when almost two-thirds of American \nfamilies own their own homes today. This would not have been possible \nwithout the FHA Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program. Each year, \nabout 700,000 Americans purchase homes using FHA insurance. The vast \nmajority of these home buyers could not qualify for a conventional home \nloan. If the FHA weren't available, they would not have been able to \nbreak into the ranks of homeowners.\n  The point is made that the default rate within the FHA is somewhat \ngreater, at 8 percent, than it is in the private insurance market. But \nthat is because, of course, the FHA is making this opportunity \navailable to people who would otherwise be closed out of the market \naltogether. Of course, the reverse side of the 8 percent is the 92 \npercent who were able to break into the home ownership market.\n  It is estimated that 77 percent of first-time home buyers and 85 \npercent of minority home buyers who use FHA\n\n[[Page S8348]]\n\nwould not have qualified for private mortgage insurance. And since the \nFHA insurance premium is financed through borrower premiums, it does \nnot end up costing the taxpayer.\n  One of the difficulties is that FHA insurance, at a set figure, \ncannot be utilized effectively in all parts of the country. Nationwide, \nthere are 43 metropolitan areas, representing 25 percent of the \npopulation, which are capped at the current ceiling of $170,000. In 32 \nout of the 43 metropolitan areas, the median home price exceeds the \n$170,000 figure. So at the $170,000 figure, in 32 of the 43 \nmetropolitan areas, the median home price exceeds that figure. In \nMaryland, half of our counties--12 of our 24 countries--are now capped \nat $170,000. Now, by striking the provision in S. 2168 which raises the \nloan limits in high-cost areas to $197,000, the result of the Nickles \namendment would be that hundreds of thousands of Americans would be \ndenied the opportunity to purchase modestly priced homes simply because \nthey live and work in high-cost parts of the country.\n  These are not wealthy Americans. These are teachers, policemen, and \nfiremen who serve in communities where they often cannot afford to \nlive. Now, this isn't just unfortunate, this is also unfair. What has \nto be understood is that a limit that will work in one part of the \ncountry will not work in another part of the country. In other words, \nif you say, well, we ought to give moderate-income people an \nopportunity to have home ownership, you have some parts of the country \nwhere the cost of housing is low, incomes are lower, costs are lower, a \nwhole different dynamic works, and other parts of the country where \ncosts are much higher and housing costs in particular are much higher.\n  I can take you on a very short ride from here to jurisdictions where \nordinary working people would not have a chance at home ownership, \nexcept through the FHA program. We need to raise those limits in those \nareas because the median housing cost is now well above the existing \ncap.\n  Furthermore, I want to know--because of the split which the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has made where he said he doesn't go after the lower \nlimits, which, of course, have a much broader application throughout \nthe country--the Nickles amendment imposes substantial increases in \nGinnie Mae user fees. This imposes a double hit on consumers. First, \nthe increased cost to lenders will be passed along to FHA consumers in \nthe form of higher interest rates and/or larger downpayments. Second, \nFHA lenders may opt out of the program if the cost of participation \nbecomes too high.\n  The net result of these changes, the increase in the Ginnie Mae user \nfees, would be a substantial reduction in FHA use and availability even \nwithin the current loan limits. And to those of my colleagues who do \nnot have high-cost areas in their State, I point out that the Nickles \namendment provision to increase the Ginnie Mae user fees would hurt all \nFHA users regardless of the size of their loans. By contrast, S. 2168 \nwould increase FHA participation without placing a cost on the \ntaxpayers or any additional financial burdens upon FHA consumers.\n  Mr. President, the FHA program has helped millions of Americans \npurchase homes who would not otherwise qualify. The FHA program serves \na much higher percentage of first-time, low- and moderate-income and \nminority home buyers than any conventional loan product.\n  If we as a Nation are committed to supporting home ownership for all \nAmericans, we should reaffirm our commitment to the FHA program.\n  I really want to commend the committee, I think, for the very careful \nbalance which they developed. This is a far departure from what the \nadministration's request was. In fact, I think the committee obviously \ntook into account the number of points that had been raised by \nproponents of the Nickles amendment in making their calculations and \nreaching their judgments in terms of what to do. But unless we raise \nthe cap in the high-cost markets, they are really going to get excluded \nfrom the possibility of home ownership. People really qualify as low- \nand moderate-income people in those high-cost areas. The Nickles \namendment allows the floor figure to come up, which in those areas of \nthe country means that the very sort of people that I am concerned \nabout in the high-cost areas would, in fact, not be able to obtain home \nownership. I don't think the people in the high-cost areas who confront \na whole different economic circumstance ought to be denied that \nopportunity.\n  This program has been enormously important and successful in moving \nAmericans into home ownership who would not otherwise have had that \nopportunity.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Nickles amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nickles amendment.\n  At the outset, I want to say to the chairman of the VA-HUD \nSubcommittee, both to Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski, that I \ncongratulate them for their effort in putting together what is \ngenerally a good and balanced HUD appropriations bill.\n  As chairman of the HUD's authorizing subcommittee, I appreciate the \ndifficulty of funding the most important parts of HUD's mission, while \nalso addressing the critical need of the Department to reform its \nmanagement and operations.\n  I especially appreciate Senator Bond's cooperation in helping ensure \nthe effective implementation of the section 8 ``mark-to-market'' \nprogram we enacted last year. However, on the issue of FHA loan limits, \nSenator Bond and I disagree.\n  I am concerned that the Appropriations Committee did not consider the \nviews of the authorizing committee. This is a major policy change that \nis being implemented through the appropriations process despite \nevidence gathered in hearings that would indicate that the change is \nill-advised.\n  Last month, the Housing Opportunity and Community Development \nSubcommittee held two days of oversight hearings on FHA. The \nSubcommittee heard extensive testimony from HUD, GAO, the HUD Inspector \nGeneral and outside witnesses on the programs, operations and mission \nof FHA, and on proposals for reform. I heard little testimony at those \nhearings that made a compelling case to raise the FHA loan limit. As \nchairman of the authorizing subcommittee, I would not have recommended \nan increase in the loan limits.\n  This bill does not contain the Administration's initial proposal for \nraising the loan limits--a proposal I strongly oppose. However, the \nproposal contained in the bill does focus attention away from the \ntraditional mission of FHA of serving low- and moderate-income families \nand first-time home buyers. Further, it covers up some of the \nfundamental problems in the FHA single-family insurance program that \njeopardize its long-term stability.\n  This proposal would result in targeting FHA, in part, to households \nwell above median income, the vast majority of whom are already \nhomeowners. An increase in the maximum mortgage amount would do little \nto help the households that FHA is intended to serve, namely moderate \nincome families who for one reason or another do not have access to the \nconventional mortgage market.\n  Mr. President, Senator Nickles, I think, did a good job of arguing \nhis position, and the points that Senator Sarbanes raised is one of the \ncentral areas of debate.\n  I would like to focus my attention on some other aspects of FHA. I \nwant to focus the bulk of my comments now on a series of management \nproblems in FHA which should be corrected before FHA expands its \nprogram and assumes further risks.\n  At a Housing Subcommittee hearing in May, we heard testimony \nconcerning serious material weaknesses in internal controls, financial \nsystems and resource management that make the Department vulnerable to \nwaste, fraud and mismanagement. Although HUD is in the process of a \nmajor management reform program, the ultimate success of that effort is \nquestionable.\n  FHA, with about $400 billion of insurance-in-force and a portfolio of \n6.7 million single-family loans, is HUD's largest, most visible--and \nmost vulnerable--program area. Many of the material weaknesses \nidentified and described by the HUD Inspector General,\n\n[[Page S8349]]\n\nthe General Accounting Office and others, involve FHA programs. \nFurther, these problems have been identified in each independent audit \nof FHA conducted since fiscal year 1991.\n  First, FHA's staffing resources have significantly declined over the \npast several years. Furthermore, the majority of staffing reductions \nthat have already occurred or are planned under HUD's 2020 Management \nReform come out of FHA's single-family operations. FHA's staffing \nresources have declined during a period where its insured portfolio has \ncontinued to increase. In 1992, FHA's staff was about 6,800, but today, \nits staff is down to around 4,100. This is equivalent to a 40 percent \nreduction. This raises concerns about the quality of skilled staff that \nremain at FHA today, since many senior staff have left the Department. \nReplacing this staff is problematic, since unlike private entities, FHA \ndoes not have the authority to hire staff or the ability to quickly \ninvest more resources in automated tools or staff training when its \nbusiness increase.\n  Second, FHA has serious weaknesses with its accounting and financial \nmanagement systems. The main problems with its information system is \nthat the systems are not linked and integrated or configured to meet \nall financial reporting requirements. Also, data quality problems exist \nin its default monitoring system. Although these problems have been \nrecognized for several years. The HUD Inspector General has found that \n``resources needed to develop state-of-the-art systems are lacking'' \nbecause of budgetary constraints or the lack of prioritizing these \nmatters.\n  FHA's accounting and financial management systems will also be \naffected by the so-called ``Year 2000'' or ``Y2K'' problem. FHA has 19 \ncritical systems that OMB has mandated to be Y2K compliant by March \n1999. However, only two systems have been programmed to address Y2K, \nand neither has been certified as Y2K compliant. The GAO recently \nwarned that failure to address the Y2K problem could result in system \nfailures that would interrupt the processing of applications for \nmortgage insurance and the payment of mortgage insurance claims.\n  Third, data integrity problems with its default monitoring system has \naffected FHA's ability to effectively monitor the performance of its \nmortgagees. FHA also lacks an effective underwriting system that can \npredict which borrowers pose the greatest risk. Identifying and \nmanaging risk is absolutely critical to the long-term soundness of FHA.\n  While FHA's single-family insurance fund currently exceeds its \ncapital reserve requirement, there have been recent indications \nof potential problems in the FHA program. If these problems are not \ncorrected, then FHA faces financial instability. For example, FHA \ndefaults are serveral times higher than either the VA or the \nconventional mortgage market. During fiscal year 1997 claim payments \nfor FHA-insured loans, especially for adjustable rate mortgages, were \nfar higher than expected. The inventory of single-family properties \nowned by HUD increased by about 30 percent to more than 30,000. We have \nalso heard and seen evidence that the geographic concentration of \nmortgage defaults, and FHA's inability to manage and monitor its \nportfolio, have damaged neighborhoods and permitted families to \npurchase homes that are either substandard or unafforable. In addition, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac have recently introduced lower down payment \nmortgage products that may attract some of FHA's lower-risk borrowers, \nleaving FHA with more of the high-risk market.\n\n  There is no denying that the FHA single-family insurance program has \nbeen a success. More than 24 million households have used FHA since its \ncreation in 1934. FHA has traditionally been a preferred tool for \nhomeownership by young families and first-time homebuyers and by lower \nincome and minority households who for many reasons have not been \nserved well by the conventional marketplace. And, thanks to reforms \nbegun under Secretary Jack Kemp, FHA has made significant strides \ntoward financial stability. I have a strong interest in ensuring that \nFHA take all of the necessary steps to ensure that it continues to \nserve the people and communities the program is intended to serve and \nwill ultimately make the program more financially stable.\n  However,I question whether it is prudent for any business, let alone \none ultimately subsidized by the taxpayer, to expand its operations \nwhile attempting to deal with serious management problems. And on the \nbasis of this concern alone, an increase in FHA loan limits would not \nbe prudent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER, Mr. President, I take the floor to stand in opposition to \nthe amendment that would strike the raise in the ceiling on the Federal \nHousing Administration loan limit. I believe the raise in the ceiling \nis critical for high cost real estate market areas, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  This bill raises the ceiling on FHA loans from 75 percent of the \nFreddie Mac conforming loan limit, which is about $170,000, to 87 \npercent of the conforming loan limit, or about $197,000. This is \nparticularly good for my state, where the cost of housing is so high, \nespecially in Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n  FHA loans encourages lenders to make mortgage credit available in \nareas and to borrowers who may not otherwise qualify for conventional \nloans on affordable terms, such as first-time home buyers. Raising the \nloan limit will help those who have not been able to get conventional \nloans because of small credit blemishes or a lack of a large cash \ndownpayment. These are the gaps in homeownership that FHA now fills, \nacross income levels, and home prices.\n  This is a modest proposal, and one that helps consumers residing in \nhigh-cost areas of the country who are currently locked out of housing \nbecause the FHA maximum of $170,362 is less than the average cost of \nhousing.\n  The cost of housing is so high in the Bay Area, that Bridge Housing \nCorporation rarely uses FHA. Carol Galante, the president of Bridge, \none of the largest non-profit housing developers in the country, says \nshe rarely can use FHA insurance because the loan limits are so far \nbelow the median home price for Northern California.\n  Raising the FHA loan limit will enable FHA to reach more borrowers \nand more communities which are not currently being served by the \nprivate mortgage industry. The raise in the FHA loan limit as provided \nfor in this bill will help between 125,000 and 175,000 worthy American \nfamilies, including 16,500 to 23,100 California families, to have \naccess to homeownership over the next 5 years.\n  In the 15 highest cost U.S. housing markets, the homeownership rate \nis only 58%. That is more than 7 percentage points below the national \naverage, and in these markets, FHA is the only credit program not \navailable to moderate-income households. Thus, in places like New York, \nBoston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, over 7% of families are \nsystematically denied access to homeownership. This increase in the \nloan limit will allow 18 counties in California to raise their loan \nlimits.\n  The increase in the loan limit will generate revenues of about $80 \nmillion a year. FHA has never called upon the taxpayers for a bailout, \nand certainly will not under this proposal.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Nickles \namendment.\n  I wish to associate myself with the remarks by the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, as well as the \nsenior Senator from Maryland, Mr. Sarbanes, who also is the ranking \nmember on the Housing, Banking, and Urban Affairs Committee. Senator \nSarbanes outlined, I think in rather solid, logical terms, exactly why \nthe Nickles amendment really is, though well-intentioned, flawed in its \npublic policy ramifications, as did Senator Bond.\n  I must say that initially, when Secretary Cuomo came and presented \nthis idea, I really raised my eyebrows. I thought, my gosh, FHA--he \nwanted to raise the limit to $227,000. That is a quarter of a million \ndollars. That is a lot of money. Now, from the time I either chaired \nthe subcommittee or now, as ranking, it has been my passion and my \ncommitment to public policy to expand opportunities for first-time home \nownership, and two significant tools\n\n[[Page S8350]]\n\nwere in the VA-HUD Subcommittee--the VA mortgage itself, which has been \na significant empowerment tool for minorities and for others who might \nhave been really segregated out of the mortgage market, and also FHA \nhas been very, very important in terms of first-time home buyers.\n  But yet as we looked at the facts, it really became important for us \nto lift the limit, and we felt that a reasonable approach would be to \nraise the FHA loan limit in high-cost areas, many of which are in my \nState, from $170,000 to $197,000, and also to raise the limit in low-\ncost areas from $86,000 to $108,000, which are also in my State, and to \nstreamline the downpayment calculations to reduce administrative costs \nand burdens.\n  The administration wanted to have just that one limit of $227,000 for \nall communities. I do not believe that one size fits all. I do believe \nwe need to recognize the realities of the market.\n  In addition to that, we are concerned about foreclosures, and we did \nnot want to risk people getting into so much debt early in their lives \nor risking the loss of a home because they got in over their heads. We \ndid not want to end up with heartbreak for the families and heartburn \nfor the taxpayers.\n  I believe what we have here is a good middle ground. Included in the \nlanguage, in addition to the mortgage, we direct HUD to consult with \nCongress before beginning its bulk sale of foreclosed properties so \nthat we can deal with the way they deal with foreclosed properties, \nwhich I am not happy about and I know the Presiding Officer is not \neither. I do not want to see those properties go at fire sale prices or \nend up blighting a community when it should have been a tool of \nempowerment. The Federal Government ends up being a slum landlord, \nselling it to someone who either cannot afford it or chooses to use it \nto downgrade the neighborhood. FHA should be a tool for first-time home \nbuyers and not a tool for neighborhood deterioration.\n  Let me just give you some figures from Maryland and why I think this \nbill is good for Maryland and also good for the Nation. There are three \ncounties in Maryland at the current low end limit of $86,000. They are \nAllegany, Garrett, and Somerset. And I also know Dorchester sits \nsomewhere in there as well. In Garrett, the realtors report that the \nmedian home price is $124,000 in a county where the FHA limit is \n$86,000. That is a poor county. FHA is a very important tool. It is not \na poor county, but it is of very modest means.\n  Eleven counties out of our 23 and Baltimore have limits at the FHA \nlimit of $170,000, yet in Montgomery County housing the median price is \n$174,000. Raising these limits, I note, could help create 2,000 new \nhome buyers in the State of Maryland.\n  Well, Mr. President, that talks about Maryland, and I have a whole \nset of facts here on why it would be good for the Nation and also why \nincreasing the Ginnie Mae fees would really give me pause, and I \nabsolutely oppose raising the Ginnie Mae fees.\n  What applies in Maryland will also apply in many communities around \nthe country.\n  This is especially true in many urban high cost areas, particularly \nin the Northeast and California. It is also true that in many rural \nareas in the heartland of the country. FHA does not meet the local \nmarket realities.\n  HUD estimates that the provision we have included in our bill will \nprovide for 17,000 new home buyers annually and generate $80 million a \nyear in revenue for the FHA fund.\n  HUD estimates the Senate's FHA increase will raise the limits in 32 \nhigh-cost metropolitan areas and 174 lower cost areas.\n  But let's be clear; we're not talking about buying a place, but we \nare talking about buying a home. It is estimated that the average loan \namount under the Senate proposal will only be $142,000.\n  We have raised the limits enough to meet today's market realities \nwithout unduly increasing the risks for foreclosures.\n  FHA is also a critical resource to fill the gap for potential home \nbuyers who are credit worthy, but don't have the money for large down \npayments. Two-thirds of FHA loans have down payments of 5 percent or \nless, while only 8 percent of private mortgage insurance purchases are \nlow down payment loans.\n  Why oppose the Nickles amendment? Two reasons: it eliminates the \nhigh-cost area increase and increases GNMA fees by 6 basis points, from \n6 to 12.\n\n\n          eliminates increase in loan limit in high cost areas\n\n  Striking the high-end increase will affect people in 32 high-cost \nareas across the country, including several areas in Maryland--\nBaltimore City, and three counties: Baltimore, Montgomery, and Prince \nGeorges.\n  For thousands of people in high cost cities and counties across the \ncountry, FHA will be severely limited in its ability to provide this \nreal resource for families shopping in the local housing markets.\n\n\n                          increases gnma fees\n\n  The Nickles amendment also increase the GNMA fees for those who \nhandle FHA loans. This can get really technical, and the ``experts'' \nhave a nice time detailing the intricacies.\n  The bottom line is that it will cost more for a lender to have GNMA \nsecuritize both FHA and VA loans and despite what people may say, I \nthink we all would agree that when costs go up for a product provider, \ncosts often go up for the consumer.\n  Simply put, this amendment could make FHA and VA loans more costly \nfor consumers. HUD estimates that it will increase the cost to the \nlender by an average of $2,200. Several veterans services organizations \nhave also estimated that the increase in GNMA fees will increase costs \nfor veterans purchasing a home by $250. These costs may be passed along \nto those trying to purchase their first homes.\n  We do not want to burden our first-time home buyers or our veterans \nwith pass-through costs.\n  Mr. President, home ownership is critical step in a person or \nfamily's attempt to obtain assets and become a more permanent fixture \nin a community.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I share the concern about the effect that \nforeclosures can have on individuals' credit and the stability of a \ncommunity. My own hometown of Baltimore has been a victim of \nforeclosures harming neighborhoods.\n  We have provided a modest increase that does not raise the limit too \nmuch too quickly.\n  Our objective is clear, for those who FHA serves, ensure that it is a \nuseful tool. The objective is not to put the private mortgage insurance \ncompanies out of business or to move FHA away from providing for low- \nand moderate-income buyers.\n  I believe that the FHA provision included in the Senate bill before \nus is good for Maryland and good for the Nation.\n  I believe that this is a positive step in rewarding investment and \nprovides relief to working families.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment and support \nthe Appropriations Committee's attempt to help home buyers across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we defeat the Nickles amendment at \ntomorrow's vote and I look forward to hearing my colleagues' comments.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the distinguished Senator from \nColorado wishes to speak on this. Has the Senator from North Carolina \nspoken yet? I believe he also wishes to speak. And then I believe we \nare ready to go on to the amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island. \nSo I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Mack). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Missouri. I thank the Chair for \nrecognizing me. I appreciate the other Members who are on the floor \nallowing me to go ahead and speak. I was presiding, and the Senator \nfrom Florida has graciously consented to give me some relief from the \nChair while I come down and make some comments on this important piece \nof legislation.\n  I want to talk a little bit about my State because I think it gives \nsome idea of how this issue impacts my State.\n  I happen to be rising in favor of the Nickles amendment, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. You see the map on the Senate floor entitled ``FHA Loan \nLimits by County,'' which was alluded to during comments made by my \ncolleague from Missouri. During his comments, he pointed to the Rocky \nMountain region in my State. That region\n\n[[Page S8351]]\n\ncharacterizes counties of high levels of income which would be impacted \nby the upper loan limit increase in the VA/HUD Appropriations bill. \nThese counties have a high preponderance of second homes. The reason \nthese counties have a higher FHA loan limit is that they are recreation \ncounties. People who go to these counties and have second homes make a \nconsiderable amount of money.\n  Now, there is no doubt that there is a housing problem in those \ncounties for individuals who have to run the ski lifts, individuals who \nwork in the ski lodges, but they do not have the income level to afford \na loan of $197,000 for a home. In fact, some may not even qualify for \nthe lower loan limit range, which we are raising from $86,000 to \n$109,000. In addition to this disparity of wages that you see in these \nareas, many of these counties have implemented a no-growth policy.\n  Finding affordable housing is certainly a problem we all should \nstrive to deal with, not just at the Federal level, but also at the \nlocal level, at the county level, and particularly at the city level. \nMany counties in Colorado, because of their rapid growth rate, have \ndecided to try to slow down that growth by increasing the costs of \ndevelopment, increasing the costs of homes.\n  If we have a problem in those counties with obtaining affordable \nhousing, I think that local governments should have a responsibility \nand should implement some programs that would hold the costs of those \nhomes down so that those with lower and median incomes can afford them.\n  I think my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, did a very good \njob in explaining what the current situation is, and the proposed \nincrease of the FHA loan limit. Currently, the lower FHA loan limit is \n$86,000 and the upper limit is $170,000. This appropriations bill \nraises both of these limits to a lower limit of $109,000 and an upper \nlimit of $197,000. I like the idea that we raise up the lower loan \nlimits. I think that helps us meet the needs of lower income and \nmedian-income families. The higher income limits, in my view, don't \nneed to be subsidized. Most of that market is already met by \nconventional loans. In fact, in order to have a $197,000 mortgage, a \nbuyer typically needs an income level of $74,000 or more. These \nindividuals are the top 16 percent of the income earners in the United \nStates. Nearly 85 percent of households earning more than $50,000 \nalready own homes. I think that is reflected in the State of Colorado.\n  I point out this idea of raising the loan limits is a rather \ncontroversial issue, as far as Colorado is concerned. The mortgage \nlenders in my State cannot reach a consensus as to whether this ought \nto happen or not. They are divided. So it is with a considerable amount \nof thought and concern that I enter into the debate as it applies to my \nState of Colorado.\n  I see no reason why the Congress should be advocating that HUD \ncompete against a very successful private market. I would also point \nout, from some of the testimony that was received by the Banking \nCommittee on which I serve with the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, \nthere is really no clear connection between FHA loan limit increases \nand greater access to financing affordable houses.\n  So when I put all these factors together, I find myself opposing \nraising the upper loan limit, and yet supporting an increase in the \nlower FHA loan limit. I think a lot of the testimony that was heard by \nthe Banking Committee, the authorizing committee, was significant in \npointing out that there is a three-times higher default rate for higher \nloans than there is for lower loans. In other words, the higher the \nloan is for the home, the higher the default rate is, as far as FHA is \nconcerned.\n  In this program, if there is a default on a loan, the taxpayers must \npick up the cost. I do not think it is necessary for us to provide for \nthat indirect subsidy.\n  If we look at the lower loan limit, 73 percent of all mortgages of \n$85,000 or less are already provided by the private sector. Therefore, \nI think we can assume that this market is being serviced sufficiently. \nThe FHA program is set up to make riskier loans to individuals who are \nnot serviced in the private sector. By allowing the loan limit to \nincrease, FHA will be insuring higher valued loans and will be, as a \nconsequence, exposed to an increased risk.\n  As I pointed out earlier, as these loan limits increase, the number \nof defaults will simply increase. I don't think that we should be \nincreasing the upper loan limit. Therefore, I am supporting the Nickles \namendment. I think it is the correct approach to the problem, \nparticularly as it applies to my State. I think it is also the right \napproach as far as the country is concerned since only three percent of \nthe counties will be affected by the upper limit.\n  Without any further ado, I yield the floor. I thank Senators for \ntheir indulgence.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment. This \namendment does two things. First, it limits the FHA loan limit increase \nto the base level. Second, it creates an equal playing field for \nprivate sector and FHA loans.\n  The current FHA limit for low-cost areas is $86,000. Although it gets \nindexed every year to median home sale prices in that area (so that it \nis increased annually), many believe that the limit is too low. Some \nargue that you cannot build new construction for $86,000.\n  Now, I thought FHA was for first-time and low and moderate income \nhome buyers. And I didn't realize that first-time home buyers were \nentitled to a brand new house. I thought FHA was supposed to help with \n``starter homes''. But some people feel otherwise and so this amendment \nwill leave the increase in place that raises the limit from $86,000 to \nalmost $109,000.\n  However, I feel very strongly that we should not be raising the \nceiling from the current $170,000 to more than $197,000. To qualify for \na mortgage of $197,000 a person must make more than $75,000 a year. \nOnly 15% of the people in this country make salaries that high--and \nmost of those folks already own homes through the private sector.\n  I don't think when President Roosevelt created FHA back in 1934 that \nhe intended the program to help people making $75,000 a year. I don't \nthink he intended for the federal government to back 100% of those \nloans. He believed that FHA should step in where the private sector \ncannot. The private sector is making these loans already. There is no \nreason to raise the limit to almost $200,000.\n  Second, the amendment establishes a more level playing field between \nFHA and private sector loans so that borrowers are not steered towards \nFHA. Currently, lenders receive huge financial incentives to make loans \nthrough FHA.\n  The first incentive is that the federal government insures 100% of \nthe loan amount. There is no risk to the lender. Total to taxpayer. In \nthe private sector, the lender assumes some of the risk of the loan so \nthere is a greater stake in making sure that a borrower can pay back \nthe loan.\n  Second, under FHA, the lender makes twice the amount in servicing the \nloan than what he makes in the private sector. A servicing fee is \ncharged for collecting the monthly mortgage payment, escrowing real \nestate taxes, etc. There is no justification why lenders should get \nmuch bigger servicing fees for FHA loans. CRS said that it would have \nno effect on FHA loans or increasing costs on homeownership. It only \ngoes to the profit that the servicers make.\n  Until we level the playing field lenders will have every economic \nincentive to steer borrowers towards FHA. Remember we've already given \nthe lender a 100% federal guarantee that the loan will be paid back. \nNow we are making them rich in servicing fees.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. FHA has a lot of \nproblems already. Default rates for FHA loans are already three to four \ntimes the rate of the private sector. Unless we take steps to change \nthe situation and deter borrowers from being steered towards FHA, \nthings may only get worse for the program and, ultimately, the country. \nJoin consumer groups, the National Taxpayer Union and others in \nsupporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as the ranking member on the Committee \non Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, I echo the comments made by \nothers praising the work that has been\n\n[[Page S8352]]\n\ndone by Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski in framing the housing part \nof this appropriations bill. I have had a chance to go over it. I think \nthey have been very sensitive to the various concerns existing in this \nfield. I think they have done a very good job on the legislation. So as \nthe ranking member on the authorizing committee, I want to enter that \ninto the Record as others have done, recognizing the general work they \nhave done on this legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish a recorded vote?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I do not see any other Senators wishing to \nspeak on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask this amendment be set aside and the Senator from \nRhode Island be recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3203\n\n   (Purpose: To increase the funding for community development block \n                                grants)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3203.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 33, line 17, strike ``$60,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$70,000,000''.\n       On page 33, line 21, insert ``Provided: That none of these \n     funds shall be available for the Healthy Homes Initiative'' \n     before the period.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment tonight not \nonly on behalf of myself, but Mr. Abraham, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nWellstone, and Ms. Mikulski. My amendment would add a modest $10 \nmillion increase to the budget for the Office of Lead Hazard in the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.\n  I first want to commend and thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir assistance and their help. Both Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski \nhave committed to finding more resources to prevent the exposure of \nyoung children to the lead hazard which is so prevalent in older \nhousing throughout the United States. They have worked very closely \nwith my staff and myself. I thank them for that. I am also very \nconfident they will continue these efforts in conference so we can \nincrease even more the funds that are allocated to this important \nendeavor.\n  Over the last 20 years, the United States has made great strides in \nreducing lead exposure among our population, particularly among our \nchildren. Since the enactment of a ban on lead-based paint, since the \nelimination of lead solder in food cans and the deleading of gasoline, \nwe have seen a significant decrease in blood level exposures of \nAmerican citizens by about an order of 80 percent. However, it is still \nestimated that approximately 1 million children nationwide still have \nexcessive levels of lead in their blood, making lead poisoning a \nleading childhood environmental disease and a disease that can be \nprevented.\n  Today, the key culprit in this exposure is lead-based paint in \nhousing. It is the major source of exposure and is responsible for most \ncases of childhood lead poisoning. It has been estimated that \napproximately half of America's housing stock, roughly 64 million \nhomes, contain some lead-based paint. Twenty million of these homes \ncontain lead-based paint in a hazardous condition, paint which is \npeeling, cracked or chipped, paint that can be ingested by children, \ntaken into their bloodstream, causing them severe health problems.\n  The problem of lead-based paint is particularly severe in my home \nState of Rhode Island. Forty-three percent of our housing stock was \nbuilt before 1950, the time in which lead paint was universally used in \npainting homes.\n  But the problem of lead-paint exposure and lead-paint poisoning in \nchildren is not related to Rhode Island; it is truly a national \nproblem. One in 11 children nationwide have elevated blood levels, and \nif you refer to the chart on my left, you can see that, for example, in \nthe city of Baltimore, 22 percent of children age 1 through 6 have \ndangerously high levels of blood--Chicago, 12 percent; Davenport, Iowa, \n18 percent; Denver, CO, 16 percent; Milwaukee, 36 percent; St. Louis, \nMO, 23 percent; my home State, Providence, RI, 28 percent of children \ntested have higher than normal levels of lead in their bloodstream. \nThis is a nationwide problem. It is a problem particularly severe in \nthe older urban areas of the country, but not exclusively there.\n  Again, one of the key factors is housing stock of the community. \nHousing built before 1950 typically have extensive lead paint still \nresiding in these homes. If you look across the country, there are \nStates everywhere that have significant totals of housing built before \n1950. For example, in Illinois, 36 percent of the housing was built \nbefore 1950; in Michigan, 31 percent; in New York, 47 percent.\n  All of this points to an extremely important public health problem. \nIt is important because childhood lead poisoning has a profound health \neffect on children, a profound educational impact on children, their \nability to learn and their ability to develop intellectually. Children \nwith high blood levels can suffer from brain damage, behavior and \nlearning problems, slow growth and hearing problems.\n  Children with a history of lead poisoning frequently require special \neducation to compensate for intellectual deficits and behavior \nproblems. In my State of Rhode Island, officials believe special \neducation services are 40 percent higher among children with \nsignificant lead exposure, and in 1990 dollars, it costs roughly an \nadditional $10,000 to provide special education services to a child.\n  By failing to eliminate the hazard of lead in homes, we are harming \nnot only the children directly, but we are also incurring huge \nadditional costs for education and health care. This is truly a problem \nthat we must address, and we have to address it with the resources \nnecessary to address this problem effectively.\n  Mr. President, childhood lead poisoning is a significant health, \neducational and fiscal issue. We must do everything to eliminate this \nlead-based paint hazard to our children. By providing sufficient \nfunding to the HUD's Office of Lead Hazard Control, which has the \nprimary responsibility for addressing this hazard in housing, and since \n1992, the Office of Lead Hazard Control has been a highly effective \ncomponent of the Federal Government's effort to address childhood lead \npoisoning.\n  Through its grant program, this office has provided grants to State \nand local governments to reduce the exposure of young children to lead-\nbased paint hazards in their homes. Specifically, they have given \ngrants to privately owned homes, to low-income occupied, and rental \nhousing, all in an attempt to help them eliminate the source of lead \npoisoning in children, the most common source, and that is lead paint \nwithin homes.\n  Since 1993, $385 million has been awarded to 30 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia. These grants have helped abate or mitigate lead-\nbased paint hazards in 50,000 homes where young children reside. \nRegrettably, this is just, in effect, the tip of the iceberg, because \nthere are so many homes that have these particular hazards to children.\n  In addition to helping mitigate and abate lead exposure in homes, \nthey have also supported programs to test children for lead-based paint \nexposure, and also to test the homes. All of these efforts together \nhave helped in some small way to eliminate this problem, and I have had \nthe opportunity in my own home State of Rhode Island to visit and look \nat the efforts that are undertaken to eliminate these exposures to \nchildren. They are important.\n  What is most important is ensuring that we have the resources so that \nwe can protect the health of all of these young children. As I stated \nbefore, this is a problem that is terribly frustrating. We know that \nchildren, if they ingest lead into their system, will suffer some type \nof health effect. This health effect will usually result in poor \nintellectual development and behavioral problems. We will be paying \nlater through special education and through\n\n[[Page S8353]]\n\nthe lifetime of these children who then become adults.\n  We can at this point take an effective step to ensure that these \nproblems are addressed. It is preventable. It is a pediatric disease we \ncan prevent if we simply get the lead out. My amendment this evening \nwill increase the resources to the Office of Lead Hazard Mitigation so \nthat we can, in fact, help local communities ensure that the housing \nthese young children are living in is lead free.\n  Oftentimes, the families of these children have no choice. They must \ngo to homes that is the best available housing, but in providing a \nshelter for their child, in some cases unwittingly they are exposing \ntheir child to a hazard which will claim not only their health, but \nalso their intellectual development.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. I am prepared \nto yield to the chairman at this time.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island \nbecause there is no question about the dangers of lead-based paint, \nwhat hazards they present. This is a critical program. The program is \nfunded at $60 million. The Senator's amendment will increase it to $70 \nmillion.\n  There is a great need to reduce lead-based paint hazards for \nchildren. As the Senator has pointed out, some of the statistics of \nlead-based paint and the dangers in some of our more mature urban areas \nis really frightening. I believe the figures are that there are some $3 \nbillion in housing rehabilitation needs existing out there to address \nall of the lead-based paint problems in the country.\n  It is our desire to accept the amendment on this side. The funding \nwill be taken from the overall CDBG funding of $4.75 billion, which is \n$75 million over last year's level. We are willing to accept it on this \nside.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, concur with the chairman. I \nthank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership. The facts speak \nfor themselves. The situation in Baltimore of 22 percent of children in \nBaltimore city have some type of lead in their blood, this is a serious \nissue. I won't go into all the public health aspects and pediatric \nconsequences this late. But I will tell you what it means.\n  It means lower intellectual achievement. It means a lethargy, a \nsluggishness that is perpetual. Unless the child has their blood \nchelated, and if you go into Johns Hopkins and you are going to have \nyour blood chelated because there was lead paint dust on your mom's \nkitchen table that kind of got mixed up with after-school cookies, then \nit is going to cost $8,000 in Medicaid to clean out your blood.\n  Even if we can clean that blood out, we can't necessarily clean out \nthe consequences that have already set this child back, particularly in \ncognitive development.\n  I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for raising this, to move it \nup.\n  I am glad we can finally accept it with an offset. I asked that I be \na cosponsor of the amendment. And we know that we need more research. \nWe need the type of licensed people to be able to clean out the lead \npaint and protect our children. I view this as an important public \nhealth, get-behind-our-kids initiative. I look forward to just \naccepting it and defending it in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3203) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REED. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3204\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \nAgency from implementing or enforcing the public water system treatment \nrequirements related to the copper action level of the national primary \n drinking water regulations for lead and copper until certain studies \n                            are completed.)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], for himself and Mr. \n     Hagel, proposes an amendment numbered 3204.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 93, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 423. TEMPORARY PROHIBITION ON IMPLEMENTATION OR \n                   ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM TREATMENT \n                   REQUIREMENTS FOR COPPER ACTION LEVEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--None of the funds made available by this \n     or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     implement or enforce the national primary drinking water \n     regulations for lead and copper in drinking water promulgated \n     under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), \n     to the extent that the regulations pertain to the public \n     water system treatment requirements related to the copper \n     action level, until--\n       (1) the Administrator and the Director of the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention jointly conduct a study to \n     establish a reliable dose-response relationship for the \n     adverse human health effects that may result from exposure to \n     copper in drinking water, that--\n       (A) includes an analysis of the health effects that may be \n     experienced by groups within the general population \n     (including infants) that are potentially at greater risk of \n     adverse health effects as the result of the exposure;\n       (B) is conducted in consultation with interested States;\n       (C) is based on the best available science and supporting \n     studies that are subject to peer review and conducted in \n     accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; and\n       (D) is completed not later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) based on the results of the study and, once peer \n     reviewed and published, the 2 studies of copper in drinking \n     water conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention in the State of Nebraska and the State of \n     Delaware, the Administrator establishes an action level for \n     the presence of copper in drinking water that protects the \n     public health against reasonably expected adverse effects due \n     to exposure to copper in drinking water.\n       (b) Current Requirements.--Nothing in this section \n     precludes a State from implementing or enforcing the national \n     primary drinking water regulations for lead and copper in \n     drinking water promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) that are in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act, to the extent that the regulations \n     pertain to the public water system treatment requirements \n     related to the copper action level.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment together with \nmy colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, to delay implementation of a \nrule that has been promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency. \nThis delay would be required until the agents review existing \nscientific data to determine whether there is ample evidence to support \nthe rule.\n  Mr. President, this rule, together with the rule on lead, is there to \nprotect Americans, to give us safe drinking water. Unlike lead, \nhowever, copper is an essential element and is regulated in a much \ndifferent fashion. I intend with my statement to lay before the body an \nappeal.\n  Nebraska has an unusual situation. Perhaps other States do have a \nsimilar situation. But ours is essentially this: The Environmental \nProtection Agency has a limit with their rule of 1.3 milligrams per \nliter. There isn't a single city in Nebraska that has 1.3 milligrams \nper liter. Here is the problem. In some communities, the water level is \nsufficiently acidic if it remains in the pipes for 6 hours or longer. \nWhen you turn the water on, you will get more than 1.3 milligrams per \nliter. Run the water for a minute, and the water drops below 1.3 \nmilligrams per liter.\n  The EPA is saying, it does not matter. The EPA is saying, ``We test \nthe\n\n[[Page S8354]]\n\nwater. It comes out of the pipe immediately. It is over 1.3 milligrams; \ntherefore, you have to make investments, substantial investments.''\n  Hastings, NE, is having to invest about $1 million initially, and \n$250,000 per year. Sixty communities are being asked to make \nsubstantial investments in their water systems to remove copper from \ntheir water, even though not a single citizen in Nebraska is getting \nsick--not a single person. I emphasize this.\n  The EPA comes into Nebraska and says, ``You are right, Senator, \nnobody is getting sick.'' I say, ``Wait a minute, what is the Safe \nDrinking Water Act for?'' They say, ``Well, it is to make the water \nsafe.'' I say, ``The water is safe, is it not? If somebody was getting \nsick, then we would have unsafe water.'' They say, ``Yes, that is \nright. But we have established 1.3 milligrams per liter as the level \nallowed.'' And even though there is not a single community with 1.3 \nmilligrams per liter--if it sets in the pipe 6 hours--even though it is \nflushed out immediately, and even though the State public health people \nare willing to implement a program of public education to make sure \nthey stay below 1.3 milligrams, the EPA says, ``It doesn't matter.''\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this has become one of those litmus \ntest issues. I have talked to many people in the environmental \ncommunity. And they have said to me, ``Gee, Senator, you can't put this \non this bill because it is another rider.'' They compare it to the 1995 \nbill--I guess it was 1995 or 1996--the year when a lot of riders were \nattached. ``We don't want another rider.'' I said, ``Well, what does \nthat have to do with anything? Do you think the public health data \nsupports what you are trying to do in Nebraska? Is there a reason?'' \nThey say, ``No, it doesn't matter. What we are talking about here, \nSenator,'' they say, ``is politics. We don't disagree with the public \nhealth aspect of this.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two studies be printed in \nthe Record, both done by the Centers for Disease Control, that say \nthere isn't a problem.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Interim Trip Report: Cu Health Effects in Delaware, 1996\n\n\n                            Dates and Places\n\n       Washington, DC: Feb. 12.\n       Dover, DE: July 10-12, July 29-Aug. 7, Nov. 7-8.\n\n\n                               Background\n\n       Copper is an established gastro-intestinal irritant which \n     has been documented to cause nausea, vomiting, stomach \n     cramps, and diarrhea in humans. The lowest level at which \n     these adverse effect occur has not been well defined. \n     Following amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act in 1986, \n     EPA promulgated a revised standard for Cu. The new copper \n     standard required action, such as the installation of \n     corrosion control measures, when the highest 10% of first \n     morning flush household tap samples exceeds 1.3 mg/1 for a \n     given water distribution system. During a state-wide survey \n     of water systems in Delaware in 1995, 35 systems exceeded the \n     action level for copper. Thirteen of these systems had 10% of \n     their samples higher than 5.3 mg/1, the EPA's LOEL (lowest \n     observable effect level).\n       Out of concern for the health of individuals consuming high \n     levels of copper, and to utilize the unique social and \n     geological conditions in Delaware to better document the \n     consequences of such exposure. Delaware Health and Social \n     Services contacted CDC for technical assistance. Many small \n     communities in Delaware have older houses with copper pipes \n     and utilize untreated, acidic groundwater sources from high \n     silica soils. The results of this collaborative effort are \n     presented herein. Note that data collection is ongoing and \n     the results presented are those of a work in progress.\n\n\n                         Principle Persons Met\n\n       EPA: Jeff Cohen, Office of G.W. and D.W.; Ken Baily, ORD; \n     Bruce Mintz, ORD; Ed Hoddum.\n       Delaware: Ed Hallock, Barbara Ashby, Raymond C. Davidson, \n     and Donna Stulir, Office of Drinking Water, Health and Social \n     Services; Gerald Llewellyn, Dir. of Public Health, Health and \n     Social Services; Mahhadeo Verma, Director, Public Health \n     Laboratory; and Christopher Zimmerman, Dep. Dir., Public \n     Health Laboratory.\n\n\n                                Methods\n\n       Those communities which has high levels of copper during \n     the state-wide survey of 1995, had a population over 100, and \n     which were suspected of not having installed adequate \n     corrosion control measures as of June, 1996 were included in \n     the study. Because of the widespread installation of \n     corrosion control systems in the preceding year, only 4 \n     communities met this criteria. One additional trailer park \n     which not in violation during the 1955 survey but which had \n     older homes with acidic water was also visited. All household \n     in the area with homes built before 1980 were visited.\n       Contacted households were given a copper free container and \n     asked to capture the first water of the day out of whichever \n     tap they usually drank on the following morning. Participants \n     were asked not to run any other taps and not to flush their \n     toilets in the morning until after they had collected the \n     water sample. On the morning after the bottles were handed \n     out, samples were picked-up by investigators, stored in a \n     cooler, and taken to the State Public Health Laboratory by 1 \n     PM.\n       Households with > 5.0 mg/l copper in the first flush sample \n     were revisited and interviewed. For each of these ``High \n     Copper'' households, 2 neighborhood matched ``Control'' \n     households were interviewed. Potential control households \n     were those with less than 0.5 mg/l copper in the first flush \n     water sample they had provided. A copy of the interview form \n     is attached.\n       To attempt to estimate individual doses, all ``High \n     Copper'' individuals and 10 individuals from ``Control'' \n     households were asked to collect a daily water intake \n     sample in a provided bucket. To do this, each time a \n     person ingested coffee, or water, or any other drink \n     containing water, they were asked to put an equal volume, \n     taken from the same tap at the same time, into a bucket. \n     Houses were also revised at the end of the study to obtain \n     a second first flush water sample to help confirm that \n     their exposure status did not change over the course of \n     the study. Blank samples consisted of bottles filled with \n     store bought distilled water. Some bucket samples were \n     shaken and two bottles were filled to serve as duplicates. \n     The laboratory was blinded to the cohort status and the \n     sample type (first flush vs. blank vs. bucket) by a sample \n     numbering scheme. Duplicate samples were separated in the \n     numbering sequence.\n       Households were contacted by phone once per week over a \n     period of 12 weeks between August 5th and October 21st. \n     Interviewees were asked, ``Has anyone in your household been \n     ill during the past week?'' If the answer was yes, a \n     questionnaire regarding patient symptoms was completed. No \n     individuals were ill with the same symptoms for more than one \n     phone interview. A copy of the illness inquiry form is \n     attached.\n       Households that were called 3 times without an answer were \n     considered ``not contacted'' for that week. Households who \n     departed for the season or asked to no longer be contacted \n     were terminated and information from the household was \n     included for those person-weeks during which successful phone \n     contact took place. Weeks in which interviewers neglected to \n     call households were also excluded from the analysis.\n       Self-reported nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, diarrhea, \n     and constipation were all defined as being consistent with \n     copper toxicity (CCT). Having acute nausea and/or vomiting \n     alone or with a headache, or any 3 of the 5 symptoms \n     consistent with copper toxicity was defined as indicative of \n     copper toxicity (ICT).\n\n\n                                results\n\n     Cohort selection\n       867 houses were approached and 365 successfully contacted \n     (42%). Of those, 7 (1.9%) refused to participate, 32 (8.8%) \n     drank bottled water exclusively, and the remaining 326 self-\n     reported tap water drinkers were asked to collect a first \n     flush sample. Forty-seven households (14.4%) did not return \n     the sample bottle. Of the 279 samples collected, 23 were \n     above 5.0 mg/l copper.\n       Of these 23 high copper households, 3 could not be re-\n     contacted, and 3 decided that they did not drink the water by \n     the time they were re-contacted. 17 high copper households \n     were enrolled in the study. During the course of the study, 2 \n     households began drinking bottled water, 1 used a RO unit \n     which had been by-passed during our initial sampling, and 1 \n     pregnant woman was advised by the investigators to drink only \n     bottled water. Thus, 13 households and 40 individuals were \n     followed over the entire course of the study. Of the 40 \n     enrolled control households, 3 acquired filters during the \n     course of the study and 7 reported beginning to use bottled \n     water exclusively. These control households were not excluded \n     from the analysis since the new water source did not change \n     their copper exposure status. Two control households and 1 \n     ``High Copper'' household asked to be dis-enrolled during the \n     study.\n     Water\n       The average ``High Copper'' household first flush \n     concentration was 7.21 mg/l Cu among the 17 households \n     enrolled. Nine bucket samples were collected from nine \n     individuals. The average first flush concentrations for these \n     people was 7.00 mg/l Cu while the average daily intake value \n     was 2.91 mg/l Cu. Thus, average intake was 41% of first flush \n     values. These 9 people ingested an average of 2.3 quarts per \n     day according to our bucket collection procedure.\n     Health\n       A summary of the weekly phone surveillance results is \n     presented below.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Parameter                     Control          High Cu    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNo. of households....................               40               13 \nNo. of individuals...................              102               40 \nPerson/week-phone contacts as a % of                                    \n attempts............................    818/1127 (72%)    346/413 (84%)\nIllness events (all).................               26               15 \nPersons ill at some time during study        20 (19.6%)       11 (27.5%)\n\n[[Page S8355]]\n\n                                                                        \nCases consistent with Cu toxicity                                       \n (CCT)...............................               31                9 \nCases CCT/all person-weeks...........     31/818 (3.8%)     9/346 (2.6%)\nNo. of people with CCT at some point.        13 (12.6%)        8 (20.0%)\nCases indicative of copper toxicity                                     \n (ICT)...............................               22                4 \nCases ICT/all person-weeks...........     22/818 (2.7%)     4/346 (1.2%)\nNo. of people with ICT at some point.          9 (8.8%)        4 (10.0%)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     Other findings\n       It is possible that more people (as a fraction of the \n     population) consume high levels of copper (>5 mg/l) in their \n     water in Southern Delaware as anywhere in the U.S. Therefore \n     Gerald Llewellyn and Laurie Cowen of Delaware's Dept. of \n     Health and Social Services searched the state databases to \n     look at the incidence of Wilson's Disease, an illness \n     previously associated with copper ingestion. Between 1979 and \n     the present, only one case of Wilson's Disease was reported \n     in the State and that case occurred in the Wilmington area \n     where systems have little problem with corrosion control. \n     This is a Statewide reported rate of .08 illnesses per \n     million population per year. Nationally, approximately 15 \n     deaths per year were recorded between 1979 and 1992 with \n     Wilson's Disease being listed as the primary cause. Between \n     1988 and 1990, less than 700 hospital discharges were \n     estimated to occur nationally via the NCHS Hospital Discharge \n     Database (less than 2.8 hospitalizations per million \n     population per year). Given the rarity of Wilson's Disease \n     and the potential for incomplete reporting of this illness, \n     little significance can be attributed to Delaware's \n     apparently lower rate of the illness.\n\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       While the study reported herein included far fewer \n     households than initially intended, there seems to be no \n     difference in the symptoms typically associated with copper \n     toxicity among the two study groups. If copper is a gastro-\n     intestinal irritant at the levels observed in the 40 \n     individuals included in our study, the effect was not \n     observed here. The most specific and direct indicator for a \n     persistent irritant would be displayed by contrasting the \n     persons meeting the most specific case definition divided by \n     the number of person/week observation periods, ``Cases ICT/\n     all person weeks'' in this study. Individuals in the ``High \n     Copper'' household had a statistically similar, but lower \n     rate of symptoms ``Indicative of Copper Toxicity'' than did \n     the individuals in the ``Control'' households.\n       There are three possible explanations for this finding.\n       (1) People drinking water with an average of 2.7 mg/l Cu \n     and with a first flush level of 7.2 mg/l are not ingesting \n     enough copper to develop G.I. symptoms.\n       (2) The ``High Copper'' exposure level in this study is \n     enough to make people sick, but not the people in this study.\n       (3) These copper levels do make people sick, but the study \n     failed to detect this fact.\n       Addressing these issues in reverse order, while the sample \n     size in this study was small, it is likely that a major \n     effect from copper ingestion would have been detected. People \n     displayed symptoms, like those expected in copper toxicity \n     cases (ICT), during approximately 2% of the person weeks \n     surveyed (2.7% in control households, 1.2% in high copper \n     households). Thus, if the effect was missed due to a lack of \n     power in the study, the effect is likely to be less than 3 \n     episodes of nausea or vomiting per person per year, which is \n     not consistent with the ongoing symptoms of copper toxicity \n     typically described in the scientific literature. The final \n     data set was sufficient in size to detect a relative risk of \n     2.5 in ``cases ICT/all person weeks'' and a relative risk of \n     3.5 in the ``number of people with ICT at some point'' with \n     95% confidence and 80% power. While self-described symptoms \n     via a phone interview can produce lower quality data than \n     some other methods, for exmaple, medical examinations, it is \n     unlikely in this case that a systematic bias on the part of \n     the interviewee or the interviewer resulted in an \n     underreporting in the ``High Copper'' cohort. The \n     interviewers were blinded to the cohort status of the study \n     participants.\n       Explanation 2, that the study population was not \n     susceptible to copper induced illness, is somewhat more \n     problematic. People may be susceptible to copper for a short \n     period and then acclimate. This study had very few transient \n     participants and most households had been at their present \n     location for months or years. Likewise, within a population, \n     some individuals may be particularly susceptible to copper \n     toxicity, realize that their water is making them ill, and \n     change sources. Because households who reported not \n     drinking their water were not enrolled in the study, the \n     data here cannot address that possibility. Several people \n     during the initial interview process reported becoming ill \n     after moving to their present address and attributed their \n     illness to their water. Several of these individuals lived \n     in ``High Copper'' homes.\n       Explanation 1, that the ingested levels of copper in the \n     study were not sufficient to cause illness, seems the most \n     likely explanation, perhaps in conjunction with the self-\n     exclusion bias described above. Given that the average intake \n     was 2.4 liters with a Cu concentration of 2.9 mg/l, and given \n     this level is below the EPA LOEL, this is not surprising. \n     What is surprising is that, in perhaps the systems serving \n     some of the most corrosive water in the U.S., studying just \n     the older homes with copper pipes, no adverse health effects \n     can be detected. Houses in the study were receiving water at \n     6 times the concentration of EPA's 90th percentile action \n     level, and represented the 92nd percentile, of the oldest \n     portions of the State's most problematic systems (therefore, \n     perhaps the 99th percentile of their communities). Thus, it \n     is unlikely that there is widespread acute illness in \n     Delaware from the ingestion of copper in people's homes.\n\n\n                                findings\n\n       (1) This study indicated that those people drinking the \n     highest levels of copper identified in Delaware are not \n     suffering adverse acute effects from this exposure.\n       (2) No evidence of Wilson's Disease can be seen in the \n     state registry in this population with some of the highest \n     water copper levels seen in the U.S.\n       (3) Average daily intakes of copper are not well predicted \n     by first flush values. A time and volume weighed daily intake \n     was typically 41% of the Cu concentrations found in the first \n     flush samples.\n       (4) The bucket collection procedure employed here for \n     estimating daily dose was easy and quantitative. Future \n     studies should use urine collection techniques to confirm its \n     accuracy.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n     To Delaware\n       Future inquiries regarding population concerns over Cu in \n     drinking water in Delaware should be addressed with a one \n     page summary of this study since it represents a best effort \n     to identify the most problematic systems and households in \n     the state. Susceptible individuals may exist and individual \n     complaints regarding systems with corrosive water should be \n     investigated and copper toxicity events reported to the CDC.\n       Many good reasons exist for promoting corrosion control \n     measures independent of copper and lead toxicity. The results \n     of this investigation should not be used by utilities to \n     avoid undertaking prudent investments in municipal \n     infrastructures or treatment processes.\n       Cooperation between the Department of Epidemiology, the \n     State Public Health Laboratory, and the Drinking Water \n     Program has been exemplary throughout this study. The study \n     should be held forward as a model cooperatively and thriftily \n     addressing public health concerns.\n       Phone monitoring efforts in future studies should remain \n     directly under the supervision of the Delaware official with \n     principle responsibility for the study.\n     To CDC\n       CDC should not conduct future studies to identify and \n     quantify the copper LOEL in a stable domestic population \n     without reports of symptomatic illness. It is unlikely that \n     ongoing illness from copper exposure in drinking water is a \n     major problem anywhere in the U.S. among domestic users. If \n     the EPA LOEL of 5.3 is an accurate estimate of where health \n     effects begin to be seen, this study indicated that first \n     flush levels of 13 mg/l would be needed to inflict daily \n     average tap water level of 5.3 mg/l Cu. No households in our \n     study or the state-wide survey had such high concentrations \n     of Cu.\n       the daily dose method employed here was appears to be \n     effective and should be validated.\n       Support of the kind provided to Delaware in this modest \n     study: (a) is a cost-effective way to produce valuable public \n     health data, (b) established excellent ties for future \n     cooperation, (c) is educational for both State and Federal \n     participants who often have dramatically different \n     perspectives.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             Interim Report\n\n       Evaluating Gastrointestinal Irritation among Humans From \n     Copper in Drinking Water, Lincoln, Nebraska (Epi-E94-73)--\n     Sharunda D.

BAKER, JR.--LEADER'S LECTURE SERIES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this was old home week in the Senate. Former \nSenator Howard Baker of Tennessee, who served almost two decades in \nthis body, returned to give us a piece of his mind--in the best sense \nof the phrase.\n  To be precise, he delivered, in the august Old Senate Chamber, the \nsecond presentation in our Leader's Lecture Series. The first address \nearlier this year, by former Senator Mike Mansfield, was both moving \nand memorable. Senator Baker's remarks were no less so.\n  He entitled his remarks ``On Herding Cats,'' a reference to the \nnature of the work of a Senator Majority Leader--or, for that matter, a \nMinority Leader. Suffice it to say that, as the current holder of the \nleadership office which Senator Baker gave up when he left the Senate, \nI fully understand what he means.\n  To advance the public's understanding of the Senate, and to further \nappreciation of its unique traditions and procedures, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of Senator Baker's Lecture be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks of the Honorable Howard H. Baker, Jr., Leader's Lecture Series, \n                             July 14, 1998\n\n                            On Herding Cats\n\n       I first walked into the gallery of the United States Senate \n     nearly sixty years ago. My great-aunt Mattie Keene was \n     secretary to Senator K.D. McKeller of Tennessee, and I came \n     here to visit her in July 1939 as a 13-year-old-boy, and she \n     procured gallery passes for the House and the Senate.\n       The Senate had only the most primitive air conditioning in \n     those days. It was principally cooled by a system of louvers \n     and vents and sky lights that dated from 1859, when the \n     Senate vacated this chamber and moved down the hall to its \n     present home.\n       The system did not work very well against Washington's \n     summertime plague of heat and humidity, and as a consequence, \n     Congress was not a year-round institution in those days.\n\n[[Page S8375]]\n\n       Anyone who knows me understands how tempting it is to \n     devote the remainder of these remarks to my perennial \n     thesis--that this was precisely the way the national \n     legislature was designed to operate: as a citizen legislature \n     that did its work and went home, rather than a perpetual \n     Congress hermetically sealed in the capitol city. In the \n     summer of 1939, in any event, nature and technology offered \n     little choice.\n       On that same trip in 1939, I traveled even further north--\n     to New York, in the company of the same Aunt Mattie--to see \n     the New York World's Fair. There I had my first encounter \n     with a novel technology that would have even more profound \n     consequences than air conditioning. It was called \n     ``television.''\n       And it was the same K.D. McKeller, my Aunt Mattie's boss, \n     who only three years later would help President Roosevelt \n     launch the Manhattan Project that would shortly usher in the \n     nuclear age.\n       (Senator McKeller, by the way, was chairman of the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee at the time, and when President \n     Roosevelt asked him if he could hide a billion dollars to \n     finance this top-secret project, Senator McKeller replied, \n     ``Of course I can, Mr. President--and where in Tennessee are \n     we going to build this plant?'')\n       I recite all this personal history not to remind you how \n     old I am but to remark on how young our country is, how true \n     it is in America that, as William Faulkner wrote, ``the past \n     isn't dead. It isn't even the past.''\n       The same ventilation system that Senator Jefferson Davis of \n     Mississippi had installed in the new Senate chamber in 1859--\n     just before leaving Washington to become President of the \n     Confederacy--was still in use when I first came here as a \n     boy, when television and nuclear power were in their infancy.\n       We enter rooms that Clay and Webster and Calhoun seem only \n     recently to have departed. We can almost smell the smoke of \n     the fire the British kindled in what is now Senator Lott's \n     office to burn down Washington in August of 1814.\n       (By the way, you can thank me for whatever smoke you now \n     smell. My late father-in-law, Everett Dirksen, has told me \n     that the fireplaces in the Republican Leader's offices didn't \n     work since they were sealed when they air conditioned the \n     Capitol. So when I was elected Republican Leader, I asked the \n     Architect of the Capitol what it would take to make these \n     fireplaces work, and he replied, ``A match, I suppose.'')\n       My dear friend, Jennings Randolph of West Virginia, with \n     whom I helped write much of the environmental and public work \n     legislation of the 1970s and who passed away recently, came \n     to Washington with Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 and was still \n     here when Ronald Reagan arrived in 1981. He was a walking \n     history lesson who embodied--and gladly imparted--a half \n     century of American history.\n       You may be wondering by now what all these ruminations have \n     to do with the subject of Senate leadership. The answer is \n     this: what makes the Senate work today is the same thing that \n     made it work in the days of Clay, Webster and Calhoun, in \n     whose temple we gather this evening.\n       It isn't just the principled courage, creative compromise \n     and persuasive eloquence that these men brought to the \n     leadership of the Senate--important as these qualities were \n     in restoring political prestige and Constitutional importance \n     to the Senate in the first half of the 19th century.\n       (Heretical as it may sound, before these gentlemen arrived, \n     an alarming number of men left the Senate to pursue more \n     influential political careers in the House of \n     Representatives.)\n       It isn't simply an understanding of the unique role and \n     rules of the Senate, important as that understanding is.\n       It isn't even the devotion of the good of the country, \n     which has inspired every Senator since 1789.\n       What really makes the Senate work--as our heroes knew \n     profoundly--is an understanding of human nature, an \n     appreciation of the hearts, as well as the minds, the \n     frailties as well as the strengths, of one's colleagues and \n     one's constituents.\n       Listen to Calhoun himself, speaking of his great rival \n     Clay: ``I don't like Henry Clay. He is a bad man, an \n     imposter, a creator of wicked schemes. I wouldn't speak to \n     him. But by God, I love him.''\n       It is almost impossible to explain that statement to most \n     people, but most Senators understand it instinctively and \n     perfectly.\n       Here, in those twenty-eight words, is the secret to leading \n     the United States Senate. Here, in a jangle of insults \n     redeemed at the end by the most profound appreciation and \n     respect, is the genius and the glory of this institution.\n       Very often in the course of my eighteen years in the \n     Senate, and especially in the last eight years as Republican \n     Leader and then Majority Leader, I found myself engaged in \n     fire-breathing, passionate debate with my fellow Senators \n     over the great issues of the times: civil rights, Vietnam, \n     environmental protection, Watergate, the Panama Canal, tax \n     cuts, defense spending, the Middle East, relations with the \n     Soviet Union, and dozens more.\n       But no sooner had the final word been spoken and the last \n     vote taken than I would walk to the desk of my recent \n     antagonist, extend the hand of friendship, and solicit his \n     support on the next day's issue.\n       People must think we're crazy when we do that. Or perhaps \n     they think our debates are fraudulent to begin with, if we \n     can put our passion aside so quickly and embrace our \n     adversaries so readily.\n       But we aren't crazy, and we aren't frauds. This ritual is \n     as natural as breathing herd in the Senate, and it is as \n     important as anything that appends in Washington or in the \n     country we serve.\n       It signifies that, as Lincoln said, ``We are not enemies \n     but friends. We must not be enemies.'' It pulls us back from \n     the brink of rhetorical, intellectual, even physical violence \n     that, thank God, has only rarely disturbed the peace of the \n     Senate.\n       It's what makes us America and not Bosnia. It's what makes \n     us the most stable government on Earth, not a civil war \n     waiting to happen.\n       We're doing the business of the American people. We have to \n     do it every day. We have to do it with the same people every \n     day. And if we cannot be civil with one another--if we stop \n     dealing with those who disagree with us or those we do not \n     like--we would soon stop functioning altogether.\n       Sometimes we have stopped functioning. Once we had a civil \n     war. Once Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina \n     (who, by the way, was born in Senator Thurman's hometown of \n     Edgefield) came into this chamber and attacked Senator \n     Charles Summer of Massachusetts with a cane, nearly killing \n     him. And it is at those times we have learned the hard way \n     how important it is to work together, to see beyond the human \n     frailties, the petty jealousies, even the occasionally craven \n     motive, the fall from grace that every mortal experiences in \n     life.\n       Calhoun didn't like Clay, didn't share his politics, didn't \n     approve of his methods. But he loved Clay because Clay was, \n     like him, an accomplished politician, a man in the arena, a \n     master of his trade, serving his convictions and his \n     constituency just as Calhoun was doing.\n       Calhoun and Clay worked together because they knew they had \n     to. The business of their young nation was too important--and \n     their roles in that business too central--to allow them the \n     luxury of petulance.\n       I read recently that our late friend and colleague Barry \n     Goldwater had proposed to his good friend, then Senator John \n     Kennedy, that the two of them make joint campaign appearances \n     in the 1964 presidential campaign, debating the issues one-\n     on-one, without intervention from the press, their handlers, \n     or anyone else.\n       Barry Goldwater and John Kennedy would have had trouble \n     agreeing on the weather, but they did agree that presidential \n     campaigns were important, that the issues were important, and \n     that the public's understanding of their respective positions \n     on those issues was important.\n       That common commitment to the importance of public life was \n     enough to bridge an ideological and partisan chasm that was \n     both deep and wide. And that friendship, born here in the \n     Senate where they were both freshmen together in 1953, would \n     have served the nation well whoever might have won that \n     election in 1964.\n       Barry Goldwater and I were also personal friends, as well \n     as professional colleagues and members of the same political \n     team. Even so, I could not automatically count on his support \n     for anything. Once, when I really needed his vote and leaned \n     on him perhaps a little too hard, he said to his Majority \n     Leader, ``Howard, you have one vote, and I have one vote, and \n     we'll just see how this thing comes out.''\n       It was at that moment that I formulated my theory that \n     being leader of the Senate was like herding cats. It is \n     trying to make ninety-nine independent souls act in concert \n     under rules that encourage polite anarchy and embolden people \n     who find majority rule a dubious proposition at best.\n       Perhaps this is why there was no such thing as a Majority \n     Leader in the Senate's first century and a quarter--and why \n     it's only a traditional, rather than statutory or \n     constitutional, office still today.\n       Indeed, the only Senator with constitutional office is the \n     President Pro Tempore, who stands third in line of succession \n     to the Presidency of the United States. Strom Thurmond has \n     served ably in that constitutional role for most of the last \n     17 years, and I have no doubt he has at least another 17 to \n     go.\n       In Strom's case I am reminded of an invitation that I \n     recently received to attend the dedication of a time capsule \n     in Rugby, Tennessee to be opened in a 100 years. \n     Unfortunately, I could not attend because of a schedule \n     conflict so I wrote that I was sorry that I couldn't be there \n     for the burying of the time capsule, but I assured them that \n     I would try to be there when they dig it up.\n       There was a time when even the Vice Presidency was a \n     powerful office. When John Calhoun served as Andrew Jackson's \n     vice president, he had the power not only to cast tie-\n     breaking votes but also to appoint whole congressional \n     committees.\n       There was also a time when Majority and Minority Leaders \n     could keep their members in line by granting or withholding \n     campaign funds from the national parties--the only major \n     source of funds, besides personal wealth, that most Senators \n     could call upon.\n       Even Lyndon Johnson, in the late 1950s, could wield this \n     power and enforce his party's discipline with cash and \n     committee assignments, as well as the famous ``Johnson \n     treatment.''\n       Today, every Senator is an independent contractor, beholden \n     to no one for fund-raising, for media coverage, for policy \n     analysis, for political standing, or anything else. I herded \n     cats. Trent Lott and Tom Daschle have to tame tigers, and the \n     wonder is not\n\n[[Page S8376]]\n\n     that the Senate, so configured, does so little but that it \n     accomplishes so much.\n       That it does is a tribute to their talented leadership. \n     They can herd cats. They can tame tigers. They can \n     demonstrate the patience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon, the \n     poise of Cary Grant and the sincerity of Jimmy Stewart--all \n     of which are essential to success in the difficult roles they \n     play.\n       For whatever help it may be to these and future leaders, \n     let me offer now a few rules of Senate leadership. As it \n     happens, they are an even Baker's Dozen.\n       1. Understand its limits. The leader of the Senate relies \n     on two prerogatives, neither of which is constitutionally or \n     statutorily guaranteed. They are the right of prior \n     recognition under the precedent of the Senate and the \n     conceded right to schedule the Senate's business. These, \n     together with the reliability of his commitment and whatever \n     power of personal persuasion one brings to the job, are all \n     the tools a Senate leader has.\n       2. Have a genuine and decent respect for differing points \n     of view. Remember that every Senator is an individual, with \n     individual needs, ambitions and political conditions. None \n     was sent here to march in lockstep with his or her colleagues \n     and none will. But also remember that even members of the \n     opposition party are susceptible to persuasion and redemption \n     on a surprising number of issues. Understanding these \n     shifting sands is the beginning of wisdom for a Senate \n     leader.\n       3. Consult as often as possible, with as many Senators as \n     possible, on as many issues as possible. This consultation \n     should encompass not only committee chairmen but as many \n     members of one's party conference as possible in matters of \n     legislative scheduling.\n       4. Remember that Senators are people with families. \n     Schedule the Senate as humanely as possible, with as few all-\n     night sessions and as much accommodation as you can manage.\n       5. Choose a good staff. In the complexity of today's world, \n     it is impossible for a Member to gather and digest all the \n     information that is necessary for the Member to make an \n     informed and prudent decision on major issues. Listen to your \n     staff, but don't let them fall into the habit of forgetting \n     of who works for whom.\n       6. Listen more often than you speak. As my father-in-law \n     Everett Dirksen once admonished me in my first year in this \n     body, ``occasionally allow yourself the luxury of an \n     unexpressed thought.''\n       7. Count carefully, and often. The essential training of a \n     Senate Majority Leader perhaps ends in the third grade, when \n     he learns to count reliably. But 51 today may be 49 tomorrow, \n     so keep on counting.\n       8. Work with the President, whoever he is, whenever \n     possible. When I became Majority Leader after the elections \n     of 1980, I had to decide whether I would try to set a \n     separate agenda for the Senate or try to see how our new \n     President, with a Republican Senate, could work together as a \n     team to enact his programs. I chose the latter course, and \n     history proved me right. Would I have done the same with a \n     President of the opposition party? Lyndon Johnson did with \n     President Eisenhower, and history proved him right, as well.\n       9. Work with the House. It is a co-equal branch of \n     government, and nothing the Senate does--except in the \n     ratification of treaties and the confirmation of federal \n     officers--is final unless the House concurs. My father and \n     step-mother both served in the House, and I appreciate its \n     special role as the sounding board of American politics. John \n     Rhodes and I established a Joint Leadership Office in 1977, \n     and it worked very well. I commend that arrangement to this \n     generation of Senate leaders and to every succeeding \n     generation.\n       10. No surprises. Bob Byrd and I decided more than twenty \n     years ago that while we were bound to disagree on many \n     things, one thing we would always agree on was the need to \n     keep each other fully informed. It was an agreement we never \n     broke--not once--in the eight years we served together as \n     Republican and Democratic Leaders of the Senate.\n       11. Tell the truth, whether you have to or not. Rather that \n     your word is your only currency you have to do business with \n     in the Senate. Devalue it, and your effectiveness as a Senate \n     leader is over. And always get the bad news out first.\n       12. Be patient. The Senate was conceived by America's \n     founders as ``the saucer into which the nation's passions are \n     poured to cool.'' Let Senators have their say. Bide your \n     time--I worked for 18 years to get television in the Senate \n     and the first camera was not turned on until after I left. \n     But, patience and persistence have their shining reward. It \n     is better to let a few important things be your legacy than \n     to boast of a thousand bills that have no lasting \n     significance.\n       13. Be civil, and encourage others to do likewise. Many of \n     you have heard me speak of the need for greater civility in \n     our political discourse. I have been making that speech since \n     the late 1960s, when America turned into an armed \n     battleground over the issues of civil rights and Vietnam. \n     Having seen political passion erupt into physical violence, I \n     do not share the view of those who say that politics today \n     are meaner or more debased than ever. But in this season of \n     prosperity and peace--so rare in our national experience--it \n     ill behooves America's leaders to invent disputes for the \n     sake of political advantage, or to inveigh carelessly against \n     the motives and morals of one's political adversaries. \n     America expects better of its leaders than this, and deserves \n     better.\n       I continue in my long-held faith that politics is an \n     honorable profession. I continue to believe that only through \n     the political process can we deal effectively with the full \n     range of the demands and dissents of the American people. I \n     continue to believe that here in the United States Senate, \n     especially, our country can expect to see the rule of the \n     majority co-exist peacefully and constructively with the \n     rights of the minority, which is an interesting statement.\n       It doesn't take Clays and Websters and Calhouns to make the \n     Senate work. Doles and Mitchells did it. Mansfields and \n     Scotts did it. Johnsons and Dirksens did it. Byrds and Bakers \n     did it. Lotts and Daschles do it now, and do it well. The \n     founders didn't require a nation of supermen to make this \n     government and this country work, but only honorable men and \n     women laboring honestly and diligently and creatively in \n     their public and private capacities.\n       It was the greatest honor of my life to serve here and lead \n     here. I learned much about this institution, about this \n     country, about human nature, about myself in the eighteen \n     years I served here at the pleasure of the people of \n     Tennessee.\n       I enjoyed some days more than others. I succeeded some days \n     more than others. I was more civil some days than others. But \n     the Senate, for all its frustration and foibles and failings, \n     is indeed the world's greatest deliberative body. And by God, \n     I love it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8374-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BASEBALL CHOOSES WELL--BUD SELIG\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Late yesterday several of my colleagues took to the \nfloor to discuss their views on the need for congressional action on \nencryption legislation. I would like to take this opportunity to \nbriefly provide my thoughts on this important issue.\n  As everyone who follows encryption policy knows, despite years of \ndiscussion and debate, we still have not found a solution that is \nacceptable to industry, consumers, law enforcement and national \nsecurity agencies. In this Congress alone, we have seen 7 competing \nbills introduced--3 in the House and 4 in the Senate.\n  The country is paying a price for this inability to produce a \nconsensus solution. That price is evident not only in loss of market \nshare and constraint on internet commerce, but also in the steady \nerosion of the ability of law enforcement's and national security \nagencies' to monitor criminal activity or activities that threaten our \nnational interest.\n  We simply must find a comprehensive national policy that protects \nboth U.S. national security and U.S. international market share--sooner \nrather than later. And I believe we can.\n  After many months of participating in discussions on encryption \npolicy and hearing from all sides of this complex issue, I have reached \ntwo conclusions. First, the Administration has and is continuing to \nmake good-faith efforts to reach agreement on the numerous complex \nissues that underlie our encryption policy. And second, there is \nalready considerable agreement on a series of key issues. The challenge \nis to pull together to forge a consensus encryption policy for the 21st \nCentury.\n  Earlier this year, I sent a letter to Vice President Gore asking for \nthe Administration's goals and plans for encryption policy. In his \nresponse to me, the Vice President indicated that he supports \n``energizing an intensive discussion that will apply the unparalleled \nexpertise of U.S. industry leaders in developing innovative solutions \nthat support our national goals.'' Subsequent actions demonstrate that \nthe\n\n[[Page S8377]]\n\nVice President and this Administration have been true to their word.\n  In the last several months, the Administration has engaged in \nintensive discussions with the Americans for Computer Privacy, an \nimportant business-oriented interest group. These discussions have \nfocused on technical, policy, legal, and business issues associated \nwith encryption, and the impact of strong encryption on law enforcement \nand national security. The Administration is also reviewing ACP's \nproposals for export relaxation. I have been assured by senior \nAdministration officials that, in making decisions on our encryption \npolicy, the Administration recognizes it must carefully consider \ncommercial needs as well as law enforcement and national security \ninterests.\n  As a result of the Administration's statements and actions, I am more \nconvinced than ever that there is already agreement on a significant \nnumber of issues and that a consensus on encryption policy is possible \nin the not-to-distant future. First, all parties accept the need for \nand reality of strong encryption products. Second, all parties agree \nthat strong encryption products are essential to the growth of \nelectronic commerce and the internet. Third, all parties agree that 40-\nbit keys are inadequate to ensure privacy and security. Fourth, all \nparties agree that doing nothing has a real and significant downside. \nAccording to a recent study, maintaining existing encryption policies \nwill cost the U.S. economy as much as $96 billion over the next 5 years \nin lost sales and slower growth in encryption-dependent industries. \nFinally, all parties agree that doing nothing is unsustainable because \nthe relaxed restrictions the Administration placed on 56-bit encryption \nproducts expire at the end of the year and must be addressed within the \nnext month or two.\n  So where does this leave us? Unfortunately, while recent discussions \nbetween industry and the Administration have been fruitful, they have \nnot gone far enough or proceeded fast enough to produce the kind of \nagreement I believe the majority of the Congress would all like to see. \nThe time has come for the Administration to announce exactly where it \nstands on several key issues--including how it intends to proceed when \nthe current relaxed restrictions on 56-bit encryption expire.\n  Having urged the Administration to greater efforts, I must also ask \nif it would not be constructive for those who are most frustrated with \nthe pace of change in this area to take a step back and closely examine \ntheir own positions. For example, several of the bills introduced in \nthe Congress this session call for the Secretary of Commerce to have \nexclusive jurisdiction over the export of encryption products. Despite \nthe widespread agreement that the sale of encryption products has \nimportant ramifications for our national security and law enforcement, \nthese bills would give no role to officials from the Justice \nDepartment, the FBI, or the intelligence community in the decision \nprocess regarding which encryption products can be legally sold.\n  This fact would be noteworthy even in isolation. It is even more \nremarkable when one combines it with the observation that many of the \nadherents to this laissez-faire approach to export controls for \nencryption products are the most vocal critics of the Administration's \nexport policies for commercial satellites.\n  The incongruity of these two positions is stunning. Trying to \nreconcile them is impossible. There are only two conclusions to be \ndrawn from this inconsistency. Either the right hand does not know what \nthe left is doing, or at least part of the criticism directed at the \nAdministration is politically motivated.\n  I will be working with the Administration and my colleagues in the \ndays ahead in the hope of reaching some consensus on national \nencryption policy. I am hopeful that over the next few weeks we can \nbegin to resolve the numerous difficult issues that remain. Neither \nindustry nor government is likely to get 100 percent of what it wants. \nHowever, if both sides are flexible and cognizant of the stakes \ninvolved, I am hopeful we can reach an agreement that's good for \nconsumers, good for business, and good for law enforcement and national \nsecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8376-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8377-S8379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OMNIBUS PATENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am here once again to talk about S. 507, \nthe Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. On this date back in 1878, a gentleman \nnamed Thaddeus Hyatt was granted a patent for reinforced concrete. Now, \n120 years later, the Senate is refusing to reinforce American \ninnovation by failing to take concrete action to reform our nation's \npatent laws.\n  We are presented with an opportunity that will not soon repeat \nitself--an opportunity to pass S. 507 and give U.S. inventors longer \npatent terms, put more royalties in their pockets, save them money in \ncostly patent litigation, and avoid wasting their development resources \non duplicative research. At the same time, we can get our new \ntechnology more rapidly into the marketplace and make U.S. companies \nmore competitive globally.\n  Remaining globally competitive is not an idle concern. The failure of \nthis body to enact the reforms of our patent system contained in S. 507 \nhas given foreign entities applying for and receiving patents in the \nU.S. unfair advantages over U.S. firms--advantages that U.S. persons \nfiling and doing business abroad do not have. This ability to keep U.S. \ninventors in the dark about the latest technological developments does \nnot work to our economic advantage. Why are we turning our backs on our \nbusinesses, small and large, by not voting on this bill?\n  I have made recent speeches citing the strong support this \nlegislation has around the country. This legislation has more than just \nVermont or any state in mind. It has the entire country in its best \ninterest. Our 200 year old patent system has provided protections to \nmany of our inventions that have led to our global economic leadership \nposition in the world marketplace. However, that leadership position is \nbeing threatened. Litigation has increased. Small inventors have been \ntaken advantage of. Inventors and businesses are asking for our help \nand requesting that we pass S. 507.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee reported this bill out over a year ago \nby an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 17-1, and this bill has yet to \nsee the light of day on the floor. No longer can we turn the other \ncheek when American business lets out such a cry for help. We need to \nbring this bill to the floor now and to pass it. We must not squander \nthis opportunity to not only update our patent system but to come to \nAmerica's defense.\n  I inserted into the Congressional Record  on June 23, letters of \nsupport from the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the \nNational Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business \nTechnology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National \nVenture Capital Association, and the 21st Century Patent Coalition.\n  On July 10, I inserted into the Congressional Record  additional \nletters of support from The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of \nAmerica; the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America, \nPhRMA; the American Automobile Manufacturers Association; the Software \nPublishers Association; the Semiconductor Industry Association; the \nBusiness Software Alliance; the American Electronics Association; and \nthe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.\n  I now ask that additional letters of support for S. 507 be printed in \nthe Record. These letters are from IBM; the Biotechnology Industry \nOrganization; the International Trademark Association; 3M; Intel \nCorporation; Caterpillar; AMP Incorporated; and Hewlett-Packard \nCompany.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     IBM Internet Media Group,\n\n                                 Essex Junction, VT, June 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As an inventor I rely on the strength \n     of the U.S. patent system to legally protect my invention(s). \n     I am also the chairman of an ANSI standardization committee \n     (NCITS L3.1) which represents the United States in an \n     International Standardization Forum (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG \n     11). Our committee has developed the Emmy Award winning \n     standard called MPEG-2, a standard which may have never come \n     to pass had it not been for strong International parent \n     protection. We are currently working on the future of \n     International\n\n[[Page S8378]]\n\n     Multimedia (MPEG-4), a standard which promises to be as \n     popular and widely used as MPEG-2 will be. The strength of \n     the patent laws is essential to promoting participation and \n     the development of International Standards. However, the \n     system which for years has effectively encouraged innovation \n     and protected inventors, is no longer effective. A \n     significant number of ways have been found to abuse it, such \n     as people and/or companies obtaining inappropriate patents \n     and in some cases pilfering others' hard-earned invention. \n     This threatens to undermine America's position as the global \n     leader in technology innovation. I am proud that my work as \n     an inventor has contributed to IBM's patent portfolio.\n       There is no legislation pending before you that will help \n     restore leadership and integrity to the U.S. patent system. \n     It is responsive to today's fast paced, highly competitive \n     environment, and it will protect inventors like me. I am \n     writing to ask you to urge Majority Leader Lott (R-MS) to \n     bring S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, to the Senate \n     floor as soon as possible and for you to support its final \n     passage.\n       The bipartisan Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507, was \n     passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 17-1 and has not \n     yet been brought up for a floor vote. The House of \n     Representatives also passed a similar bill in May 1997. Five \n     former Commissioners of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) \n     support this bill. A Senate floor vote is the only way to \n     continue the process to enact this legislation that would \n     help protect inventors and companies from patent system \n     abuse.\n       Please help protect America's intellectual property and \n     urge Majority Leader Lott (R-MS) to bring this bill to the \n     floor for a vote. Thank you for your attention to this \n     matter, and as a concerned constituent, I request your \n     support of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Peter P. Schirling,\n     IBM Senior Engineer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 18, 1998.\n     Re Scheduling Debate on Patent Reform Legislation, S. 507 \n         (Hatch/Leahy).\n     United States Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing to urge you to support \n     scheduling of the patent reform legislation, S. 507, on the \n     Senate floor before the August recess. This legislation is \n     supported by an overwhelming majority of the Senators and the \n     few Senators who have amendments to offer can easily be \n     accommodated in a time agreement.\n       BIO has been working on this critical legislation for four \n     years, the House passed the bill by a lopsided and bipartisan \n     margin, and it emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee on \n     a near-unanimous vote. There are very few issues for the \n     Senate debate or conference with the House. It should be easy \n     to complete action on this bill and enact it into law this \n     session. Doing so will be a major victory for biomedical and \n     other research.\n       This bill answers the concerns raised by the biotechnology \n     industry and other high technology industries regarding the \n     erosion of patents caused by the adoption of the GATT 20 \n     year-from-filing regime. We need to enact this bill to \n     provide vital protection to biotechnology firms conducting \n     research on cures and therapies for cancer, AIDS, \n     Alzheimer's, and other deadly and disabling diseases.\n       The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) represents \n     almost 800 companies and organizations that use or support \n     biotechnology research. Our companies are finding the next \n     generation of medicines and cures for endemic diseases that \n     diminish the quality of life for all Americans. On a per \n     capita basis, our companies invest more in research and \n     development than any other industry--almost ten times the \n     national average--or about $100,000 per employee per year. \n     This industries investment (almost 10 billion dollars in \n     1998) is protected primarily through the patent system.\n       Patents as an incentive for this critical research. Without \n     patents this research would stop because no investor will \n     fund this research without patents. This is why the patent \n     term protections in this bill are so important. The Hatch-\n     Leahy patent term bill provides complete and unequivocal \n     protections to ensure that diligent patent applicants will \n     not lose patent term under the new GATT 20 year patent law.\n       There is no industry which has lost more in patent \n     protection under the new GATT 20 year patent term than the \n     biotechnology industry. Our industry has been working for \n     three years to secure protections so that diligent patent \n     applicants cannot, and will not, lose patent protection under \n     this new law. It is imperative that the GATT law be amended \n     to protect diligent patent applicants this year.\n       Diligent patent applicants cannot lose patent term under \n     the patent provisions of Hatch-Leahy bill. If there are any \n     delays in the grant of a patent by the Patent and Trademark \n     Office (PTO) which are beyond the applicant's control, the \n     applicant is given extra patent term--day-for-day \n     compensation. This is a similar system which now applies when \n     a patent holder loses patent term due to delays in the \n     approval of a product by the Food and Drug Administration. \n     So, the solution provided by the Hatch-Leahy bill is tried \n     and tested and it works.\n       In addition to these patent term provisions, the Hatch-\n     Leahy bill also provides for publication of internationally \n     filed patent applications 18 months after filing and BIO \n     supports this provision as well. Our companies file for \n     patents in Europe and Japan where all applications are \n     published after 18 months. Therefore 18 month publication in \n     the United States will place U.S. companies on equal footing \n     to their European and Asian competitors.\n       We enthusiastically support the patent term and publication \n     provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, know that it solves the \n     patent term problem, urge you to support scheduling of this \n     bill and support final passage. The current GATT/TRIPS law is \n     very problematic for the biotechnology industry and enactment \n     of S. 507 is needed to eliminate the disincentive for \n     biomedical research,\n       Please contact us with any questions about this critical \n     issue; we would be pleased to meet with you to discuss them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles E. Ludlam,\n                          Vice President for Government Relations.\n                                                   Dave Schmickel,\n     Patent and Legal Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           International Trademark\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: You already know of our association's \n     strong support for S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Reform Act. Our \n     members are trademark owners located in every state of the \n     union. This bipartisan bill makes important changes to the \n     U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that are necessary \n     to enable the USPTO to respond efficiently and effectively to \n     the tremendous growth in trademark applications generated by \n     our robust economy.\n       With next week designated as ``High Tech Week'' in the \n     Senate, where legislation dealing with new technology will be \n     considered, there is no bill that is more deserving of \n     attention and support at this time than S. 507. By converting \n     the USPTO into a government corporation that is 100% user-fee \n     funded, S. 507 will free the agency from constraints which \n     have long hampered efficient operations. Passage of this \n     important legislation will ensure that new products and \n     inventions receive the protection they need both here at home \n     and in global markets.\n       S. 507 provides great value to intellectual property owners \n     and should be allowed to proceed to the Senate floor. We ask \n     for your help in gaining passage of S. 507.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Stimson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     3M, Office of\n\n\n                                Intellectual Property Counsel,\n\n                                       St. Paul, MN, June 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express the strong \n     support of the 3M Company for the reforms contained in S. \n     507, the Hatch/Leahy Omnibus Patent Reform Act, and to \n     request that you ask Senator Lott to schedule it for a Senate \n     vote as soon as possible. S. 507 is critically important to \n     U.S. industry. Its reforms will strengthen and improve the \n     United States patent system, allowing American industry to \n     compete more effectively with its foreign competition.\n       S. 507 will give the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the \n     administrative flexibility to operate at peak efficiency, \n     save inventors money, and accelerate patent processing. It \n     will allow American inventors and companies to see foreign \n     technology contained in U.S. patent applications more than a \n     year earlier than today, while ensuring that domestic \n     inventors who choose not to take advantage of publication \n     before patent grant may continue to do so if they do not file \n     outside of the U.S. The legislation will guarantee diligent \n     applications a patent term of at least 17 years from grant \n     and most will receive an even longer term of exclusivity. S. \n     507 would also make existing reexamination procedures more \n     effective by allowing greater third party participation, \n     while adding numerous safeguards to protect against abuse.\n       One specific reform of S. 507 which 3M most strongly \n     supports is that of creating a prior domestic commercial use \n     defense. This long overdue reform will protect manufacturing \n     jobs in American companies like 3M by ensuring that a late \n     filed patent--nearly one-half of U.S. patents are foreign \n     owned--will not disrupt domestic manufacturing operations. \n     Important technology underlying our successful Post-\n     it' Notes such as those attached to this letter--\n     and the jobs of the American workers who produce them--will \n     be made safer against foreign attack by the passage of S. \n     507.\n       The reforms in S. 507 are designed to improve the \n     functioning of the patent system for all users, large and \n     small. In fact, Senators Hatch and Leahy have recently agreed \n     to amend their bill on the Senate floor in response to \n     requests from small businesses. With these changes, key small \n     business constituencies such as the Technology Chairs of the \n     White House Conference on Small Business, the National \n     Association of Women Business Owners, and the Small Business \n     Technology Coalition have expressed their enthusiastic \n     support for S. 507.\n\n[[Page S8379]]\n\n       U.S. industry needs these patent reforms now. Support S. \n     507 and urge Senator Lott to bring it to a vote promptly.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                   Gary L.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     433 Russell Senate Office Building.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: For the past four years, Intel has been \n     an active participant in the 21st Century Patent Coalition, \n     which supports the enactment of patent reform legislation (S. \n     507). S. 507 would accomplish three broad goals of vital \n     importance to our industry: modernizing patent \n     administration, improving and simplifying dispute resolution \n     procedures in the Patent and Trademark Office, and \n     strengthening inventors' rights in a number of ways, most \n     importantly by protecting them from loss of term due to \n     Patent Office delays. Our coalition has the support of over \n     80 major American industrial companies and 22 industry \n     associations that are composed, primarily, of small \n     businesses.\n       Now, S. 507--which passed the House on a voice vote last \n     year, and was approved in the Senate Judiciary by a vote of \n     17-1--is ready for floor action in the Senate. Our coalition \n     has worked hard to address any and all legitimate concerns \n     about the text of the bill and its impact upon small business \n     entities and independent inventors, and we believe that it \n     would, if enacted, create the most pro-inventor patent system \n     in the world. It has recently received the enthusiastic \n     support of the White House Conference on Small Business \n     Technology Chairs, the National Association of Women Business \n     Owners, and the Small Business Technology Coalition.\n       The patent system we have today will be ill equipped to \n     serve the needs of inventors in the next century if the \n     improvements provided for in S. 507 are not made. We ask for \n     your help in scheduling S. 507 for a floor vote, and for your \n     support for the Committee bill on final passage.\n       Your support will help preserve America's role as the \n     world's technology leader.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carl Silverman,\n     Director of Intellectual Property.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Caterpillar Inc.,\n\n                                         Peoria, IL, June 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express Caterpillar's \n     strong support for S. 507 (Hatch/Leahy), The Omnibus Patent \n     Act of 1997. As you know, S. 507 was reported from the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on a vote of 17-1 and is awaiting Senate \n     floor action. A companion bill passed the House last year.\n       S. 507 would modernize the U.S. patent system through major \n     improvements in our patent laws that will greatly benefit \n     America's large and small businesses, inventors and \n     entrepreneurs. For Caterpillar, this legislation will mean \n     reduced costs, reduced risk, reduced bureaucracy, fewer \n     lawsuits, more certainty regarding property rights, and \n     generally a faster, more responsive patent system.\n       Equally significant, key small business groups now agree \n     that S. 507 will streamline the patent process and help \n     America's inventors who currently suffer from delays in the \n     patent office that are not their fault.\n       It's time for the Senate to vote on this bill to help \n     strengthen the U.S. economy and keep jobs in America.\n       I urge you to contact Majority Leader Lott in support of \n     early scheduling of S. 507 for floor debate, and support the \n     efforts of its sponsors to adopt a bill without weakening \n     amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William B.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Please ask Senator Lott to bring S. \n     507, the Hatch-Leahy Omnibus Patent Act, to the floor as soon \n     as possible. This patent reform is important to AMP, our \n     employees, and the hundreds of inventors in our company who \n     think up new ideas to produce better products, to keep our \n     company competitive, and to create new jobs.\n       It's time to bring this bill up for a vote. The technology \n     chairs of the White House Conference on Small Business have \n     approved S. 507 because, ``(it) will lower the litigation \n     costs for small business, make it easier to know what areas \n     of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way \n     towards giving us a more level playing field vis-a-vis our \n     foreign competitors.'' AMP and the dozens of other companies \n     and associations in the 21st Century Patent Coalition agree.\n       This bill has undergone months and months of scrutiny and \n     compromise and is now ready for a vote. I hope you'll \n     encourage the Majority Leader to schedule floor time for this \n     reasonable reform measure.\n       If you need any more information about S. 507, please let \n     me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John Palafoutas,\n     Director, Federal Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Hewlett-Packard Company,\n\n                                     Palo Alto, CA, June 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act, has \n     been reported out of the Judiciary Committee, but is appears \n     that Majority Leader Lott needs some encouragement to \n     schedule the bill for floor action. Hewlett-Packard Company \n     strongly supports enactment of S. 507 and would appreciate \n     your support in urging Senator Lott to put the bill on the \n     calendar.\n       Enactment of S. 507 would assure that inventors can receive \n     a full 17 years--or more--of patent protection if they pursue \n     their patent claims in a timely manner. It would also \n     streamline patent operations to expedite processing and \n     accelerate the dissemination of new technologies for \n     continuing advancement in products and services.\n       Significantly, S. 507 achieves these important goals \n     without threatening a return to the ``submarine patent'' \n     system that existed before the 1995 reform. Under the old \n     policy, an inventor could manipulate the patent system to \n     stretch the term even while withholding the new knowledge \n     from society. Prior to 1995, inventors could wait until the \n     technology had ripened, and then essentially extort license \n     fees form another inventor who had independently, in good \n     faith, created the same or a similar invention.\n       While ``submarine patents'' are infrequent, when they \n     strike, they are egregious. In an HP cases, for example, the \n     company has paid millions of dollars in royatlieis to a \n     Swedish inventor whose patent has expired in every other \n     country except the United States. This inventor contributed \n     nothing to the technology that is in use, in fact, he did not \n     offer to work with the consortium that was developing the \n     technology in an open-systems environment. A more thorough \n     explanation of that case is attached for your review.\n       Senator Hatch and other supporters of S. 507 have worked \n     diligently with small business and independent inventors to \n     resolve concerns about the bill. It is a good compromise for \n     a more effective patent system as we head into the 21st \n     century. HP urges your support for S. 507 without weakening \n     amendments that would revive the submarine patent system.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Lew Platt,\n\n                                           Chairman, President and\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8377-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8379-S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING JULY 10TH\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has \nreported that for the week ending July 10 that the U.S. imported \n9,323,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,645,000 barrels a day more than \nthe 7,678,000 imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 59.6 percent of their needs last \nweek. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the \nPersian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its \noil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the \n1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil \nsupply.\n  All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in \nthe U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now \n9,323,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $104,137,910 a day.\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr President, today I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 30th anniversary and reunion of the United Mexican-\nAmerican Students of Colorado.\n  In July 1968, Mexican-American students at the University of Colorado \nat Boulder came together to discuss the formation of an organization \ncommitted to initiating change within the educational system to serve \nthe needs of the Mexican-American community and to recruit minority \nstudents to the institution. The outcome of that meeting was the \nformation of the United Mexican-American Students (UMAS).\n  Later that same summer, fifty minority students were admitted into a \ntutorial program initiated by university professors and students to \nmake higher education accessible to African American and Chicano \nstudents. UMAS students worked for the program. The Migrant Action \nProgram also brought migrant workers into the university and they also \nbecame UMAS members.\n  A student referendum initiated and supported by UMAS was passed in \nMarch 1969 which dedicated five dollars from registration fees each \nsemester to create scholarships for minority students. These funds and \nfederal matching funds allowed UMAS to implement tutorial counseling, \nrecruitment and financial aid programs. On-campus accredited summer \nremedial programs followed. Students who successfully completed those \nclasses gained admission and earned financial aid.\n  UMAS has thrived on the Boulder Campus of the University of Colorado \nfor three decades. This summer marks the thirtieth anniversary of the \norganization. To mark this important anniversary, UMAS alumni and \nsupporters will come together to renew their commitment and unity.\n  Mr. President, I commend the work of UMAS students and alumni \nassociations for their commitment and continuing efforts to serve \ndeserving students on the Boulder campus of the University of Colorado. \nAs someone who has experienced hardship, I sincerely appreciate the \nempowerment UMAS has offered to thousands of deserving students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8380-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8380-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8380-S8381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-6048.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nphaseout the estate and gift taxes over a 10-year period; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             estate and gift tax rate reduction act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. It seems that in every Congress the \nissue of ``death taxes'' comes before this body at some time. Each year \nwe tinker around the edges of the issue, making adjustments here and \nexemptions there. But the fact is, estate and gift taxes still remain a \nburden on American families, particularly those who own their own \nbusinesses.\n  Family-owned businesses are hit with the highest tax rate when they \nare handed down to descendants. In fact, the highest estate and gift \ntax rate is fifty-five percent--that's far higher than even the highest \nincome tax rate bracket of thirty-nine percent. Estate and gift taxes \nright now are one of the leading reasons why family farms and small \nbusinesses are declining; the burden of the inheritance tax is just too \ncrushing. That hardly seems fair to me. It also seems to suggest that \nfamilies should spend as much money as they can while they are still \nalive, since whatever they have managed to save will create a huge tax \nburden when passed on to their descendants.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Estate and Gift Tax Rate \nReduction Act of 1998, which will gradually eliminate this tax burden. \nThat's right, I said eliminate, not reduce. This bill will phase-out \nthe estate and gift tax by gradually reducing the amount of the tax by \nfive percent each year until the highest rate--55%--reaches zero. \nSeveral states have already taken the initiative and phased out this \ntype of tax on their own. I think it's time we follow the example they \nhave set, and eliminate them across the board. At the same time, we \nwill be encouraging better investment, savings and retirement planning \nby relieving the threat of an impending tax crisis.\n  This legislation is a companion bill to H.R. 3879, introduced by our \ncolleague in the House, Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn. I hope my \ncolleagues will support passage of this bill, and will join me in \nputting a real end to this oppressive and unfair tax.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2318\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Estate and Gift Tax Rate \n     Reduction Act of 1998''.\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) estate and gift tax rates, which reach as high as 55 \n     percent of a decedent's taxable estate, are in most cases \n     substantially in excess of the tax rates imposed on the same \n     amount of regular income and capital gains income; and\n       (2) a reduction in estate and gift tax rates to a level \n     more comparable with the rates of tax imposed on regular \n     income and capital gains income will make the estate and gift \n     tax less confiscatory and mitigate its negative impacts on \n     American families and businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nparticipate in the design, planning, and construction of the Truckee \nWatershed Reclamation Project for the reclamation and reuse of water; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        truckee river watershed reclamation project legislation\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I introduce today a bill to authorize the \nTruckee River Watershed Reclamation Project. The water in Nevada is a \nprecious resource that should not be wasted and we need to reuse what \nwe can of this commodity. The Title XVI program in the Bureau of \nReclamation is aimed at reclaiming the water for use within the \ncommunity. The projects that are within this watershed project will in \nfact be utilized in multiple municipal functions throughout the Truckee \nRiver Basin communities.\n  Specifically, the North Valleys Reuse Project would be to reclaim the \nwastewater from Reno and Sparks and convey that water to subdivisions \nextending to the north of Reno for irrigation purposes so that the \ngroundwater can be preserved for domestic and other potable uses. Once \nthe new effluent reuse system is operational, groundwater currently \nused for irrigation can then be a reliable source in a region with \nlimited resources. Additionally, the Spanish Springs Valley Reuse \nProject would use treated wastewater with excessive total dissolved \nsolids to be channeled for irrigation and environmental watering. The \ntreated wastewater would be returned to the valley where numerous \nparks, golf courses, pastures could be irrigated with effluent reducing \nthe quantity of groundwater pumped and improving the quality of the \naquifer. Another aspect of this reclamation effort is the protection of \nthe scarce resource during emergency conditions, increases the \nreliability of domestic water supply in the event of a toxic spill into \nthe Truckee River through a series of optional programs in cooperation \nwith the regional and community resource planners. When this project is \nauthorized and appropriated for the counties can begin their \nfeasibility studies of their projects and programs within its Regional \nWater Management Plan.\n  Mr. President, as the ranking member on the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations, I have the opportunity to examine closely \nthe Bureau of Reclamation's programs and I appreciate the assistance \nthe Bureau gives to communities throughout the arid west. The first \nproject initiated by the Bureau of Reclamation was in Nevada called the \nNewlands Project and Nevada communities have benefited from the Federal \nassistance in water management. Now, the Bureau of Reclamation Title \nXVI program can be of immeasurable value to the communities in the \nTruckee River Watershed to preserve and reclaim some of this precious \nresource.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Mack, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Murkowski, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 2323. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npreserve access to home health services under the Medicare Program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              home health access preservation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Home \nHealth Access Preservation Act of 1998, which I am introducing today. I \nhave been deeply involved in home care issues throughout my career, and \nthat involvement has deepened in the past year. It was 1 year ago that \nthe Special Committee on Aging, which I chair held a hearing on fraud \nand abuse of the Medicare home health benefit. That led to a \nroundtable, where we brainstormed on solutions to that problem. That \ndiscussion led to turn to a bill, the Home Health Integrity \nPreservation Act of 1998, which I was proud to cosponsor with Senator \nBreaux.\n  In March of this year, the Aging Committee held another hearing on \nhome health. This hearing focused on the Balanced Budget Act provisions \naffecting seniors' access to home care. At this hearing, we learned of \nthe serious problems being caused by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration's surety bond regulations, as well as by the Interim \nPayment System for home health. Like the earlier hearing, this hearing \nled to two pieces of legislation. The first was Senate Joint Resolution \n50, which would have vetoed the surety bond regulation. I was pleased \nthat this effort brought the administration to the bargaining table, \nand I believe that the surety bond problem will be solved as we work \ntogether.\n  The second piece of legislation to come out of that hearing is the \nbill I am introducing today. It addresses a major piece of unfinished \nbusiness in the home health area, and that is the Interim Payment \nSystem. What's wrong with that system? In short, it bases payment on an \nindividual home health agency's historical costs from Fiscal Year 1994. \nThat means that if the agency had high cost per patient in that year, \nit can receive relatively high payment this year. However, if the \nagency had low costs in that year, its payments this year is severely \nlimited.\n  This approach would be fine if the Health Care Financing \nAdministration knew that the higher-cost agency had sicker patients \nthis year, but the sad truth is that HCFA has no idea. So the interim \nsystem has been a windfall for\n\n[[Page S8384]]\n\nsome agencies, but crushing for agencies with low historical costs. In \nIowa, we are blessed with many efficient providers, but this system \nseems to prove the old adage that ``No good deed goes unpunished.'' In \nmany cases, the providers who are suffering--and more importantly, \nwhose patients are suffering--are those who most want to keep in the \nMedicare program.\n  Another feature of the system is that it treats older and newer home \nhealth providers in completely different ways. In some areas of the \ncountry, new agencies simply cannot compete with older agencies, while \nin other areas (such as Iowa), it is the older agencies that are at the \ndisadvantage. This kind of arbitrary distinction just doesn't make \nsense.\n  For months, I have worked with a bipartisan group of Finance \nCommittee members on fixing the Interim Payment System. This bill is \nthe product of those efforts. Believe me, if this were an easy issue to \ntackle, I would have introduced this bill months ago. Instead, we have \ngone to great lengths to get input from home health providers, as well \nas from a broad range of Senate colleagues. Those efforts have paid \noff, and I am gratified to be introducing the bill with seventeen \noriginal cosponsors, and maybe more by the end of the day.\n\n  The bill has a number of features, but its basic approach is to \nabandon our reliance on individual agencies' historical costs. Instead, \nit would pay all agencies--old or new--based on a 50/50 blend of \nnational and regional average rates from the 1994 base year. This 50/50 \nblend is the only approach that can win support from all parts of the \ncountry. In addition, the bill seeks to provide supplemental payments \nfor patients with long stays as home care recipients. We think it is \nessential that agencies be compensated for taking these neediest \npatients.\n  The bill is budget-neutral, which in my opinion it has to be in order \nto have a chance of passage. There is a great deal of concern, which I \nshare, about the automatic 15 percent cut in all home health payment \nthat will occur in October 1999. We did consider an attempt to address \nthat cut in this bill, but the cosponsors have learned from the \nCongressional Budget Office that, under its methodology, such language \nwould send the bill's costs skyrocketing. We think that this would doom \nthe bill's chances of enactment this year. We do believe that there is \na crisis that needs to be addressed this year, and thus we have not \nincluded the 15 percent provision in the bill. I will urge the Senate \nto revisit that issue next year, when we'll have more information on \nhome health cost growth or decline, but for now it cannot be addressed.\n  If there was any doubt about the need for action to rectify the \nInterim Payment System, I believe that it has vanished with the \nadministration's recent indications that prospective payment will not \nbe ready in October 1999, as mandated by Congress. Just this morning, \nat a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, the \nadministrator of HCFA confirmed that the Year 2000 computer problem has \nmade meeting the deadline totally impossible. In fact, at HCFA's \nsuggestion, we have written the per-beneficiary limit numbers into the \nbill itself, so that HCFA will not need to issue a regulation in order \nto implement the bill. HCFA just doesn't think it could issue a \nregulation doing so, in light of its Year 2000 problems. The fact is \nthat we do not know when prospective payment will be ready. We had \nbetter do what we can now, to make sure our agencies can hang on until \nthat day.\n  Let me make a comment about political realities. Our focus was on \ncreating something that could actually pass this year, and so the bill \nis a product of compromise. In talking with home health providers, I \nfind that many of them understand the need to be realists. I wish that \nthe big national associations were equally reasonable. It is already \nthe middle of July. This bill's moderate approach is the only one that \nhas any chance of moving this year. If there really is an emergency in \nhome health, which I believe, then everyone needs to get serious right \nnow. Let me be more explicit: I call on the home health industry to \nrecognize that this approach is as good as it's gong to get, and to \nsupport it. I call on HCFA to make fixing this system a top, near-term \npriority. And I call on my colleagues here in Congress to unite around \na moderate, feasible formula. Our Nation's seniors and disabled are \nwaiting for us.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, along with \nSenator Grassley, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Breaux, the Home \nHealth Access Preservation Act of 1998. Essentially, our legislation is \ngeared at reforming the home health interim payment system.\n  Several years ago, because home health care costs were rising at such \na rapid, alarming rate, Congress, in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \ndecided to do something about it. What did we do? We passed a provision \ncalled the interim payment system as a transition interim system for \nhome health care agencies to live under until we move to a prospective \npayment system.\n  What does all that mean? It is this: In the first 15 years of \nMedicare, home health care constituted about 2 percent of the total \nMedicare budget. Medicare, as we know, is the program that is financed \nalmost entirely out of payroll taxes. Those dollars go to Uncle Sam, \nand Uncle Sam then pays hospitals and doctors for health care for \nsenior citizens. Part A is hospital care; Part B is doctor's care for \nsenior citizens. Again, only 2 percent of Part A of Medicare--that is \nthe hospital part--was for home health care.\n  In 1997, however, the total amount of Medicare Part A dollars--that \nis, the hospital dollars that go out to senior citizens--was about 15 \npercent. That is a rise from 2 percent up to 15 percent, a staggering \nincrease in home health care.\n  Why did that happen? Basically, because hospitals were moving \npatients out of hospitals. They were moving some of the patients into \nhome health care settings. In addition to that, it was a lot cheaper to \nprovide some services out of the hospitals. And, on top of that, \nseniors prefer to have care at home rather than sometimes in the \nhospital or perhaps in a nursing home. Home health care has risen \ndramatically.\n  Well, as a consequence, there has been extra pressure on the Medicare \ntrust fund. And that is why Congress, in 1997, decided to pass this \nprovision, changing the way we reimburse home health care and moving to \na system to try to get a handle on all this rising cost.\n  The old way that Medicare paid home health care was called cost-based \nreimbursement. Essentially, a home health care agency would get \nreimbursed, get paid, for the costs that that home health care agency \nincurred in treating patients--basically cost-plus; that is, the agency \nwould get whatever it cost and was able to add on just a little bit to \nstay in business.\n  As a consequence, several phenomena developed.\n  In some States, there was a proliferation of home health care \nagencies. They just sprung up all over because they are cost based. In \naddition to getting more patients to get reimbursed more, they provide \nmore services to the public.\n  In some other States, home health care agencies were very efficient; \nthat is, they did their work, and they did not try to provide extra \nservices, nor did they get extra reimbursement.\n  We are in a position now where the interim system that Congress \npassed in 1997 is causing problems, and significant problems, for all \nhome health care agencies, in particularly those rural areas. Why is \nthat? It is because the provision we passed, the interim payment \nsystem, provided that home health care agencies would be paid on \nwhatever their costs were in 1994.\n  Well, that means that those home health care agencies that were very \nefficient in 1994, compared with those who were very inefficient in \n1994, are adversely affected. Why is that? That is because, if the \npayment is based upon 1994 levels, and it is locked in at 1994 levels, \nand you are a very efficient home health care agency--you are cutting \ncosts--then you are paid less.\n  On the other hand, if you were a very inefficient home health care \nagency in 1994, and you are locked into whatever Uncle Sam was paying \nyou in 1994, you can continue to be inefficient. Well, that is \nobviously not fair. It is not fair to those home health care agencies \nwho were doing a pretty good job.\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\n  In addition, there is another problem. The movement from cost-based \nreimbursement over to what is called a prospective payment \nreimbursement--that is, paying home health care agencies a certain \npayment for a given procedure regardless of what else is going on with \nthe agency--is based on the assumption that the efficient home health \ncare agencies, the efficient providers--hospitals are also paid on a \nprospective payment system--that is, the efficient ones will survive, \nthey will do well; the inefficient, those that are getting the same \ndollars but are inefficiently run, poorly run, will fail, they will not \nbe able to make it.\n  That is good--the theory is--because the efficient survive and the \ninefficient don't. The theory goes on to hold that, well, that is OK \nfor patients, for people, because when the inefficient fails, there is \na nearby efficient hospital, or nearby efficient home health care \nagency in this case. So patients are still well served. They just go to \nthe other, nearby, efficient home health care agency.\n  That is a false assumption, Mr. President, for rural areas, because \nin rural areas of America, when an inefficient fails--or for some other \nreason that home health care agency cannot make ends meet--when it \nfails, there is no other nearby home health care agency, there is no \nnearby alternative provider because they are just too many miles apart.\n  We, Mr. President, are introducing legislation designed to fix this \nproblem until we finally move to a more permanent compensation system \nfor rural health care agencies. Essentially, what it does is, we say to \na State, we are going to have a single rate per State, not differential \namong States, but per State. We also get rid of the cap on agency-\nspecific costs, because we move to a 50-50 blend of regional as well as \nnational averages.\n  That is, I think, a fair compromise between those who want fixed \ncosts based on a national rate and those who want the rate to be based \nupon the particular characteristics of the region.\n  I think this helps. I think it goes a long way to solving the problem \nthat many home health care agencies have. This, by the way, is in \naddition to the surety bond problem facing home health care agencies, \nanother matter which we are addressing separately.\n  But I hope this interim measure that we are now reforming will be \nreformed along the way to provide for, in the bill, making sure that a \nlot of people get health care who otherwise would not have it \navailable.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join a number of my \ncolleagues, and most especially Senators Grassley, Baucus, and Breaux, \nin introducing the ``Home Health Care Access Preservation Act of \n1998.'' This legislation seeks to prevent many reputable home health \nagencies from going out of business and it will ensure that patients \ncontinue to have access to quality home care in the future.\n  I would like to talk about the importance of health care in the lives \nof our Nation's seniors and why we must take action to protect their \naccess to home care. Some people question why we need to make these \nchanges. I think they ask because when we talk about providing care, \nsometimes we forget that it is about taking care of someone. Home care \nis not just about giving people their pills and checking their blood \npressure. It's about giving people who need a little help the ability \nto stay at home, surrounded by their family and friends. It's about \npreserving the dignity of people who've worked hard their entire lives \nto provide for their families and serve the community they live in.\n  Mr. President, our seniors should not lose their right to live life \nin the way they want because of their age. They want to stay at home. \nThey can get the care they need at home. We can provide it for them. \nAnd if we can do it, I think we should.\n  There are also financial reasons to provide home health care. When \nmanaged properly, home health care can save the health system money. \nHomes care can often be substituted for more expensive care provided in \nhospitals and nursing homes.\n  Last year, the Congress made needed reforms to the Medicare Program \nthrough the Balanced Budget Act, including moving to a prospective \npayment system (PPS) for home care. Everyone, including the home health \nindustry, agrees that the Medicare Program should move away from a \nretrospective payment system and PPS to encourage all providers to be \nmore cost-effective.\n  The move toward PPS was included among many other reforms to \nMedicare. We, however, knew that we couldn't move directly into PPS--we \nneeded time and more information to create a workable system. \nTherefore, the Interim Payment System (IPS) was also established in the \nBBA to transition home care from fee-for-service to prospective \npayment. But, in making these changes, the future viability of home \nhealth care has been threatened.\n  Already, at least four home health agencies have gone out of business \nin my home State of West Virginia. In rural states like West Virginia, \nsometimes there is only one agency to provide these services in the \narea. We cannot afford to lose providers without endangering the well-\nbeing of our citizens.\n  Therefore, it is imperative that we again take action to make sure \nthat the home health care problems we're facing today do not become a \ncrisis that we'll have to face in the near future. This legislation \nwill help do just that.\n  This bill attempts to accomplish three critical goals:\n  1. Keep agencies viable by providing a badly needed bridge between \nthe old home health payment system and the new system due to be \nimplemented in the next several years.\n  2. Level the playing field in the home care industry, ensuring that \nefficient, low cost providers are able to continue providing services \nas Medicare transitions to a new payment system.\n  3. Make certain that patients with chronic health needs have \ncontinued access to quality care.\n  Many members of the home health industry are particularly concerned \nabout this issue of providing quality health care to patients with \nchronic conditions. Under current law, caring for the chronically ill \npushes home health agencies closer to the brink of bankruptcy. We share \nthat concern and realize that IPS does not address this issue. As a \nresult, our bill creates supplemental payments to compensate home \nhealth agencies for the added costs they incur caring for the \nchronically ill.\n  While this bill would address the immediate concerns faced by the \nhome health care industry, and is an important step toward protecting \naccess--there is still more that needs to be done. While the BBA \nintended for IPS to be a temporary system, it now looks like it may be \nin place longer than we expected. I have recently learned that HCFA may \nhave to postpone the implementation of the prospective payment system. \nThey will have their hands full restructuring their computer systems to \nprepare for the year 2000. I remain concerned that if we do not move to \nPPS quickly, all agencies will face an additional 15 percent across the \nboard cut. Certainly, this will place an undue financial burden on the \nagencies and force many to close their doors.\n  Mr. President, I am not advocating going back in time and undo the \nBBA. However, we must address the inequities that resulted from its \nenactment, particularly when it comes to making certain our seniors get \nthe care they need. To do this, we must level the playing field so that \nall reputable home health care agencies can remain competitive. Our \nlegislation will accomplish this by providing a bridge between the old \nMedicare payment system and the new one.\n  We have to remain watchful of the situation to make sure that home \nhealth care continues to be a viable option for so many in need. We \nhave a commitment to those who came before us and sacrificed so much to \nmake this Nation what it is today. I believe that we have to honor that \ncommitment, and I urge my colleagues to do so by supporting the Home \nHealth Care Access Preservation Act.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to once again express my concern \nover the plight of Medicare beneficiaries who are in need of home \nhealth care services. I am pleased to cosponsor the Home Health Access \nPreservation Act of 1998, with my colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, as an attempt to address these concerns. The Interim Payment \nSystem which was enacted by this Congress for the reimbursement of home \nhealth care services is not\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\nachieving the policy goals that Congress wants nor is it not serving \nthe best interest of American citizens.\n  The act is appropriately titled because, without a correction, access \nto home health services for Medicare's most vulnerable beneficiaries \nwill be seriously damaged. Since the new reimbursement system has been \nimplemented, no fewer than 1,200 agencies have left Medicare program \nand most of these 1,200 have been forced to cease operations. Although \nmany of our health policy actions are based upon allowing the market to \ndetermine the optimum efficiency of our health care system, we must \nrecognize that not all areas and all sectors are prepared for a rapid \nchange in how these forces operate. The problem of access to home care \nis particularly troublesome in rural areas and inner cities where these \nservices are sorely needed.\n  My home State of Vermont is a case in point. Home health agencies and \ntheir patients are facing a true crisis. There are only 13 agencies in \nthe State, all not-for-profit, each serving a distinct and separate \narea. The system was developed to meet the needs of our largely rural \nState, and all of these agencies have a long tradition of providing \nquality care to our citizens. We cannot accept the loss of a single \nagency without serious consequences for patients and other sectors of \ncare.\n  I want to emphasize that today we are proposing a revision to the \nhome health reimbursement system because of our deep concern for the \nwelfare of those frail elders and disabled individuals who have come to \ndepend upon home care for their very existence. Yes, we are concerned \nabout fiscal responsibility. We remain determined to eliminate fraud \nand abuse within the Medicare program. Of course, we must find a way to \npreserve the Medicare Trust Fund for future generations. But it is not \nacceptable to seek these goals by any mechanism that will impose an \neven greater burden on those who are most in need of our help.\n  The Home Health Access Preservation Act of 1998 is budget neutral. It \ndoes not change the fact that home health agencies will have to work \nhard to remain financially viable and allocate their resources \ncarefully. The Act does, however, level the playing field for home \nhealth agencies. Under the present IPS system, agencies in close \nproximity to one another are expected to operate competitively under \nhighly divergent payment limits. Furthermore, under the current IPS \nsystem, the most efficient agencies and those that care for the most \ndifficult cases, are hit hardest by the reduction in reimbursement. \nThus the Act does provide some relief for agencies in the worst \npredicament.\n  Finally, it is important to recognize that the Home Health Access \nPreservation Act represents an interim resolution to our most pressing \nconcerns. The implementation of a prospective payment system as \ndirected by Congress represents the preferred solution. Thus, the bill \nrequires the Secretary to provide regular quarterly updates to Congress \non progress toward the development of the prospective payment system \nfor home health care. But for now, Congress must pass legislation to \nensure that home care remains an option for Medicare beneficiaries. We \nalso must pledge to work with the Health Care Financing Administration \nand the home health industry to replace the interim payment system with \na permanent system which better meets the needs of patients and is fair \nto health care providers.\n  This Congress struggles with many challenges, but I doubt that there \nare many that are of greater significance than home health care. Access \nto home care affects a significant number of persons, has a serious \ninfluence on their mental and physical health, and its financial impact \nis measured in billions of dollars. We must act. We must act quickly to \ncurtail the negative consequences of the payment system as it exists \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2324. A bill to amend section 922(t) of title 18, United States \nCode, to require the reporting of information to the chief law \nenforcement officer of the buyer's residence and to require a minimum \n72-hour waiting period before the purchase of a handgun, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the brady waiting period extension act of 1998\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I with my colleagues Senators \nChafee, Lautenberg, Torricelli, Reed, Dodd, and Boxer introduce the \n``Brady Waiting Period Extension Act of 1998.'' It is vital that we \nenact this measure this year if we are to ensure Americans that the \npopular Brady Bill will continue to be one hundred percent effective.\n  Almost 5 years ago, Congress passed the Brady Bill. That law \ncontained a provision that required a 5 day waiting period before a \nperson can buy a gun. Unfortunately, on November 30 of this year, the \nwaiting period will be eliminated when we begin using the national \ninstant check system for gun purchasers.\n  I fully support the use of an instant check system to determine if a \nputative firearm purchaser is legally barred from owning a gun because \nof a criminal record. But I believe that it must be coupled with a \ncooling off period.\n  Let me briefly explain what his legislation would to. It would \nrequire that anyone who wishes to buy a handgun must wait three days. \nThere are two exceptions to this requirement. First, if a prospective \npurchaser presents a written statement from his of her local chief law \nenforcement officer stating that the handgun is needed immediately \nbecause of a threat to that person's life or that of his family, then \nthe cooling off period will not apply. Second, if a prospective \npurchaser lives in a state that has a licensing requirement--and there \nare 27 such states--then the federal cooling off period will not apply.\n  I think that both of these are common sense exceptions. Obviously \npeople who have a legitimate and immediate need of a handgun for self-\ndefense should be able to buy one. And in the states that have \nlicensing or permit systems, the process of getting a permit acts as a \nstate cooling off period.\n  This measure also requires that when a person applies to buy a gun \nthat the gun shop owner send a copy of the application to the local \nchief law enforcement officer. In addition, it alters the amount of \ntime that the state or federal government has to investigate a \npotential purchaser who has an arrest record. Under the law that will \ngo into effect on the first of December this year, if a person with an \narrest record applies for a gun, law enforcement will have three days \nto determine if that arrest resulted in a conviction. The measure we \nintroduce today would give law enforcement five days.\n  Mr. President, let me walk you through the process of buying a gun if \nthis law were in place.\n  If you are in a state that does not have a permit system in place, \nthen you go into a store and fill out a purchase form. A copy of that \nform will be sent to the Insta-Check point of contact for your state \nand a copy will also be sent to the chief law enforcement officer for \nwhere you live. You will then need to wait three days whereupon, \nassuming that you do not have a criminal record or any of the other \ndisqualifying characteristics, you will be able to pick up your gun.\n  If on the other hand, when the Insta-Check is run, the FBI learns \nthat you were arrested, then you will have to wait at least 5 days. \nThat five days will be used to determine if the arrest resulted in a \nconviction. If it did not, then after 5 days you can get your gun. It \nyou were arrested and convicted then you cannot get your gun and may be \nprosecuted.\n  Enacting this law is only sensible. A cooling off period may be the \nonly barrier between a woman and her abusive husband whose local \nrestraining order doesn't show up on a computer check or the only \nobstacle in the way of a troubled person planning to commit suicide and \ntake others with them. A cooling off period will prevent crimes of \npassion and spontaneous suicides. The list of people who have bought \nguns and used them within a few hours or a day to kill themselves or \nothers is far too long.\n  A recent study by the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence demonstrates \na disturbing trend that reinforces the need for a cooling off period. \nNormally, 4 to 5% of all crime guns traced by the police were used in \nmurders. But the\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nstudy found that 20% of all guns traced within 7 days of purchase were \nused in murders. That is a startlingly high incidence of guns being \nbought and used very soon thereafter to commit a murder.\n  But this measure has a second, equally important justification.\n  That the Insta-Check system is in very good shape, but it will never \nbe perfect. For example, it will not have a lot of mental health \nrecords. And it is unlikely to have information like restraining orders \nentered in domestic violence cases. Letting local law enforcement know \nabout a potential gun purchase is a good idea--the local sheriff may \nknow that a person trying to buy a gun has a restraining order while \nthe FBI's Insta-check computer might not. In short, then, this bill \nwill help serve as a fail safe mechanism for the Insta-Check system. I \nfor one do not want to learn a year from now that someone got a gun and \nused it to harm someone else when a simple check of local records in \naddition to the Insta-Check would have revealed that the purchaser had \na history of mental instability.\n  Making the Brady waiting period permanent is not about more \ngovernment. It's about fewer gun crime victims. I hope that we can all \nagree on this goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be referred to as the ``Brady Waiting Period \n     Extension Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenator Durbin in introducing the Brady Waiting Period Extension Act of \n1998.\n  This legislation will build on the incredible success of the original \nBrady Act, which I cosponsored. Since that law went into effect in \nFebruary 1994, our hard-working law enforcement officers have prevented \nmore than 240,000 felons, domestic abusers, and mentally ill people \nfrom buying guns. In 1997 alone, 69,000 prohibited purchases were \nstopped. Because of the Brady Act, and the Domestic Violence Gun Ban \nwhich I authored, over 6,000 criminals convicted of domestic violence \noffenses were prevented from buying a gun last year.\n  These laws are working. They are saving countless lives, helping to \nprotect women and children, and making our streets safer. Just imagine \nhow much more gun violence there would have been, if these gun \npurchases had not been stopped.\n  And the Brady Act does more than just stop handgun purchases--it \nhelps the police put violent criminals behind bars. Consider just a few \nexamples:\n  The Brady Law stopped a handgun sale in Colorado to a man who was \nwanted for armed robbery in the State of Washington. As a result of the \nBrady check, he was arrested in Colorado and extradited back to \nWashington.\n  In Utah, an individual trying to purchase a handgun from a pawn \ndealer was arrested by the Salt Lake City Police Department on a felony \nwarrant held by the State of Colorado for aggravated sexual abuse of a \nchild.\n  Incredibly, criminals continue to try to buy guns at gun stores. But \nthanks to the Brady Law, they do not get the deadly tools of their \ntrade, and lives are saved.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will build upon this success. \nAs my colleagues know, the five-day waiting period for handgun \npurchases will expire in November of this year, and be replaced with a \ncomputerized background check system. While we all hope that this \ncomputerized system will work well, there are some potential problems. \nThe Department of Justice and the FBI have done a good job centralizing \nmost crime record, but some information, like restraining orders and \nmental health records, will not be available through the system.\n  Our bill will ensure that no criminals slip through the system, by \nrequiring that the Brady forms be sent to the chief law enforcement \nofficer where the buyer resides. This requirement will give local \npolice the opportunity to look through local records and determine \nwhether the buyer is a prohibited purchaser.\n  This legislation will also provide a 72-hour waiting period for \nhandgun purchases. By maintaining a brief ``cooling off'' period, we \ncan help prevent crimes of passion and suicides. When you consider that \n20 percent of funds used in murders are purchased in the week before \nthe crime, this provision will help save lives.\n  Mr. President, these are sensible provisions that will help reduce \ngun violence in our nation. And make no mistake about it, there is much \nwork to be done.\n  In the United States, firearm violence is currently the second \nleading cause of injury-related death, behind automobile-related \nfatalities. This violence is increasing at an alarming rate. By the \nyear 2003, firearm fatalities are projected to become the United States \nleading cause of injury-related death.\n  Violence is taking a terrible toll on our children. Homicide is the \nthird leading cause of death for youths 5 to 14 years old and the vast \nmajority of these homicides were committed by firearms.\n  Mr. President, our nation can do better. We can and we must stop the \ngun violence on our street. The Brady Waiting Period Extension Act will \nhelp us toward that goal, and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I am here once again to talk about \nS. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. On this date back in 1878, a \ngentleman named Thaddeus Hyatt was granted a patent for reinforced \nconcrete. Now, 120 years later, the Senate is refusing to reinforce \nAmerican innovation by failing to take concrete action to reform our \nnation's patent laws.\n  We are presented with an opportunity that will not soon repeat \nitself--an opportunity to pass S. 507 and give U.S. inventors longer \npatent terms, put more royalties in their pockets, save them money in \ncostly patent litigation, and avoid wasting their development resources \non duplicative research. At the same time, we can get our new \ntechnology more rapidly into the marketplace and make U.S. companies \nmore competitive globally.\n  Remaining globally competitive is not an idle concern. The failure of \nthis body to enact the reforms of our patent system contained in S. 507 \nhas given foreign entities applying for and receiving patents in the \nU.S. unfair advantages over U.S. firms--advantages that U.S. persons \nfiling and doing business abroad do not have. This ability to keep U.S. \ninventors in the dark about the latest technological developments does \nnot work to our economic advantage. Why are we turning our backs on our \nbusinesses, small and large, by not voting on this bill?\n  I have made recent speeches citing the strong support this \nlegislation has around the country. This legislation has more than just \nVermont or any state in mind. It has the entire country in its best \ninterest. Our 200 year old patent system has provided protections to \nmany of our inventions that have led to our global economic leadership \nposition in the world marketplace. However, that leadership position is \nbeing threatened. Litigation has increased. Small inventors have been \ntaken advantage of. Inventors and businesses are asking for our help \nand requesting that we pass S. 507.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee reported this bill out over a year ago \nby an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 17-1, 17-1, and this bill has \nyet to see the light of day on the floor. No longer can we turn the \nother cheek when\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\nAmerican business lets out such a cry for help. We need to bring this \nbill to the floor now and to pass it. We must not squander this \nopportunity to not only update our patent system but to come to \nAmerica's defense.\n  I inserted into the Record on June 23, letters of support from the \nWhite House Conference on Small Businesses, the National Association of \nWomen Business Owners, the Small Business Technology Coalition, \nNational Small Business United, the National Venture Capital \nAssociation, and the 21st Century Patent Coalition.\n  On July 10, I inserted in the Record additional letters of support \nfrom The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of American, PhRMA; the \nAmerican Automobile Manufacturers Association; the Software Publishers \nAssociation; the Semiconductor Industry Association; the Business \nSoftware Alliance; the American Electronics Association; and the \nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that additional letters of support for S. \n507 be included in the Record. These letters are from IBM; the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization; the International Trademark \nAssociation; 3M; Intel Corporation; Caterpillar; AMP Incorporated; and \nHewlett-Packard Company.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Hewlett-Packard Company,\n\n                                     Palo Alto, CA, June 22, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act, has \n     been reported out of the Judiciary Committee, but it appears \n     that Majority Leader Lott needs some encouragement to \n     schedule the bill for floor action. Hewlett-Packard Company \n     strongly supports enactment of S. 507 and would appreciate \n     your support in urging Senator Lott to put the bill on the \n     calendar.\n       Enactment of S. 507 would assure that inventors can receive \n     a full 17 years--or more--of patent protection if they pursue \n     their patent claims in a timely manner. It would also \n     streamline patent operations to expedite processing and \n     accelerate the dissemination of new technologies for \n     continuing advancement in products and services.\n       Significantly, S. 507 achieves these important goals \n     without threatening a return to the ``submarine patent'' \n     system that existed before the 1995 reform. Under the old \n     policy, an inventor could manipulate the patent system to \n     stretch the term even while withholding the new knowledge \n     from society. Prior to 1995, inventors could wait until the \n     technology had ripened, and then essentially extort license \n     fees from another inventor who had independently, in good \n     faith, created the same or a similar invention.\n       While ``submarine patents'' are infrequent, when they \n     strike, they are egregious. In an HP case, for example, the \n     company has paid millions of dollars in royalties to a \n     Swedish inventor whose patent has expired in every other \n     country except the United States. This inventor contributed \n     nothing to the technology that is in use, in fact, he did not \n     offer to work with the consortium that was developing the \n     technology in an open-systems environment. A more thorough \n     explanation of that case is attached for your review.\n       Senator Hatch and other supporters of S. 507 have worked \n     diligently with small business and independent inventors to \n     resolve concerns about the bill. It is a good compromise for \n     a more effective patent system as we head into the 21st \n     century. HP urges your support for S. 507 without weakening \n     amendments that would revive the submarine patent system.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lew Platt.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    IBM, Internet Media Group,\n\n                                 Essex Junction, VT, June 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As an inventor I rely on the strength \n     of the U.S. patent system to legally protect my invention(s). \n     I am also the chairman of an ANSI standardization committee \n     (NCITS L3.1) which represents the United States in an \n     International Standardization Forum (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG \n     11). Our committee has developed the Emmy Award winning \n     standard called MPEG-2, a standard which may have never come \n     to pass had it not been for strong International patent \n     protection. We are currently working on the future of \n     International Multimedia (MPEG-4), a standard which promises \n     to be as popular and widely used as MPEG-2 will be. The \n     strength of the patent laws is essential to promoting \n     participation and the development of International Standards. \n     However, the system which for years has effectively \n     encouraged innovation and protected inventors, is no longer \n     effective. As significant number of ways have been found to \n     abuse it, such as people and/or companies obtaining \n     inappropriate patents and in some cases pilfering others' \n     hard-earned invention. This threatens to undermine America's \n     position as the global leader in technology innovation. I am \n     proud that my work as an inventor has contributed to IBM's \n     patent portfolio.\n       There is now legislation pending before you that will help \n     restore leadership and integrity to the U.S. patent system. \n     It is responsive to today's fast paced, highly competitve \n     environment, and it will protect inventors like me. I am \n     writing to ask you to urge Majority Leader Lott (R-MS) to \n     bring S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, to the Senate \n     floor as soon as possible and for you to support its final \n     passage.\n       The bipartisan Omnibus Patent Act of 1997, S. 507, was \n     passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee 17-1 and has not \n     yet been brough up for a floor vote. The House of \n     Representatives also passed a similar bill in May 1997. Five \n     former Commissioners of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) \n     support this bill. A Senate floor vote is the only way to \n     continue the process to enact this legislation that would \n     help protect inventors and companies from patent system \n     abuse.\n       Please help protect America's intellectual property and \n     urge Majority Leader Lott (R-MS) to bring this bill to the \n     floor for a vote. Thank you for your attention to this \n     matter, and as a concerned constituent, I request your \n     support of this legislation.\n           Sincerly,\n                                               Peter P.

This legislation is \n     supported by an overwhelming majority of the Senators and the \n     few Senators who have amendments to offer can easily be \n     accommodated in a time agreement.\n       BIO has been working on this critical legislation for four \n     years, the House passed the bill by a lopsided and bipartisan \n     margin, and it emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee on \n     a near-unanimous vote. There are very few issues for the \n     Senate debate or conference with the House. It should be easy \n     to complete action on this bill and enact it into law this \n     session. Doing so will be a major victory for biomedical and \n     other research.\n       The bill answers the concerns raised by the biotechnology \n     industry and other high technology industries regarding the \n     erosion of patents caused by the adoption of the GATT 20 \n     year-from-filing regime. We need to enact this bill to \n     provide vital protection to biotechnology firms conducting \n     research on cures and therapies for cancer, AIDS, \n     Alzheimer's, and other deadly and disabling diseases.\n       The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) represents \n     almost 800 companies and organizations that use or support \n     biotechnology research. Our companies are finding the next \n     generation of medicines and cures for endemic diseases that \n     diminish the quality of life for all Americans. On a per \n     capita basis, our companies invest more in research and \n     development than any other industry--almost ten times the \n     national average--or about $100,000 per employee per year. \n     This industries investment (almost 10 billion dollars in \n     1998) is protected primarily through the patent system.\n       Patents as an incentive for this critical research. Without \n     patents this research would stop because no investor will \n     fund this research without patents. This is why the patent \n     term protections in this bill are so important. The Hatch-\n     Leahy patent term bill provides complete and unequivocal \n     protections to ensure that diligent patent applicants will \n     not lose patent term under the new GATT 20 year patent law.\n       There is no industry which has lost more in patent \n     protection under the new GATT 20 year patent term than the \n     biotechnology industry. Our industry has been working for \n     three years to secure protections so that diligent patent \n     applicants cannot, and will not, lose patent protection under \n     this new law. It is imperative that the GATT law be amended \n     to protect diligent patent applicants this year.\n       Diligent patent applicants cannot lose patent term under \n     the patent term provisions of Hatch-Leahy bill. If there are \n     any delays in the grant of a patent by the Patent and \n     Trademark Office (PTO) which are beyond the applicant's \n     control, the applicant is given extra patent term--day-for-\n     day compensation. This is a similar system which now applies \n     when a patent holder loses patent term due to delays in the \n     approval of a product by the Food and Drug Administration. \n     So, the solution provided by the Hatch-Leahy bill is tried \n     and tested and it works.\n       In addition to these patent term provisions, the Hatch-\n     Leahy bill also provides for publication of internationally \n     filed patent applications 18 months after filing and BIO \n     supports this provision as well. Our companies file for \n     patents in Europe and Japan where all applications are \n     published after 18 months. Therefore 18 month publication in \n     the United States will place U.S. companies on equal footing \n     to their European and Asian competitors.\n       We enthusiastically support the patent term and publication \n     provisions of the Hatch-Leahy bill, know that it solves the \n     patent term problem, urge you to support\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\n     scheduling of this bill and support final passage. The \n     current GATT/TRIPS law is very problematic for the \n     biotechnology industry and enactment of S. 507 is needed to \n     eliminate the disincentive for biomedical research.\n       Please contact us with any questions about this critical \n     issue; we would be pleased to meet with you to discuss them. \n     857-0244.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: You already know of our association's \n     strong support for S. 507, the Omnibus Patent Reform Act. Our \n     members are trademark owners located in every state of the \n     union. This bipartisan bill makes important changes to the \n     U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that are necessary \n     to enable the USPTO to respond efficiently and effectively to \n     the tremendous growth in trademark applications generated by \n     our robust economy.\n       With next week designated as ``High Tech Week'' in the \n     Senate, where legislation dealing with new technology will be \n     considered, there is no bill that is more deserving of \n     attention and support at this time than S. 507. By converting \n     the USPTO into a government corporation that is 100% user-fee \n     funded, S. 507 will free the agency from constraints which \n     have long hampered efficient operations. Passage of this \n     important legislation will ensure that new products and \n     inventions receive the protection they need both here at home \n     and in global markets.\n       S. 507 provides great value to intellectual property owners \n     and should be allowed to proceed to the Senate floor. We ask \n     for your help in gaining passage of S. 507.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David Stimson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             3M Company, Office of\n\n\n                                Intellectual Property Counsel,\n\n                                                     June 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express the strong \n     support of the 3M Company for the reforms contained in S. \n     507, the Hatch/Leahy Omnibus Patent Reform Act, and to \n     request that you ask Senator Lott to schedule it for a Senate \n     vote as soon as possible. S. 507 is critically important to \n     U.S. industry. Its reforms will strengthen and improve the \n     United States patent system, allowing American industry to \n     compete more effectively with its foreign competition.\n       S. 507 will give the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the \n     administrative flexibility to operate at peak efficiency, \n     save inventors money, and accelerate patent processing. It \n     will allow American inventors and companies to see foreign \n     technology contained in U.S. patent applications more than a \n     year earlier than today, while ensuring that domestic \n     inventors who choose not to take advantage of publication \n     before patent grant may continue to do so if they do not file \n     outside of the U.S. The legislation will guarantee diligent \n     applications a patent term of at least 17 years from grant \n     and most will receive an even longer term of exclusivity. S. \n     507 would also make existing reexamination procedures more \n     effective by allowing greater third party participation, \n     while adding numerous safeguards to protect against abuse.\n       One specific reform of S. 507 which 3M most strongly \n     supports is that of creating a prior domestic commercial use \n     defense. This long overdue reform will protect manufacturing \n     jobs in American companies like 3M by ensuring that a late \n     filed patent--nearly one-half of U.S. patents are foreign \n     owned--will not disrupt domestic manufacturing operations. \n     Important technology underlying our successful Post-it \n      Notes such as those attached to this letter--and \n     the jobs of the American workers who produce them--will be \n     made safer against foreign attack by the passage of S. 507.\n       The reforms in S. 507 are designed to improve the \n     functioning of the patent system for all users, large and \n     small. In fact, Senators Hatch and Leahy have recently agreed \n     to amend their bill on the Senate floor in response to \n     requests from small businesses. With these changes, key small \n     business constituencies such as the Technology Chairs of the \n     White House Conference on Small Business, the National \n     Association of Women Business Owners, and the Small Business \n     Technology Coalition have expressed their enthusiastic \n     support for S. 507.\n       U.S. industry needs these patent reforms now. Support S. \n     507 and urge Senator Lott to bring it to a vote promptly.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Gary L. Griswold,\n\n                                      Staff Vice President and    \n     Chief Intellectual Property Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Intel Corporation,\n\n                                   Santa Clara, CA, June 12, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n       Building.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: For the past four years, Intel has been \n     an active participant in the 21st Century Patent Coalition, \n     which supports the enactment of patent reform legislation (S. \n     507). S. 507 would accomplish three broad goals of vital \n     importance to our industry: modernizing patent \n     administration, improving and simplifying dispute resolution \n     procedures in the Patent and Trademark Office, and \n     strengthening inventors' rights in a number of ways, most \n     importantly by protecting them from loss of term due to \n     Patent Office delays. Our coalition has the support of over \n     80 major American industrial companies and 22 industry \n     associations that are composed, primarily, of small \n     businesses.\n       Now, S. 507--which passed the House on a voice vote last \n     year, and was approved in the Senate Judiciary by a vote of \n     17-1--is ready for floor action in the Senate. Our coalition \n     has worked hard to address any and all legitimate concerns \n     about the taxt of the bill and its impact upon small business \n     entities and independent inventors, and we believe that it \n     would, if enacted, create the most pro-inventor patent system \n     in the world. It has recently received the enthusiastic \n     support of the White House Conference on Small Business \n     Technology Chairs, the National Association of Women Business \n     Owners, and the Small Business Technology Coalition.\n       The patent system we have today will be ill equipped to \n     serve the needs of inventors in the next century if the \n     improvements provided for in S. 507 are not made. We ask for \n     your help in scheduling S. 507 for a floor vote, and for your \n     support for the Committee bill on final passage.\n       Your support will help preserve America's role as the \n     world's technology leader.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carl Silverman,\n     Director of Intellectual Property.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Caterpillar Inc.,\n\n                                         Peoria, IL, June 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing to express Caterpillar's \n     strong support for S. 507 (Hatch/Leahy), The Omnibus Patent \n     Act of 1997. As you know, S. 507 was reported from the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee on a vote of 17-1 and is awaiting Senate \n     floor action. A companion bill passed the House last year.\n       S. 507 would modernize the U.S. patent system through major \n     improvements in our patent laws that will greatly benefit \n     America's large and small businesses, inventors and \n     entrepreneurs. For Caterpillar, this legislation will mean \n     reduced costs, reduced risk, reduced bureaucracy, fewer \n     lawsuits, more certainty regarding property rights, and \n     generally a faster, more responsive patent system.\n       Equally significant, key small business groups now agree \n     that S. 507 will streamline the patent process and help \n     America's inventors who currently suffer from delays in the \n     patent office that are not their fault.\n       It's time for the Senate to vote on this bill to help \n     strengthen the U.S. economy and keep jobs in America.\n       I urge you to contact Majority Leader Lott in support of \n     early scheduling of S. 507 for floor debate, and support the \n     efforts of its sponsors to adopt a bill without weakening \n     amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William B.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Please ask Senator Lott to bring S. \n     507, the Hatch-Leahy Omnibus Patent Act, to the floor as soon \n     as possible. This patent reform is important to AMP, our \n     employees, and the hundreds of inventors in our company who \n     think up new ideas to produce better products, to keep our \n     company competitive, and to create new jobs.\n       It's time to bring this bill up for a vote. The technology \n     chairs of the White House Conference on Small Business have \n     approved S. 507 because, ``(it) will lower the litigation \n     costs for small business, make it easier to know what areas \n     of technology are open for innovation, and will go a long way \n     towards giving us a more level playing field vis-a-vis our \n     foreign competitors.'' AMP and the dozens of other companies \n     and associations in the 21th Century Patent Coalition agree.\n       This bill has undergone months and months of scrutiny and \n     compromise and is now ready for a vote. I hope you'll \n     encourage the Majority Leader to schedule floor time for this \n     reasonable reform measure.\n       If you need any more information about S. 507, please let \n     me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John Palafoutas,\n                              Director, Federal Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HARKIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3175\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Torricelli, Mr.\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nDurbin, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Kerry) \nproposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2159, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 67, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 7____. FOOD SAFETY INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In addition to the amounts made available \n     under other provisions of this Act, there are appropriated, \n     out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, \n     to carry out activities described in the Food Safety \n     Initiative submitted by the President for fiscal year 1999--\n       (1) $98,000 to the Chief Economist;\n       (2) $906,000 to the Economic Research Service;\n       (3) $8,920,000 to the Agricultural Research Service;\n       (4) $11,000,000 to the Cooperative State Research, \n     Education, and Extension Service;\n       (5) $8,347,000 to the Food Safety and Inspection Service; \n     and\n       (6) $37,000,000 to the Food and Drug Administration.\n       1. Amendment of the No Net Cost Fund assessments to provide \n     for collection of all administrative costs not previously \n     covered and all crop insurance costs for tobacco. Section \n     106A of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, 7 U.S.C. \n     1445-1(c), is hereby amended by, in (d)(7) changing ``the \n     Secretary'' to ``the Secretary; and'' and by adding a new \n     clause, (d)(8) read as follows:\n       ``(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subsection or other law, that with respect to the 1999 and \n     subsequent crops of tobacco for which price support is made \n     available and for which a Fund is maintained under this \n     section, an additional assessment shall be remitted over and \n     above that otherwise provided for in this subsection. Such \n     additional assessment shall be equal to: (1) the \n     administrative costs within the Department of Agriculture \n     that not otherwise covered under another assessment under \n     this section or under another provision of law; and (2) any \n     and all net losses in federal crop insurance programs for \n     tobacco, whether those losses be on price-supported tobacco \n     or on other tobaccos. The Secretary shall estimate those \n     administrative and insurance costs in advance. The Secretary \n     may make such adjustments in the assessment under this clause \n     for future crops as are needed to cover shortfalls or over-\n     collections. The assessment shall be applied so that the \n     additional amount to be collected under this clause shall be \n     the same for all price support tobaccos (and imported tobacco \n     of like kind) which are marketed or imported into the United \n     States during the marketing year for the crops covered by \n     this clause. For each domestically produced pound of tobacco \n     the assessment amount to be remitted under this clause shall \n     be paid by the purchaser of the tobacco. On imported tobacco, \n     the assessment shall be paid by the importer. Monies \n     collected pursuant to this section shall be commingled with \n     other monies in the No Net Cost Fund maintained under this \n     section. The administrative and crop insurance costs that are \n     taken into account in fixing the amount of the assessment \n     shall be a claim on the fund and shall be transferred to the \n     appropriate account for the payment of administrative costs \n     and insurance costs at a time determined appropriate by the \n     Secretary. Collections under this clause shall not effect the \n     amount of any other collection established under this section \n     or under another provision of law but shall be enforceable in \n     the same manner as other assessments under this section and \n     shall be subject to the same sanctions for nonpayment.''\n       2. Amendment of the No Net Cost Account assessments to \n     provide for collection of all administrative cost not \n     previously covered and all crop insurance costs.

Such additional assessment shall be equal to: (1) \n     the administrative costs within the Department of Agriculture \n     that are not otherwise covered under another assessment under \n     this section or under another provision of law; and (2) any \n     and all net losses in federal crop insurance programs for \n     tobacco, whether those losses be on price-supported tobacco \n     or on other tobaccos.

For each domestically produced pound of tobacco \n     the assessment amount to be remitted under this clause shall \n     be paid by the purchaser of the tobacco. On imported tobacco, \n     the assessment shall be paid by the importer. Monies \n     collected pursuant to this section shall be commingled with \n     other monies in the No Net Cost Account maintained under this \n     section. The administrative and crop issuance costs that are \n     taken into account in fixing the amount of the assessment \n     shall be a claim on the Account and shall be transferred to \n     the appropriate account for the payment of administrative \n     costs and insurance costs at a time determined appropriate by \n     the Secretary. Collections under this clause shall not effect \n     the amount of any other collection established under this \n     section or under another provision of law but shall be \n     enforceable in the same manner as other assessments under \n     this section and shall be subject to the same sanctions for \n     nonpayment.''\n       3.

LOW-INCOME HOUSING PRESERVATION AND RESIDENT \n                   HOMEOWNERSHIP.\n\n       (a) Notice of Prepayment or Termination.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 212(b) of the Low-\n     Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of \n     1990 (12 U.S.C. 4102) or any other provision of law, during \n     fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, an owner of \n     eligible low-income housing (as defined in section 229 of the \n     Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership \n     Act of 1990 (12 U.S.C. 4119) that intends to take any action \n     described in section 212(a) of the Low-Income Housing \n     Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (12 \n     U.S.C. 4102(a)) shall, not less than 1 year before the date \n     on which the action is taken--\n       (A) file a notice indicating that intent with the chief \n     executive officer of the appropriate State or local \n     government for the jurisdiction within which the housing is \n     located; and\n       (B) provide each tenant of the housing with a copy of that \n     notice.\n       (2) Exception.--The requirements of this subsection do not \n     apply in any case in which the prepayment or termination at \n     issue is necessary to effect conversion to ownership by a \n     priority purchaser (as defined in section 231(a) of the Low-\n     Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of \n     1990 (12 U.S.C. 4120(a)). The requirements of this subsection \n     do not apply where owners have provided, legal notice of \n     prepayment of termination as of July 7, 1998, under the terms \n     of current law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8405-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM AND PAPER AND \n                         MARKET ACCESS TO JAPAN\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       D'AMATO AMENDMENT NO. 3210\n\n  Mr. BOND (for Mr. D'Amato) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution (S.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nSenate's attention the excellent speech on the Year 2000 (Y2K) \ntechnology problem given by Senator Bennett at the National Press Club \non Wednesday, July 15, 1998. The insightful and informative speech by \nthe Chairman of the Senate's Special Committee on the Year 2000 further \nadvances the work of our committee in bringing this time-sensitive \nissue to the fore. The speech accurately emphasized the urgent nature \nof Y2K, and candidly surmised the dire consequences if left \nuncorrected. I commend Senator Bennett on his efforts to bring \nincreased awareness of the millennium bug to the public and private \nsectors.\n  I ask that Senator Bennett's address to the National Press Club be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The speech follows:\n         National Press Club Luncheon Speaker, Senator Robert \n           Bennett (R-Utah),\n                                     Washington, DC, July 15, 1998\n       Senator Bennett. Thank you very much. I'm delighted to be \n     here. And I have to introduce myself as ``the other  Bob \n     Bennett.'' I know that name has been prominent in the Press \n     Club in the past. You may even have heard from him. I point \n     out that I'm the tall, skinny, bald Bob Bennett. He is the \n     short, fat, hairy Bob Bennett--(laughter)--and that's how you \n     keep us separated --keep us apart.\n       I first got interested in the Year 2000 problem I suppose \n     the way anybody did; I read about it briefly, thought that's \n     kind of an interesting sort of thing, more of a feature story \n     issue, but not something to get particularly worried about. \n     Oh, two years ago, 18 months ago, whenever the first stories \n     first started filtering out, I was chairman of the--I guess I \n     still am--chairman of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on \n     Technology and Financial Services. Ever since I've been on \n     the Banking Committee, I've been saying to the chairman we \n     need to spend more time talking about technology, smart \n     cards, digital signatures, those kinds of things.\n       And finally, Al D'Amato said we're going to create a \n     subcommittee on technology, make you the chairman so you'll \n     leave us alone. (Laughter.) And we started holding hearings \n     on those various things I've described, and then said to \n     Robert, ``You know, let's hold a hearing on this Year 2000 \n     problem. That'd be a subject that we could talk about to keep \n     the subcommittee going.\n       And so we convened a hearing on the Year 2000 problem, \n     focusing primarily on the\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\n     banking system, since that's the jurisdiction of the \n     subcommittee, and heard for the first time some real details \n     about the Year 2000 problem. And when it was over, Chris \n     Dodd, who had stayed through the whole hearing--and those of \n     you in the Washington press corps know how unusual that is--\n     turned to me and said, ``Mr. Chairman, we need another \n     hearing. This is pretty scary stuff.'' And I said, you know, \n     ``You're exactly right.'' We've now held eight hearings in \n     that subcommittee, and each time we've gotten a little more \n     scared.\n       Finally, in the early part of this year I went to Senator \n     Lott and Senator Dodd went to Senator Daschle, and we said, \n     ``This problem is serious enough it needs more than just the \n     jurisdiction of the Banking Committee.'' And out of those \n     conversations Lott and Daschle got together, put through the \n     resolution creating the Senate committee on the Year 2000. I \n     became the chairman, Chris Dodd became the vice chair, and in \n     a(n) unprecedented, I think, certainly an unusual, move we \n     picked up two ex officio members of that committee: Ted \n     Stevens and Robert C. Byrd. So we have a direct pipeline into \n     the Appropriations Committee, and we saw how that worked. Had \n     the first meeting of the committee in which I outlined some \n     of the problems. Ted Stevens leaned over and whispered in the \n     ear of one of his staffers who was there, and the next day he \n     had set aside $2\\1/4\\ billion of extra money to help the \n     federal government solve its Year 2000 problem. I'm not used \n     to having that kind of horsepower on my committee--\n     (laughter)--and I'm delighted to have Ted and Senator Byrd \n     there, but also delighted that Senator Dodd is the ranking \n     Democrat and the vice chairman of the committee. He's \n     probably going to join us a little later. But I wanted to \n     publicly acknowledge the work that he's done on this.\n       We have tried to be the Paul Revere. But I tell people \n     we're not yet Chicken Little. The British are, indeed, \n     coming. This is a serious problem, and one that cannot be \n     minimized. But I'm not yet ready to say that the sky is \n     falling, as some people do on the web sites. And so we've \n     tried to strike the balance between Paul Revere and Chicken \n     Little. Now, in that capacity I wrote the White House and \n     said we need some direction out of the executive branch and \n     urged the president to appoint a Y2K czar. He didn't answer \n     my letter, but he appointed a Y2K czar, which is even \n     better--John Koskinen, appointed in February of this year. \n     And when he came to see me and we chatted for a while, I said \n     ``I'm very impressed with you. I think you're just what the \n     president needs, only I have one problem: you're not high \n     enough profile. Nobody's ever heard of you.'' We do need a \n     higher profile here.\n       I called Erskine Bowles. Senator Dodd joined me. Erskine \n     came to my office. We sat there, the three of us, and talked \n     about how we could get the president involved. And I am \n     delighted that yesterday the president made a major address \n     on this. If you missed it, go back and get a hold of it. Much \n     as it hurts me, as a Republican, to have to say so, it was a \n     superb speech. He touched all of the right bases, sounded all \n     of the right notes. And this is a very, very welcome addition \n     to the Y2K challenge.\n       Then I picked up the paper this morning and saw Robert \n     Samuelson's column on this issue. As the Paul Revere of this \n     particular challenge, it's nice to hear some additional \n     hoofbeats on the side while I'm riding from every Middlesex \n     village and town. (Soft laughter.)\n       Now the problem, of course, that we face is time. We can do \n     a lot of things in the United States Congress, but we cannot \n     legislate that the year 2000 will not come. We cannot pass a \n     law saying we will only allow the year 2000 to occur once \n     these fixes have been made. So we have to do something very, \n     very dramatic. We have to do it in a number-one priority \n     state of mind, and that's why the president's statement is so \n     welcome, because he said this should be the number-one \n     priority of every CEO in the country. And of course, he is \n     joining Tony Blair and other international leaders who are \n     saying the same thing.\n       Unfortunately, there are not enough of them saying this in \n     enough countries, and the problem globally is worse than it \n     is here. I'll get to that in a minute, but I wanted to make \n     that very clear. While I'm focusing on the United States, I \n     do not mean to minimize the difficulties of a national--\n     pardon me, an international challenge here.\n       Well, when I get out here in these speeches and hearings \n     and other presentations, the first thing that comes up is \n     that people say, ``How did we get into this mess?'' We've \n     gotten the quick answer in the introduction; they tried to \n     save space, and so they held it down to just two digits for \n     the date. But it's actually more generic than that, and I'd \n     like to spend just a minute with you on the generic side of \n     it, so that you get an understanding of exactly how serious \n     this really is.\n       Go back with me a quarter century--or, living in Washington \n     terms, four Senate elections--(laughter)--and take a look at \n     the economy and where we were. We were in the Industrial Age. \n     We were perhaps at the peak of the Industrial Age, the \n     Industrial Age that was created because somewhere, somebody \n     had a very simple idea, and that idea was interchangeable \n     parts.\n       Before we had the notion of producing things that were \n     interchangeable, every manufacturing operation was really \n     producing a work of art. Everything was one of a kind. And \n     then someone got the notion of interchangeable parts, and \n     factories began to turn out things that were alike. And mass \n     production was possible, mass distribution was possible, mass \n     advertising came along. The Industrial Age came, and it \n     revolutionized everything; created enormous wealth, enormous \n     social problems but enormous opportunities.\n       And we were just beginning to get comfortable with all of \n     that when somebody had another simple little idea, as \n     revolutionary as the idea of interchangeable parts. It was \n     the idea that said the switch in a transistor is either on or \n     off. And, therefore, you can write code that can be read \n     mechanically by a series of transistors strung together that \n     show that they are either on or off. And that was the \n     beginning of the what we now call digital code. And we began \n     to get serious about it roughly 25 years ago.\n       And just as the concept of interchangeable parts \n     transformed the world in the Industrial Revolution, the \n     concept of digital code transformed the world in the \n     Information Revolution. And we are living through that \n     revolution in ways that future historians will look back on \n     and comment about. But it has happened to us gradually enough \n     that we don't really understand the incredible impact of that \n     little notion that a switch can be either on or off, that a \n     punch in an IBM card can either be in or out, or that a pit \n     on a laser disk can be burned to either be there or not, only \n     a micron wide so that on a disk this size, you can put the \n     entire Encyclopedia Britannica and read it by virtue of \n     digital code.\n       Enormously significant things have happened as a result of \n     that revolution. We have now eliminated whole portions of the \n     hierarchy of corporate organizations. Middle management is \n     pretty well gone. Where did it go? It was replaced by \n     computer technology, because the purpose of middle management \n     was to manage information. Now, an individual on the factory \n     floor can call up on a screen more information than he could \n     have gotten from acres and acres of Harvard MBAs in the \n     middle management prior to the invention of the computer and \n     digital code.\n       And it has become ubiquitous this digital code. It is \n     everywhere we look. One of the things that has happened--and \n     I am going to focus on this for just a minute out of my \n     business background, to help you understand how difficult the \n     Y2K challenge is--is that we have changed manufacturing \n     fundamentally, and not just by robotics and all of the things \n     you think of in terms of computers.\n       Go back 25 years ago to General Motors, and they would have \n     warehouses filled with steel and aluminum and glass and \n     rubber and chrome and all the other things necessary to \n     produce a car. And usually there would be about 90 days--\n     (audio break). (Following audio break)--in these warehouses.\n       Along came digital code. Toyota pioneered Edward Deming's \n     idea of ``just in time'' inventory. The warehouse holding the \n     spare parts or the component parts of a Toyota consisted of \n     the railroad car in which those parts arrived at the plant. \n     And the railroad car pulls up to the side of the plant, they \n     open the doors and start off-loading the parts directly onto \n     the assembly line until the car is empty, and it is then \n     pulled away and another car pulled up. You can imagine the \n     savings--money, time, effort, capital, everything else--that \n     has occurred because of ``just in time'' inventory. But you \n     must understand that ``just in time'' inventory cannot work \n     without computers. You cannot have enough middle managers \n     with Harvard MBAs figuring it out to make it work if you \n     don't have computers.\n       And quite frankly--I'll make one last comment on this and \n     then move on. We Republicans will tell you that the good \n     economy we're enjoying is because we won control of the \n     Congress in 1994. The Democrats will say no, it's because \n     Bill Clinton won control of the presidency in 1992. And then \n     some of us will say no, it's because President Bush appointed \n     Alan Greenspan chairman of the Fed back in the 1980s. I think \n     that, of the three, has the most validity to it. (Laughter.)\n       But we have to recognize that one of the major reasons we \n     have a good economy is because we have eliminated the old \n     warehouses and those huge inventories.\n       We have made people more productive, we have smoothed out \n     the curves of the business cycle, and we have done it all \n     with computers. We are reaping the benefits, whether the \n     Republicans claim credit or the Democrats claim credit, we \n     are reaping the benefits in the economy of the introduction \n     of the Information Age, and it is wonderful. And as I say, \n     all of the incumbent politicians are taking credit for it, \n     even though none of them deserve it.\n       That's the good news. The bad news is that that flaw that \n     got put into the system in terms of two digits for a date \n     instead of four, that used to be just part of a single \n     software program and then several software programs and \n     something that would get taken care of later, has become over \n     the last 25 years, absolutely pervasive, and the flaw is \n     everywhere.\n       Yes, it's in computer programs, software programs; it's \n     also imbedded into those microcomputers that we call chips \n     that are imbedded into machine tools, supertankers, valves on \n     pipelines that control natural gas and, yes--get your \n     attention--probably in the presses that print your magazines \n     and newspapers. And the estimates we get on our committee are \n     that between 2 (percent) and possibly 5 percent of those \n     chips will fail.\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\n      And you don't know which 2 (percent) to 5 percent they are, \n     and you don't know where they are.\n       But if all of a sudden the pipeline that is bringing \n     natural gas to the generating plant that is creating the \n     electricity that's lighting these lights shuts down because \n     an imbedded chip in one of the valves fails, it isn't just a \n     valve in a pipeline that has failed, the whole power grid is \n     now at risk. And if enough of them fail in enough key places, \n     you don't have any power.\n       Or, if enough of them fail in enough water purification \n     plants, you don't have any water. Or, if enough of them fail \n     in enough medical devices in an ICU in a major hospital, some \n     people will die. I'm beginning to sound a little like Chicken \n     Little, but I want you to know these are very real \n     possibilities. And the only reason I am not Chicken Little \n     yet is that we have 17 months in which to get from here to \n     there.\n       Now, the number-one problem we face is denial.\n       People say, ``No, it can't possibly happen.''\n       If I may take a swipe at the National Press Club--I hope \n     this is permitted--the McLaughlin Group--I was on a program \n     with John McLaughlin. We talked about this. And then he \n     played a few clips of our program to the McLaughlin Group and \n     took a vote. And by three to one, they decided it was not a \n     major problem. (Laughter.)\n       Awareness: Understanding of how serious the problem is, in \n     fact, our biggest challenge. And that's why the president's \n     statement is so welcome, because we can hold all the hearings \n     we want, I can give all the speeches on the floor of the \n     Senate I want, I've long since learned that if I had a secret \n     document of highest national importance that I wanted to put \n     someplace where no one ever would find it--(laughter)--I \n     would put it in the Congressional Record. (Laughter.)\n       So we can't do this without a much higher level of \n     awareness to get everybody involved and get everybody going. \n     That's why, as I say, the president's speech was so welcome \n     and so well done.\n       But the other thing that I get after I get the first \n     question of how did we get into this mess and how pervasive \n     it is--and I hope I've helped you understand how pervasive it \n     is--I say again, as I said at the outset, what I have \n     described in the United States applies in spades abroad. The \n     only countries that I think are moving aggressively in this \n     area so far, besides the United States, in no particular \n     order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Singapore. \n     Now the Netherlands have just appointed a former CEO of \n     Phillips (sp) to head their effort, and I think they will \n     soon join that group. There may be some other countries that \n     belong there. But specifically not in that top tier are \n     Japan, Germany, France, and many of our other allies.\n       This is a global problem, pervasive in robotics, pervasive \n     in embedded chips, pervasive in connections.\n       To give you a quick anecdote about that, I was at the \n     Defense Department talking about this to Secretary Cohen and \n     Deputy Secretary Hamre. And I--they said, ``Yeah, we're--you \n     know, we're working very hard on this.''\n       And I said, ``It'll be real embarrassing if the screen goes \n     blank on the year 2000.''\n       And Secretary Hamre said, ``Well, actually, Senator, that's \n     not our biggest problem.'' He said, ``That's kind of good \n     news. If the screen goes blank, we know we've got a problem. \n     Our problem is if the screen stays up and we are receiving \n     data that is wrong and we don't know it, and the whole \n     database then becomes suspect.''\n       So those are the three areas. You've got the software \n     problem that people can quickly understand, you've got the \n     embedded chip problem that they probably haven't thought \n     about, and then you have the connections problem that can \n     ultimately kill you.\n       Well, back to the ``McLaughlin Group'' for just a minute. \n     This is the question I get: Are we going to win or lose? \n     Okay, is it going to be a catastrophe or are we going to get \n     by? Give me an answer so I can cut to a commercial. \n     (Laughter.)\n       All right. Let me leave you with this analogy. I think the \n     president's statement yesterday was a stirring call to arms. \n     And if I may say so without overdramatizing it, it's a little \n     like announcing that we are at war. Now, this is a different \n     war in that it has a set time period. But if you had asked \n     Franklin Roosevelt on the 8th of December, 1941--Are we going \n     to win or lose''--he would have said, ``We're going to \n     win''--just the way Bill Clinton said yesterday, ``We're \n     going to win. We're going to solve this problem.'' But would \n     you in the press corps say, ``Oh, good. The president has \n     told us we are going to win, so we can now ignore this \n     story.'' And yet too many in the press are saying that: ``Oh, \n     we've got a three-to-one vote on the `McLaughlin Group' that \n     says it's not going to be a big deal, so we can ignore this \n     story.''\n       I believe we're going to win; that is I think that \n     civilization as we know it is not going to come to an end. \n     It's a possibility. Possibility, if Y2K were this weekend \n     instead of 76 weekends from now, it would. But we have 76 \n     weeks in which to try to get this under control. But we are, \n     in a sense, at war against this problem. And you would not \n     have said in the Second World War, ``Oh, because the \n     president assures us we're going to eventually prevail, we do \n     not need to cover Guadalcanal, Iwo Jima, Normandy, the Battle \n     of the Bulge, or any of the rest of it.''\n       And so my plea to you here in the Press Club is: Do not \n     ignore this story just because someone is reassuring you that \n     it's going to work out all right. There are all kinds of \n     stories out there that need to be covered and, most \n     importantly, need to be exposed.\n       This is the ideal story for the Washington press corps. In \n     covering it, you can affect the outcome. Isn't that what \n     you're always trying to do? (Laughter.) Here's an \n     opportunity! (Applause.)\n       Well, as you know, I've told you I've been immersed in \n     this. It has become my obsession. I said that to the \n     president yesterday as I congratulated him on his speech. And \n     he said, ``Good. Somebody has to be obsessed.''\n       But I think I will quit at this point and respond to \n     whatever questions you might have. Thank you very much. \n     (Applause.) \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8413-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CAMPUS CRIME REPORTING\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to praise my colleagues for \nmaking Senator Specter's legislation on campus crime reporting a part \nof the higher education bill. This amendment to the higher education \nlegislation, of which I was a cosponsor, will improve the safety and \nsecurity of college students and employees across the United States.\n  Mr. President, when young people go to college they expect to face \nmany challenges--academically, professionally and personally. But \nneither they nor their parents expect college kids to face high rates \nof crime, including violent crime. Unfortunately, on too many of our \ncampuses this is exactly what they face. And the situation is made \nworse by the fact that many colleges and universities fail to \naccurately and fully report crimes committed on their campuses.\n  This amendment will close significant loopholes in current law that \nkeep parents and prospective college students from getting the \ninformation they need to make a fully informed decision regarding where \nthey should go to college. Thanks to this amendment, the Department of \nEducation will be directed to require colleges to report criminal \noffenses that occur on sidewalks, streets, and other public lands on or \nadjacent to the campus, as well as offenses that occur in buildings \nthat are owned by the college but used for commercial purposes, such as \nstudent food courts. Colleges that fail to compile accurate crime \nreports in accordance with these new requirements will suffer civil \npenalties.\n  Mr. President, a crime is a crime, whether it occurs in a college \nclassroom, in the campus food court or on the sidewalk. A young man who \nis mugged, a young woman who is raped, any student who is accosted, \nbeaten or murdered, suffers the same pain and loss regardless of which \npart of campus it is on which they are victimized.\n  Through this amendment we can see to it that students and their \nparents have the fullest possible information available to them \nregarding the safety of the campuses they are considering. This \namendment also will provide colleges and universities with the extra \nincentive some of them may need to improve the safety and security of \ntheir students and employees. In 1994 alone, Mr. President, over 9,500 \nviolent crimes were reported on our college campuses. And that figure \ndoes not include crimes colleges have not been required to report. We \nmust do better. College is challenging enough, Mr. President, without \nadding to its challenges the unknown risk of crime.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleagues on including this important \namendment in the higher education bill and look forward to the swift \nand efficient implementation of its language.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8415-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8415-S8416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE BLACK SHIPS FESTIVAL OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Japan-\nAmerica Society of Rhode Island for its efforts in organizing this \nweekend's 15th annual Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island.\n  The Black Ships Festival takes its name from the Japanese word \nKurofune (Black Ships) which the residents of Shimoda, Japan used to \ndescribe the tar covered American ships which sailed into Shimoda \nharbor under the command of Rhode Island native Commodore Matthew Perry \nin 1854. As you know, Commodore Perry and officials in the Edo Period \nShogunate negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa, the first treaty between \nUnited States and Japan, which opened Japan to trade with the West and \nmarked the beginning of the relationship between our two great \ncountries.\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\n  Each summer, Newport, Rhode Island and Shimoda, her sister city, hold \nBlack Ships Festivals to celebrate the friendship which began in 1854. \nSince its inception 15 years ago, the Black Ships Festival of Rhode \nIsland has grown bigger and better every year, becoming a fixture on \nNewport's summer schedule and an event that the entire state eagerly \nawaits.\n  The Festival truly is one of Rhode Island's treasures. It provides \nresidents and visitors to the Ocean State a unique and inexpensive \nopportunity to learn about and celebrate Japan's traditions and \nculture. As a result, I can honestly say that our state has gained a \nbetter awareness than most of Japanese culture.\n  The success of the Black Ships Festival of Rhode Island is now \nrecognized far beyond the borders of the Ocean State. On July 1, the \nJapan-America Society of Rhode Island was selected to receive the \nprestigious Japanese ``Minister of Foreign Affairs' Citation'', which \nrecognizes individuals and organizations that have contributed to \nfriendship and understanding between Japan and other countries. Of the \n9 organizations receiving this award in 1998, the Japan-America Society \nis the only one that is not Japanese.\n  Mr. President, as the Co-Chair of this year's Black Ships Festival of \nRhode Island, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Japan \nAmerica Society of Rhode Island for its tremendous efforts in \norganizing the Festival and strengthening the bond friendship between \nthe United States and Japan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8415-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DETROIT LADY ROAD RUNNERS BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \nvery special group of girls in the metro Detroit area. The Detroit Lady \nRoad Runners basketball team came in second place in the girls 12 and \nunder division of the Police Athletic League. The girls are the only \nbasketball team in the city that won second place in the state of \nMichigan in the girls 10 and under Amateur Athletic Union. They are now \non their way to competing in the 1998 AAU National Championship in \nOrlando, Florida July 31-August 8th.\n  The Lady Road Runners, led by Coach Jeffery Cruse, have not only put \nforth a great effort toward sharpening their basketball skills, \npracticing four days a week, but also in raising funds by washing cars, \nselling hot dogs and holding raffles and walk-a-thons. These girls also \nwork very hard in school and for their churches.\n  I want to wish this team the best of success in their effort to win a \nNational Championship.

Mr. President, one of my constituents, Rabbi Israel \nZoberman of congregation Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach, VA, has \nrecently published some thoughts arising from the release of a Vatican \ndocument. I would like to bring them to the attention of my colleagues, \nand ask that they appear in the Congressional Record at the appropriate \njuncture.\n  The article follows:\n\n         [From the Southern Virginia Jewish News, May 22, 1998]\n\n           Saving Memory: A Rabbi's: Response to the Vatican\n\n                       (By Rabbi Israel Zoberman)\n\n       The recent release of the long awaited Vatican document on \n     the connection between the Holocaust and the Catholic Church \n     almost coincides with the annual observance this season of \n     the Shoah's tragedy, the enormity of which has turned it into \n     the most defining event of the soon concluding 20th century, \n     the bloodiest of all times.\n       Whie the document acknowledges a measure of Christian \n     culpability for Jewish suffering, it falls short of a full \n     apology, for the over-a-decade study of the trying theme is \n     fraught with painful and embarrassing confrontations for the \n     church, touching upon the historical rejectionist attitude by \n     Christianity of Judaism and the Jewish people. No wonder that \n     there were high expectations that the reached conclusions \n     would fully reflect and respect the record of a troubling \n     past reality in light of the subject's magnitude, as well as \n     the breakthrough conciliatory accomplishments of the Second \n     Vatican Council in the 60s and the unparalleled contribution \n     of Pope John II, building upon the foundation laid by his \n     great predecessor Pope John XXIII in dismissing Jewish \n     responsibility for Jesus' execution and honoring Abraham's \n     descendants. At stake was also the church's own need to come \n     to grips with a burden weighing upon its conscience in a way \n     demanding absolution from sins of both commission and \n     omission, allowing for a renewed sense of integrity and \n     reconciliation in an era of an unprecedented ecumenical \n     spirit, where no longer can any faith claim an imperialistic \n     role.\n       It seems that the controversial document could not escape \n     internal political pressure and compromise along with \n     vestiges of pre-Second Vatican thinking. Perhaps some of us \n     within both the Jewish and Christian communities got a bit \n     carried away in believing that the significant victories of \n     the past several decades were free from roadblocks and \n     unforeseen detours. How else explain the skirting of two \n     central issues that the authors were surely aware of their \n     persistent presence, that now more than ever will beg an \n     unequivocal response. The fact that traditional anti-Semitism \n     has its origins in two millennia of the church's anti-Jewish \n     teachings, demonstrates contempt in word and deed for both \n     the spiritual heritage from which ironically Christianity \n     emerged, and the people who bore witness to the covenant they \n     refused to abandon when threatened with expulsion, forced \n     conversion and death itself. Is there any doubt that the \n     Holocaust and anti-Semitism are intimately interwoven?\n       The second bone of contention is the role of Pope Pius XII \n     whose silence during the Nazi slaughter was far louder than \n     his intervention in saving individual lives. While there is \n     no surprise that the church would want to defend her \n     ``infallible' 'leaders, it is the failure to exercise the \n     vast moral authority invested in the Pope's high office which \n     should serve as a cardinal yardstick in evaluating the legacy \n     of any Holy Father, particularly under critical circumstances \n     testing and mantle of true spiritual greatness. The related \n     concern of the Vatican's alleged involvement in aiding the \n     escape of Nazis at the war's end to South America and \n     elsewhere, deserves an honest investigation and disclosure. \n     Only when past ghosts are finally laid to rest, can memory be \n     cleansed to serve the future.\n       I trust that the contested official statement is not in its \n     final form, for history and our common God expect more from \n     us and we can deliver in this generation of unfathomable lows \n     but also dazzling heights, a gift of healing hope for those \n     to follow. I ought to know for during 1985 to 1995 my \n     congregation benefitted from generosity of the most gracious \n     Church of Ascension in Virginia Beach, where we found a \n     loving home in the only such Catholic-Jewish sharing bond in \n     the world, a direct outcome of a radically changed climate.\n       The Polish Pope, John Paul II, with his unique personality \n     and past, did more than all other pontiffs combined to bring \n     the two faith groups closer to one another, coming as he does \n     from the vineyard turned graveyard of European Jewry, \n     experiencing and resisting the German occupation, and being \n     particularly close to a surviving Jewish childhood friend. \n     His heartfelt embrace of the Jews, beginning in an historic \n     first visit by a Pope to a synagogue, in 1986 in Rome, \n     addressing them as ``our dearly beloved brothers'' and ``our \n     elder brothers,'' culminated in establishing diplomatic \n     relations with the State of Israel in 1994. Before his \n     extraordinary papacy comes to an end, he may yet surprise us \n     with further bold steps to reassure us all that there is no \n     retreat from the visionary path he so compassionately \n     bequested to a suffering and expectant humanity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8416-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8416-S8418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               BICENTENNIAL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the \nbicentennial of the Public Health Service. On July 16, 1798, the Fifth \nCongress passed, and President John Adams signed, an Act which \nestablished the Public Health Service. The Public Health Service was \noriginally established to provide medical care to sick and disabled \nseamen. Today the scope of their service includes educational \nactivities, the provision of medical care, and activities on the \nforefront of biomedical research. I commend the members of the Public \nHealth Service not only for their commitment to public health, but also \ntheir willingness to serve, and to contribute to the prevention and \neradication of diseases.\n  Before being elected to the Senate in 1994, I was a heart and lung \ntransplant surgeon for many years. The question I'm most often asked \nis, ``Why would you leave medicine for politics?'' My simple answer is: \nI didn't ``leave.'' I'm away only for awhile. The deeper answer is that \nwhile--on the surface--politics seems so different from medicine, the \nunderlying motivation is exactly the same. Medicine exists to improve \nthe life of another human being. The primacy of the patient is the \ncentral focus of all that physicians do. The same can be said of public \nservice and public policy. They exist to serve the best interest of the \ncitizenry. As a physician, I had the opportunity to help\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\none person at a time. As a United States Senator, I have the chance--\nevery day--to improve the lives of millions of Americans in Tennessee \nand throughout the country, as well as help secure the future of the \nnext generation.\n  The Officers of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service \nhave a long history of service to the American people. For two \ncenturies, the physicians of the Public Health Service have been on the \nforefront of protecting America from disease. As Fitzhugh Mullen \nchronicled in his book ``Plagues and Politics,'' PHS officers have \nplayed a leading role in the control of infectious diseases--from \nplague control measures, to the eradication of smallpox, to the \ncontinuing response to outbreaks that threaten the public health, such \nas Legionnaire's disease and hantavirus.\n  As the leader of the Commissioned Corps, the Surgeon General has a \ncritical role in promoting public health. I have been a strong \nsupporter of the position of Surgeon General. I believe America needs a \nphysician who will champion public health messages. We need a physician \nto focus national and international attention on public health \nproblems. Reports from the Surgeon General have such credibility they \nare repeated by the media, health professionals, medical journals, and \nhealth educators. As chronic diseases such as heart disease and \ndiabetes affect more Americans, we need a medical voice we can trust to \ntalk to us about the need for prevention. We need a physician to \neducate the American people about the links between personal behavior \nand illness.\n  In Dr. David Satcher, America's new Surgeon General, we have the \nvoice we need. I had the privilege of knowing Dr. Satcher from his time \nin Nashville. Because of his knowledge of population-based medicine, \nfamily medicine, and public health, he is eminently qualified to be our \nmessenger to the American people on health issues. This past April, I \nhad the privilege of introducing Dr. Satcher when he presented his \nfirst Surgeon General's report--a report on tobacco use among US racial \nand ethnic minority groups.\n  Surgeons General have led the fight against smoking for more than 30 \nyears, and I'm pleased to see that the health consequences from tobacco \nuse are also high on Dr. Satcher's agenda. Since the first report on \nthe dangers of smoking by Surgeon General Luther Terry in 1964, there \nhave been 24 reports on smoking, including the latest on smoking and \nminority populations. This most recent report notes the increasing \nrates of smoking among African-American and Hispanic teenagers, and \ncites the need for further research into prevention and cessation \nactivities. Between 1991 and 1997, smoking among African American \nteenagers increased from 12.6 percent to 22.7 percent--an increase of \n80 percent! Among Hispanic teenagers, smoking prevalence increased from \n25 percent in 1991 to 34 percent in 1997. But teen smoking is not just \na problem among minority populations. In 1997, cigarette smoking among \nwhite teenagers was nearly 40 percent--up from 31 percent in 1991. Teen \nsmoking is a public health crisis that must be addressed.\n  There has been a great deal of attention given to reaching an \nagreement with the tobacco companies to reduce teen smoking. There is \nno silver bullet to stop young people from smoking. It will require a \ncomprehensive approach that addresses three aspects: access, public \nhealth, and advertising.\n  Today, children and teenagers have ready access to cigarettes. \nLimiting that access includes everything from raising the price of a \npack of cigarettes to restricting their ability to purchase \ncigarettes--including their access to vending machines. The cost must \nbe high enough to discourage teenagers from smoking, but not high \nenough to create a black market.\n  The second aspect is the need for strong public health initiatives, \nincluding research, treatment, and surveillance. We must deal with the \nissue of nicotine addiction--through a better understanding of the \nphysiology of addiction; through the best research programs--including \nbasic science and behavioral research; and through effective programs \nthat not only keep people from starting, but help them quit.\n  The third component is advertising. Society can no longer tolerate \nthe specific targeting of young people by tobacco companies. This \nraises a Constitutional issue--the freedom to advertise versus what I \nregard as the wrongful targeting of children--8,9,10,12 years-old--in \norder to encourage them to smoke.\n  In the beginning of the 105th Congress, I was honored to assume the \nchairmanship of a newly established subcommittee on public health and \nsafety, with jurisdiction over many agencies of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. In establishing the Subcommittee on Public \nHealth and Safety, the Senate recognized the importance of public \nhealth. As Chairman, I've been able to bring public awareness to health \nissues facing this nation and to address the reauthorization of public \nhealth programs and agencies.\n  This past March, I was pleased to chair a subcommittee hearing on \nGlobal Health. We live in a global society. To paraphrase the Institute \nof Medicine's report, ``America's Vital Interest in Global Health,'' we \ncan consider no site too remote, no person too removed, and no organism \ntoo isolated to affect our citizens.\n  Last January, I spent a week on a medical missionary tour of Africa, \nspecifically Kenya, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the \nCongo. I was struck by how medical care and services varied--from \nsophisticated Western-style hospitals with adequate laboratory capacity \nto small hospitals without electricity and running water. Several of \nthe small hospitals are in remote areas that were virtually impossible \nto reach, except by small plane. While in Kenya, I heard about an \nongoing epidemic of Rift Valley Fever where more than 300 people had \nalready died. I saw first-hand patients with infectious health problems \ncommon in much of the world: tuberculosis, HIV, malaria and other \nparasitic infections.\n  The United States is uniquely poised to look beyond our borders and \nreach out to other countries. As a world leader in medical science, \nbiomedical research, and pharmaceutical drug development, we can play a \nleadership role in global health issues through our federal agencies. \nHowever, the development of an effective global disease surveillance \nand response network requires the involvement of all countries and a \npartnership between the public and private sectors.\n  This past year, the subcommittee has also addressed the \nreauthorization of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research \n(AHCPR), the nation's leading agency on health services research. The \ncurrent debate on health care quality has led us to reexamine the \nfederal role in supporting innovation and promoting quality in health \ncare. We need solutions that are not only based on sound science but \nalso serve the interests of patients. While there are many good private \nsector initiatives, there is a role for the federal government in \nimplementing biomedical research results. As we reauthorize AHCPR, we \nwill focus on health care quality, public-private partnerships, and \nadvancing the science of quality improvement efforts.\n  This past March, I introduced ``The Women's Health Research and \nPrevention Amendments of 1998''--a bill with broad bipartisan support \nthat addresses diseases that affect women. I'm very pleased that, since \n1993, we have developed guidelines to include women and minorities in \nNIH-sponsored trials. However, we must continue to do more. We must \ncontinue to review the women's health research agenda as we set \nresearch priorities. We need to incorporate new scientific knowledge on \nwomen's health. The women's health bill reauthorizes NIH programs for \nvital research activities into the causes, prevention, and treatment \nfor some of the major diseases affecting women--including osteoporosis, \nbreast and ovarian cancer, heart disease, as well as research into the \naging processes of women. Our bill also reauthorizes several programs \nat the CDC for prevention and education activities on women's health \nissues. CDC's programs provide critical health services in each of our \nStates to detect, prevent, and diagnose diseases such as breast and \ncervical cancer. Also, CDC programs--such as those at the National \nCenter for Health Statistics--provide data that can assist us in making \ninformed policy decisions about health care.\n  In conjunction with Senators from both sides of the aisle, I \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\n``The Health Professions Education Partnerships Act''--a bill that \nrepresents an opportunity to help improve the quality of, and access \nto, health care for millions of Americans. The Bill reauthorizes the \nprograms funded through title VII and title VIII of the Public Health \nService Act. For many years, this legislation has helped our nation's \nschools of health better serve the health needs of their communities, \nand better prepare the practitioners of the future. The Bill strives to \nincrease the number of health practitioners, including physicians, \ndentists, and nurses, in underserved areas and to improve the \nrepresentation of minorities and disadvantaged individuals in the \nhealth professions. These programs have often been the assistance of \nlast resort for many disadvantaged students seeking careers in health.\n  Equally important is the legislation's goal to meet the need of \nunderserved communities, often in rural or inner-city areas. Programs \nfunded through this bill support the infrastructure which facilitates \nthe training and practice of health care providers in underserved \nareas. Patients in underserved areas depend on these programs for their \nhealth care. Training providers in these areas greatly increases the \nlikelihood that they will work in these areas when they complete their \neducation. The Bill would also allow the Secretary of HHS to make \ngrants to certain health professions schools designated ``Centers of \nExcellence''--to assist these schools in supporting health professions \neducation for under represented minority individuals. To qualify, these \nschools would: have a significant number of underrepresented minorities \nenrolled in the school; been effective in assisting minorities to \ncomplete their degree programs; and have been effective in recruiting \nunderrepresented minorities as students and as faculty. ``Centers of \nExcellence'' are currently designated at Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities. This bill establishes Hispanic and Native American \nCenters of Excellence to increase the number of Hispanic and Native \nAmerican health professionals.\n  Mr. President, for the past two centuries, the Public Health Service \nhas been contributing unique ideas, ethics, and skills to public \nservice. I congratulate the Public Health Service as it celebrates 200 \nyears of public health and science. As the Public Health Service rises \nto meet the challenges of the next 200 years, I know they'll be every \nbit as successful as they have been in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8416-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING MS. JAMIE FOSTER BROWN\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to take a \nfew moments to join the Midwest Radio and Music Association (MRMA) in \nrecognizing the career achievements of Ms. Jamie Foster Brown. The MRMA \nwill host a tribute dinner in Ms. Brown's honor during their annual \nconference in Chicago on July 23, 1998. I want to extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations to Jamie Foster Brown for this prestigious award.\n  A native Chicagoan, Jamie Foster Brown graduated from Calumet High \nSchool and subsequently attended the University of Stockholm in \nStockholm, Sweden. From these beginnings, Ms. Brown has become one of \nthe most accomplished and respected women in the field of entertainment \njournalism. She publishes her own magazine, is heard on radio stations \naround the United States and England, and makes numerous television \nappearances each month. Jamie Foster Brown's success is testament to \nher talent and determination.\n  Jamie Foster Brown began her career in the entertainment business in \n1979 when she founded the Washington Theater Group. Ms. Brown \nsubsequently went to work for Robert Johnson's Black Entertainment \nTelevision, and was among the pioneers at this network in creating \ntelevision programming for African-American viewers written, directed, \nand produced by African-Americans. Ms. Brown's talents were recognized \nat BET, as she ascended the ranks from executive secretary to a \nproducer of the network's top-rated programs, ``Video LP'' and ``Video \nSoul.''\n  In 1988, Jamie Foster Brown struck out on her own and founded Sister \n2 Sister Magazine as a monthly trade newsletter targeted at prominent \nwomen in the entertainment and media industries. Ten years later, \nSister 2 Sister has emerged as one of the most powerful and respected \nmonthly entertainment magazines, with a special focus on African-\nAmerican celebrity news. The magazine is often the first to be granted \ninterviews with major American entertainers, and often breaks stories \nthat are later picked up by other news organizations.\n  In addition to publishing and writing for Sister 2 Sister Magazine, \nMs. Brown has also recently written a book in honor of the late Betty \nShabazz, entitled: Betty Shabazz: A Sisterfriend's Tribute In Words and \nPictures. This loving tribute to Dr. Shabazz, published by Simon & \nSchuster, contains the recollections and anecdotes of friends and \nadmirers including Maya Angelou, Myrlie Evers-Williams, and Ruby Dee.\n  Building upon the success of her magazine, Jamie Foster Brown is a \nregular entertainment reporter on BET, and makes many appearances on \nnationally syndicated news and entertainment television shows. \nAdditionally, Ms. Brown hosts ``Sister 2 Sister Update,'' a syndicated, \ndaily celebrity news feature that is carried nationwide on the Westwood \nOne Radio Network. ``Sister 2 Sister Update'' is also broadcast twice a \nweek throughout Great Britain over the British Broadcasting Company's \nGreater London Radio. Ms. Brown is also heard daily as a frequent \ncelebrity guest on radio stations in Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D.C. \nand Los Angeles.\n  In a further display of her immense energy and enthusiasm for life, \nMs. Brown also uses her considerable talents to better her community \nand our nation through volunteerism. Some of the many charitable \norganizations that have benefitted from Jamie Foster Brown's \nparticipation include the Duke Ellington School of Music, the Mount \nSinai Parenting Institute and the Corporation Against Drug Abuse. For \nher professional and civic accomplishments, Ms. Brown has been honored \nby numerous organizations, including the Chicago League of Black Women, \nAnheuser Busch, Maurice Starr Productions, IMPACT and most recently, \nthe Midwest Radio and Music Association. Along with balancing the \ndemands of her career and charitable work, Ms. Brown remarkably finds \ntime to remain a committed wife to Dr. Lorenzo Brown, as well as a \nloving and devoted mother to their two sons, Russell and Randall.\n  In closing, I would like to extend my most sincere congratulations to \nJamie Foster Brown, a remarkable woman who is most deserving of this \naward. It is an important symbol of her exceptional talent, dedication, \nand vision, and I am pleased that she is being distinguished with this \nhonor by the Midwest Radio and Music Association. I wish her, and her \nfamily, God's speed and much continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8418-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8418-S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CBO ESTIMATE ON S. 1754\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, on June 23, 1998, I filed Report \n105-220 to accompany S. 1754, the Health Professions Education \nPartnerships Act of 1998, a bill to consolidate and reauthorize health \nprofessions and minority and disadvantaged health education programs, \nand for other purposes. At the time the report was filed, an incorrect \nestimate was filed by the Congressional Budget Office. Since that time, \nthe CBO has corrected its estimate. I ask that a complete copy of the \nrevised CBO estimate be printed in the Record.\n  The estimate follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1998.\n     Hon.

These programs provide \n     federal funding through grants and contracts for health \n     professions students, schools, clinics, and demonstration \n     projects. They focus on increasing the diversity and supply \n     of health care providers and the care they provide to \n     shortage areas, ethnic populations, and high-risk population \n     groups. The legislation would authorize appropriations for \n     fiscal years beginning in 1998 and, in most instances, ending \n     in 2002. Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, \n     CBO estimates that enacting S. 1754 would result in \n     additional discretionary outlays of $334 million in 1999 and \n     a total of $3.5 billion over the 1998-2003 period.\n       Subtitle C would reauthorize the Health Education \n     Assistance Loan (HEAL) program through 2002. This provision \n     would increase direct spending by $1 million in fiscal year \n     1998 and by $21 million during the 1998-2003 period. Because \n     the bill would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply.\n       S. 1754 would waive any state statutes of limitations that \n     govern the repayment of loans by nursing and other medical \n     students. This preemption of state statutory authority would \n     represent a mandate as defined by the Unfunded Mandates \n     Reform Act (UMRA). However, CBO estimates that the mandate \n     would have no impact on the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments. The legislation does not include any \n     private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       This revised estimate supersedes CBO's estimate of May 28, \n     1998, and corrects an error in the assumed subsidy rate for \n     Health Education Assistance Loans.\n\n\n                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 1754 is shown in the \n

within budget function \n     550 (health).\n\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       S. 1754 would reauthorize and consolidate several programs \n     within the Public Health Service Act. The initial and final \n     year of the period of authorization would vary across \n     programs. For years in which the bill specifies the amount \n     authorized, CBO assumed that appropriations for each program \n     would be made in the full amount of the authorization. For \n     years in which the bill authorizes appropriation of such sums \n     as may be necessary, CBO assumed that the specific amount \n     appropriated in 1998 or authorized in a subsequent year would \n     be increased by inflation and that the amount authorized \n     would be appropriated.\n       With the exception of 1998, CBO assumed that all amounts \n     authorized by S. 1754 would be appropriated by the start of \n     the fiscal year and that outlays would follow the historical \n     spending patterns of the respective agencies. The estimate \n     assumes that amounts authorized for 1998 would be \n     appropriated late in the year and that outlays would begin in \n     1999.\n\nTitle I--Health Professions Education and Financial Assistance Programs\n\n       Subtitle A--Health Professionals Education Programs. S. \n     1754 would reauthorize, amend, and consolidate the Health \n     Professions Education Programs administered by the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and would \n     include funding for behavioral or mental health providers and \n     services under the Programs. It authorizes $237 million in \n     1998 and such sums as necessary for 1999-2002. Assuming \n     appropriation of the authorized amounts CBO estimates \n     Subtitle A would result in additional discretionary outlays \n     of $107 million in 1999 and $985 million over the 1998-2003 \n     period.\n       Subtitle B--Nursing Workforce Development. S. 1754 would \n     reauthorize, amend, and consolidate the Nursing Workforce \n     Development programs administered by HRSA. It authorizes $65 \n     million in 1998 and such sums as necessary over the 1999-2002 \n     period. CBO estimates that this subtitle would result in \n     additional discretionary spending of $28 million in 1999 and \n     $269 million over the 1998-2003 period.\n\n                    Subtitle C--Financial Assistance\n\n       Chapter 1--School-Based Revolving Loan Funds. S. 1745 would \n     reauthorize and amend HRSA's school-based revolving loan \n     funds. It authorizes $8 million in annual appropriations for \n     1998 through 2002. CBO estimates this provision would result \n     in additional discretionary outlays of $11 million in 1999 \n     and $39 million during the 1998-2003 period.\n       Chapter 2--Insured Health Education Assistance Loans to \n     Graduate Students. S. 1754 would reauthorize the HEAL program \n     through 2002. Currently, the program's authorization expires \n     at the end of 1998, and it is only authorized to make loans \n     to students who received their first HEAL loan before 1995. \n     Section 143 of the bill would reauthorize HEAL for five \n     years, starting in 1998. The authorized loan limits would be \n     $350 million in 1998, $375 million in 1999, and $425 million \n     a year for 2000 through 2002. Loans to new borrowers would \n     not be issued after 2000, and no loans would be insured under \n     the program after 2005. CBO assumes that loan disbursements \n     would equal the amount authorized. CBO estimates that the \n     average subsidy rate for these disbursements would be about 1 \n     percent. Therefore, this provision would result in $1 million \n     in direct spending in 1998 and a total of $21 million during \n     the 1998-2003 period.\n       For lenders who fail to meet certain performance standards, \n     the bill would also reduce federal payments from 100 percent \n     to 98 percent of losses incurred through loan defaults. In \n     addition, the Secretary would have the authority to collect \n     any unpaid balances from the estate of a deceased borrower. \n     Finally, the proposal would grant a deferment to borrowers \n     who furnish health care services to Indians through an Indian \n     Health Service program.\n\n                  Title II--Office of Minority Health\n\n       S. 1754 would reauthorize the Office of Minority Health \n     within the Office of the Assistance Secretary. It would also \n     require the Secretary to establish the Advisory Committee on \n     Minority Health. It would authorize appropriations of $30 \n     million for 1998 and such sums as necessary for 1999-2002.\n       It would also reauthorize the National Center for Health \n     Statistics (NCHS) within the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC), providing such sums as necessary for 1999 \n     through 2003. In addition, where current law provides a \n     general authorization for NCHS to make grants to entities for \n     data collection and analysis on racial and ethnic\n\n[[Page S8420]]\n\n     populations, S. 1754 would authorize an additional grant \n     program. The funding under this grant program would be used \n     for collecting data specifically on Hispanics and major \n     Hispanic subpopulation groups and on American Indians, and \n     for developing special area population studies on major Asian \n     American and Pacific Islander populations. For this \n     additional grant program, it would authorize $1 million in \n     appropriations for fiscal year 1998 and such sums as \n     necessary for 1999-2002.\n       CBO estimates the provisions under Title II would result in \n     additional discretionary outlays of $25 million in 1999 and \n     $242 million during the 1998-2003 period.\n\n Title III--Selected Initiatives and Title IV--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n       S. 1754 would amend and reauthorize several other grant \n     programs within HRSA, CDC, the National Institutes of Health, \n     and the Administration on Aging. Except for a few small \n     programs where the bill specifies the authorization for one \n     or more years, Title III and IV would provide such sums as \n     necessary for the entire period of the authorization for \n     these programs. In addition, it would provide a permanent \n     authorization of $0.5 million a year for the Foundation for \n     the National Institutes of Health.\n       Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO \n     estimates that Titles III and IV would result in additional \n     discretionary spending of $163 million in 1999 and $1.9 \n     billion over the 1998-2003 period.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985 sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for legislation \n     affecting direct spending or receipts. Because section 143 of \n     the bill would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply. The impact of this provision on \n     federal outlays is shown in the following table. For the \n     purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the \n     effects in the current year, the budget year, and the \n     succeeding four years are counted.\n\n                                                            SUMMARY OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO EFFECTS                                                            \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars--                                  \n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               1998       1999       2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006       2007  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in outlays.........................          1          3          4          5          5          3          2          1          0         0[\nChange in receipts........................                                                                                                              \n(9)Not applicable                                                                                                                                       \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n        estimated impact on state, local, and tribal governments\n\n       S. 1754 would waive any state statutes of limitations that \n     govern the repayment of loans to nursing and other medical \n     students.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great Maine \ncompany that this week celebrates a remarkable milestone--its 150th \nAnniversary.\n  It was thirteen years before the Civil War began that the UNUM \nCorporation of Maine was founded as the Union Mutual Life Insurance \nCorporation. Since that time, UNUM has grown to employ more than 7,400 \nemployees worldwide, and almost 3,800 in their World Headquarters in \nPortland alone--and has become an industry leader in the area of long \nterm care disability insurance.\n  We in Maine are proud of UNUM's growth and longevity--outstanding \nachievements that don't happen by accident. But what is even more \nimpressive is UNUM's commitment to providing an outstanding environment \nfor its employees. Indeed, UNUM has been recognized by Fortune magazine \nas one of the nation's top 100 employers, and named as a leading \n``family-friendly'' company by both Business Week and Working Mother \nmagazines--evidence that UNUM's vision and innovation is garnering \naccolades throughout the professional world. In fact, UNUM has been on \nWorking Mother's list a remarkable nine years in a row.\n  From the standpoint of one who has consistently fought in Congress \nfor opening up possibilities and opportunities for women in business, \nas well as family-friendly legislation such as the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, I appreciate UNUM's commitment to fostering a work \nenvironment that recognizes that the values of hard work and family are \nnot mutually exclusive. Indeed, UNUM's philosophy shows that responding \nto employees' concerns is not only the right thing to do, it's also \nsound business practice.\n  In particular, I applaud UNUM's commitment to providing safe, \naffordable child care options to employees. UNUM was one of the first \ncompanies in America to establish an on-site child care center, and \nUNUM subsidizes child care costs for qualified employees. Hopefully, \nthis will blaze a trail that others in corporate America will be eager \nto follow.\n  UNUM also exemplifies the principles of corporate citizenship, and \nthe corporation as a partner in the community. UNUM has consistently \nbeen a responsible and integral member of the Portland community--where \nmost of their employees live--and UNUM will be celebrating their \nanniversary in part with a day-long community service effort involving \nthousands of employees and hundreds of projects. I commend UNUM's \ndedication to the community and to the use of corporate resources for \nthe betterment of others, and believe that their model is one which \nshould be replicated throughout the country.\n  This tone of corporate responsibility is set at the top, and UNUM \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Jim Orr deserves much of the \ncredit. A recent article in Portland's Maine Sunday Telegram elaborated \non Jim's many talents, saying that, ``he preaches a gospel of shared \ngoals, clear vision and intense focus''. A member of UNUM's board of \ndirectors stated, simply, ``The guy knows how to lead''. Obviously, he \nhas used that skill to build a company that not only knows how to \nsatisfy the bottom line, but to set an example for others to follow.\n  Mr. President, in Maine we like to speak of ``the way life should \nbe'', and we cherish a quality of life that is second to none. UNUM \nexemplifies ``the way business should be'' and for 150 years--that's \ntwo-thirds of this nation's existence--it has been contributing to the \neffort to build an even better Maine in which to live, work, and raise \na family. Again, I congratulate the leadership of UNNM, and the \noutstanding employees who have guaranteed the company's success over \nthe past 150 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/16/senate-section/article/S8420-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "16", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8420-S8421]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CALLING ON JAPAN TO MAINTAIN AN OPEN MARKET FOR SECTORS FACING MARKET \n                        ACCESS BARRIERS IN JAPAN\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join in cosponsoring S. \n2316, which earmarks a portion of Treasury funds obtained through the \nprivatization of the United States Enrichment Corporation for the clean \nup of depleted uranium hexafluoride, or so-called uranium ``tails.'' \nThe legislation earmarks roughly $335 million for this cleanup, \npreserving authority to conduct the treatment and recycling of depleted \nuranium tails.\n  However, none of the money will be spent unless Congress appropriates \nsuch funding. I am pleased that my amendment has been added to this \nbill which puts the Senate on record in support of fully appropriating \nfunds to implement a cleanup plan to be developed by the Secretary of \nEnergy. It is a two way street, Mr. President. I agree that the \nSecretary of Energy should immediately develop a plan to clean up the \ndepleted uranium tails. But I also believe Congress should respond \nquickly to appropriate the necessary funds.\n  Three weeks ago, the Administration announced that the USEC Board had \napproved the privatization of USEC through an initial public offering \nof stock in the new Corporation. This will be the largest federal \nprivatization effort since Conrail, establishing a $2.4 billion private \ncorporation to enrich uranium for nuclear power production and compete \nin world markets. I have been involved in this effort for more than a \ndecade. It directly affects 2,200 workers in Paducah, Kentucky who work \nat one of the two gaseous diffusion plants operated by USEC.\n  As part of this transaction, a $1.7 billion ``exit dividend'' is to \nbe paid to the Treasury. This legislation assures that an appropriate \nportion of those funds will be available for clean up at the existing \nUSEC facilities. And it also puts the Senate on record in support of \nfuture appropriations for clean up purposes.\n  Among the reasons for obtaining these assurances is the employment \nsituation at the two USEC plants. One of the great myths some are \npromoting is the suggestion that the privatization is causing 600 job \nlosses at the two plants over the next two years. This is simply not \nthe case. The job losses were apparently likely regardless of whether \nprivatization went forward. As part of the privatization agreement, the \nnew corporation has agreed to operate both existing plants through \nJanuary, 2005. However, some job reductions will occur. The job impact \nwas likely in the event that USEC remained as a government corporation \nand did not privatize. And it is equally likely in the short-term if \nprivatization goes forward. They are a reality and we must deal with \nthis situation. The privatization transaction provides $50 million to \nbegin clean up efforts at the two plants. This legislation adds to that \namount, earmarking an amount necessary to fully fund the estimated \nclean up liability for all uranium tails acquired since July 1993. Once \nenacted, it will be the responsibility of the Secretary of Energy to \ndevelop an adequate clean up plan. And just as importantly, it will be \nthe responsibility of the Congress to appropriate funds which are \nsufficient to fully implement the clean up plan.\n  I believe any individuals who lose their jobs at either of the \nexisting two facilities should be given a preference in obtaining these \nclean up jobs, and I will be urging the Administration to provide such \na preference in the months ahead.\n  A second great myth associated with privatization is that there is a \nlarge pot of money laying around which could be spent on clean up. That \nis not the case. First of all, upon privatization, the authority to \nspend the so-called ``exit dividend'' will expire unless we pass this \nbill. Time is of the essence. Second, even if the authority is \npreserved, none of the exit dividend may be spent unless Congress \nappropriates the funds. That is why our Sense of the Senate language is \nimportant. When we return to this issue in the future, it is essential \nthat Congress act expeditiously to appropriate the funds. So I think \nthis is a timely bill and strongly support its adoption.\n  I also support the privatization decisions which have been made by \nthe Administration and by the USEC Board. There is little question that \nthe current course of action is in the best long-term interest of the \nemployees at the Paducah facility. As a private corporation, USEC will \nbe more efficient. It will be better suited to enter into long-term \ncontracts and recapture its world market share for uranium enrichment. \nIt will be better suited to implement the technology of the future, \nwhich many believe will be the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation \n(AVLIS) technology. And it will be better suited to provide for the \nlong-term employment of the workers at the two current facilities.\n  Mr. President, I urge the passage of this bill and will continue to \nwork with my colleagues to get this proposal to the President's desk in \nthe days ahead.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this bill will ensure that the \nDepartment of Energy is not stuck with a massive unfunded mandate as a \nresult of the privatization of the United States Enrichment \nCorporation. This bill will ensure that both the workers at Paducah, \nKentucky and Portsmouth, Ohio as well as the environment are made a top \npriority.\n  Last month the Administration, the Department of Energy and the USEC \nBoard came to a decision on privatization of the United States \nEnrichment Corporation. The deal, however, put USEC first and \ntaxpayers, workers and the environment last.\n  As proposed, the USEC privatization will have a devastating effect on \njobs. The Administration has stated that 600 jobs will be lost in the \nfirst two years and admits that there is a real possibility that \nadditional job losses would occur in the following years. Something \nmust be done to alleviate the economic impact of this legislation, and \nI am hopeful that a serious clean up effort will mitigate some of the \njob losses.\n  Unless we prevent this transfer of funds from USEC to the General \nTreasury, taxpayers will be stuck with a massive unfunded environmental \nliability if this funding doesn't remain dedicated to clean up. \nConsidering the Department of Energy's track record on cleaning up its \nown depleted uranium tails that have been stockpiled for the past forty \nyears, it would be a big mistake if we allowed USEC to add an \nadditional 9,000 canisters to the tens of thousands of canisters in the \nDepartment's inventory without the funds already earmarked and \nallocated to cleaning up this environmental nightmare.\n  I am willing to accept the amendment by Senator Ford in order to \nsecure the nearly $400 million. Senator Ford's amendment adds language \nto ensure that this clean up effort remains consistent with National \nenvironmental Policy Act and adds a brief Sense of the Senate that \nCongress should fully fund the President's request.\n  I want to be absolutely clear, this amendment simply restates current \nlaw. This bill like any other, is subject to NEPA standards. However, \nit must not be an excuse for the Administration to slow down the \nimplementation of a clean up plan.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the support of Senator Ford for this \nlegislation and I look forward to passing it in a timely fashion so the \nAdministration does not privatize USEC until we can ensure that workers \nand the environment in Western Kentucky and Southeast Ohio are made a \ntop priority.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill be considered read the third time, and passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without any \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
