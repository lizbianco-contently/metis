Please join me in a word of prayer.\n  Dear God of all, though You look upon Your creation and see our world \nwithout the borders we draw or the barriers we erect, hear the cry of \nYour people in this corner of Your great universe. We implore You on \nbehalf of the men and women who govern these United States of America \nas Senators to grant to them wisdom, justice, mercy, and love in \nquantities not common to humankind. For, indeed, the task they share \nand the burden they bear is not a common one. Charged as they are to \nlead a Nation which stands out among all the nations of the world, the \nvery fate of this planet is altered by what they do.\n  Mighty and ever loving God, You have been so gracious to us, we \ncannot begin to express our gratitude for the rich resources of fertile \nland, refreshing rivers, and majestic forests with which You have \nblessed this Nation. All this is magnified by the fact that no merit of \nours has earned these blessings--no merit. For who can claim merit in \nthe presence of Your divine goodness? Who can claim merit before Your \nsublime righteousness? And so with these awesome blessings come great \nresponsibility. For You have instructed us that ``From the one to whom \nmuch has been entrusted, even more will be demanded''. --Luke 12:48.\n  Sovereign Spirit, help the Senators hear Your demand upon a people of \nfreedom to seek liberation for all; a people of wealth to seek \nprosperity for everyone; a people of justice to seek righteousness for \nall. May all gathered here execute their office with mercy, love, and \ncompassion. May this august assembly seek to share the blessings of \nthis Nation with all of its people and even with those who do not share \nthis badge of our citizenship but who still are our brothers and \nsisters whom You have commanded us to love and who share in that larger \ncircle of the whole human family of which You are the one Divine \nParent.\n  Let us all say--amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10865-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Reverend Shockley is pastor of the Congregational \nChurch of Christian Fellowship, United Church of Christ in Los Angeles, \nCA.\n  Mr. President, I had the great pleasure of attending services at his \nchurch a few weeks ago. On that particular day, we were reeling from a \nnumber of things both at home and abroad. His words were so fitting and \nhealing. I was honored to be sitting in his congregation.\n  Reverend Shockley has been a civil rights and human rights leader in \nLos Angeles for more than a decade. His accomplishments, his leadership \nand his compassion make him one of California's most respected members \nof the clergy.\n  Following the 1992 civil unrest in Los Angeles, Reverend Shockley \nhelped establish a 3-year program of ``community conversation,'' \nbringing together people from all racial and ethnic backgrounds, as \nwell as leaders from across this country, to talk about the causes of \nunrest and tension and to bring peace and love to a community that was \ntorn by hate and fear.\n  Most recently, Pastor Shockley has authored a series of critically \nacclaimed articles in the Los Angeles Times covering a broad range of \nimportant social topics. I congratulate and I thank Reverend Shockley \nfor coming all the way from California on a redeye flight, no less, \nwhich is not easy to do, and to share his prayers with us today. Our \ncountry so needs the healing message that he brings us every day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10865-5", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n        FEDERAL VACANCIES REFORM ACT OF 1988--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will proceed to S. 2279 which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2279) to amend title 49, United States Code, to \n     authorize programs of the Federal Aviation Administration for \n     fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Inhofe amendment No. 3620, to provide for the immediate \n     application of certain orders relating to the amendment, \n     modification, suspension, or revocation of certificates under \n     chapter 447 of title 49, United States Code.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3620\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  There are 10 minutes equally divided on the Inhofe amendment. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that because of \nhis eloquence, the Senator from Oklahoma be allowed 7 minutes and I \nwill take 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is a process that is used by the FAA \nwhich is known as the emergency revocation process. This process will \nallow an inspector in the event of an alleged violation by a licensed \npilot to take away the pilot's certificate. He would take away the \ncertificate under the emergency revocation clause declaring that an \nemergency exists.\n\n  The problem with this is that many times when you have an inspector \ndo this, or an examiner take away a certificate, there is not even an \nemergency nature to the revocation. Consequently, we have many, many \ncases where the individuals have been abused.\n  I would like to suggest that Ted Stewart, who is an American Airlines \npilot, has been a pilot for over 12 years and presently flying Boeing \n767s. In May of 1995, there was an emergency revocation. He was not \nguilty of anything. There was not an emergency attached to this. There \nwas never any hazard to anyone's health or safety.\n  However, it was 2 months until he was able to get his certificate \nback. Then an examiner went back to him in June of 1996 and again \nrevoked his certificate under the emergency revocation. Consequently, \nfor another 2 months he was unable to earn a living. Fortunately, he \nworked for American Airlines; they were good enough to keep his \npaychecks coming, but in many cases that is not the case.\n  I happen to be a very close friend of a man named Bob Hoover. I think \nmost of you can remember who Bob Hoover is. He is considered to be the \nbest performer in the circuit of airshows. In fact, I have flown \nairshows with him. In 1992--and I was there at the time--an inspector \ncame in, an examiner for the FAA, and said to him, We think you have a \nproblem. We think perhaps there is a mental problem or something--they \ndidn't really define it--and they revoked his certificate. It wasn't \nfor another 4 years he was able to get his certificate back. In the \nmeantime, he was flying his airshows but outside the United States.\n  Now, very simply, what my amendment does is set up a process whereby \nif you lose your certificate, you have 48 hours to take it to the NTSB \nand let the NTSB make a determination as to whether or not there is any \nkind of an emergency nature to the revocation. After they have looked \nthis over and decided there is no emergency involved to the nature of \nthe revocation, then at the end of 7 days the pilot will get his \ncertificate back. If there is, then he would not get it back. They can \ngo ahead then and go through the normal adjudication of the violation.\n  This is something that has been going on for quite some time. We have \nbeen concerned about reforming this process. This is a compromise, \nbecause this makes it very clear if there is any hazard out there, if \nthere is any risk to anyone's safety, the flying public or the pilot \nhimself, the pilot is not going to be able to fly. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  A lot of people say that there are only 300 emergency revocations a \nyear. Therefore, it is not really a problem; it doesn't really affect \nthat many people. I suggest to you that if you take 300 people, there \nmight be 20 or 30 of those who make their living flying airplanes for \nAmerican Airlines or one of the other airlines, in which case that \ntakes them out of their occupation.\n  The other problem we have is there are 650,000 pilots right now \nlicensed in\n\n[[Page S10867]]\n\nthe United States and they all live in mortal fear that something like \nthis would happen to them.\n  At this point let me yield 1 minute to Senator Frist.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Inhofe amendment. \nClearly, the FAA will be against this amendment because they will not \nvoluntarily relinquish anything in terms of regulatory authority. I \nbelieve this amendment is reasonable. It provides, in essence, due \nprocess for pilots who do have their privileges revoked, with attention \ngiven to safety. It really assures accountability within the FAA.\n  As a pilot who has been witness to the potential abuses--and the \nSenator from Oklahoma has demonstrated several well-documented examples \nof how the FAA has really unfairly used a necessary power to \nprematurely revoke certificates--this amendment will address the issue \nwhile assuring accountability.\n  I rise in support of the amendment, a more reasonable approach which \nassures accountability and assures due process.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, of course, respect very much the views \nexpressed by Senators Frist and Inhofe, both of whom are pilots. The \nFAA has objected to this amendment. I believe it goes too far. I \nunderstand Senator Inhofe's concerns. They were voiced a couple of \nyears ago on a similar measure when we were doing another bill, the \naviation bill. The fact is, we need to address this issue.\n  I believe this goes too far. I look forward to working with Senator \nInhofe and Senator Frist on it, but I am very hesitant to take a \nmeasure which could, at the end of the day, possibly endanger safety. \nThat is why I have to oppose this amendment at this time.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have to oppose this amendment, also. The \nFAA must have the ability to act when it believes safety is at risk. \nThe FAA is often criticized for not acting quickly enough on safety \nmatters. Here they revoke a certificate for safety purposes and we want \nto make it harder for them to act. Right now the court of appeals has \nupheld the FAA actions in every case. They do not second guess the \nagency charged with the regulation of safety, so let's be sure we give \nthe FAA the authority for safety in the air.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President just a few years ago we went through the \nsame thing with the civil penalties of the FAA Act, so there would be \nsomeone other than the FAA involved. Prior to that time, the FAA was \nthe judge, the jury, and the appellate court. They made all the \ndecisions and they were protecting their own, because every bureaucracy \ndoes this--EPA, IRS, FDA and all the rest of them.\n  We changed the regulation so the NTSB, then, would be the appellate \ncourt for civil penalties, and it has worked very well. The junior \nSenator from Texas served on the NTSB, and I yield her whatever time \nshe needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute 20 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do support the Inhofe amendment. \nHaving served on the National Transportation Safety Board, I can tell \nyou that the NTSB normally does not overturn the FAA revocation of \npilots' licenses. But they do, after they go through the process and \nlook at all of the evidence. I think it is quite fair to say if someone \nis going to be disadvantaged by having a license revoked, that the NTSB \ncould very easily, and quickly, look at the type of evidence that they \nare going to hear and, without making a final adjudication, determine \nthat this person would or would not be eligible to fly during the \npendency of the proceedings.\n  I think it would introduce a new level in the process. It would be \nthe emergency level. I think the NTSB can handle this. I think they are \ncompetent to do it, and I think their record shows that they have done \nit in the past.\n  I do support the amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 seconds.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will conclude by saying this in no way impairs the \nflying safety of the flying public or the pilots. The fact that the \naverage time between the alleged violation and the revocation is 132 \ndays pretty much tells you it is not really an emergency problem in \nmost of these cases. I urge you to join the 625,000 pilots and myself \nin supporting the Inhofe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. If he \ndoes not prevail on this amendment, which I oppose, I want to pledge to \nhim that I will work with him. There have been abuses. He pointed out \nthe case of Mr. Hoover, who was respected and admired by all of us, who \nwas mistreated by the bureaucracy. Unfortunately, there are always \ncases where these things happen. But I think we have always to keep \nsafety as the paramount concern, and I believe this amendment \npossibly--I am not saying absolutely--but possibly could endanger the \nFAA's ability to carry out their primary responsibilities.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his deep involvement in this \nand other aviation issues. I look forward to working with him in \naddressing what is clearly a problem.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

I am receiving calls, and I know there is support for it on both \nsides of the aisle. So we will continue to try to work that out, and we \nwill try to get an agreement to go forward on it later today.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are back on the FAA authorization bill. \nWe have a number of amendments that will require debate and votes. We \nalso are working to resolve a number of them. I want to say to my \ncolleagues that I don't know what the leaders on both sides intend to \ndo this evening, but the Senator from Kentucky and I intend to try to \nget rid of all amendments by this evening. If we are unable to have \nMembers come over here to propose amendments, then, obviously, we have \nno choice but to move forward\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\non the legislation. We have a number of amendments: A Dorgan amendment, \na Mikulski-Sarbanes amendment, a Torricelli amendment, a Robb \namendment, a Domenici amendment, and others that are on the unanimous-\nconsent agreement. I hope that those Senators will come over and offer \nthe amendments and stand ready to debate them and vote on them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I join my colleague in asking the Senators \nto help us move this bill along. We worked late into the night last \nevening in order to try to accommodate as many Senators as we could. \nThere were some changes in language to where the amendments could be \nagreeable. Those amendments will be offered because both sides have \nagreed. We are down to maybe five or six amendments that will need \nvotes. I don't know of any other vote that would be necessary.\n  Under the unanimous consent agreement of last evening, we said that \nthese were first-degree amendments and that there might be second-\ndegree amendments. We hope not. I want to encourage those on my side, \nif they have amendments that they want to debate and discuss, we are \nready to take the time to do it now.\n  It gets a little frustrating here at the end of a session when \neverybody wants something done and nobody is here to help us get things \ndone. It is the ``nature of the brute,'' as I have heard quite often. \nBut we will be in a crunch, we will be here Saturdays and Sunday \nafternoon if we are going to get out by October 9, or we will be \nlabeled as a ``do-nothing Congress.'' I don't like that label, and I \ndon't like to work on Saturdays or Sundays. I don't think my colleagues \ndo either.\n\n  If they would just come and offer their amendments and give us a time \nagreement, we can stack votes. We can do a lot of things to accommodate \nour Members.\n  I hope they will listen to the admonishment of my friend from Arizona \nthat we want to finish this bill today, if at all possible. We intend \nto do that. If colleagues are not cooperative, then third reading is \nalways possible.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, how long will the Senator be?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. The reason I ask--I apologize for interrupting--is for \nothers who want to come to the floor, and we can give them a time at \nwhich they can get here. So it would be roughly 10 minutes after 11.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10869-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10870-S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE 1998 TAX MEASURE\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few comments on the \nbudget picture and the tax measure that appears likely to move through \nCongress in these few days remaining in the session.\n  Over the last several days, a number of my colleagues have come to \nthe floor to voice concerns about the increasing use of the emergency \nspending provisions in our budget rule as a device to circumvent the \ntough limits we have imposed on our budget requiring that all new \nspending be paid for.\n  Those Members are properly alarmed because those spending provisions, \nwhich by any reasonable measure were predictable and expected, have now \nbeen designated as emergency appropriations precisely to avoid the need \nfor offsetting spending cuts.\n  Mr. President, I want you to know that I share the concerns of those \nMembers.\n  The spending limits to which we agreed in the bipartisan budget \nagreement last year are indeed tough. They were intended to be tough. \nBut if we are to make progress toward a truly balanced budget, those \nlimits have to be respected--not just last year's but also this year \nand into the future.\n  Along those same lines, I have some very serious concerns about the \nproposed tax bill that is working its way through Congress. To many it \nwill not come as a surprise that I have serious concerns about this \nmeasure.\n  In 1994, I was the first Member of either House to fault both parties \nfor the irresponsible tax policies they were advocating while our \nNation still faced a very serious budget deficit. Then, as now, I \nfirmly believed that balancing the budget has to be our highest \neconomic priority, and that the irresponsible tax legislation being \noffered at that time made that task much harder. I think that \nsubsequent events have proved that point.\n  The 104th Congress pursued the so-called Contract With America \nbudget, a proposal that featured massive cuts in Medicare and Medicaid \nto help fund an irresponsible tax cut. That proposal in effect tried to \nserve two masters at the same time--a reduced deficit, and a massive \ntax cut.\n  The result was a measure that was unsustainable economically and \npolitically, and the political gridlock that followed in the wake of \nthat budget produced a Government shutdown, and little, if any, new \nprogress toward balancing the Federal budget.\n  So the result was that the 104th Congress missed an important \nopportunity to finish the job that we started in the 103d Congress with \nthe successful enactment of the historic deficit reduction package \npassed in August of 1993. It was the 1993 deficit reduction package \nthat helped finally turn the budget around. It also helped turn \nCongress around by focusing attention on the need for continuing \ndeficit reduction.\n  Unfortunately, the 104th Congress failed to advance the work of the \n103d Congress. It sadly lost the focus of deficit reduction and the \npolitically driven tax cut proposal undercut the potential for a \nsustainable deficit reduction package.\n  Then, at the beginning of the 105th Congress, we began to regain part \nof our focus on reducing the deficit. The political gridlock that \ncharacterized most of the previous Congress was really a slap in the \nface to many, and the following Congress--this Congress--there was a \nhistoric bipartisan effort to get back on track.\n  As a Member of the Senate Budget Committee, I was proud to be part of \nthat bipartisan effort.\n  Once again, let me pay special notice to our distinguished chairman, \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and our ranking member, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, for their leadership in helping to craft a bipartisan \nspending-cut bill that we passed in 1997.\n  Mr. President, taken together, the 1993 deficit package, and to a \nlesser but still important extent the 1997 budget-cutting bill, have \nput this Nation on the road--``on the road''; we are not there yet, but \non the road--to a truly balanced budget. We are not there yet, but the \ngoal is in sight.\n  As I noted, I was proud to support the budget-cutting bill last year. \nI voted for the tough spending cuts that included. However, I did not \nsupport the separate irresponsible tax-cut bill that was also part of \nthose discussions.\n  A large part of the reason we have not reached our goal of a balanced \nbudget is last year's tax-cut legislation. In fact, that tax cut should \nnot have been enacted for a great many reasons. But first and foremost, \nMr. President, it shouldn't have been enacted because it was premature. \nIn effect, it created over a 10-year period a $292 billion net tax \ncut--a net tax cut of $292 billion--while we were still facing \nsignificant budget deficits.\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that because our budget is still in \ndeficit, the tax cut was effectively funded with Social Security \nrevenues. Make no mistake about it. That $292 billion comes out of the \nSocial Security trust fund, because it is the only pot that is left \nwhen you have a deficit.\n  Mr. President, this terrible problem in last year's tax bill is the \nvery same problem that plagued this year's tax proposal.\n  There are other problems, as well, with last year's tax bill. Not \nonly was it premature, but the bill's costs were heavily backloaded, \nputting even a greater burden on our children and grandchildren, and \neven adding more complexity, if you can believe it--even more \ncomplexity--to a Tax Code already thick with it.\n  And by committing revenues to a variety of specific interests, it \nfurther\n\n[[Page S10871]]\n\njeopardized the broad-based tax reform that so many of us genuinely \nwant to see, and that we really thought was going to happen after the \n1994 election.\n  Mr. President, the most telling legacy of last year's premature tax \ncut is that, if it had not been enacted, our Federal budget would have \nfinally achieved a significant surplus by 2002 instead of having to \nwait until at least as long as 2006, 4 years earlier.\n  Mr. President, this bears repeating.\n  As we have talked for years about how we wanted to have a truly \nbalanced budget by the year 2002, that goal and that achievement was \nsacrificed to the desire to give out a premature tax cut last year. If \nCongress had not enacted last year's premature tax cut, today we would \nbe looking at the chance of real budget surpluses in the year 2002 \ninstead of having to wait at least until the year 2006, and perhaps \nbeyond, if the appetite for premature tax cuts is not satiated.\n  Mr. President, this mistake of last year should have been a lesson \nfor us. Regrettably, it appears at least some have not learned a \nlesson.\n  We now come to the end of the 105th Congress, and again we are \npresented with yet another tax-cut proposal.\n  Estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation puts the cost of the \ntax cuts in this new proposal at about $86 billion over the next 5 \nyears. Naturally, all of us who care about truly balancing the budget \nsay, ``OK. Where are the offsets? What about the offsets? What revenue \nincreases or spending cuts are included in the package to offset this \ncost of $86 billion in lost revenue?''\n  Apparently, other than about $5 billion in revenue offsets, there are \nnone. So it begins to look an awful lot like the 1997 tax bill, which \ninvolved at least $86 billion to $90 billion in net tax reductions--not \noffsets--over the course of 5 years.\n  Mr. President, this new proposal essentially has no offsets. It is a \nnet $80-billion-deficit increase.\n  How can this be? What possible justification is offered to again \nballoon the deficit in this way?\n  The answer is the same shell-game explanation that has been given to \nthe public for about 30 years.\n  Proponents of this legislation argue that somehow there is no \ndeficit, that the budget currently has a surplus, and that all this tax \nbill does is merely return some of that surplus to the taxpayer.\n  That portrayal of our budget is simply wrong and, frankly, is \nmisleading.\n  We do not have the surplus. The budget this year is projected to have \nabout a $40 billion deficit. And except for briefly achieving balance \nin 2002 and 2005, the Congressional Budget Office does not project a \nsignificant budget surplus until at least the year 2006, 8 years from \nnow, if, and only if, their economic assumptions hold. And they, of \ncourse, are optimistic economic assumptions based on the rather healthy \neconomy we have enjoyed for several years.\n  In response to a letter from our ranking member on the Budget \nCommittee, the Congressional Budget Office indicates that if a \nrecession similar to the one that occurred in 1990 and 1991 were to \nbegin in late 1999, the budget's bottom line in that year would be \nclose to $50 billion worse than is currently projected. CBO goes on to \nnote that this impact on the budget would grow to almost $150 billion \nby the year 2002.\n  Put simply, if we were to experience a recession similar to the one \nwe experienced in 1990 and 1991, instead of having a balanced budget in \nthe year 2002, we would have a budget deficit of $150 billion--all the \nmore reason for us to be fiscally prudent.\n  Let me reiterate, we do not have a budget surplus today. Our budget \nis currently projected to end the current fiscal year with a deficit of \nabout $40 billion. How can proponents argue that we have a budget \nsurplus when we do not? What is the difference? What is the difference \nbetween their view and their argument and the real budget? The \ndifference is Social Security. Those who are pushing this tax measure \nwant to include Social Security trust fund balances in our budget. They \nwant to use Social Security balances to pay for their tax cut. And that \nis what is wrong with this tax cut.\n  A recent release from the Concord Coalition said it quite well. They \nsaid, ``It is inconsistent for Congress to say that Social Security is \n`off budget' while at the same time using the Social Security surplus \nto pay for tax cuts or new spending.''\n  That is exactly what is being proposed here. Years of fiscal \ndiscipline are being squandered for the sake of an election year tax \ncut bill.\n  What is equally troubling, the future discipline that will be needed \nto finish the job and balance the budget is also put at risk by this \ntax bill. Our budget rules cannot by themselves eliminate our deficit \nand balance the budget, but they can help sustain the tough decisions \nwe make here. They play an important role in ensuring that Congress \ndoes not backslide in efforts to balance the budget.\n  The tax measure as it currently is being debated in the other body \nappears to violate several critical budget rules. It violates the pay-\ngo rule, which is supposed to ensure that tax and entitlement bills do \nnot aggravate the deficit. It violates section 311(A)(2)(b) of the \nBudget Act by undercutting the revenue levels established in the most \nrecent budget resolution. And it may violate section 306 of the Budget \nAct if, as some believe will happen, the majority includes language \nwhich would include further provisions to avoid the automatic cuts made \nby the sequester process.\n  This proposal may well become a triple threat. It ignores rules \nrequiring offsets, it ignores rules establishing revenue floors, and \nbefore we are done it may also seek to circumvent the sequester \nprovisions--the last line of defense to protect the budget.\n  I know this can sound very complicated. The people pushing this tax \nbill are counting on it sounding complicated. But it is really not \ncomplicated. Put simply, what they want to do, just like they did last \nyear, is to use the Social Security trust funds to pay for an election \nyear tax cut. They will balloon the deficit and imperil Social \nSecurity, and that is a bad idea.\n  This is the legacy of the tax bill as it is the legacy of the 1997 \ntax bill--raiding the Social Security trust fund, busting the budget \nand trashing budget discipline, all for an election year tax cut. For \nthe sake of expediency, this body will be asked to put fiscal prudence \non the block.\n  Last year's tax bill was premature. This year's tax bill is equally \nreckless. We are within sight of our goal of a truly balanced budget. \nWe really should not stray from that path. I urge my colleagues to join \nwith me to oppose any tax measure which violates our budget rules and \nsets us once again on a fiscally irresponsible course.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10870-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10871-S10873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H. FORD NATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  1998\n\n  The Senate continued the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3627\n\n (Purpose: To reestablish the Office of Noise Abatement and Control in \n                  the Environmental Protection Agency)\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment on \nthe underlying legislation of FAA reauthorization. I do so in \nrecognition of the reality of life of hundreds of thousands of people \nthat I represent--and, indeed, most Members of the Senate represent--\nwho, by the chance of the place of their birth or where they choose to \nlive, have a daily encounter with the rising problem of airplane noise \nin our country.\n  We have through recent decades learned to expand our concept of \npollution of the air and the water to toxins, to chemicals we work with \nevery day. But to most Americans they, in their own lives, have already \ncome to understand and reach the decision that I bring before this \nSenate today: Noise is a pollution, and it is a very real part of the \nquality of life of most people in our country, impacting their \ncommunities.\n  I offer this amendment because this problem will not solve itself \nand, indeed, as the years pass, it is clear it is\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\ngoing to get worse. The FAA predicts that by the year 2007 there will \nbe 36 percent more airplane flights than this Nation will experience \nthis year; 60 of the 100 largest airports in this country in each of \nour major metropolitan regions are planning expansions with new \nrunways. To some, this is a choice between economic expansion and the \nquality of life or health of our families. We do not have to reach that \nchoice. If we build airports, plan their expansion, and deal with the \nissue of flight paths with good, scientific information, understanding \nthe impact of noise on health and how it can be mitigated, there is no \nreason to compromise economic growth while we legitimately address the \nhealth of our families.\n  We already know that 25 million Americans are impacted by noise \nproblems every day. Even the rudimentary studies that have been \nundertaken lead us to understand that noise exposure is an element of \nhypertension difficulties and cardiovascular problems. It is estimated \nthat another 40 million people with different levels of noise exposure \nhave sleep or work disruption that affect their productivity and their \nown quality of life.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency for a time was involved in these \nissues. Some of the judgment I bring before the Senate today was made \nmore than two decades ago. Then Congress understood the impact of noise \non health and quality of life. But in 1981 the Congress eliminated the \nOffice of Noise Abatement and Control, so much scientific work and the \nadvice of scientists and others with this responsibility ceased.\n  In the EPA's absence, the Federal Aviation Administration has been \ncharged with the responsibility of monitoring aircraft noise. Mr. \nPresident, the FAA has a mission, it has technical capabilities, and it \nperforms its mission admirably. But dealing with the problem of noise \nis not its expertise or its mission. There is an obvious conflict of \ninterest between promoting the expansion of the aviation industry and \nits airports and their operations, and dealing with the problem of \nnoise. This conflict was recently highlighted by the Natural Resources \nDefense Council's own study that found that the FAA's policy, relying \non a 65-decibel threshold for determining the level of noise \ncompatibility with residential communities, was far too high and \ncompletely inappropriate. Yet that is the level the FAA continues to \nuse because it does not force the critical choices in dealing with \nnoise abatement.\n  I cannot adequately describe, for the quarter of a million people who \nlive in New Jersey who are impacted by noise problems from Newark \nAirport, JFK, and La Guardia every day, how disappointing it is that \nthis work in the Federal Government has ceased and the FAA alone is \nexercising this responsibility.\n  In our absence in these 17 years, much of this work and much of the \nprogress on the question of noise and airports has been ceded to \nEuropean leadership where much of the current health studies are being \nundertaken. For example, in Munich, Germany, a scientific study \nrecently found that chronic exposure to airplane noise was affecting \nthe psychological well-being of young children. Another study in \nEngland, where in our absence this work also was continuing, found that \nchildren studying under flight paths to Heathrow Airport in London had \na reading age 6 months behind children who were not similarly exposed \nto aircraft noise.\n  The amendment I offer today, of which I now speak, would reengage the \nEPA in the serious business of evaluating alternatives and the impacts \nof airplane noise. It is based on legislation that I introduced last \nyear with Senators Sarbanes, Wellstone, Lautenberg, Moynihan, Murray, \nD'Amato, and Boxer. I have termed it the ``Quiet Communities Act,'' and \nit would reestablish within the EPA an Office of Noise Abatement and \nControl.\n  Some of that mission is reflected in the amendment I bring to the \nfloor today for this authorization legislation. It will require the EPA \nto conduct a study which examines the FAA selection of noise \nmeasurement methodologies, so we know when the FAA does undertake \nstudies whether their methodologies are sound and reasonable, as well \nas establishing a threshold of noise at which health impacts are felt.\n  So that in communities all across America, when people gather with \nlocal airport authorities and State authorities and Federal \nauthorities, there is a scientific basis to know with some certainty \nwhether or not their children's health is being impacted.\n  It is important to note that this bill will only give the EPA the \nauthority to recommend new standards. It will only give them authority \nto recommend. It imposes nothing. The EPA can make its suggestions. It \ncan do scientific studies. It can give a baseline. It will not change \nthe authority in making final judgments.\n  Mr. President, I believe this is a reasonable suggestion to go down \nthe path that other industrialized democracies have followed and which \nthis Congress recognized two decades ago, that noise is a real and \npersistent problem in America that affects health. It is only \nreasonable that on a voluntary basis the EPA be able to make \nrecommendations at what level and what methodologies so we can have an \ninformed debate.\n  Mr. President, I offer this amendment for my colleagues' \nconsideration, and I urge its adoption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from New \nJersey seeks a recorded vote on this; is that correct?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will make a motion to table the Torricelli-Lautenberg \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no amendment pending.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from New Jersey, I do not believe he \nhas sent the amendment to the desk yet.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. It is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Jersey ask that it \nbe reported?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I ask that it be reported, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that before the recorded vote, each side be given 2 minutes to \nexplain their positions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is fine.\n  Who has the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement calls for 1 \nhour of debate on this amendment, evenly divided.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Sure.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I reserve the remainder of my time pending Senator \nLautenberg having a chance to come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], for himself, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Wellstone, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3627.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we will be glad to use whatever time the \nSenator from New Jersey desires, along with his colleague.\n  I still move to table the amendment, and ask unanimous consent that \nthe time for that vote----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A motion to table is not in order until the \ntime has been used.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Until such time as the time has expired or the Senator \nfrom New Jersey yields back, at that time, I intend to seek a tabling \nmotion, and that tabling motion would be at the agreement of the two \nleaders, since it is not clear as to exactly when that vote would be \nheld. So that is my intention.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on the amendment.\n  This amendment to reestablish the Office of Noise Abatement and \nControl in the EPA is something that I believe is very unnecessary. The \nlanguage of the proposal is being represented as dealing with noise \nfrom all sources. It is clearly targeted at aviation noise.\n  I also say to the Senator from New Jersey, I understand the aviation \nnoise problems in his State, as well as neighboring States.\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\n  Mr. President, aviation noise issues involve a careful balancing of \nmany concerns, including technology, safety, airspace management, \nresearch and education, and land use. The expertise and necessary \ncenter of authority for dealing with these highly interrelated matters \nhas always resided in the FAA.\n  Replication of the necessary expertise within the EPA, along with the \ncreation of jurisdictional ambiguities, would not only be wasteful of \nour limited Federal resources, but would also serve to complicate and \nconfound existing efforts to deal with and better understand community \nnoise concerns. The fact of the matter is that the EPA does not have \nany expertise in aerodynamics, which is fundamental to addressing \naircraft noise issues.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to point out that noisy Stage \n2 aircraft are currently being phased out. The FAA estimates that by \nthe year 2000, the population exposed to significant aircraft noise \nwill be approximately 600,000. That is a dramatic decrease from the \nmore than 4.5 million just 8 years ago. It is clear that current noise \nmitigation efforts have significantly reduced the exposure of a great \nmany people to aircraft noise. We should allow this substantive work to \ncontinue without any interference.\n  Reestablishing the Office of Noise Abatement and Control strikes me \nas a needless return to big government. The last thing I think we need \nto be doing now is funding, even with a budget surplus, another \nbureaucratic office, especially when the underlying concerns are \nalready being addressed.\n  Mr. President, the FAA News, i.e., the press release that was issued \non September 9, says:\n\n       Aircraft Noise Levels Continue to Decline, Secretary Slater \n     Announces.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       With the continued removal of noisier aircraft and the \n     introduction of quieter airplanes to the U.S. fleet, \n     approximately 80 percent of airplanes operating in the United \n     States today are the quieter Stage 3 aircraft, Secretary of \n     Transportation Rodney E. Slater reported today.\n       * * * * * *\n       This is the sixth consecutive year that the aircraft fleet \n     has been ahead of the requirement to transition to a quieter \n     aircraft. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 requires \n     that all airplanes meet quieter Stage 3 noise levels by the \n     year 2000.\n\n  I might add that that legislation was a direct result of the efforts \nof the Senator from Kentucky.\n\n       Secretary Slater's report to Congress shows that operators \n     surpassed the Dec. 31 interim compliance requirement. \n     Operators either had to reduce noisier Stage 2 airplanes by \n     50 percent or have 65 percent of the quieter Stage 3 \n     airplanes in their fleets. Just this past year, 225 noisier \n     Stage 2 aircraft have been removed from service while 554 \n     quieter Stage 3 aircraft have entered service in the United \n     States.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this complete statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From FAA News, Sept. 9, 1998]\n\n Aircraft Noise Levels Continue to Decline, Secretary Slater Announces\n\n       Washington.--With the continued removal of noisier aircraft \n     and the introduction of quieter airplanes to the U.S. fleet, \n     approximately 80 percent of airplanes operating in the United \n     States today are the quieter Stage 3 aircraft, Secretary of \n     Transportation Rodney E.

The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 requires \n     that all airplanes meet quieter Stage 3 noise levels by the \n     year 2000.\n       Secretary Slater's report to Congress shows that operators \n     surpassed the Dec. 31 interim compliance requirement. \n     Operators either had to reduce noisier Stage 2 airplanes by \n     50 percent or have 65 percent of the quieter Stage 3 \n     airplanes in their fleets. Just this past year, 225 noisier \n     Stage 2 aircraft have been removed from service while 554 \n     quieter Stage 3 aircraft have entered service in the United \n     States.\n       FAA Administrator Jane F. Garvey said, ``I applaud the \n     continued commitment of airplane operators and manufacturers. \n     The operators continue to meet or exceed interim compliance \n     dates and manufacturers continue to develop quieter aircraft \n     and engines.''\n       Stage 2 airplanes include Boeing models 727-200, 737-200 \n     and McDonnell Douglas model DC-9. Stage 3 airplanes include \n     Boeing models 737-300, 757, 777 and McDonnell Douglas models \n     MD-80 and 90.\n       Some operators are complying with the Stage 2 airplane \n     phaseout by installing FAA certified Stage 3 noise level \n     hushkits to their Stage 2 fleet. Many airline operators have \n     already met the criteria for the next interim compliance \n     date, which is Dec. 31, 1998.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are making progress, a lot of it due to \nthe exhaustive efforts of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce \nCommittee under the leadership of Senator Ford. We are making progress. \nIt is exceeding the goals that everyone agreed were reasonable at the \ntime we passed the act in 1990. I strongly recommend that we do not set \nup or reestablish another bureaucracy to address a problem which, \nalthough is still in existence, clearly is being addressed in a manner \nwhich exceeds our expectations.\n  Again, I have great sympathy for the Senator from New Jersey and the \npeople who live in these air corridors where there is exceedingly high \nnoise levels. My message to them is: Help is not only on the way but it \nhas been on the way for some years now. In fact, for the sixth \nconsecutive year noise levels have been reduced. I know that is of \nsmall consolation to some, but over time we will have much quieter \ncommunities in New Jersey, as well as Arizona, Kentucky, and every \nother State in America.\n  As I said before, Mr. President, I intend to move to table the \namendment, either at the expiration of all time or the yielding back of \ntime before the vote. I tell my colleagues, I will let them know as \nsoon as possible, because the two leaders would have to consult on the \ntime of that vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if there are no others seeking recognition \non this amendment--and the distinguished Senator from Arizona has noted \nthe procedure following the vote--I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business to speak about the issue of \nimpeachment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. For how long?\n  Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, for 1 minute, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I renew my earlier unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, is that request for a \nmaximum of 20 minutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, an absolute maximum of 20 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As long as that unanimous-consent request includes not \nlonger than 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I amend it to so state.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nKentucky for their usual courtesies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10871-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10873-S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRESS' RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING THE REFERRAL FROM KENNETH STARR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nthe responsibility of Congress considering the referral from Kenneth \nStarr.\n  I am deeply concerned about how this is unfolding. This process is \nfast losing credibility. It is enough off track that the national \ninterest, which should be our paramount concern, is suffering. It is \nenough off track that our institutions of government--the Congress, the \nPresidency, and the Constitution itself--may suffer damage that will \nlinger long after we are all gone from the scene. The way we handle \nthis responsibility, the character of our own institution is also at \nstake.\n  America, look where we are. The President has misused his office. \nKenneth Starr is leaving in his wake a body of debris that will bring \ndown the entire independent counsel law. And now that this matter is on \nour doorstep, we in the Congress increasingly risk, through our \nactions, undermining the public's faith and trust in our own \ninstitution of our own national government.\n  In these early stages of this inquiry into the actions of the \nPresident of the\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\nUnited States, it is time we ask whether we, ourselves, are on the \nverge of becoming not part of the solution but, instead, part of the \nproblem, by harming our national interests and further eroding the \npublic's confidence in their government.\n  Should we be disappointed and offended and angered by the President's \nconduct? Certainly we should be. As a father, a husband, as an \nAmerican, and as someone who knows this President and supports the good \nhe has done for the Nation, I am appalled and saddened by this episode.\n  These are difficult days in Washington and they are difficult days \nfor the Nation. But this is a time when the Congress must rise above \npartisanship and look beyond short-term political objectives. We must \nconsider what best serves the common good of the American people.\n  Four tenets must guide Congress' proper handling of the referral from \nMr. Starr: We should put the national interests first in all of our \nconsiderations. Secondly, proceedings should be structured and enjoined \nto be as bipartisan as possible. Third, we must be fair. And fourth, we \nmust move toward resolving this controversy as promptly as possible.\n  Early statements by the House leadership point in the right \ndirection, but these have been overtaken by events and actions. I have \nnoted on many other occasions my respect for Henry Hyde, chairman of \nthe House Judiciary Committee, and John Conyers, ranking Democratic \nmember of that committee. These two distinguished leaders have the \nwisdom and experience to work together for the good of the country and \nto construct a fair, bipartisan process. It does not augur well for \nsuch a process, however, that unilateral decisions and party-line votes \nalready have become the norm, and the House has paid little attention \nto ensuring fairness in its initial decisions and actions.\n  The past several weeks have not been reassuring. The other body has \nyet to determine what rules and procedures should govern their actions, \nhow our traditional notions of due process and fundamental fairness \nwill be guaranteed, and how to prevent this process from degenerating \ninto a partisan exercise. The House only now is beginning to examine \nthe precedence and bipartisan actions of the House Judiciary Committee \nthat considered the impeachment of President Nixon. In effect, they \nhave put the cart before the horse.\n  Perhaps the meeting yesterday involving the House leadership will \nyield some progress. It is time for leaders in the House and the \nSenate, leaders from both parties, people of good will who put the \nnational interests first, to reconsider how this matter is being \nhandled and where it is headed.\n  A partisan train seems to be rolling out of the House station in a \ndecidedly political direction. Perhaps it is too much to hope that \nMembers, in the midst of reelection efforts, would view this matter \nthrough any prism other than their own campaigns or prospects for \nmajority control in the Congress and the presidential election in 2000. \nThe public is wondering whether this Congress can do anything serious \nnow that election season is upon us.\n  Congress risks undermining the public's trust in our institutions of \nour national government. We must consider what best serves the common \ngood of the American people and our national interests. This is a time \nwhen Congress must rise above partisanship and look beyond short-term \npolitical objectives.\n  Like Dwight Eisenhower before him, my friend and former colleague \nSenator Dole used his Farewell Address to the Senate in 1996 to warn of \nan impending danger to the Nation. He chose to speak about a \nfundamental lesson he learned in his years in Washington: that people \nof both parties must work together. He reminded Senators that we \nrepresent all our constituents--Republicans, Democrats, and \nindependents.\n  On any consideration of proceedings to inquire into the possible \nimpeachment of the President of the United States, as on matters of \nsuch overriding significance as the declaration of war or amending the \nConstitution, all Members of Congress must be mindful of the Nation's \ninterests and the potential for harm that can be caused by pursuing \nnarrow partisan goals.\n  We have already seen personal criticism of the President while he was \noverseas on a trip to Russia and Ireland. On Monday, the videotape of \nthe President's appearance before one of the Starr grand juries was \nbroadcast over the airwaves, even while the President of the United \nStates was making a major address before the United Nations on \ninternational terrorism--one of the greatest current threats to our \nNation's security and to stability around the world. These rash acts \nharm the Nation and they harm the international standing of the United \nStates. Such actions may help the political fortunes of some in \nCongress, but they ignore the precedent of past Congresses where \ncriticisms of the President were put on hold during those periods when \nhe represents the United States in issues with other countries.\n  The national interest would not be served by a divided House \nmembership proceeding to punt this matter to the Senate while they \ncrossed their fingers and hoped for the Senate to bail them out of an \nill-considered finding. The national interest should not be hostage to \nmonths of meandering through an undefined partisan process that leads \ninexorably to impasse. A lengthy, partisan impeachment inquest would \nserve no national purpose but only lead to a year of balkanized \npolarization that would poison a generation of relationships across the \naisle in Congress and even across the Nation.\n  A fundamental lesson I learned as a practicing lawyer and that was \nreinforced when I served as the State's Attorney for Chittenden County, \nin my work as a U.S. Senator, as a member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and now as its ranking member, is that fairness in a process \nis critical to the result of that process. The process must be fair for \nthe American people to find it credible. If it is not fair, the \nAmerican people will not find it credible.\n  One measure of a prosecutor's fairness is fulfilling the duty to \ndisclose exculpatory evidence. That aspect of fairness has \nconstitutional implication in criminal matters. Now, weeks after the \nallegations have saturated the public media, we find buried in the \nthousands of pages of documents, transcripts and appendices that Ms. \nLewinsky, the principal witness upon whom Mr. Starr relies for his \ncharges, volunteered at the conclusion of her testimony before the \ngrand jury that ``no one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised \na job for my silence.'' Neither Mr. Starr, nor the lawyers working for \nhim, felt any duty of fairness to ask this critical question. It was \nleft to an anonymous juror who felt an obligation to the real issue at \nthe heart of this matter.\n  One measure of the credibility of the House's proceedings will be \nwhether it achieves the balance and fairness that so far has been \nlacking in the work of Mr. Starr's office.\n  An independent counsel does not have the checks and the \naccountability that enforce judgment and discretion in other \nprosecutors in this country. Wielding that enormous authority, \ntherefore, it is incumbent upon an independent counsel to discipline \nhimself with discretion and judgment. Unfortunately, in this matter, it \nis by this juncture quite clear that the report from Mr. Starr is an \nadvocate's brief, intended to persuade, rather than the balanced \npresentation that should be the hallmark of such a somber exercise.\n  And, again, this makes it all the more important that the House \nexercise independent judgment and provide the balance and fairness that \nis lacking from the work of a zealous band of prosecutors.\n  I am concerned that the same House that is charged with this awesome \nresponsibility is the body that is being asked to hold the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States in contempt for having sought to protect \nthe investigative process in connection with the ongoing campaign \nfinance investigation.\n  I participated in a lengthy meeting with Senator Hatch, Mr. Hyde, Mr. \nBurton, Mr. Waxman, and the Attorney General on this matter on \nSeptember 2. The Attorney General extensively consulted with us in a \nsincere effort to allow congressional oversight without compromising \nthe ongoing investigation. In spite of the efforts she\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\nmade to satisfy any legitimate congressional oversight interest, and \ndespite the lack of any basis to charge contemptuous conduct, the House \npersists in its efforts to pressure and sanction.\n  This effort and the lack of balance it signals do not bode well for \nthe House's other tasks.\n  I recall, as well, that it was not too many months ago in this same \nCongress that Republican leaders in the House were urging that \nimpeachment be used as a device to intimidate federal judges when they \nrendered decisions that a Republican Member did not like. Impeachment \nshould not be used as a partisan, ideological bludgeon in any context. \nThat is not the proper use of this important constitutional authority. \nSuch comments, at a minimum, complicate the task at hand.\n  Nor is it reassuring to read accounts of meetings, on the other side \nof the aisle, in this body, where partisan litmus tests on this matter \nare being applied to those chairing committees in the Senate.\n  There are few matters of such possible significance that may come \nbefore Congress as the matter of a President's fitness to serve.\n  The people of the United States elected William Jefferson Clinton to \nthe Presidency in 1992 and reelected him in 1996. He and the Vice \nPresident are the only people serving anywhere in the Nation in any \noffice who were elected by the entire country.\n  Under our Constitution, the Senate is charged with the ultimate \nresponsibility to act as the jury in connection with any charges that \nthe House were to deem worthy of impeachment.\n  Never in our history as a country has the Senate convicted a \nPresident of an impeachable offense. Only in the tumultuous times \nfollowing the Civil War has the Senate been through the ordeal of a \nPresidential impeachment trial.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to have been elected by the people of \nVermont to serve as their United States Senator. In our history, only \n20 other Vermonters have had the privilege to hold the seat I now have \nrepresenting our State. I am proud to serve as the ranking Democrat on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. I appreciate my limited role in the \nSenate and in our government. I cannot take lightly being asked to \njudge whether a President, elected by the people of the United States, \nought to be removed from office by an act of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Now, the search for blame is a practiced congressional skill. It \nalways bears fruit--sometimes bitter fruit. But the acceptance of our \nown solemn responsibility is more difficult. We must discharge our \nduties by serving the national interest, not by appealing to partisan \nor even public passions.\n  Let our actions not compound the Nation's anguish, harm the common \ngood, nor further shake the public's faith in our institutions of self-\ngovernment. These institutions have served this country well for over \n200 years, in accordance with our Constitution, which has been a \nguidepost for that time. Our Constitution has survived because good men \nand women have stood up when needed to make sure it survives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10873-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H.

Mr. President, can you tell me how much time is \navailable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Torricelli controls 30 minutes as a \nproponent of his amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. On Senator Torricelli's time, I yield myself as much \ntime as I need, which will probably be less than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the pending \namendment, offered by my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nTorricelli. The amendment, called the Quiet Communities Act, will \nreestablish the Environmental Protection Agency's appropriate role in \nnoise abatement.\n  This amendment simply reactivates an office in the EPA--the Office of \nNoise Abatement and Control--that was unfunded in 1981 at the request \nof the Reagan administration. The Office of Noise Abatement and Control \nwill coordinate Federal noise abatement activities, develop noise \nstandards, provide technical assistance to local communities, and \npromote research and education on the impacts of noise pollution.\n  This office will be a resource to the millions of Americans who are \naffected by noise pollution, and particularly aircraft noise.\n  Those of us who are in the New York-New Jersey region know only too \nwell what effect aircraft noise has on our communities. It is a serious \nproblem for populations across our country who are constantly harassed \nby airplane noise, truck noise, construction noise, and other noise, \nwhen they can never find peace in their own homes. In our region, with \nthe several airports we have operating--La Guardia and Kennedy and \nNewark, and others--it is a constant. We have to find ways to deal with \nit.\n  Just like air and water pollution, noise pollution is an \nenvironmental health issue. People who are tormented by noise pollution \nexperience a range of health problems, such as hearing loss, stress, \nhigh blood pressure, sleep deprivation, distraction, and lost \nproductivity. Aircraft noise is especially detrimental to human health.\n  Some studies indicate that persistent exposure to high levels of \naircraft noise is linked to hypertension, cardiovascular and \ngastrointestinal problems, among other disorders.\n  Noise pollution is particularly troublesome in parts of the State of \nNew Jersey.\n  New Jersey is the most densely populated State in the Nation, and \nmillions of New Jerseyans live close to major transportation centers \nthat generate significant levels of noise in their neighborhoods. For \nexample, aircraft approaching and departing from Newark International \nAirport are guided along flight paths routed over residential \nneighborhoods, patterns which disrupt families and disturb the \ncommunity's quality of life. Communities affected by aircraft noise \nhave been living with the pain for over 10 years and they must find \nrelief.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Aviation Administration, which is charged \nwith the responsibility of monitoring aircraft noise, has not \nadequately addressed the noise problems in New Jersey, and when \nattempted, its approach toward these problems is often flawed.\n  For example the FAA's current threshold of 65 decibels Day-Night \nLevel--or DNL--that the FAA indicates is compatible with residential \nuse is often criticized as problematic and, in the opinion of the \nNational Resources Defense Council, significantly underestimates the \nlevel at which many people are affected by aircraft noise.\n  The fact that this fundamental threshold is controversial and the \nscience behind it is disputed points to the fact that more research is \nneeded on these issues.\n  Mr. President, citizens living near airports have few resources at \ntheir disposal to find out more about the effects of air noise on their \nhealth and their environment.\n  The Office of Noise Abatement and Control used to be one resource, \nand it has been dormant for too long.\n  Simply put, Mr. President, noise pollution, and particularly aircraft \nnoise, is a serious environmental health issue that deserves attention \nfrom the primary Federal agency whose responsibility is environmental \nprotection--the EPA.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, that was not the view in 1981. But now \nwe have an opportunity to correct this mistake by adopting this \namendment.\n  Besides reactivating the Office of Noise Abatement and Control, the \nbill authorizes funding of $5 million a year for the first 2 years and \n$8 million a year for the subsequent years to fund Office's activities.\n  According to the National Institutes of Health, more than 20 million \nAmericans are exposed on a regular basis to\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\nhazardous noise levels that could result in hearing loss and other \npsychological and physiological damage. In my view, $5 million a year \nto address a problem affecting over 20 million Americans is a sound \ninvestment.\n  The bill also requires the Office of Noise Abatement and Control to \nproduce a study. The study must examine the FAA's selection of noise \nmeasurement methodologies, determine the threshold of noise at which \nhealth impacts are felt and determine the effectiveness of noise \nabatement programs at airports around the United States.\n  The EPA would then issue recommendations--recommendations, Mr. \nPresident, not directives--to the FAA on measures that will mitigate \nthe impact of air noise on affected communities. In my opinion, Mr. \nPresident, this study is long overdue, and particularly long overdue \nfor the millions of Americans who live every day with the nuisance of \naircraft noise in their lives.\n  Mr. President, back in 1990, I sponsored a provision in the Airport \nNoise and Capacity Act, that required all commercial airlines to \nconvert their fleets from Stage II to Stage III noise certification \nlevels, a quieter plane, by the year 2000. I am pleased to say that \nmany of the commercial airlines are ahead of their schedules and we \nhave seen positive benefits.\n  Research is continuing on even quieter aircraft, and we may soon see \nfleets that would satisfy Stage IV noise certification levels. However, \nas air travel increases, communities will experience more aircraft \nnoise. This issue will not go away. Indeed, if nothing is done, it will \nonly get worse.\n  Mr. President, this amendment simply reactivates a program in EPA \nthat has been dormant for too long, a program that addressed a serious \nenvironmental health issue, in the Federal agency that is responsible \nfor mitigating environmental health problems. This amendment makes \nsense, and will provide some element of relief for the millions of \nAmericans who face debilitating noise pollution, such as aircraft \npollution, every day.\n  Mr. President, we have a chance to do something about this at a \nfairly modest cost overall, and to say to those people, simply because \nthey live in an area that is crowded, that is a transportation center \nand so forth, that you shouldn't have to suffer a different way of \nlife, or a less pleasant way of life than other citizens across this \ncountry.\n  We do all kinds of things to mitigate against noise. We build highway \nnoise barriers and have all kinds of systems. We have police rules that \nsay you can't blow your horn unnecessarily--all kinds of programs that \nwould reduce the amount of noise pollution that we endure each and \nevery day.\n  I strongly support this amendment and urge my colleagues to think \nthrough what it means to their communities, to their States, and do the \nsame thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 12:10 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form for \ndebate on the pending Torricelli amendment prior to the motion to \ntable. I further ask that upon the expiration of time Senator McCain be \nrecognized to offer a motion to table the amendment. Finally, I ask \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just want to mention that I received \ninformation from Senator Chafee, chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, who feels very strongly that legislation of this \nnature should--and I agree with him--very appropriately go through the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. That is another reason why I \nhope my colleagues will support the motion to table at the appropriate \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, it is always painful to be against an \namendment by one of your colleagues, and particularly a friend. But I \nthink under the circumstances it is a little premature to go with this \nwhen the Environment Committee has asked that this come through their \ncommittee and not be offered on the floor. But attacking noise is a \ndifficult problem that requires a coordinated effort involving \nresearch, airport grant money, flight paths, and phaseout of noisy \naircraft.\n  The FAA has been successful in its efforts to reduce airplane noise. \nIn fact, the FAA has spent in the last few years $2 billion for sound \ninsulation and property purchase around our U.S. airports. And \nduplicating the expertise of the FAA within the EPA and costing the \ntaxpayers some $21 million would be wasteful, in my opinion, of \ngovernment resources. It would complicate and confuse efforts to deal \nwith and better understand community noise concerns. And it would, Mr. \nPresident, create a judicial ambiguity that could have real problems as \nwe reduce aircraft noise worldwide.\n  Since 1993, the Federal Interagency Committee on Aircraft Noise has \nworked successfully to advance cooperative noise research among the \nvarious Federal agencies with an interest in this area. The \nparticipants of this interagency committee on noise includes the \nNational Park Service; EPA is a part of this, FAA, NASA, HUD housing, \nDepartment of Defense, National Institutes of Health, and others. And \nthe participating agencies have and continue to address all of the \nresponsibilities envisioned in the Quiet Communities Act through their \ncooperative research work, and EPA is, has been, and will remain an \nactive participant in this process.\n  Mr. President, there is no need to change their current structure. I \nwant to reiterate:--There does not appear to be any substantive reason \nto expend $21 million and add needless jurisdictional confusion to the \nongoing efforts to deal effectively with community aircraft noise.\n  I go back to the struggle we had to eliminate Stage 2 aircraft \nengines. There were 4.5 million, as my friend from Arizona said, people \nthat were subjected to noise as it relates to aircraft. We have been \nquite successful. We have reduced that now by 90 percent. We are down \nto a mere 10 percent. And by January 1, 2000, all aircraft will have to \nbe Stage 3. So the noise is going to be reduced even further.\n  I understand the problems. But we have been working on it for some \ntime. I hope that our colleagues will leave the authority with FAA and \nlet them continue with all the groups in the Federal Government, such \nas NASA, Housing, Defense, National Institutes of Health, and EPA that \nare working together.\n  I am going to join with my friend in endorsing his motion to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, the proponent of this amendment, Senator Torricelli, \nwanted at least 2 minutes. I don't believe Senator McCain and I have \nany time left. I will suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be charged equally to both sides up to no more than 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote \non an amendment that I have offered with my colleague, Senator \nLautenberg. The amendment could not be simpler on its face or more \nmodest in its intent. We could have required an environmental impact \nstatement for every time the FAA changes a flight path. We did not do \nthat. We could have given the EPA the power to set standards for noise, \nfor health. Maybe we should have, but we did not do that.\n  All that we have asked is that, as with each of our other major \nindustrial competitors in the western world, noise be considered as a \nfactor in the operation of this Nation's airports. That is all. And on \ntwo bases. First, when the FAA establishes methodology to determine \nwhether or not particular noise involving airplanes is safe for \nschoolchildren or families or recreation, that methodology be evaluated \nby the EPA. That is all. They will not establish it. They will not make \nthe decisions. They\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\nwill evaluate whether the methodology is sound because scientific \nstudies are indicating our current methodology does not accurately \ngauge whether or not our children are safe.\n  Second, that the appropriate levels of what is safe be established. \nThere is also independent scientific evidence, as confirmed by European \nallies, that current levels may allow a level of noise pollution that \ndoes have detrimental health impacts. We would like the EPA's judgment \non what the appropriate levels might be. They will not make a decision. \nThey will offer their advice.\n  Mr. President, it is modest in its intent. It recognizes that noise \nis a real part of their lives for 40 million Americans every day of \nthis expansion of our air networks. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very appreciative of and I believe \nsympathetic to the concerns of the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nTorricelli. There are very large noise issues in his State and in \nStates surrounding his. I just think it is important for us to \nrecognize that noise levels have decreased by some 80 percent around \nAmerica. We are moving to Stage 3 aircraft. We do not need to \nreestablish another bureaucracy. I am confident in the FAA in that the \nprovisions of the 1990 act, which Senator Ford was responsible for, are \nbeing carried out in an accelerated fashion. I pledge to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey that if there is not continued progress, I would be \nmore than happy to revisit this issue with him.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time. I move to table the \nTorricelli amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto table the amendment, No. 3627, offered by the Senator from New \nJersey. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), and the Senator from \nIllinois (Ms. Moseley-Braun) are necessarily absent.

We have about \ntwo or three amendments left, on which I believe we will be able to set \ntimes for debate, and we will have votes on those amendments before 6 \no'clock this evening, when the Senate will recess for the evening.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for their assistance in narrowing down \nwhat looks like about 30 or 40 amendments to 2 or 3. There are a couple \nof recalcitrant, obstinate Members who will shortly show up on the \nfloor, but the rest we thank very much.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, as we go through \nthese amendments that we have worked out, with the Senator's agreement, \nas amendments on my side come, I will offer those and get them done so \nwe can move on when we come to 6 o'clock tonight and try to get a final \nvote on this piece of legislation so that we will not be kept here \nafter 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I made a comment in jest, and I want to \nmake sure the Record is clear that it was in jest. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota, as well as the Senator from Rhode Island, who are waiting \nto address these very serious issues. I have discussed, on several \noccasions, the situation that existed in North Dakota. When there was a \nNorthwest Airlines strike, his State was, for all intents and purposes, \nshut down. The Senator from North Dakota has been an important member \nof our committee and a serious student and expert on these aviation \nissues. I certainly was not in any way making light of his involvement \nor that of the Senator from Rhode Island in these aviation issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, do we have Senators who want \nto offer amendments?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Kentucky if we can let him speak \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. That will be fine, since we don't have a Senator on the \nfloor wanting to offer an amendment right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10875-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10877-S10879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to announce an agreement between \nthe White House and supporters of the American Competitiveness Act \nwhich I hope and expect will insure passage and implementation of \nlegislation to safeguard the competitive edge of American business.\n  Mr. President, the American Competitiveness Act was designed to \naddress a growing shortage of skilled workers for certain high \ntechnology positions important to American business.\n  This shortage threatens all sectors of our economy. Economist Larry \nKudlow reports that high technology companies account for about one \nthird of real economic growth. Overall, electronic commerce is expected \nto grow to $80 billion by the year 2000.\n  But high technology firms are running into serious worker shortages.\n  A study conducted by Virginia Tech estimates that right now we have \nmore than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled information \ntechnology workers.\n  And, while Department of Labor figures project our economy will \nproduce more than 1.3 million information technology jobs over the next \n10 years, our universities will not produce the graduates needed to \nfill those positions.\n  In fact, it is estimated that the shortfall will be very, very \nsubstantial. If they are to keep their major operations in America, \nfirms must find workers with the skills needed to fill important \npositions in their companies. This requires that we do more as a nation \nto encourage our young people to choose high-technology fields for \nstudy and for their careers. In the long term this is the only way we \ncan stay competitive and protect American jobs.\n  As I said, the shortfalls clearly demonstrate the need for us to grow \nmore talent here at home. In fact, you need\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\nonly look at the high-tech companies that are feeling this shortage. \nWhen I visit manufacturing companies in my State, they indicate that \nthey are having increasing trouble finding sufficient information \ntechnology workers to meet their needs. This is because so many of our \nindustries are now, in one form or another, dependent on technology \njobs. For the long term, the solution clearly must rest here at home, \nwith American workers being trained to fill these jobs, with college \nstudents being given incentives to study in the areas where the next \ncentury's job creation will take place.\n  However, over the short term, until we are producing more qualified \nhigh technology graduates we must do more to fill the gap between high \ntechnology needs and high technology skills.\n  This has required that we allow companies to hire a limited number of \nhighly skilled workers from overseas to fill essential roles. To do \nthis they must go through a fairly onerous process to get one of the \n65,000 ``H-1B'' temporary worker visas allotted by the INS.\n  Mr. President, in the history of this program, that 65,000 limit was \nnever breached until last year when we hit the 65,000 annual limit at \nthe end of August. The limit was hit this year in May. It is projected \nthat if we do not change the limit, it will be hit next year as early \nas February. What that means, in short, as so many of my colleagues \nknow, is that since May of this year not one American company, \nregardless of the emergency circumstances and the needs, has been able \nto bring in a highly skilled foreign worker to fill a job slot. As a \nconsequence of that, we have lost opportunities and economic growth is \npaying a price.\n  This is dangerous for our economy. And that is why my American \nCompetitiveness Act, in addition to providing significant incentives \nfor Americans to enter the high technology sector, will add a limited \nnumber of additional H-1B visas so companies can find the workers they \nneed to keep facilities and jobs in the United States, and keep our \nhigh-tech industry competitive in the global marketplace.\n  Let me be specific, Mr. President. In the absence of an increase in \nthese numbers, if we can't find the people to fill the jobs here in \nthis country, what is going to happen is American companies are going \nto shift operations overseas, and that means not only the loss of the \nparticular job which an H-1B worker might fill, but it means the loss \nof other jobs in the division of the company where the H-1B position is \nvacant.\n  Let me just quickly outline the compromise agreement reached by the \nWhite House with our office.\n  First, the bill provides increased access to skilled personnel for \nAmerican companies and universities. It will do this by increasing the \nnumber of H-1B temporary worker visas from 65,000 now to 115,000 in \nfiscal year 1999, 115,000 in fiscal year 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal \nyear 2001. The visa limit will then return to 65,000 in the year 2002.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the bill provides new funding for college \nscholarships and job training for American workers.\n  10,000 scholarships per year will be provided to low income students \nin math, engineering and computer science through the National Science \nFoundation, with training provided through the Jobs Partnership Act.\n  This program will be funded by a $500 fee per visa petition and a \n$500 fee for visa renewals, which combined will raise an estimated $75 \nmillion each year.\n  Further, Mr. President, this legislation provides three types of \nlayoff protection for American workers.\n  Let me add that throughout the process of working on this \nlegislation, we have been very mindful of the concerns people have that \nsomehow these H-1B temporary workers might end up filling a position \nwhere an American worker could have filled the slot. Our goal is to \nmake sure that does not happen, and we have built protections into this \nagreement which we and the administration feel will accomplish that \nobjective.\n  First, any company with 15% or more of its workforce in the United \nStates on H-1B visas must attest that it will not lay off an American \nemployee in the same job 90 days or less before or after the filing of \na petition for an H-1B professional.\n  Second, an H-1B dependent company acting as a contractor must attest \nthat it also will not place an H-1B professional in another company to \nfill the same job held by a laid off American 90 days before or after \nthe date of placement.\n  Third, any employer, whether H-1B dependent or not, will face severe \npenalties for committing a willful violation of H-1B rules, underpaying \nan individual on an H-1B visa and replacing an American worker. That \ncompany will be debarred for 3 years from all employment immigration \nprograms and fined $35,000 for each violation. Penalties for other \nviolations also will be substantially increased.\n  In addition, Mr. President, H-1B dependent companies must attest that \nthey recruit according to industry-wide standards and that the H-1B-\nholding individual was as, or more, qualified than any American job \napplicant. An American not hired can file a complaint with an \narbitration panel, which can fine employers violating this provision.\n  Penalties and enforcement will be increased from those under current \nlaw.\n  The Department of Labor will be given authority to investigate \nsuspected willful and serious violations of H-1B visas if it receives \nspecific and credible evidence of such violations and receives the \npersonal sign-off of the Secretary of Labor.\n  The purpose of this authority is to respond to situations of \npotentially egregious wrongdoing where a complaint had not been filed. \nThis new authority sunsets with the increase in the visas, which will \ngive Congress the opportunity for close scrutiny of whether or not DOL \nacts responsibly.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation eliminates any financial \nincentive for companies to hire under-compensated foreign temporary \nworkers by permanently reforming the prevailing wage attestation that \nis required prior to the hiring of anyone under the H-1B program.\n  Under this legislation, employers must offer benefits and the \nopportunity to earn bonuses to H-1B employees if those benefits and \nbonuses are available to that company's similarly-employed American \nworkers.\n  In short, it will not be possible to bring in a foreign worker under \nthe H-1B program to fill a job where that person is not being paid the \nprevailing wage inclusive of potential benefits and other forms of \ncompensation.\n  In addition, this legislation provides sanctions for violations of \nnew whistleblower protections and contains provisions against \nunconscionable contracts and against so-called benching.\n  I am convinced, Mr. President, that this legislation is crucial to \nmaintaining American economic competitiveness and to protect American \njobs.\n  It will increase the skills and employability of American workers \nwhile making certain that no qualified American worker is replaced by \nany immigrant worker.\n  It gives our high technology companies the tools they need to compete \nin world markets without sacrificing in any way the economic \nopportunities and well-being of American workers. Indeed, by keeping \nAmerica competitive it will increase economic growth and the ability of \nall Americans to achieve and maintain economic security and \nprosperity. And as we move this bill through the final process--first, \nof course, in the House and then hopefully here soon--I will be urging \nmy colleagues to support the legislation.\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me just summarize as follows: We have \na serious crisis confronting our high-tech industries. We need to have \nmore skilled workers on a longer-term basis. We need the scholarship \nand job training programs contained in this legislation to achieve the \ntechnology worker goals that we have set, but until those programs are \nadequate to meet the demand, we need to fill the gaps that exist today.\n  This legislation will increase on a temporary basis the number of \ntemporary workers who can come to this country which will help us meet \nthat challenge. In short, it will allow us to keep the economy going \nand at the same time prepare us for the future. Most importantly, it \nwill protect American workers so that this program\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\ncannot be exploited in any fashion that would cause somebody to lose a \njob or lose the chance to be hired for a job because a foreign worker \nwas being selected for that assignment.\n  So there are safeguards for workers. There are the long-range \neducation and job training components and there is the temporary \nincrease in the number of workers who can come into this country to \nmeet the immediate crisis. It is a balanced approach. It is one that, I \nthink, deserves our support.\n  In closing, let me say thanks to those in the administration with \nwhom we have been working. But also I would like to thank a number of \nour colleagues who have worked with me throughout this process, \nincluding Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Senator \nGorton, who has had a special interest in this for a variety of reasons \nrelating to his interest in high-tech companies; the majority leader, \nwho has been very supportive; Senator Phil Gramm, who worked with me on \na number of the negotiations; Senator Lieberman, who played a very \nactive role throughout the process, both here in the Senate and in the \nrecent deliberations; Senator Bob Graham, who was an early and active \nsupporter of this effort; and especially to the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee who worked with me as we moved this legislation \nforward, both here in the Senate and in the intervening timeframes. \nSenator McCain, whose commitment to this type of an approach of making \nsure on a variety of fronts that America is ready to enter the digital \nage and the digital economy, has given the kind of leadership I think \nwe all admire. I thank him especially for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me say that what the Senator from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham, has described today is a signal event. I \nrecently visited Silicon Valley, which politicians seem to be doing \nmore and more of nowadays. I was told that there were two major \npriorities that they felt were critical to the future of their \nindustry. One was this, what we know now as the H-1B visa bill, and the \nother is the Internet tax freedom bill.\n  Senator Abraham took an issue, which very few believed we could, and \nturned it into reality. He worked with both sides of the aisle, with \nthe White House, and with the Silicon Valley folks, as well as labor. I \nbelieve that he has come up with a remarkable package, a remarkable \nproduct, which will allow us to maintain the incredible high-tech lead \nwe have in the world. Without the ability to have trained, qualified \nand educated people in this industry, obviously we cannot have as \npredictable a future as we would like.\n  A part of this bill, Mr. President, will be the National Science \nFoundation Scholarship Program for Science and Math. At the appropriate \ntime, I will offer language to name these scholarships the ``Spencer \nAbraham Scholarship Program.''\n  Again, I congratulate Senator Abraham, because what he has achieved \nin this time of labeling the Congress as a ``do-nothing Congress,'' \nvery frankly, is the best example of working on both sides of the aisle \nand with the administration for the good of the Nation. I hope that \nmany of the rest of us, including this Senator, will follow his \nexample.\n  I also hope we will be able to take up the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nso that we can also get that legislation passed before we leave.\n  I note the presence of Senator Dorgan on the floor. I thank him for \nhis patience. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have indicated that I will offer two amendments to this \npiece of legislation. This would be the first. I intend, however, not \nto seek a vote on this amendment. I intend to ask unanimous consent \nthat it be withdrawn. I am offering it for this reason. This \nlegislation provides tax credits under certain circumstances. I \nrecognize that it would cause a blue slip on this bill because this tax \nlegislation must originate in the House of Representatives. I do not \nintend or want to cause that kind of problem for this bill, but I \nbelieve very strongly that this amendment is part of the solution to a \nvery large problem we have, and I introduce it today for the purpose of \ndescribing to my colleagues an approach that I would intend to offer to \nsome future tax legislation that will be considered by the Senate and \nthe House.\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the subcommittee--excuse me, chairman \nof the full committee--I have demoted him--the chairman of the full \ncommittee, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Ford, have \nbrought a bill to the floor of the Senate that is very important.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2  . DISCRETIONARY GRANTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any limitation on the amount of funds that \n     may be expended for grants for noise abatement, if any funds \n     made available under section 48103 of title 49, United States \n     Code, remain available at the end of the fiscal year for \n     which those funds were made available, and are not allocated \n     under section 47115 of that title, or under any other \n     provision relating to the awarding of discretionary grants \n     from unobligated funds made available under section 48103 of \n     that title, the Secretary of Transportation may use those \n     funds to make discretionary grants for noise abatement \n     activities.\n\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is a very straightforward attempt to find \nadditional resources to help neighborhoods that surround airports and \nare confronting the problem of airport noise. My State of Rhode Island \nis home to one of the fastest growing airports in the country, T.F. \nGreen Airport. Indeed, over the past two years,\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\nT.F. Green has seen roughly an annual increase of 55 percent in \npassenger traffic. This is compared to a national average increase of 4 \npercent a year. So you can well appreciate that the impact of \nadditional flights coming in has caused severe noise problems around \nthe airport.\n  This has been a source of great strength, the growth of T.F. Green, \nin terms of our economy; it has brought visitors; it has become a \ngateway to New England. It has created jobs. All of these are extremely \npositive. But it has also generated increased noise with increased \nnumbers of flights. The Rhode Island Airport Corporation, the city of \nWarwick, and community groups are working together. We have been \nsuccessful in securing grants from the FAA for noise abatement. But I \nthink we have to do much more to ensure that all the homes that need \nsoundproofing with all of the techniques that we can use to mitigate \nand minimize noise are effectively employed to assist the people of \nRhode Island.\n  I am very pleased with what has already been done in this \nlegislation. Both Senator McCain and Senator Ford have taken a very \nstrong, positive step to ensure that we are sensitive to the noise \nproblem at airports. This legislation includes a set-aside for noise \nabatement of approximately 35 percent rather than the 31 percent in the \nbill that has been passed by the other body. This is a very, very \npositive development, but I think we can do more. I would also be very \nsupportive of Senator McCain and Senator Ford's efforts to maintain \nthat 35 percent set-aside.\n  What my amendment does is simply lift the existing cap on the total \namount of funds that the FAA may spend on noise abatement when the FAA \ndistributes unexpended funds at the end of a fiscal year. This, we \nhope, would allow for additional resources to be devoted towards noise \nabatement. It would be consistent with and within the confines and \nframework of the existing appropriations bills. It is a modest, but I \nthink very important step forward to help address the problem of noise \naround airports.\n  I, indeed, am very pleased that Senator McCain and Senator Ford have \ntaken such a strong step in this bill to protect airport neighborhoods \nfrom the increased level of noise.\n  With this, I urge passage of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). If there is no further debate, \nwithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The Amendment (No. 3629) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator, and I particularly thank Senator \nDorgan for allowing us to move this amendment along.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3628\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I was saying, the amendment that I have \noffered to the FAA bill is an amendment that is very important to the \ncountry and especially to my region of the country. Just before I \nyielded the floor, I was talking about the leadership of Senator McCain \nand Senator Ford. I think they have both done a wonderful job with this \npiece of legislation. It is an important piece of legislation for the \ncountry's sake, and it now appears that we will get this through the \nSenate and probably be completed with the legislation today, and that \nwill be in no small measure due to their tenacity and their skill at \ncrafting and moving this piece of legislation.\n  Let me describe what I intend to do with this amendment, and I will \nnot talk about the second amendment which I intend to offer later today \nand hope that that will be approved by the Senate.\n  In late August, Northwest Airlines had a pilot strike and therefore a \nshutdown of their airline service. That might not have meant much to \nsome. In some airports, I assume Northwest was one of a number of \ncarriers that was serving certain airports and serving passengers. But \nin North Dakota, the State which I represent, Northwest Airlines was \nthe only airline providing jet service to my State. That is a very \ndifferent picture than the last time we had an airline strike, which \nwas over 25 years ago.\n  Nearly a quarter of a century ago when Northwest had another strike \nand a shutdown prior to deregulation of the airlines, we had five \ndifferent airline companies flying jets into the State of North \nDakota--five different jet carriers in North Dakota. And then we had \nfolks in Congress saying, you know what we really need to do to foster \ncompetition? We need to deregulate the airline industry. And so we \nderegulated the airline industry. I wasn't here at the time. But we \nderegulated them and we went from five jet carriers in North Dakota to \none.\n  So I am thinking to myself, all those folks who are choking on the \nword ``competition,'' we need to deregulate so we stimulate more \ncompetition, where are they now so they can really choke on the word \n``competition''? We have much less competition in airlines today, much \nless competition with a couple of exceptions.\n  If you live in Chicago and you are flying to New York or Los Angeles, \nGod bless you, because you are going to have a lot of carriers to \nchoose from and you are going to find very inexpensive ticket prices, \nand you can make a choice of carriers and ticket prices that are very \nattractive to you. You live in a city with millions and millions of \npeople and you want to fly to another city with millions and millions \nof people. Guess what. This is not an awfully big deal for you; more \nchoices and low fares. But you get beyond those cities and ask how has \nthis airline deregulation affected other Americans, and what you will \nfind is less selection, fewer choices, and higher prices.\n\n  North Dakota is just one example, but the most striking example--one \nairline with jet service. And on that night at midnight, when the \nstrike was called and the airline shut down, just like that, an entire \nState lost all of its jet service.\n  What does that mean to a State? It begins to choke the economy very \nquickly. People can't move in and out. North Dakota is a sparsely \npopulated State, 640,000 people. Up in the northern tier, we are 10 \ntimes the size of Massachusetts in land mass--big State, 640,000 \npeople, and one airline serving with jets.\n  Now, I happen to think Northwest is a good carrier. I believe the \nsame about all the major carriers. Most of them are well-run, good \ncompanies; they went through tough times, now are doing better, and I \nadmire them.\n  What I do not admire is what they have done--retreating into regional \nmonopolies in this country, retreating into hub and spoke so that they \ncontrol the hub.\n  You go to any big area in this country and take a look at what they \ndo. The major carriers have retreated so that they now, one company, \nwill control 60 or 70 or 80 percent of all the gates at that airport. \nThey control that hub. Do you think anybody is going to come in and \ntake them on, anybody is going to come in and compete aggressively and \nsay, ``Boy, this is a free market; we are going to go into your hub and \nwe are going to compete against you?'' This is not happening. They cut \nthe pie, created the slices, retreated into their little slices, and \nthere is no competition. We now have regional monopolies without any \nregulation.\n\n  What sense does that make, to have monopolies without regulation? The \nminute I say ``regulation,'' we have people here having apoplectic \nseizures on the floor of the Senate. Oh, Lord, we should talk about \nregulation? I am not standing here today talking about regulation \nbecause I want to reregulate the airlines. All I want to do is see if \nwe can provide some sort of industrial-strength vitamin B-12 shot right \nin the rump of those airlines to see if we cannot get them competing \nagain. How do we do that? We do it by creating the conditions that \nrequire competition. This amendment is one.\n  Let us assume there is somebody out there who says, ``You know what I \nwould like to do, I would like to run an airline. I have the money, I \nhave the energy, I have the time, I have the skill. I want to create a \nregional airline, and I want to fly in an area where\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\nnobody else is flying a jet, and I want to haul people to a major \nhub.''\n  They create their airline and fly to a major hub and they drop \nsomebody off. And guess what. That somebody in most cases is going \nbeyond that hub.\n  Let me give an example, of Bismarck going to Denver, which is a major \nhub. For 35 years, we had jet service with Frontier Airlines and then \nContinental, from Bismarck, ND, to Denver, a major hub. Now we do not. \nSo a new company comes in and says, ``I will connect Bismarck to \nDenver, a major hub.'' But about 70 percent of the people leaving \nBismarck are not going to just Denver, they are going beyond, to Los \nAngeles, San Francisco, Phoenix--you name it.\n  So this airline carrier starts up and hauls the Bismarck passengers \nto Denver and opens the door of the airplane, and they disembark on a \nsunny Denver day and discover they cannot go anywhere else, because if \nthey walk over to United or another carrier, they don't have the \nopportunity to get a joint fare ticket. They charge them an arm and a \nleg. In fact, they even have trouble getting their baggage moved from \none airline to another, because the big airlines do not want \ncompetition. They have their hub, they don't want anybody messing with \nit, and they certainly do not want these upstart regional airlines \nspringing up, hauling people into their hub.\n  So what you have is a circumstance where there is deregulation of the \nairlines, and the major carriers have merged. There has been all this \nromance going on; they decided they like each other a lot. Pretty soon \nthey are going to get married. They merge up, two airlines become one, \nand now we have five or six large airlines in this country because they \nlike each other so much, and they have retreated into these regional \nmonopolies because they don't want to compete with each other. They \ncreate their own hub and they create their own spokes and they say to \nthose who want to start up, ``We are sorry but we are not interested.''\n  Having said all that, and that is a mouthful, and having said I \nadmire the majors--most of them are good carriers and they have good \nmanagement and they do what they do in their interest--there is their \ninterest and then there is a parallel and sometimes not parallel public \ninterest. In some cases it is not a parallel public interest, as the \ncase where we have areas that used to be served and are now not served \nbut could be served by a new carrier if only the majors would cooperate \nwith those new carriers.\n  In order to encourage new startup regional jet service, I am \nproposing a 10 percent investment tax credit for regional jet \npurchases. That is, those startup companies that want to begin regional \njet service to fly these new regional jets between certain cities and \nhubs that are not now served with regional jet service, we would say to \nthem that we will help with a 10 percent investment tax credit on the \npurchase or lease of those regional jets. We will help because we want \nto provide incentives for the establishment of regional jet service \nonce again in our country.\n  My legislation would require that they serve those markets for a \nminimum of 5 years. We have defined exactly what those underserved \nmarkets are. It is targeted, it makes good sense, and will stimulate \ninvestment in an activity that this country very much needs and an \nactivity that the so-called free market now does not accommodate, \nbecause the free market is clogged. There is kind of an airline \ncholesterol here that clogs up the arteries, and they say, ``This is \nthe way we work, these are our hubs, these are our spokes, and you \ncannot mess with them.''\n  My legislation simply says we would like to encourage areas that no \nlonger have jet service but could support it. We would like to \nencourage companies that decide they want to come in and serve there to \nbe able to purchase the regional jets and be able to initiate that kind \nof service.\n\n  My legislation has a second provision which reduces the airline \nticket tax for certain qualified flights in rural America. This \nproposal also has a revenue offset so it would not be a net loser for \nthe Federal budget.\n  Having described all that, the second amendment I am going to offer \nalso addresses this in a different way. My hope is we could work to get \nthat accepted. We have been working hard with a number of Members of \nthe Senate to see if we cannot get that accepted.\n  I just want to make two more points.\n  We are not in a situation in rural areas of this country where we can \njust sit back and say what is going to happen to us is going to happen \nto us and there is nothing we can do about it. There are some, I \nsuppose, who sit around and wring their hands and gnash their teeth and \nfret and sweat and say, ``I really cannot alter things very much, this \nis the way it is.''\n  The way it is is not satisfactory to the people of my State. It is \nnot satisfactory to have only one jet carrier serving our entire State. \nOur State's transportation services and airline service, especially jet \nairline service, is an essential transportation service. It ought not \nbe held hostage by labor problems or other problems of one jet carrier. \nWe must have competition. If all of those in this Chamber who mean what \nthey say when they talk about competition will weigh in here and say, \n``Let's stand for competition, let's stand for the free market, let's \ntry to help new starts, let's breed opportunities for broader based \neconomic ownership and more competition in the airline industry,'' then \nI think we will have done something important and useful and good for \nStates like mine and for many other rural States in this country.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated when I started, I will offer my second \namendment later this afternoon, which I hope will be accepted, because \nthe amendment I have just described and offered has a blue slip \nattached to it in the sense it would be objected to, because a revenue \nmeasure must begin in the Ways and Means Committee of the House of \nRepresentatives--and I used to serve in the House and used to serve on \nthe Ways and Means Committee, and we were fierce in our determination \nto make certain that committee always had original jurisdiction on \nthose issues. I am willing to say I understand that. But I wanted my \ncolleagues to be able to review this amendment in the Record, because \nif and when there is a piece of legislation dealing with tax issues \nlater this year, it is my intention to see that this becomes part of \nthat discussion.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent my amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3628) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10879-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10881-S10883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE FAMILY FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are going to conference, I think, this \nafternoon or tomorrow on the agriculture appropriations bill. I want to \nmake some comments so that those in this Chamber who believe what some \nare proposing to go to conference with is adequate will understand it \nis not adequate at all.\n  We have a farm crisis in our country that is as significant a crisis \nas we have had since perhaps the 1930s. As you know, farm prices have \ncollapsed. The price of wheat has dropped nearly 60 percent. We have \nfarmers facing a serious, serious problem, many of whom will not be \nable to continue farming next year.\n  That means that yard light someplace out in the country is going out, \nthat family farm is losing their money, their farm, their hope, their \ndreams. This Congress has the capability to do something about it or it \nhas the capability to ignore it.\n  We have had two votes here in the Senate to increase price supports \nto give family farmers some hope. Twice we have been turned back. We \nare going to have a third vote. I am not sure when that is going to \nhappen. As soon as we have the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\noffer the emergency plan sent down by the President on Monday of this \nweek, we are going to have another vote. We have only lost by a handful \nof votes.\n  The future of a lot of farm families will depend on that next vote. \nSome have offered an alternative plan in recent days. I am told they \nintend to put that in the agriculture appropriations conference in the \nnext day or so. I would say to them, it is not going to work. It is not \nenough. It is offering a 4-foot rope to somebody drowning in 10 feet of \nwater. ``Well, thanks for the rope, but it doesn't help.''\n  This Congress has to decide that it is going to help family farmers \nwhen prices collapse. If it does not build a bridge over price valleys, \nwe will not have family farmers left.\n  I have a letter from a young boy named Wyatt that I mentioned the \nother day on the floor of the Senate. Wyatt is 15-years old, a \nsophomore at Stanley High School in Stanley, ND. He comes from a family \nfarm. Wyatt said, after a long description of the problems his family \nis having, ``My dad is a family farmer. And my dad can feed 180 people, \nbut he can't feed his family.'' It just breaks your heart to get \nletters like Wyatt's, and so many others, who write to us talking about \nwhat happens to them when prices collapse.\n  Our farmers in North Dakota lost 98 percent of their net farm income \nin 1 year. Washed away was 98 percent of their income--gone. Just have \nany neighborhood, any block, any community, any group of people think \nto themselves, ``Where would I be if I lost 98 percent of my income?'' \nI know where I would be. I bet I know where you would be. That is what \nfarmers are facing right now in my State and all up and down the farm \nbelt.\n  People seem to think, ``You know, things will be just fine. Food \ncomes from the store. Butter comes from a carton. Milk comes from a \nbottle.'' Things will not be just fine if this country loses its family \nfarms and America's farmers to big agrifactories from California to \nMaine. I will tell you what will happen to food costs.\n  The way you get good, wholesome, safe food--the best in the world, at \nthe best possible price--is to have a network of family farmers farming \nthis country and putting food on our tables, at a price that gives them \na decent opportunity to earn a living.\n  We have had this kind of economic circumstance in our country \nrecently where I guess the farm belt is viewed as one giant economic \ncow. Nobody is willing to feed it, but everybody wants to milk it from \nevery single direction. Well, the cow is about out of milk. The \nquestion for this Congress is: Are you going to step up, when you pass \na farm bill that says, ``Let's have farmers operate in the free \nmarket,'' but then in every direction the farmer turns, there is no \nfree market?\n  Want to market some cows? Guess what? Eighty-five percent of the \ncattle slaughtered in this country is done by four firms--four. They \nwill tell a family farmer what they are going to pay them. If they do \nnot like it, tough luck.\n  Want to ship your wheat on a train? Well, there is one train that \ncomes through our State to haul that wheat. They will tell the farmer \nwhat they are going to charge them. If the farmer does not like it, \ntough luck.\n  Let me give you a little example about what farmers face on \ntransportation. Ship a carload of wheat from Bismarck, ND, to \nMinneapolis; the railroad says that is $2,300--that is what it is going \nto cost you to ship that wheat to Minneapolis. Ship the same wheat from \nMinneapolis to Chicago--about the same distance--the railroad says that \nis $1,000. So you ask the railroad, ``Why do you double-charge North \nDakota farmers?'' The answer is because there is competition between \nMinneapolis and Chicago and there is none in North Dakota. So the \nrailroad says, ``We're able to double-charge farmers in North Dakota.''\n  So send a cow to market; you face a monopoly. Take your grain to the \nrailroad; you face a monopoly and get double-charged. Send a hog to \nmarket; the same thing. Send your grain to a flour mill; the same \nthing. And 50, 60, 70 percent of the milling, the slaughter, the \ntransportation--all controlled by a couple big corporations that then \ntell family farmers, ``Yeah, you worked hard, you plowed this soil in \nthe spring, you planted the seed, you nurtured it, you put some \nchemicals on it to keep the bugs away and the weeds out, put some \nnitrogen in to make it grow, and then you harvested it--and, by the \nway, when you are done, we're going to pay you half of what it's worth \nand half of what it cost you to produce. And if you don't like it, \ntough luck.'' Well, that does not work for this country. That is not \nthe way this country's economy should be allowed to work. It is not a \nfree market.\n  So let's assume a farmer would be able to find a benevolent \nrailroad--that is, of course, an oxymoron. Let's assume the farmer was \nable to market up through a cattle market that was not controlled by \nmonopolies. Let's assume all of that worked--it does not--but let's \nassume it all did. The only thing left that farmer would face is a \nseries of other countries, like Europe. The farmer then finds half of \nhis grain, or her grain, goes overseas to a foreign market where they \ncompete with other governments that subsidize the sale of their grain \ninto northern African markets and other places to the tune of 10 times \nthe United States.\n  People here say to farmers, ``Well, go compete in the free market.'' \nYes, the farmer should compete against the big grain companies, against \nthe big chemical companies, against the big railroads, against the big \npacking plants, and against European countries, and against the \nCanadians. And if all of that were settled--if all of that were \nsettled--those farmers would still be told, ``Just compete in the free \nmarket. And here's one more piece of the free market. We've signed you \nup for some competition with a trade agreement that we've negotiated \nwith Canada.'' And my colleagues have heard me speak about this many \ntimes. That trade agreement says to the Canadians, ``You just flood us \nwith your grain and your cattle and your hogs. You just run them over, \njust bring them right on down. And we can't get our grain up, but you \njust keep bringing your grain down here, undercut our price.'' That is \nthe kind of trade agreement we negotiated. We send incompetent \nnegotiators to negotiate bad agreements, and then we do not even \nenforce them.\n  We had farmers gather at the Canadian border the other day. The \nCanadians are good neighbors of ours, have been for a long while, but \nthe trade agreement with Canada is unfair and taking money right out of \nthe pockets of our farmers. And we have trade officials who do not seem \nto want to do much about it.\n  So every direction you turn, we have these problems that press in on \nour family farmers. We face the prospect of up to 20 percent of our \nfamily farmers in North Dakota not being able to plant in the next \nspring or the spring thereafter. You fly over my State and look out at \nnight from a small plane, look out that window and look at those yard \nlights that shine down on a family trying to make a living out on the \nland; and then see them turn off, one by one, because public policy \nsays to them, ``You don't matter anymore. This country doesn't need you \nanymore.'' Ask yourself whether this country is going to be a better or \na weaker country when family farmers are gone.\n  They are talking about bringing the endangered species bill to the \nfloor of the Senate soon. I am thinking of enlisting family farmers. I \nknow it will list birds and butterflies, frogs, and flowers. I am the \nfirst one to say I like birds, I like butterflies, and sign me up for \nfrogs and flowers, as well. I think they are good for our environment \nand good to have around.\n\n  However, another endangered species in this country is Wyatt. He is a \nyoung boy that comes from a family that will lose their farm, and there \nwon't be another family like Wyatt's out there. There is only one \nfamily like Wyatt's. Does it matter if Wyatt and his folks and tens of \nthousands of others are told, ``You are too small an operator, you \ndon't matter.''\n  I think this country will make a huge mistake. The reason I wanted to \nspeak for a moment now is we are fixing--I think tomorrow--to take a \npathetic little plan that has been offered that will maybe pole-vault \nsome farmers between now and December, just over the next election, but \nwon't do nearly enough to get those family farmers into the field next \nspring and give them some hope that they can get a harvest next fall. \nIt is a pathetic little plan. It will be offered, perhaps, in\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\nthe agriculture appropriations conference tomorrow, and then people \nwill wash their hands and say, ``We sure took care of that.''\n  No, they won't have taken care of anything. All they will have done \nis nudged enough resources out of the scarce pot of money to get them \nfrom here to December, to be able to say to farmers here is a little, \nbut it is not enough. We understand you won't make it.\n  There are some of us in this Chamber who are not willing to stand for \nthat and are not willing to let that be the last word on the fight for \nthe family farmers' future in the 105th Congress. I don't mean to sound \nchallenging--yes, I do, now that I think about it. Of course I do. It \nis unforgivable in my judgment when we have people coming to the floor \nof the Senate and the House and there are hundreds of millions of \ndollars here and billions of dollars there and they have appetites for \neverything and everything is important, for us to go home and decide it \nis not important to save family farmers. I do want to challenge that.\n  In my judgment, that is a goofy set of priorities for this country. \nThomas Jefferson said 200 years ago that those who live on that land \nand produce that food are the best Americans, the first Americans. He \nwasn't necessarily saying that nobody else is any good, I am sure. \nThomas Jefferson believed in everyone's worth and he believed in broad-\nbased economic ownership. Part of what makes this country so strong is \nthe opportunities for people around the country to engage in broad-\nbased ownership of America's economy and resources. No one represents \nthat more than families living on the farm trying to make a decent \nliving.\n  I hope in the next 2 weeks we will have the opportunity to convince \nthe leadership of this Congress that family farmers matter and the \nsubmission on Monday by President Clinton of an emergency plan to \nrespond to this farm crisis is the right step for this Congress to \ntake. If Congress does not stand for family farmers, if it fails to \ntake the step the President has requested, if it decides that this \ndoesn't matter somehow, then we will have made a very fatal error.\n  The Senator from Kentucky stood on this floor month after month this \nyear in very tough circumstances when we were debating the tobacco \nbill. He said he understood the public policy issues of tobacco, but he \nsaid I want the Congress to understand the public policy issues of \nfamily farmers out there raising tobacco, as well. Their interests need \nto be heard. I know he did that and I watched the passion with which he \ndid that. He feels very strongly about the interests of those family \nfarmers. I feel as strongly about his farmers as I do about mine and \nall of the farmers up and down that farm belt.\n  I just want to say to those who think they will shortcut this issue \nand they will ram some pathetic plan home tomorrow, take a deep breath, \nbecause you are in for a heck of a fight in the coming weeks if you \nthink that is how you will solve the problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me compliment and thank my friend from \nNorth Dakota. No one has worked harder or spoken more eloquently in \nsupport of the small family farm than the Senator from North Dakota. \nHow well I understand what he is going through.\n  We heard on this floor yesterday afternoon that we are getting ready \nto spend money for ``emergencies,'' but we ought to give a tax break. \nWhat is an emergency? Farmers, the Senator said. We should have known \nthere would be a drought or there would be too much water. We ought to \nhave put money in the budget for it.\n  ``Emergency'' is something that is on occasion. We cannot anticipate \nan emergency. We can't do that. But a tax break is in perpetuity. It \ngoes on forever. Emergency is one time.\n  So we try to cover up by accelerating the payments under Freedom to \nFarm. I voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of \nseven in this body. It is awfully hard to get a Senator with something \non his mind, with a philosophy that never looks in the future. The \nfuture is now at hand on that vote on the North American Free Trade \nAgreement when we are being flooded not only with farm products but \nwool and everything else relating to our people trying to make suits, \npants and so forth in the textile business. It is driving our people \nout of this country.\n\n  The Senator is absolutely correct, we need that safety net for our \nfarmers.\n  I have sat on too many front porches of farm families. I have been in \nthe kitchen with the farmer and his wife and family. I understand what \nthey are going through. They can't compete.\n  One of the finest men I know was in my office yesterday taking a load \nof hogs to the slaughter house. He got $3,500 for hogs that a year ago \nwould have brought $7,000. What did he get? Nothing. We don't have any \ncompassion for him; we don't have any reason to try to help him keep \nthat farm. He put everything into that load of hogs. What does he get \nback? He couldn't even pay for the feed.\n  So we say ``compete.'' Competition is like dialing a new bank at \nhome. The tape says if you want so and so, push 1; if you want so and \nso, push 2; if you want so and so, push 3. You keep on pushing the \nphone and finally people throw the phone out the door. They want to \ntalk to a human being, but we call another State to talk about local \nloan problems or financial problems.\n  We are getting into an intolerable situation. I hope the Senator \nnever lets his vote die as it relates to the family farm. I compliment \nthe Senator for what he is trying to do.\n  I understand we have been debating the aviation bill, but he has an \namendment that talks sense. The commodity we have so little of here is \ncommon sense. Common sense, I think, if it prevails, the Senator might \nwin a couple of amendments in the not-too-distant future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10881-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10883-S10884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LETHAL DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I informed the minority leader that I \nwill object to any unanimous consent requests to proceed to S. 2151 or \nany similar legislation containing provisions that would override \nOregon's assisted suicide law. Should S. 2151, the Lethal Drug Abuse \nPrevention Act come to the floor, I intend to insist that this body \nclearly hear the arguments against this legislation before voting on \nit, even if I must filibuster to assure that this occurs.\n  Let me state, as I have done before on this floor, that I have \npersonal reservations about the assisted suicide concept. I voted twice \nagainst assisted suicide in my home State, and I joined our colleagues \nin voting against Federal funding of assisted suicide.\n  I personally believe that nowhere near enough has been done to \npromote hospice care, pain management, comfort care, and other \napproaches to deal with the end of life.\n  The people of my State entered into an honest, direct, and exhausting \ndiscussion on the issue of assisted suicide--not once, but twice--\nthrough our public referenda process. I am not going to let that vote \nbe set aside without an extended debate on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  S. 2151 attempts to override the popular will of the citizens of my \nState who have made a judgment about what is acceptable medical \npractice. Medical practice is a matter that has been traditionally left \nto the States to regulate. However, in overriding the will of the \nOregon voters, S. 2151 strikes at the people across this country who \nare terminally ill and the millions of individuals who suffer in great \npain daily.\n  Almost all of our States have laws in effect, or about to go into \neffect, with respect to physician-assisted suicide. All of our States \nhave laws that regulate medical practice, including the use of \ncontrolled substances. The underlying message of S. 2151 is that the \nU.S. Congress knows better than voters in Coos Bay, Bend, and La \nGrande, OR. Does this Congress, meeting here in Washington, DC, believe \nit is better equipped than the citizens of my State to make moral \ndecisions about acceptable medical practice in Oregon?\n  This Senator is not going to sit by while there is an abbreviated \ndebate that cuts off the rights of Oregonians. I want the Senate to \nunderstand that today.\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\n  S. 2151 would amend the Controlled Substances Act to allow the Drug \nEnforcement Agency to deny DEA registration of providers determined to \nhave assisted in causing or participating in a physician-assisted \nsuicide. The advocates of this legislation say that good physicians \nwould have no problem with this legislation.\n  The record shows otherwise. The record shows that more than 50 \nmedical groups, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and hospice \nprograms--a variety of medical groups--believe this legislation would \nhave a chilling effect on pain management programs, on hospice care \nservices, and on comfort care. I want my colleagues to understand that. \nMore than 50 medical groups in our country believe this legislation \nwill have a chilling effect on our ability to make sure that our \ncitizens can get good pain management services, hospice programs and \ncomfort care.\n  What is especially striking is that even Americans who are opposed to \nOregon's law and are opposed to assisted suicide do not want to see the \nU.S. Congress overturn this law. Pain management, palliative care, and \nhospice services are still evolving fields. Not enough has been done to \ncomfort patients in these tragic situations, and Americans know that in \nthe current regulatory environment there can be a chilling effect on \nthe pain management services by laws such as the one proposed in S. \n2151. This legislation also runs counter to the recent Supreme Court \ndecision on physician-assisted suicide that encourages the States to \ncontinue to debate this question.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not going to stop assisted suicide. What \nit is going to do is set up new roadblocks to ensuring that there are \ngood pain management programs in our country. This bill is going to \nharm pain management for millions of Americans, turn the resources of \nthe Drug Enforcement Agency from looking at drug diversion and drug \ntrafficking to reviewing the intent of physicians and pharmacists as \nthey try to alleviate the pain of their patients. That is not what the \nDEA was set up to do. It was not set up to deal with overseeing hospice \nprograms, and the like.\n  If Congress tramples on the twice-expressed popular will of the \npeople of Oregon, it is going to feed the fires of cynicism and \nfrustration about Government across our land.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude with this. We all know that so often \nin coffee shops, churches, grange halls and senior centers, we hear \nAmericans say: You know, our vote doesn't matter. After we vote, those \npoliticians are going to say we really don't get it, the citizens don't \nunderstand. So we will just vote again; we will just vote, vote and \nvote until we set aside what their judgment has been.\n  I am here to say that I don't think the U.S. Congress knows better \nthan those voters in Coos Bay and Bend and La Grande. I don't think the \nU.S. Congress, meeting here in Washington, DC, is better equipped than \nthe citizens of my State to make a moral decision about what is \nacceptable medical practice in Oregon. This Congress should not try to \nsettle this issue in a hasty debate in the last hours of the U.S. \nCongress.\n  I have informed the minority leader that I will have a hold on this \nlegislation. Senator Grassley and I have, for some time, been \nencouraging Senators to announce publicly their intentions with respect \nto holds. I have done that in a letter to Senator Daschle. I will make \nthat letter a part of the Record. I am going to insist on my rights as \na Senator, representing thousands and thousands of Oregonians who have \nweighed in on this issue, that this Senate is going to have a real \ndebate on this legislation before there is a vote on it. I am going to \nassure that there is such a debate, even if I must filibuster to assure \nthat this occurs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Senator Daschle be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1998.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I want to point out once again to the \nSenate that we have been in a quorum call for about a half hour, and we \nare waiting to conclude the FAA legislation. As I understand, it has \nbeen tentatively agreed to be concluded later in the afternoon \nsometime--5 or 6 o'clock this evening--and we can anticipate perhaps \none or two more votes.\n  But I want to bring to the attention of the Senate again that we \ncould be using this time to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. We \nhave by now seen the majority leader's priorities--the FAA bill, which \nis important to a number of communities, including my own State of \nMassachusetts is not a matter of insignificance--but we have had the \nsalting legislation, we have had other pieces of legislation that have \nbeen advanced, and still the Republican leadership refuses to call up \nor permit our debate here on issues relating to the quality of health \nof some 140 million Americans, those Americans that are covered in \nvarious HMOs.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, we have some of the very best in \nterms of HMOs. The HMO program really took off, expanded, and we now \nfind many high-quality HMOs. But in my State, and across the country, \nHMOs too often are making judgments and decisions based upon what \ninsurance company accountants say, not what members of the medical \nprofession recommend.\n  I heard the President of the United States speak eloquently about his \nstrong support for the Patients' Bill of Rights just a few days ago. \nAnd he made a point which I think is worth underlining here in the U.S. \nSenate this afternoon. He said that no one in these HMOs ever loses \ntheir job when they deny a procedure that a patient's doctor requests, \nbecause these HMOs are organized so that there are several different \nlevels of approval required to receive medical care.\n  The deep concern that many of us have is that these decisions be made \nat the ground level--by doctors and other trained medical \nprofessionals--so that American families receive the care that they \nneed.\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\n  And if decisions are going to be made that are in the interests of \nthe profit of the HMO and not the health of the patient, and as a \nresult of those decisions that that individual is killed or permanently \ndisabled, there ought to be some form of remedy. That is a key part in \nour Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Why should we say that there is only going to be one industry in \nAmerica that is going to be free from accountability to the American \ncitizens? Why should they be the only one? They are, today, effectively \nthe only one.\n\n  Under existing law, the health insurance industry is the only \nindustry in America where, if there is negligence resulting in the loss \nof life or serious bodily injury, they are essentially free of \naccountability. That is wrong. Most Americans believe that is wrong, \nand it is wrong.\n  Accountability is an essential part of our Patients' Bill of Rights. \nMedical decisions should be made by medical professionals and not by \naccountants. And if a negligent decision was made, there should be \naccountability. Or what will happen to the family of the patient who \ndied because an HMO refused to pay for a medical test? What will happen \nto the education of the children of the patient who is permanently \ndisabled because she could not receive care at the closest emergency \nroom?\n  Our Republican friends say that is too bad, we don't want to change \nthat provision. Why can't we debate that? Why are we taking time in a \nquorum, or the time used yesterday waiting for amendments to the FAA \nbill? We understand that there is no long list of speakers to come to \nthe floor even this afternoon. Why aren't we debating managed care \nreform here on the floor this afternoon? Why aren't we able to make \nsome decision that affects millions of families today, across this \ncountry, on the issues of accountability?\n  It isn't just accountability. Another very important provision in our \nPatients' Bill of Rights would require HMOs to pay for routine medical \ncosts associated with clinical trials for their patients. We know--I \nknow from personal experience--the importance of clinical trials. These \ntrials don't, in fact, add any substantial additional cost to the HMO, \nbecause most of the patient's expenses are covered by the trial \nprotocol--the grant for that particular trial. There are very small \nadditional expenses--very, very small additional expenses.\n  And clinical trials are enormously important. They are enormously \nimportant for children who have cancer and other serious and dread \ndiseases. My own son was involved in an NIH clinical trial when he had \nosteosarcoma. Only 22 children had been in that clinical trial prior to \nmy son. He lost his leg to cancer. But his chances of surviving were \n15-18 percent before he entered that clinical trial. And he survived, \nas about 85 percent of the children who got into that clinical trial \ndid. Now the treatment used in that trial is a generally accepted \nprocedure for children who have osteosarcoma, bone sarcoma.\n  The idea of denying children the opportunity to enter clinical trials \nis outrageous. What are we supposed to say to a parent? ``Yes, we know \nyour child has osteosarcoma. We know there is a clinical trial that \ncould save his life. But we are not going to permit you to enlist your \nchild in that clinical trial''?\n  That is happening in the United States today in HMOs. These families \nsay, ``My goodness, what will I do?'' They appeal the decision, they \nwait, they go to desperate lengths requiring tremendous courage, and \nfinally they get in the clinical trial weeks or months later. But it is \ntoo late; that tumor that was a fraction of a centimeter has enlarged. \nThere can be no treatment now.\n  Denying our citizens an opportunity to participate in the greatest \nadvances that are taking place in the medical profession is effectively \na death sentence.\n  We have made great advances in the war on cancer, especially in \nchildren's diseases. And I don't know what we would have done if we \ndidn't have clinical trials for these children, and for patients with \nother diseases. We now have some very important opportunities for \ntreatments of breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer of \nthe stomach, and colorectal cancer.\n  Diseases like breast cancer are becoming more and more of a \nchallenge. Yet we are experiencing these breakthrough therapies that \ncan make an enormous difference in saving the lives of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  I seriously believe that the next millennium will be the millennium \nof the life sciences, breakthroughs in terms of medicine. It will offer \nenormous opportunities. The opportunities of mapping the human genome \nalone--which our good friend, the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, \nhas been such a leader on here in the U.S. Senate--are just mind \nboggling.\n  But we also have the opportunity now to make a difference in people's \nlives--to make sure that, when medical professionals recommend that \npatients enroll in clinical trials, these decisions are not overruled \nby insurance company accountants. That decision effectively denies them \nthe opportunity to save their lives or to get the best in terms of \nmedicine.\n  Every single day we have examples of this type of situation. I will \nmention one, Diane Bergin. I have Diane Bergin's testimony from a forum \nthat was held on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We talk about the \nPatients' Bill of Rights as a piece of legislation, but it is really an \nissue of lifesaving protections. That is what the legislation is really \nabout, lifesaving protections, and we do it in a number of different \nways.\n  Mr. President, this is Diane Bergin's comment:\n\n       My name is Diane Bergin and I was diagnosed with ovarian \n     cancer two years ago. I had always been very healthy--so the \n     news was particularly devastating. The only time I had been \n     in the hospital was when I had my three children. My primary \n     care physician referred me to a specialist at Georgetown, \n     where I eventually had my surgery and received standard \n     chemotherapy treatment. For three months, everything looked \n     good. At my next checkup, however, the cancer had come back.\n       My physician recommended that I consider getting a bone \n     marrow transplant. Before I could get treated, however, I had \n     to go through a round of medical testing to see if I was a \n     good candidate for a transplant. All through the testing I \n     kept hoping that I would qualify. I worked hard to keep my \n     spirits up and be optimistic. But in addition to worrying \n     about whether I would qualify for a transplant, I also had to \n     worry over whether my insurance would cover the procedure. It \n     felt like the insurance company held the balance of my life \n     in their hands. I had no guarantee that if I qualified, I \n     would be covered.\n       My husband and family couldn't have been any more \n     supportive. They told me to count on getting the transplant \n     and that they would somehow find a way to pay for it. In my \n     heart I couldn't accept that I would impoverish my family to \n     have a chance at prolonging my life.\n       Fortunately we weren't asked to make that decision. My \n     insurer finally sent me a letter approving my treatment.\n       Again I improved immediately after the transplant, but six \n     weeks later I was not so lucky. I was sent to another \n     specialist in Philadelphia who put me on tamoxifen. This was \n     the only drug I could tolerate because my condition was so \n     fragile after the transplant and there was some hope it would \n     help me. Unfortunately I didn't improve.\n       It was then that my physician suggested that I enroll in a \n     clinical trial for a new treatment at the Lombardi Cancer \n     Center. Even though I had been on an emotional roller coaster \n     waiting for my insurer to approve other treatments, I never \n     thought my insurer wouldn't pay now.\n       But on the Friday before I was to start my treatment, I was \n     called and told that my request had been rejected. I was \n     devastated and didn't know how I could get through the \n     weekend with my husband and son out of town. It struck me how \n     arbitrary the insurance system was. They were acting as judge \n     and jury on what medical care I could receive even though my \n     doctors recommended this care. The denial felt like a death \n     sentence--that I wouldn't have any more chances to fight for \n     my very survival.\n       I refused to accept that I couldn't get this treatment that \n     I so desperately needed. I objected and started my appeal. \n     When my family returned, they joined in the fight. \n     Fortunately, my son works at the Cancer Center and is very \n     involved in the clinical trial program there. With all our \n     efforts, and the aggressive appeal by my clinical team at \n     Lombardi, my insurer finally agreed to pay the routine costs \n     of my care. I'm in the midst of that trial right now.\n       I don't know if this trial will help me. And I don't know \n     what will happen if I should need to seek treatment through \n     another clinical trial. I anticipate another fight, only next \n     time I may not be so lucky.\n       I wanted to come today to tell my story because I believe \n     that no one facing a serous illness should be denied access \n     to care because that treatment is being provided through a \n     clinical trial. Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. And \n     the benefit to me, whether short or long term, will surely \n     help those women who come after me, seeking a\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\n     cure--a chance to prolong their life for just a little while, \n     just so that they can attend a graduation, or a wedding, or \n     the birth of a grandchild.\n       I strongly support, and my family is right there with me, \n     requiring insurers to pay for the routine costs of care that \n     are part of an approved clinical trial. I think the cures of \n     the future depend on it.\n\n  Mr. President, letters signed by scores of groups supporting the \nright to get into clinical trials, and we have letters signed by scores \nof groups regarding access to specialists, such as pediatric \noncologists.\n  In our legislation, we also have provisions for guaranteeing that a \nchild can see a specialist if that child has a serious illness. That is \nnot in the Republican program. We in the Senate ought to be able to \ndebate the merits of this provision.\n  But the bottom line, at the end of the day, is what the additional \ncosts are going to be. We ought to be able to debate these, as well. \nYou will find out that the cost of our protections is approximately $2 \nper worker per month. I think most workers would be glad to pay that \nadditional $2 a month for the kind of protections we are talking about \nhere in terms of clinical trials and specialists for members of their \nfamily. Why not give us an opportunity to debate that? Why not call the \nroll on those particular provisions?\n  We need to have a debate on the situation we see taking place around \nthis country, where if you are a member of an HMO, your ambulance will \ndrive by the nearest hospital and go to another hospital on the other \nside of town just because they are a member of that HMO. They will \ndrive right by it. If a family goes to the closer hospital, the HMO \nwill charge the family for the emergency care, which perhaps saved \ntheir child's life. We ought to be able to debate that. Why are we \nbeing shut out and denied? Why are we continuing in these quorum calls \nthat last the course of the afternoon? Why didn't we take time \nyesterday and why aren't we taking time this afternoon to move ahead on \nthis kind of legislation?\n  Mr. President, many of the guarantees that have been included in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights are guarantees that were unanimously \nrecommended by the bipartisan President's Commission on Quality Care. \nIn fairness, I will say that the Commission didn't recommend that these \nrecommendations necessarily be put in legislation. But if all of the \nHMOs had just accepted those requirements, then we would not be needing \nthis legislation. The problem is that the good ones have it, but the \nothers don't.\n  So we are saying that we want to make sure that the protections are \ngoing to be across the board. If all of the HMOs complied with the \nlegislation, we would not need it.\n  But these are very sensible and responsible recommendations. Half of \nthem have been recommended by the President's Commission, half of them \nby the American Association of Health Plans. We have more than half of \nthem that are already in existence included in form of Medicare, and 32 \nmillion Americans get those protections. So they are working in the \nMedicare, but they are not available for other Americans. Other \nprotections in our bill were recommended by the National Association of \nInsurance Commissions--again, a bipartisan group of insurance \ncommissioners representing the States who have a pretty good \nunderstanding and awareness of what is needed.\n  There is not one of our recommendations--not one of them--that has \nnot been recommended by one of those four organizations or groups. Not \none.\n  Mr. President, what I am saying is that these protections have been \nwell thought out. They are reasonable, they are sensible, they are \nresponsible, and they will make a significant difference in terms of \nprotecting the health care of the American people. Now, Mr. President, \nit is time to give us an opportunity to debate those and act on them.\n  I will wind up with these final comments. We have every professional \nmedical organization, every nursing organization, every consumer group \nin the country supporting our Patients' Bill of Rights. Not one is \nsupporting the Republican proposal. Not one. No matter how many \nstaffers go out and search, they can't find one.\n  The doctors and the medical profession understand the importance of \nthis, as well as the parents. Every children's group, every disability \ngroup, every women's group, every one of those groups support this \nbecause this is the way to protect children, the disabled, women, and \nfamilies.\n  With all respect to the importance of the legislation that we are \ncurrently considering, we have few days left to debate the Patients' \nBill of Rights. We continue to implore the Republican leadership to \nbring up this legislation and permit the Senate to work its will so \nthat we can do something to protect the American consumer in health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from Arizona on the \nfloor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nshortening, somewhat, his statement today. I appreciate it, because I \nknow the obvious passion with which he addresses the issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10884-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10886-S10889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H. FORD NATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3631\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n   Transportation should ensure the enforcement of the rights of the \nUnited States under the air service agreement between the United States \n     and the United Kingdom known as the ``Bermuda II Agreement'')\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk for Mr. \nFaircloth, Mr. Hollings and Mr. Helms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), for Mr. Faircloth, \n     for himself, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Helms, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3631.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this Sense of the Senate resolution \nputs the Senate on record about a transportation issue in the largest \ncity in my State.\n  The failure of this Administration to stand up for American carriers \nunder our air services agreements with foreign governments is a serious \nissue. The unwillingness of this Administration to stand up for \nAmerican interests undercuts our international position in critical \nnegotiations and promotes intransigence amongst other parties to these \nnegotiations.\n  Specifically, Mr. President, this Administration has not fought to \nenforce the rights of American citizens, American communities, and \nAmerican air carriers.\n  Under the existing air services agreement between the United States \nand the United Kingdom, the so-called Bermuda II agreement, the United \nStates has the right to designate a U.S. flag carrier to serve the \nCharlotte-London route.\n  On February 20, 1998, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded \nthis route to US Airways. US Airways announced its plans to launch \nnonstop service on May 7, 1998 and to compete with British Airways' \nmonopoly on this route.\n  With its network at Charlotte, US Airways was prepared to offer \nconvenient one-stop service to the United Kingdom from dozens of cities \nin North Carolina, South Carolina, and the surrounding area.\n  However, the government of the United Kingdom failed to provide US \nAirways with commercially viable landing and take-off rights at Gatwick \nAirport, London's secondary airport.\n  The Bermuda II agreement prohibits US Airways from serving Heathrow \nAirport at all. Only two U.S. carriers are allowed to serve Heathrow. I \nwant to remind my colleagues that the British are blocking access not \nto the primary airport, Heathrow, but even to the secondary airport, \nGatwick.\n  Yes, Mr. President, the British Government refused to facilitate \naccess to its secondary airport for a competitor to the British Airways \nmonopoly on the Charlotte-London route.\n  US Airways tried to obtain landing and take-off rights at Gatwick \nairport. The British refuse to budge. As a result, US Airways was \nforced to cancel its Charlotte-London service for the\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\nhigh-peak summer of 1998 and for the winter of 1998-1999 as well.\n  The outrage is that not only was British Airways' monopoly at \nCharlotte preserved, but the Department of Transportation granted \nBritish Airways yet another monopoly route--between London and Denver.\n  That's right, while the British refused to comply with their Bermuda \nII obligations, our Department of Transportation gave them another \nmonopoly route.\n  While the US Airways Charlotte flight remains grounded, and while the \nBritish thumb their noses at us, British Airways now has a monopoly on \nten routes between the U.S. and the U.K.\n  This Sense of the Senate urges the U.S. Government, especially the \nU.S. Secretary of Transportation, to act to enforce U.S. rights under \nthe Bermuda II agreement.\n  Our government seems willing to grant foreign carriers the right to \nserve our airports on a monopoly basis but unwilling to take a firm \nstand with foreign governments.\n  We need the Administration to ensure that our carriers have the right \nto serve our citizens and enforce their rights under international law.\n  We hear a lot of talk from the Administration these days about ``Open \nSkies'' with the U.K. We understand that negotiations are about to \nbegin to achieve a more competitive marketplace.\n  It is critical, however, that the Secretary of Transportation first \nensure that existing rights are enforced for the benefit of U.S. \ncitizens.\n  The people of the Southeast have been denied the benefits of \ncompetitive service by a U.S. flag carrier to the U.K.\n  Surely, an Administration that refuses to enforce existing rights \ncannot possibly negotiate an agreement that is less than a full \nsurrender to the British. We didn't surrender in 1776 and we will not \nsurrender now.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman and Senator \nFord for their support on this issue. This is a simple matter of \nfairness and equity. The unreasonable and anticompetitive conduct of \nthe United Kingdom has gone on far too long and exacted an unacceptable \ntoll on the Carolinas.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary awarded the Charlotte-London (Gatwick) \nroute to US Airways on September 12, 1997. On May 7, 1998, US Airways \nannounced plans to launch nonstop service in competition with British \nAirways, providing a convenient one-stop service from dozens of cities \nin North and South Carolina. Unfortunately, US Airways was forced to \ncancel this service because of the UK refusal to provide commercially \nviable access to Gatwick.\n  It is now time for the Secretary to assert our rights and enforce the \nBermuda II Agreement.\n  Mr. President, before the Secretary enters into negotiations on a new \nbroad bilateral agreement, equity dictates that the Secretary must \nresolve this issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I have an amendment, and I send it to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Robb), for himself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Ms. Collins and Mr. Gregg, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3634.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 41, line 22, strike the ``and''.\n       On page 41, line 23, strike the period and insert ``;''.\n       On page 41, line 24 insert the following:\n       ``(3) not reduce travel options for communities served by \n     small hub airports and medium hub airports within the \n     perimeter described in section 49109 of title 49, United \n     States Code; and\n       ``(4) not result in meaningfully increased travel delays.''\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I understand that a number of Senators could \nconceivably benefit from the additional flights at National. Current \nlanguage in the bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to award \nnew flights for service outside the perimeter if those flights will \nprovide ``network benefits beyond the perimeter'' and ``increase \ncompetition in multiple markets.''\n  I believe this proposed test tilts the Secretary's decision in favor \nof consumers flying beyond the perimeter and away from considering the \nbenefits to all consumers using this region's airports. For that \nreason, I am proposing an amendment to provide a more balanced \napproach. Consumers using the airports are not just worried about the \navailability of long-haul service, they are also worried about timely \nservice and the availability of service to smaller airports.\n  The amendment I am offering would simply require the Secretary to \nconsider those factors in awarding any new slots at National. Senators \nGregg, Smith of New Hampshire, Graham of Florida, Snowe, and Collins \nhave agreed to cosponsor this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Smith of New \nHampshire and Senator Graham of Florida be added as cosponsors to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Again, Mr. President, I believe very strongly--and will \nhave more to say later this afternoon--that it is wrong for the \nCongress to retreat from its promise to the citizens of this region, \nand I believe the changes in this bill will be harmful to the capital \narea's economy as well as its quality of life. If we are going to \nmeddle in the rules governing service at National, however, we should \ndo so in a way that is fair to all consumers.\n  I understand that this amendment has been accepted by the managers on \nboth sides, and I thank the managers for their assistance. I am \nprepared to move it or set it aside, whichever would be the preference \nof either manager at this time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I must say it is not cleared on this side at this time. \nWe would be glad to continue to evaluate that, but I am not at liberty \nto accept it at this point.\n  Mr. ROBB. I understand. With that, I ask unanimous consent that it be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \nproposed by Mr. Robb of which I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  This amendment addresses an issue of great importance to the State of \nFlorida. Specifically, concern has been expressed about the weakening \nof the ``Perimeter Rule,'' and the availability of nonstop flights \nbetween smaller airports and Reagan National Airport. I have been in \ntouch with representatives from Jacksonville, Ft. Meyers, West Palm \nBeach, and Fort Lauderdale. They are convinced that a substantial \nportion of the direct flights to National that operate out of these \nairports would eventually be eliminated because the airlines would \nchoose the higher revenue options. A study done by the Washington \nAirports Task Force supports this opinion.\n  The study shows that if the perimeter rule was essentially eliminated \nor weakened by allowing exemptions, economics will drive the airlines \nto take that airport's capacity away from markets within the perimeter \nand re-apply it to the higher value markets outside of the perimeter. \nThat means that as many as 25 cities within the perimeter would be \nvulnerable to loss of some or all of their nonstop service to National. \nThe study also shows that as many as 1.6 million air travelers in 93 \ncongressional districts could be affected.\n  This amendment assures that, for those communities that are served by \nsmall and medium hub airports that fall within the perimeter, travel \noptions will not be reduced and consumers will not be subjected to \nincreased travel delays. In addition, this legislation protects the \nlevel of service and choices for consumers in the State of Florida and \nthroughout the country.\n  I hope that you can support our efforts to ensure that the aviation \nservice in our States are not threatened.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I understand that the managers are now \nprepared to weigh in on this particular amendment. I yield to the \nmanagers of the amendment for any comments they might like to make.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we are prepared to accept this \namendment. I know of no objection.\n  Mr. BRYAN. No objection on this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3634) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

ALLOCATION OF TRUST FUND FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Airport and airway trust fund.--The term ``Airport and \n     Airway Trust Fund'' means the trust fund established under \n     section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the States, \n     the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico.\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\n       (4) State dollar contribution to the airport and airway \n     trust fund.--The term ``State dollar contribution to the \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund'', with respect to a State and \n     fiscal year, means the amount of funds equal to the amounts \n     transferred to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund under \n     section 9502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that are \n     equivalent to the taxes described in section 9502(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 that are collected in that \n     State.\n       (b) Reporting.--\n       (1) In general.--As soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary \n     of the Treasury shall report to the Secretary the amount \n     equal to the amount of taxes collected in each State during \n     the preceding fiscal year that were transferred to the \n     Airport and Airway Trust Fund.\n       (2) Report by secretary.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Secretary shall prepare and submit to Congress a report that \n     provides, for each State, for the preceding fiscal year--\n       (A) the State dollar contribution to the Airport and Airway \n     Trust Fund; and\n       (B) the amount of funds (from funds made available under \n     section 48103 of title 49, United States Code) that were made \n     available to the State (including any political subdivision \n     thereof) under chapter 471 of title 49, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, this is a simple proposal to obtain \nnumbers about a Federal program as regards the respective States. As a \nmember of the Committee on Environment and Public Works for the last 22 \nyears, I served as chairman, at one point, and handled a number of \nhighway bills, as we call them, transportation bills, and have been \ninvolved with negotiations with the House in these matters.\n  One of the subjects that comes forward continuously is the payments \nby respective State residents, or persons passing through a State, into \nthe highway trust fund. This was established in 1956 by President \nEisenhower, under his administration, on the recommendation of a \ncommission headed by General Clay, with the previous Speaker, Mr. \nWright of Texas, as one of the persons animating the effort in the \nCongress. There was a source of funding for the Interstate and Defense \nHighway Program. Indeed, there was, and we have very successfully \nfinished that program and we continue to fund transportation projects \nacross the Nation with those revenues as they come in.\n\n  Now, in 1986 we established the airport and airway trust fund. It is \na ticket tax and other taxes. It brings considerable revenue, as anyone \nwho has recently ridden on the Washington-New York shuttle can attest. \nIn fiscal year 1998, we estimate that $4.5 billion was collected in \nticket taxes.\n  However, we have no State-by-State analysis of the dollar \ncontributions. Inevitably and properly, the moneys are used by the \nFederal Aviation Administration to provide airport projects around the \nNation, but with no accounting for the relative contributions of the \ndifferent States with the thought that there be some proportionality as \nto the return to the States. I say ``some''--nothing precise, nothing \nis proposed in this amendment to make such a proportionality \nrequirement. Indeed, it is not desired.\n  Public policy on transportation should follow the needs of \ntransportation, and yet it is reasonable to assume that Senators and \nRepresentatives will expect some relationship between what their State \nprovides and what it receives. That may now take place; it may not take \nplace. The answer is we don't know.\n  The most normal function of government when it collects a tax is to \nrecord the origins and the specifics of the revenue stream. There will \nbe some difficulty doing this. It is tricky. A good number of airline \ntickets are now purchased on the Internet as opposed to travel agents \nor at the airport. These are methodological problems which the Treasury \nis entirely capable of dealing with through sampling and other devices. \nThis amendment quite specifically says, ``as soon as practicable after \nthe date of enactment of this act and annually thereafter,'' that the \nSecretary of the Treasury will report to the Secretary of \nTransportation.\n  The term ``as soon as practicable'' gives the Treasury the leeway it \nrequires to get these numbers and break them down. It is routine \ngovernment. It is good government. It is an opportunity to avoid a \ngreat deal of misunderstanding and discord in the committees involved \nand on the floor as we ask how appropriate, and in a general sense, how \nfair the use of these funds is--the allocation of these funds once they \nhave been obligated through taxation.\n  Accordingly, I hope the Senate can approve this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully inquire of the managers whether this \nstraightforward measure could be accepted and spare the Senate the \ntime.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If I might respond to the inquiry from my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, I am informed at this point we are \nnot able to accept the amendment. The floor leader is absent from the \nfloor temporarily and will return shortly. Perhaps the Senator may be \nable to engage in a conversation with him and the distinguished Senator \non the other side of the aisle as to working out this point. I am not \nable to give the distinguished Senator the assurance that he needs that \nwe can approve it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. My friend from Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  This amendment has just been presented and is now being seen by the \nmanagers. I think both sides of the aisle have expressed some concerns, \nso we will have to study it some more.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. In that regard, Mr. President, I wonder if I could, \nwith the understanding of the managers, ask for the yeas and nays with \nthe understanding that if the managers, after consideration of this \nvery simple proposal, decide that it is acceptable, when that moment \ncomes when this amendment comes up after 5 o'clock, that the yeas and \nnays be vitiated and the amendment be accepted; if not, we will have a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Once again, if on further consideration the managers \nwould like to accept the amendment, we will vitiate the vote when the \ntime comes.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10886-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10889-S10893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, about an hour ago, our dear friend, Senator \nKennedy from Massachusetts, came on the floor to talk about health care \nand, like Goliath of old, challenged us to respond to his cry to allow \nhim to dramatically change our health care system. Since it appears \nthat there is a break in the legislative action,---I see no one \nstanding around waiting to speak or amend--I thought I would make \nSenator Kennedy's day, so-to-speak, by coming over and responding to \nhim.\n  Mr. President, there are several points I want to make and I will try \nnot to belabor any of them. First of all, there is something to be said \nabout having an institutional memory. I would like to take our \ncolleagues, at least those who are now eager to remake our health care \nsystem in their ideal image, down memory lane, and remind them that it \nwas only in 1993 that President Clinton and Senator Kennedy told us in \na debate, which lasted for 18 months in the Senate, that they knew how \nto solve our health care problem.\n  Our health care problem, in 1993, according to President Clinton and \nSenator Kennedy, was an access problem, that 40 million Americans did \nnot have health insurance, and their solution was to have the \nGovernment take over and run the health care system and create one \ngiant HMO that I think they called a ``health care purchasing \ncollective.'' All Americans were going to be forced into one giant \nGovernment-run HMO, and the benefit we were going to get from it was \nthat everyone\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\nwould be covered. The cost of it, obviously, was that we would lose our \nright to choose.\n  Now, in that program, no one had the right to sue the Government \nbased on poor medical treatment. They had the right that you have under \ncurrent law to sue an HMO if they violate their contract. But we were \ntold in 1993 that the problem was access to health care, and that the \nright to choose your own doctor, the right to choose your own hospital, \nand the right to sue was not important. What was important--in the \nwords of Senator Kennedy and the President, which still ring in our \nears --was ``access.''\n  Now, here we are 5 years later and we are now being told that the \nproblem is not access, the problem is not that 40 million Americans are \nhaving trouble paying for health insurance, and that in fact we should \ntake action to make millions more unable to pay for their health \ninsurance; we are now being told that the problem is that HMOs limit \nchoice.\n  Now, Mr. President, I can't help but be struck by the fact that the \nsame people who, 5 years ago, said the problem is access and we should \nsacrifice choice by putting everybody into one giant Government-run HMO \ncalled a ``health care collective,'' and that we should limit the \nability of people to sue in the name of access--those same people are \nnow saying that the problem is that HMOs limit choice. Specifically, \nthey are saying the problem is that, under current law, you can't sue \nan HMO.\n  The only point I want to make--and I think it is a very important \npoint--is that, 5 years ago, the President and Senator Kennedy loved \nHMOs. They loved them so much they wanted to put every American into \none, regardless of their circumstances, and not allow anyone, under \npunishment of law, to buy health care outside the system. They wanted \nto have everyone in one giant Government health care HMO called a \n``health care collective.''\n  Now, they don't love HMOs anymore. Then they cared about people \nhaving health insurance, and now they don't care about people having \nhealth insurance. In fact, under their bill, even under the most \nconservative estimates, hundreds of thousands, millions of families \nwill lose health insurance. Suddenly, they don't like HMOs, and they \nwant to protect people from the very same health care system that they \nwanted to impose on the Nation on a mandatory basis just 5 years ago.\n  Now, what is their real objective? We all know their real objective \nbecause, one thing about them--and they are not trying to hide it--is \nthat they really believe the Government ought to run the health care \nsystem. We know what their ideal plan looked like; we had it 5 years \nago. By the way, it looked very menacing. We had about 70 Members of \nthe Senate who were cosponsoring these Government-run health care \ncollectives. It looked like a 20-foot tall giant until, finally, a few \nMembers of the Senate went up and stuck a pin in its big belly and it \ndeflated. People realized that when their mama got sick, she was going \nto have to talk to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor, so we killed the \nKennedy-Clinton health care plan.\n  Well, they are back. Since we are not going to let them run the \nhealth care system, they have decided they are going to tell the \nprivate sector how to run it.\n  Let me address the problems with HMOs. Let me say that, unlike the \nPresident and Senator Kennedy, I never was in love with their idea of \nan HMO. I was opposed to forcing people, on a mandatory basis, to go to \na Government-run HMO. I want people to have choices. Now, Senator \nKennedy says these HMOs are bad, but he doesn't want to give people the \npower to fire them, which I want to do. He wants to give people the \nability to sue them.\n  I want to give people the ability to have real choices. That is what \nour bill is about.\n  Let me try to define the problem. I want to define it generically, \nand then I want to talk about the problem as people see it. Then I want \nto talk about Senator Kennedy's solution and then about the Republican \nsolution.\n  Here is the real problem. HMOs have grown like wildfire because of \nexploding medical costs. Under our old medical system, which we all \nloved and which was wonderful, except for one thing--nobody could \nafford it--with fee-for-service medicine and low-deductible health \ninsurance policies, we all bought health care where somebody else paid \nfor it.\n  Under our old health care system, if you went to the hospital, \nsomebody else paid 95 percent of your bill. Sometimes that was private \nhealth insurance; sometimes it was Medicare; sometimes it was Medicaid; \nsometimes it was indigent care. But the bottom line was, under our old \nfee-for-service health care system where Americans with Medicaid, \nMedicare, and private health insurance had a third party paying, when \nyou went to the hospital somebody else paid 95 percent of your costs.\n  Can you imagine if we had grocery insurance, so that when we went to \nthe grocery store 95 percent of everything we put in our basket was \npaid for by our grocery insurance? We would all eat differently, and so \nwould our dogs. Grocery stores as we know them wouldn't exist. They \nwould have 20 times as many people working at the supermarket as they \nhave now. They would have all kinds of luxury foods and prepared foods. \nAnd we would all love the grocery store, and we would all hate our \ngrocery insurance bills.\n  That is the situation we were in. Government, as usual, did nothing \nabout it. In fact, Government policy made all those problems worse. \nThen the private sector started to move to solve the problem. And one \nof the innovations was the development of the HMO. People have gone \ninto HMOs, through their jobs, by the millions because they are \ncheaper, because they exercise more judgment in spending and because \nthey make health care more affordable.\n  But there is a problem. The problem is that the way the HMOs control \ncost is by exerting influence over the health care you consume. Here is \nthe problem with our national psyche. The problem is, we all want the \nbenefits of cost control, but we don't want to bear the burden of \nhaving the cost control imposed on us and our family. We want the lower \nrates of the HMOs. We want to make the HMOs give us whatever we want, \nbut we don't want them to charge us more to pay for it.\n  In other words, as usual, we want a free lunch. We want something for \nnothing. But that can never be, because one of the things God decided a \nlong time ago is, you can't get something for nothing. If you drive up \ncosts, you have to pay for it ultimately.\n  Here is Senator Kennedy's definition of the problem, and here is his \nsolution.\n  His definition of the problem, which millions of Americans identify \nwith--and so do I--is when you go to see your doctor and you are a \nmember of an HMO, when you go into the examining room, the HMO has its \ngatekeeper in the examining room, in essence, making decisions with \nyour doctor as to what you need.\n  We don't want somebody else in our examining room. When we go into \nthe examining room with the doctor, we want to be alone with the \ndoctor. The problem is, with HMOs, one of the prices we pay for lower \ncost is having a gatekeeper involved in our health care, which almost \nliterally means having a third person in the examining room.\n  What do Americans want, and what does Senator Kennedy want?\n  Americans want to get the gatekeeper out of the examining room. They \nwant to be alone with their doctors. What Senator Kennedy says is, \n``OK, you do not like having a gatekeeper in your examining room. So \nwhat we will do is this.''\n  If you will adopt Senator Kennedy's bill, he will bring into the \nexamining room a Government bureaucrat, whom he will choose, who will \nbe there to regulate the gatekeeper and your doctor. And then you will \nget to hire with your money a lawyer, who can be there to watch the \ndoctor and the gatekeeper and to be there to sue them on your behalf.\n  I thought it would be instructive to take a simple medical device, \nthe stethoscope, invented by the ancient Greeks and used to this day to \nlisten to people's hearts, and demonstrate graphically what Kennedy-\nCare looks like. What Kennedy-Care looks like is this stethoscope.\n  When you go into the examining room, under Senator Kennedy's program, \nyou are at this end--this part\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\nright here where they put that right up against your heart. So that is \nwhere you are. Then your doctor has one set of earpieces so that he can \nlisten to your heart and determine if something is wrong with you.\n  Then the problem everybody is concerned about is, the HMO has a \ngatekeeper there with his stethoscope next to your heart listening to \nyour beat, second-guessing your doctor.\n  What you would like to do is cut this part of the stethoscope off. \nThat is what every American who is a member of an HMO would like. But \nwhat does Senator Kennedy do? He adds another stethoscope for the \nGovernment bureaucrat that he is going to choose. So the Government \nbureaucrat is going to be listening to your heartbeat, second-guessing \nthe HMO, and second-guessing your doctor, and trying to tell them both \nwhat to do.\n  In addition, Senator Kennedy lets you hire a lawyer to come, and \ngives him another stethoscope.\n  So here you are. What you wanted was to be alone with your doctor. \nBut now, under the Kennedy plan, you are in the examining room not only \nwith your doctor and the HMO gatekeeper, but also with a bureaucrat \nchosen by Senator Kennedy, and a lawyer, whom you pay for. So there you \nare, and there are four people in the examining room with you, three of \nwhom you don't want.\n  It is Senator Kennedy's solution to the problem.\n  You wanted to get rid of the gatekeeper. But he keeps the gatekeeper, \nbecause he doesn't give you the ability to fire the HMO, but he sends \nhis bureaucrats in and then takes your money to hire you a lawyer. \nSuddenly, you have four people in the examining room with you and you \nare three times as unhappy as you were before.\n  That is not the solution that most Americans have in mind.\n  What is the solution they have in mind? The solution they have in \nmind is what I call ``medical savings account care.'' Under our \nprogram, which is embodied in the Republican alternative, this is what \nthe stethoscope looks like--again, exactly like the Greeks designed it.\n  Here you are. The doctor is listening to your heart. Here is the \ndoctor. But you have gotten rid of the HMO gatekeeper. You didn't have \nto hire Senator Kennedy's bureaucrat. You didn't have to hire Senator \nKennedy's lawyer. What you have is simply you and your doctor.\n  That is what people want.\n  How do we do it?\n  I conducted an interesting experiment the other day and I want to \nshow you a chart and share the results with you today. I took a page of \nmedical providers out of the Yellow Pages. I called up, and asked them \nif they were part of the largest HMO in Washington, Kaiser HMO. Then I \nasked if they were part of the largest preferred provider organization. \nThat is Blue Cross, PPO. Then I asked them about the Republican \nsolution, which is based on medical savings accounts, and I will \nexplain more about them in a minute.\n  The Republican bill--I want to congratulate our leader, Don Nickles, \nand the members of our task force who put together an excellent bill \nthat deals with the legitimate concerns that Americans have about HMOs. \nBut we do more on that to try to deal with HMO abuses, because we give \npeople the power to fire their HMO--something Senator Kennedy does not \ndo. He gives you the power to have a Government bureaucrat oversee your \nHMO, gives you the power to have a lawyer to sue them, but he doesn't \ngive you the power to fire them.\n  Now, in addition to dealing with the legitimate concerns about HMOs, \nwe did something so much better, and that is we brought freedom into \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. What are the Bill of Rights about if they \nare not about the right to choose. So we create real medical savings \naccounts, and here is how they work. Let's say I have two children, \nwhich I do, and I have a wife. And I am grateful for the children and \nmy wife. I buy the standard option Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and it costs \nmy employer about $4,000 a year. Now, I could buy that same coverage, \nif it had a $3,000 high deductible, for just $2,000 a year. That is \nbecause the first $2,000 of medical costs are prepaid medical expenses \nrather than insurance.\n  So under our bill, people would have the right--no one would make you \ndo it, but you would have the right to choose a medical savings \naccount. What it would mean, especially for young couples with a \nmoderate income, is that you could at a low cost buy a high-deductible \npolicy to protect your family in case something really bad happened and \nyet you could still afford it.\n  The way it would work is your company, which is currently buying you \na $4,000 Blue Cross/Blue Shield standard option, low-deductible policy, \nwould instead buy for $2,000 the high-deductible plan and then deposit \nthe $2,000 it saves into your medical savings account. With that \n$2,000, and the $1,000 you would normally spend on both health premiums \nand out of pocket medical expenses, your medical savings account would \nhave $3,000 to pay for all your health care expenses up to $3,000. Any \nfurther medical expenses above $3,000 in a year would be covered by \nyour high-deductible insurance.\n  Now, there are two reasons why this is important. One, at the end of \nthe year, if you had not spent that $3,000 in your medical savings \naccount on medicine, it is your money. If you go to the doctor and you \nsay, I have a terrible headache, and the doctor looks at you, examines \nyou, and he says, look, you probably have a headache and you have two \noptions: One, I can give you two aspirins and it will probably go away, \nor I can give you a brain scan that will cost $1,000. If you take the \ntwo aspirins and it doesn't go away, you can come back tomorrow and I \ncan give you the brain scan. With the medical savings account, since \nyou get to keep that $1,000 if you don't spend it on a brain scan, you \nwill see more rational economic decisions. You will probably ask the \ndoctor what he really thinks, and in all probability, you re going to \ntake the two aspirins and come back tomorrow if the headache is not \ngone.\n  On the other hand, under Senator Kennedy's plan, if you have low-\ndeductible insurance, you will say, well, does this brain scan hurt? \nAnd they will say, no, it doesn't hurt at all. In fact, it is very \ninteresting. You can actually watch it. You might say, great, let's \nhave the brain scan.\n  The point is, if I am spending my money I behave differently than if \nI am spending someone else's money. But under the medical savings \naccount, at the end of the year, if all I had was a headache, I am \n$1,000 better off in my pocket--to send my children to Texas A or to \ngo on a vacation or buy a refrigerator--if I went with the two aspirins \nand I didn't need the brain scan. But the most important thing about \nour medical savings accounts is I get to choose.\n  Now, let me get back to my experiment. I took a page out of the \nYellow Pages. In my Yellow Pages test on the Kennedy health care plan \nand the Republican health care plan, I decided to give him the benefit \nof the doubt and assumed that everyone was in the biggest HMO in \nWashington. Many people won't be. Or let's say everyone went with the \nmost popular preferred provider organization, the Blue Cross/Blue \nShield PPO. So what we did was, starting with Ginsberg, Susan M. \nGinsberg, M.D., at 106 Irving Street, NW, 723-4015, we went through and \ncalled each of these physicians and we asked them three questions: One, \nDo you participate in the Kaiser HMO?\n  Ten of them did. So if I were a member of the Kaiser HMO, I could see \none of their doctors. If I could get to see somebody under the Kennedy \nplan, I would even have a Government bureaucrat in the examining room \nwith me sharing my intimate experiences, along with a gatekeeper at \nKaiser, but only 10 doctors of the 28 on this list would see me under \nthe Kaiser HMO plan.\n  Now, if I had the Blue Cross PPO, 17 physicians that are listed on \npage 1017 of the Yellow Pages, 17 of the 28 physicians would take Blue \nCross/Blue Shield. But then we asked them another question. We asked \nthese physicians if they would take a check from a medical savings \naccount. Golden Rule is a just one company that offers these MSA \nchecking accounts. When you go to the doctor, you simply pay with your \nMSA check.\n  Then you have, through Mellon Bank with MasterCard, a MasterCard \nmedical savings account. The way it works is you don't call up any \ngatekeeper. You don't say, do you take my preferred provider? Or, do \nyou participate\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\nin this HMO? You simply call up and say, do you take MasterCard? And \nthrough the medical savings account at Mellon Bank you can get a \nMasterCard for participating in the program. And then there is Health \nValue, which has a medical savings account through Visa.\n  I performed an additional experiment. After we had asked them, Do you \ntake Kaiser HMO, and 10 of the 28 did; Do you take Blue Cross preferred \nprovider, and 17 of the 28 did. Then we said, Do you take Visa? Every \none of the 28 took Visa. Do you take MasterCard? Every one of them took \nMasterCard. If I have identification, do you take a check? Every one of \nthem took a check.\n  Now, there is the power of real freedom of choice. The freedom of \nchoice is you do not have to go to an HMO. You do not have to go to \nsome preferred provider. You do not have to appeal to an outside \nappeals board. You do not have to file a lawsuit. You do not have to \nhave a Government bureaucrat. All you have to do is pick up the phone \nand call the doctor or the specialist you want and say, ``Dr. Goldbaum, \ndo you take MasterCard?'' If he takes MasterCard, you don't care \nwhether he is on somebody's preferred provider list or whether he is a \nreferral specialist. He is your primary care physician, if he takes \nMasterCard.\n  What our proposal does is set people free to choose. Senator Kennedy \nand the President hate medical savings accounts. They respond to \nmedical savings accounts the way vampires react to a cross. And the \nreason is simply this: They understand that medical savings accounts \nempower people. And once somebody has a medical savings account, they \ndo not want a Government bureaucrat. They do not need a lawyer. And if \nthey need one, they can go into court and hire the lawyer. They do not \nhave to fool around with gatekeepers. They just simply pick up the \nphone and dial William D. Goldman, Pediatrics-Adolescent Medicine. He \ncould be a referral doctor for Kaiser or Blue Cross/Blue Shield. But \nthey call up Dr. Goldman, and they have one simple question for Dr. \nGoldman: ``Dr. Goldman, do you take Visa?'' If Dr. Goldman takes Visa, \nthey are in. We set them free to choose.\n  Now, Senator Kennedy and the President understand that if we ever \nhave medical savings accounts that will work, their idea of having the \nGovernment taking over and running the health care system of America is \ndead. It will never be brought back to life. So they do not like this \nprovision in our bill. But the wonderful thing about it is we do not \nmake people buy medical savings accounts. Many people love HMOs. My \nmother-in-law participates in an HMO and loves it, and she ought to \nhave the right to choose it. Many people love preferred providers. All \nwe do is make it possible for people to have real choice so if their \nbaby is sick and they want to get in to see a specialist, if they want \nto see William D. Goldman, pediatrics and adolescent medicine, they \ndon't go to a gatekeeper; they just pick up the phone and say do you \ntake MasterCard? He does? They are in.\n\n  Senator Kennedy tells us that he wants to vote on health care. I find \nit very interesting that we have offered him the ability to present to \nthe Senate his plan, change it any way he wants to change it--put two \nFederal bureaucrats in every examining room, hire five lawyers, \nwhatever works for him--develop the best system he can develop for \nAmerica, we will not try to change it. We will not try to be \nmischievous and offer an amendment to it. He tells us how to fix the \nhealth care system. And then the Republican Task Force, of which I am a \nproud member, will present our alternative and what will happen is we \nwill let people choose.\n  Senator Kennedy, knowing we are in session for 10 more days--I ask \nunanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Senator Kennedy, knowing we are in session for only 10 \nmore days, wants to do all these amendments. He wants to amend our \nproposal. We do not want to amend his proposal. All we want to do is \ngive people a choice. We think we have a better way. He, obviously, \nthinks highly of his plan. It is much closer to the world as he sees \nit.\n  What we are saying is, if he really wants to vote on his plan, we can \nhave a vote this afternoon. But what we want to do, instead of getting \ninto all these games with only 10 days left where we try to amend each \nother's plan and mess it up and end up with something nobody in the \nworld wants, what we have offered, and very generously offered as the \nmajority--I don't ever remember it happening when we were the minority \non a major bill--we have offered to Senator Kennedy, you take your \nhealth care plan and you write it exactly as you want it and you offer \nit and we will vote on it. And if you get 50 votes, you can get the \nVice President to come over, break the tie, and you are in. You can put \na Government bureaucrat in every examining room, you can have people \nhire lawyers, you can do it however you want to do it. But we think we \nhave a better way.\n  What we would like to say to Senator Kennedy is, we will give you a \nvote on your plan, and then you give us a vote on our plan. If we win \nand you do not, then we go forward with our bill. If you win and we \ndon't, we go forward with your bill. But I am afraid there is a growing \nsuspicion--I would never say this because I try to never be suspicious \nof people's motives--but there are some people who believe all of this \ndiscussion about health care is political. There are some people who \nbelieve that Senator Kennedy does not really want his bill voted on \nbecause he knows it is not going to pass. Some suspect he knows some of \nthe Democrats are not going to vote for it. And I believe he suspects \nour proposal would pass.\n  But the point is, if we really want to vote on health care with just \n10 days left, let's stop all the games; let's let the Democrats sit \ndown in a room and write the best plan they can write and we will not \ntry to amend it. We will not try to stall it. We will let them bring it \nforward, tell us why it is the right idea, and we will vote up or down. \nThen we would like to have the same right on our plan, and if we are \nsuccessful then we can go to the House very quickly, work out our \ndifferences, and let the bill go to the President. If we really want to \ndo something about health care, that is what we need to do.\n  Finally, before my time runs out, I want to simply say that I believe \nthat a lot of work has gone into this issue. I will congratulate \nSenator Kennedy and others for raising the issue. I think we have a \nbetter way, as Republicans. I think our bill is better. I think it \ngives more choice. I congratulate Doug Badger, who has been the staff \ndirector who, through some 25 meetings, has helped us put together, \nwith Senator Nickles' leadership, what I believe is an excellent \nprogram. I would be happy for our program to become law.\n  But we have 10 legislative days left. If we want to have any \nopportunity to do something about health care, there is only one way: \nthe Democrats put together their best bill. If that is Senator \nKennedy's bill, that is fine. If they want to change his bill, we are \nnot going to interfere because we are not trying to make mischief. But \nwe have a better way which we think will improve health care in \nAmerica. We think it will make HMOs more responsive. We think it deals \nwith legitimate concerns without denying millions of people access to \nhealth care because they will not be able to afford it, and it gives \npeople the freedom to choose.\n  Remember the Yellow Pages test. On the Yellow Pages test, if the \nRepublican plan passes and you want a medical savings account--you can \nhave one, but nobody makes you get one. You can do a HMO, you can do \nBlue Cross/Blue Shield, you can do whatever you want to do. But if you \nwant to choose for your family, we put you in a position so when you \ncall up Seth Goldberg--who is ear, nose, throat, facial plastic \nreconstructive surgery--you don't have to go through a gatekeeper, on \nthe Republican plan. You just call up Dr. Goldberg and say, ``Dr. \nGoldberg, I wanted to come see you but I had to ask you a question.''\n  So Dr. Goldberg gets out his big file and he figures we are about to \nask him do you participate in the Joe B. Brown HMO, and he is going to \nlook it up and see if he does. We just simply say, ``Dr. Goldberg, will \nyou take a check?''\n  He is going to say, ``Yes.'' And when he says yes, if your baby has a \nthroat problem, you are going to get to see a specialist and you are \nnot going to have to go through a gatekeeper.\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\n  Senator Kennedy will let you sue if the gatekeeper says no, and he \nwill have a Government bureaucrat there, with your child, if you ever \nget in to see the ear, nose and throat specialist. But the point is, if \nyour baby is sick and your baby has a 104-degree fever, you don't care \nabout suing. You want to go to see Dr. Goldberg.\n  Our plan gets you in the door. Our plan gets your baby medical \nattention because it empowers you. Hallelujah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak in morning business \nfor 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will shortly offer an amendment to the \nFAA bill on the floor. But I could not help but listen to my colleague \nfrom Texas. I should not frame it that way, I ``could not help but \nlisten to him.'' I was here and listened to him, and I couldn't help \nbut have a desire, an urgency to respond to some of it. I shall not do \nthat now, but reserve the time later.\n  I notice he talked about the Kennedy plan. He is probably talking \nabout the plan that is embraced by hundreds of organizations in this \ncountry, by the President, by the American Medical Association, and \nothers who believe that health care ought to be practiced in a doctor's \noffice or in a hospital room, not by some insurance accountant 500 \nmiles away, and who understand the stories we have told on the floor of \nthe Senate about a little boy had cerebral palsy whose HMO says this \nboy only has a 50 percent chance of being able to walk by age 5, and \nthat is insignificant, and therefore we will not give this young boy \nthe kind of therapy he needs. That decision was not made by a doctor. \nThe doctor of that boy recommended therapy. That decision was made by \nan accountant, and had everything to do with an HMO's bottom line, not \nhealth care. That is the issue.\n  The issue is, do patients have a set of rights here? Do patients, \nwhen sick, and who present themselves to a doctor and hospital, have a \nright to know all of their medical options? Or do they have a right to \nknow only the cheapest medical option?\n\n  Does a patient have a right to be taken to an emergency room when \nthey have just broken their neck? I will give you an example of \nsomebody who broke their neck, went to the emergency room, unconscious, \nand the HMO said, ``We can't pay for that because you didn't get prior \nclearance.'' That is health care? That is a decision a doctor would \nmake? I do not think so.\n  That is why doctors across this country, health care professionals \nacross this country, and increasing numbers of people who have been \nherded into these shoots called ``managed care,'' 160 million of them \nare now saying, there needs to be some changes here.\n  Health care ought to be practiced in the doctor's office, in a \nhospital room. I understand there is great passion about this issue. I \nhope this Congress will address this issue. The Senator from Texas \nproposes a way to address it. ``We have a bill; they have a bill. We \nhave a vote; they have a vote.''\n  What about regular order? Why does the Senator from Texas propose \nthat we not have regular order? Bring your bill to the floor--we have \namendments, they have amendments--vote on the amendments one by one. \nHow do you propose to deal with emergency care? What about the choice \nof specialists when you need it? What about the ability to know all of \nyour medical options? What about the issue of bringing managed care to \nthe floor of the Senate, a Patients' Bill of Rights--any version--and \nthen having votes, amendment after amendment after amendment?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10889-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10893-S10901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H.

Interline agreements for domestic transportation.''.\n\n       Between lines 13 and 14 on page 151, insert the following--\n       ``(d) Additional Action.--Under the pilot program \n     established pursuant to subsection (a), the Secretary shall \n     work with air carriers providing service to participating \n     communities and major air carriers serving large hub airports \n     (as defined in section 41731(a)(3)) to facilitate joint fare \n     arrangements consistent with normal industry practice.''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as I indicated when I spoke previously on \nthis bill, I think Senator McCain and Senator Ford have done a \nremarkably good job on this piece of legislation, and I appreciate \ntheir work so much. And I think many involved in airline issues in this \ncountry, such as safety and so many other related issues, feel the same \nway. This is an important piece of legislation, and we very much \nappreciate their good work. I think both of them will be on the floor \nshortly, but I did want to offer the amendment and begin a discussion \nof it.\n  Let me first describe why I felt a requirement to offer an amendment \nof this type. I offered an amendment similar to this in the Commerce \nCommittee and lost by a vote of 11-9. It is interesting to me. I always \nremember the exact vote when I lose--11-9--and somehow that sticks with \nme, because I understand why I lost: there are people who view these \nissues differently.\n  My concern here is about competition in the airline industry. I know \nabout competition. I come from a town of 300 people. I grew up in that \ntown. I was in a high school class of nine. We had one blacksmith. We \nhad one doctor. We had one barber. We had one of almost everything. \nActually, we had a couple of bars. I guess that is probably typical of \na lot of small towns. But we had one of most things. I understand that.\n  The fact is, most of the people who had their exclusive services that \nthey\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\noffered in my hometown always priced their service in a very reasonable \nway. Go to the barber and the haircut was just very little cost. Same \nwas true with the blacksmith. But then, as I left my small hometown in \nsouthwestern North Dakota and started studying economics and lived in \nsome big cities and went off to graduate school and so on, I began to \nunderstand that is not always true in our economy. When you have one \nentity providing a service or a commodity, it is not always true that \nthey will always price that service in the public interest. Sometimes \nthey will price it in their interest.\n  I began to understand what monopolies were. I studied economics. \nActually, I taught economics for a couple years in college. And I have \ntold people I was able to overcome that experience, nonetheless. But I \nunderstood about economic concentration, market dominance.\n  Then I watched what has happened in the airline industry in the last \n20 to 30 years. I understood some of the things that I had studied and \nlearned and understood something in the field of economics relates to \nwhat we are experiencing in this country in the airline industry.\n  In 1938, when the Federal Government began to regulate air \ntransportation, there were 16 carriers--16 carriers--who accounted for \nvirtually all of the air traffic in our country. It was a pretty \nprimitive system back then. If you looked at those airplanes now down \nat the Smithsonian Institution you would say, ``Gee, I'm not sure I \nwould want to ride very far in those airplanes,'' but people did. \nSixteen air carriers accounted for the total traffic in our U.S. \ndomestic market.\n  By 1978, 40 years later, the year that Congress passed something \ncalled deregulation of the airlines, those same 16 carriers had reduced \nto 11. They were merged. A couple went out of business. So you had 11 \ncarriers. Those 11 carriers accounted for 94 percent of all the airline \nbusiness in the country.\n  Today, those 11 carriers have been reduced to seven airline carriers \nbecause of mergers, a couple bankruptcies--a lot of mergers. Those \nseven now account for over 80 percent of all the total traffic. \nAmerican Airlines, Continental Airlines, Delta, Northwest, United and \nUSAir--they account for 95 percent of the total air traffic in the \ndomestic U.S., with their cochair partners.\n  Since deregulation, 1978, it was estimated that we have had about 120 \nnew airlines appear. And then about 200 different airlines have \ndisappeared, appeared, disappeared, merged, been purchased. But we do \nnot have more competition after deregulation; we actually have less \ncompetition.\n  Between 1979 and 1988, there were 51 airline mergers and \nacquisitions. Twenty of those were approved by the Department of \nTransportation after 1985 when it assumed all the jurisdiction over \nmergers and acquisition requests. In fact, the Department of \nTransportation approved every airline merger that was sent to it. You \ndo not need a human being to do that. You do not need somebody that \nbreathes and lives and eats breakfast; all you need is a big rubber \nstamp. If we are going to have a Department of Transportation that will \nsay, ``Gee, no merger is too big. No merger's consequence is too \nsignificant for market dominance. We'll just stamp `approve' with a \nbig, big ink pad and a big stamp,'' we don't need to pay anybody any \nsignificant amount to do that kind of Government work. Every airline \nmerger submitted to it was approved.\n  The 15 independent airlines operating at the beginning of 1986 had \nbeen merged into six megacarriers by the end of 1987.\n  The father of deregulation, Alfred Kahn, testified recently at one of \nour hearings. He said that he had great disappointment in the industry \nconcentration because he said it perverted the purpose of deregulation. \nAnd he pinned most of the blame on mergers and the Department of \nTransportation's approval of all of these mergers.\n  What has happened is that these megacarriers--I will probably \ndescribe in a moment ``megacarriers''--have created competition-free \nzones in effect, securing dominant market shares at regional hubs.\n  Let me describe a couple of these.\n  Atlanta: Atlanta is a big, old city. If you go down to Atlanta, \nAtlanta is bustling. It has an economy that is vibrant, a huge city, \nbig airport, a lot of folks coming and going, a lot of traffic. One \nairline has 82 percent of all traffic in and out of the airport in \nAtlanta.\n  Why would that be the case? A city that big, that vibrant, an economy \nthat strong, one airline virtually dominates the hub? Why? Because that \nis the way the airline companies have sliced up the pie.\n  Charlotte: One airline, 92 percent in and out of Charlotte.\n  Cincinnati: One airline, 94 percent.\n  Dallas-Fort Worth, a big city: One airline, 72 percent.\n  Denver: One airline, 74 percent,\n  Detroit: One airline, 82 percent.\n  Well, I do not need to go through all of them, but you get the \npicture. This is not exactly the picture of a robust American economy \nin which there thrives aggressive, interesting competition, one company \ncompeting with another for the consumers' business, deciding ``I'll \noffer a better product. I'll offer a lower price.'' That is what \ncompetition is about.\n  Most businesses understand competition. The airlines have constructed \na series of regional hubs which have dominance for major carriers, and \nthen they retreat from the kind of competition you would have expected.\n  That is my way of describing my criticism of where we find ourselves. \nI would like to infuse some competition here.\n  I would like to see if we can find ways to say to the major carriers, \n``We need more competition.'' The consumer deserves more competition, \nthe consumer deserves more choices, and the consumer deserves lower \nprices with respect to airlines.\n  We have had plenty of studies about this issue. I come from a \nsparsely populated State, and deregulation has affected us in a much \nmore detrimental way than in other parts of the country. Here are some \nstudies--just a few--that describe deregulation and its impact on small \nStates and rural economies: Airline Competition, Industry Operating and \nMarketing Practices Limit Market Entry; Trends and Air Fares at \nAirports in Small- and Medium-sized Communities; Fares and Competition \nat Small City Airports; Effects of Air Competition and Barriers to \nEntry. The list goes on and on, study after study.\n  We don't need to study this. We know what is happening. We know what \nhas happened. Most of us know what should happen. We should do \nsomething to help provide competition, certainly in areas that are \nunderserved. For areas that used to have service but don't now have jet \nservice, we ought to find some way to allow that service to exist. I \nhave produced a piece of legislation that I think will do that.\n  I mentioned that we had an airline shutdown as a result of a labor \nstrike recently. That shutdown was very inconvenient to a lot of \npeople, but it was much more inconvenient to my State. Just prior to \nderegulation, we had five airline companies flying jets in and out of \nmy State. Now we have one. That one happened to shut down as a result \nof a labor strike. At 12:01 a.m. on August 30, there were no more jet \nflights in and out of our State. It was devastating to North Dakota, to \nthe passengers, and to the economy.\n  That kind of dominance by a carrier I admire. I think the carrier \nthat serves our State is a wonderful carrier. It has some labor \nproblems and other issues, but the fact is, they fly good planes and \nthey have been serving North Dakota for many, many decades. I hope they \nwill continue to serve many decades. I have told their president that \none day there will be another carrier and some competition. Although I \nhope to get them some competition, I want them to stay there because \nthey are a good airline carrier.\n  But I also want to plug some holes in service that does not now \nexist, that should exist, and used to exist. For example, a State like \nNorth Dakota, for 35 years, had jet service connecting North Dakota to \na hub in Denver, CO. After 35 years, that jet service was gone. We no \nlonger have jet service to Denver, CO. The only way a jet service can \nexist between North Dakota and Denver, CO, is if you have a regional \njet service that starts up and can cooperate with and have interline \nand other agreements with the major carrier that dominates in Denver. \nWe had\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\na company that started and tried to do that, but, of course, the major \ncarrier in Denver said, ``We want nothing to do with you; we don't want \nto do interline agreements with you.''\n  So the only passengers they could haul were the passengers going from \nNorth Dakota to Denver. In fact, 70 percent of our people were going \nbeyond Denver. They were flying North Dakota to Denver to Phoenix, to \nTulsa, to Tucson, to Los Angeles, to San Francisco. That airline pulled \nout because they couldn't make it. The large carriers will coshare with \neach other, they will do all kinds of interline agreements with each \nother, but they don't want regional jet service to start up and \nflourish in these regions.\n  I don't understand that. It seems to me it would benefit them to have \nregional jet service startups.\n  However, I proposed something I hope will address this issue in the \nCommerce Committee that lost 11-9, as I mentioned before. I have \nmodified that substantially now. But even with those modifications, it \nembodies the principles I am trying to establish: the opportunity for \nnew regional jet service carriers to compete in a regional market by \nencouraging agreements between new regional jet carriers and large \nairlines with respect to a number of items--gates, baggage, and other \nissues.\n  I will not read the amendment, but let me say that the current \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from the State of Washington, Senator \nGorton, is someone who has spent a great deal of time on airline \nissues. I will be careful not to mischaracterize any of his views. I \nhope it is accurate to say that he has been someone who has felt very \nstrongly that he does not want to move in the direction of reregulating \nair service. While we might disagree on some issues, I very much \nrespect his views, and he has been very strong in asserting his views \non a range of these issues.\n  I have worked with Senator Gorton and others in the last few days to \nsee if we could find agreement on a set of principles in this amendment \nthat will accomplish the purposes and the goals that I want for my \nregion of the country and other regions without abridging the \nprinciples that he has with respect to the consistency, deregulation, \nand other areas. I think we have done that.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk, I believe, is an amendment \nthat is approved by Senator Gorton, who is the chairman of the \nsubcommittee on the Commerce Committee that deals with these issues. I \nwant to say to the Senator I very much appreciate his willingness to \nwork with me to address this issue. It is more urgent than it has been \nin the past, because everyone understands the dilemma that we faced \nwith this shutdown. It could happen again. We have other circumstances \nout there that could very well result in it happening again. I just \nwant the Congress to send a signal that we are going to provide some \nworkable solutions to allow regional carriers to serve areas not now \nserved, in a way that can give them a viable opportunity to make it. \nThat is the purpose of this amendment.\n  I think I have described the amendment without spending time on a \ngreat deal of detail about the amendment itself. I have worked with \nSenator McCain, his staff, and Senator Ford. I recognize that doing \nanything in this area causes some heartburn for some people. There are \nsome who are still not pleased because they would prefer the existing \norder--leave things as they are. Honestly, we can't leave things as \nthey are. We must make some thoughtful changes here. That is what I \npropose to do with my amendment.\n  Since the chairman of the subcommittee and Senator Ford were not \nhere, let me again say I thank them very much for their cooperation. I \nam pleased we were able to work out this amendment. I hope very much \nthey will be able to help me prevail in conference with the House on \nthis very important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from North Dakota, \nno one has worked any harder or had a deeper interest in trying to \naccommodate his constituency. He has been typical Henry Clay in this \noperation; he has been willing to compromise. As Henry Clay said, \ncompromise is negotiated hurt. So he has given up something that hurt, \nand others have, too.\n  I am very pleased we have gotten to this point. If I have any ability \nto help the Senator in conference, I promise him I certainly will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McCain). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to express my agreement with this \namendment and also express my admiration for both the dedication and \nthe persistence of the Senator from North Dakota. It is a quality in \nhim I greatly admire.\n  We did start from very, very different points of view on this \nsubject. Mine emphasized to the greatest extent free market principles \nand a lack of interference, whenever possible, with business \norganizations; his, a deep concern, and an appropriate concern, for \nsmaller cities in which the kind of competitive advantage that my major \ncity, Seattle, clearly has are simply not present.\n  From the beginning, I have thought that his goal was an appropriate \none, to try to see to it that better service was provided his \nconstituents, was proper public policy, and at the same time feared the \nconstrictions that some elements of his amendment imposed.\n  I think at this point we have something with which we can live \ntemporarily. It is not all that the Senator from North Dakota wants. I \ndon't know everything about this field myself.\n  One element of this amendment will try to get us the most objective \npossible information about the nature of the problem and perhaps the \nbest solutions. We will be back--even if this bill passes in its \npresent form--we will be back with another FAA bill in 2 years, all of \nus with much more knowledge.\n  So my tribute to the Senator from North Dakota for his dedication to \na cause that is significant. I hope we have done it in a way that will \nnot damage the competition among major airlines or minor airlines, and \nin a way that will be of some real benefit to his constituents and to \nmany other people in cities across the country in similar areas.\n  I approve of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3636) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also want to add my words of \nappreciation to the Senator from North Dakota. It seems that he and I \nare destined to spend a lot of time together, especially since we are \ngoing to take up the Internet Tax Freedom Act here soon. He and I will \nbe having a vigorous discussion on that.\n  I want to point out something again that I pointed out three times. \nDeregulation of the airlines is a wonderful and marvelous thing and has \ndone great things for America. But when we have a situation where the \nState of the Senator from North Dakota is shut down because of one \nairline going on strike, obviously, we have to look at this whole \nenvironment of competition. Mr. President, it is not right; it is not \nright when an entire region of the country is dependent upon one \nairline. That is true, perhaps to a lesser degree, for other regions in \nthe country. The concerns of the Senator from North Dakota, not only \naffecting his own State but the entire Nation, include the dramatic \ndisparity, according to GAO, of airfares and where there is hub \nconcentration and competition, which is clearly something that is \nindisputable.\n  So it seems to me that the Senator from Washington, chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, and I, and others should devote a lot of \nattention to this issue, as to whether there is true competition and \nwhether people in rural areas and in smaller markets in America are \nbeing deprived as a penalty because of where they live. So I want to \ntell the Senator from North Dakota again, I want to work with him and \nwith the distinguished Senator from Washington, and other members\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\nof the committee, next year as we address this issue.\n  I am afraid, Mr. President, that concentration is increasing rather \nthan decreasing. That trend can only be reversed when we get new \nentrants into the airline business. I am very disappointed at some of \nthe information--much of it anecdotal--that I hear of the major \nairlines basically preventing that competition from beginning, or even \nexisting, for a long period of time.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota and I look forward to more work \nwith him on this issue and other issues, such as Internet tax freedom.\n  I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was thinking as the Senator from Arizona \ntalked about fares, the ultimate objective of more competition is more \nkinds of service and lower fares. I pointed out on the Commerce \nCommittee--and I thought maybe I should for my colleagues on the \nfloor--the disparity in fares. I pointed out in the Commerce Committee \nthat we may fly from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles to go to Disneyland \nand see Mickey Mouse, which is all the way across the country. Or, \ninstead, we could choose to fly to Bismarck, ND, which is half the \ntrip, and see the world's largest cow sitting on a hill outside New \nSalem. If you wanted to see Salem Sue, the largest cow in the world, \nyou would pay twice as much to go half as far than if you were to go \nsee Mickey Mouse.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is that cow alive?\n  Mr. DORGAN. No; the cow is dead. Because you might be interested in \ngoing there, I will tell you that it is a big metal cow that sits on a \nhill.\n  My point is that we have a fare structure that says you can go twice \nas far and pay half as much. Or, if you choose, if you want to go half \nas far, you get to pay twice as much. People talk about bureaucrats, \nand the discussion here a while ago was about bureaucrats and the HMO \nissue. I can't think of many Americans who could sit down and develop a \nrate structure that says, ``You know, we are going to tell people that \nif they will just go farther, we will cut their ticket in half, but if \nthey don't go as far, we will double their price,'' and think that \nmarketing strategy has any relevance at all. That has everything to do \nwith competition. Where there isn't competition, they will price at \nwhatever they want to price. Where there is competition, of course, \nprices must come down because that is the regulator in the competitive \nsystem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. I want to say that I am going to \nurge all of my colleagues to go view that cow.\n  Mr. FORD. At twice the price.\n  Mr. McCAIN. At twice the price.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I wonder if that cow gives milk.\n  Mr. DORGAN. No.\n  Mr. FORD. You could prime it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also want to say again to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, I was in Iowa, strangely enough, and I found out--to \nvalidate the point of the Senator from North Dakota--that it costs more \nto fly from Des Moines, IA, to Chicago, IL, than it does from Chicago, \nIL, to Tokyo. Now, these distortions have to be fixed because we are \npenalizing Americans who don't have access to major hubs. That is not \nfair to the American citizens. I know that the Senator from North \nDakota will not give up on this particular issue.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to raise an important issue \nwith chairman of the Commerce Committee.\n  I strongly support vigorous competition in the aviation industry. \nCompetition provides greater travel opportunities at lower prices for \nthe people of New York. As the Chairman knows, when discussing \nincreased activities at major airports we must be very mindful of the \nimpact that aircraft noise has on surrounding communities.\n  A new start-up airline intends to provide new low-fare jet service \nout of JFK International Airport and is willing to purchase a number of \nnew Stage III aircraft to place into service in New York. These \naircraft will be the quietest aircraft manufactured, even quieter than \naircraft that are retro-fitted with Stage III technology known as \n``hush kits.'' In selecting airlines to receive slot exemptions to \nenhance competition at JFK, the Secretary should give preference to the \nquietest aircraft willing to fill such slots, which, as I said, would \nbe newly manufactured Stage III jets.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would like to amplify the comments of my colleague \nfrom New York on aircraft noise. I strongly endorse increasing travel \nopportunities and lower air fares for the traveling public, especially \nin upstate New York where we have some of the highest air fares in the \ncountry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would strongly agree with the Senators from New York. \nNoise is an important issue and all considerations held equal the \nSecretary should give preference to the quietest aircraft in the \nawarding of slot exemptions at JFK.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3635\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Moynihan \namendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I understand that this is acceptable on both \nsides.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask that Senators Chafee, Kennedy, and \nD'Amato be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I understand that the amendment is \nacceptable to our distinguished managers. I earlier indicated if that \nwould be the case, I would ask that the yeas and nays be vitiated, and \nI do that now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to vitiating the yeas and \nnays?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I ask that the amendment be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3635) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the managers.\n  If I might just add a little tale, the manager remarked about Chicago \nand Hong Kong. In the city of Rochester, a major city in our State, and \nin the Nation, the flight to Chicago and the flight to Hong Kong cost \nexactly the same. And the Kodak company, as I understand it, has taken \nto having their employees who do business in Chicago drive there. There \nis something deeply mistaken about all of this. Thank heaven, we have \nyou here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from New York. I thank him for his \nabiding concern about Rochester, Ithaca, a number of small- and medium-\nsized markets in his State that, frankly, have great difficulty getting \nto New York City, at great expense. I believe his amendment will be \nhelpful in that direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am concerned about the provisions in \nsections 606 and 607 of this legislation which would increase the \nnumber of flights and grant exemptions to the 1,250-mile nonstop \nperimeter rule at Reagan Washington National Airport. These changes \nwould alter longstanding Federal policies and agreements governing the \noperations of the three Washington area airports--Reagan National, \nDulles, and BWI--and could result in unacceptable noise impacts for \ntens of thousands of citizens living in the flight path of Reagan \nNational along the Potomac.\n  I recognize that the chairman and other Members are concerned about \npotential barriers to entry of new carriers at Reagan Washington \nNational. While recognizing this, I think we must seek a careful \nbalance between the benefits of increased competition and legitimate \nconcerns of our citizens about aircraft noise. Anyone who lives in the \nflight path of Reagan Washington National Airport knows what a serious \nproblem aircraft noise poses for human health, and even for performing \ndaily activities.\n  Despite having restrictive nighttime noise rules, aircraft noise \nremains a major concern for many of our citizens who live in Reagan \nWashington National's flight path.\n  The Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, a coalition of \ncitizens\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\nand civic associations which has been working for more than a decade to \nreduce aircraft noise in the Washington metropolitan area, has analyzed \ndata from a recent Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority report \nwhich shows that approximately 1/3 of the 32 noise-monitoring stations \nin the region have a day-night average sound level which is higher than \nthe 65-decibel level that has been established by the EPA and the \nAmerican National Standards Institute as a threshold above which \nresidential living is considered compatible.\n  Addressing existing noise impacts and the impacts of noise from \nfurther flights into Reagan Washington National Airport must, \ntherefore, be a top priority.\n  Senators Mikulski, Robb, and Warner have joined with me in framing \nsome amendments to the pending bill to address the potential impact \nthat would arise from increasing the slots and changing the perimeter \nat National Airport. These amendments seek to provide a noise safety \nnet to mitigate adverse environmental noise consequences of exemptions \nto the existing operating rules.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI, Mr. President, today, I rise to offer three amendments \nwith my colleague, Senator Sarbanes to address the needs of my \nconstituents in regard to this legislation.\n  I also note that I am a proud co-sponsor of two amendments offered by \nSenator Warner of Virginia that further addresses our citizens \nconcerns.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that I am opposed to any \nchanges in the perimeter rule and slot rules at Ronald Reagan National \nAirport.\n  I believe the present balance among the three regional airports \nserves the public well. The present slot rules governing Reagan \nNational work well and should be maintained.\n  However, I recognize that this legislation has overwhelming support \nin the Senate and will pass with a majority vote.\n  As a result, Senator Sarbanes and I have crafted two amendments to \nminimize any potential impact from changes to the slot and perimeter \nrules.\n  The first amendment creates a mandatory set-aside of federal funds to \nmitigate any noise impacts that arise from changes to the perimeter and \nslot rules.\n  The amendment requires the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority \nto set aside no less than ten percent of their federal funds to prevent \nnoise pollution in areas affected by noise from National and Dulles \nInternational Airports.\n  For my constituents, this means that they will be eligible for \nfinancial assistance to soundproof their homes and schools. This \namendment will ensure that residents in Montgomery and Prince Georges \nCounties will finally get some relief from noise that impacts their \ncommunities.\n  Currently, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority does not \nutilize federal funds for noise mitigation activities.\n  This amendment will ensure that federal funds are used for noise \nmitigation. For the first time, federal funds will be dedicated to \nreducing noise in the Washington area.\n  The second amendment requires that any new slots be distributed \nevenly during the day to avoid the possibility of stacking new flights \nearly in the morning or in the evening.\n  I want to make sure that my constituents do not suffer additional \nnoise during the time they are at home in the morning or the evening. \nWhen families are together, they should not have to endure additional \naircraft noise when enjoying their breakfast or dinner.\n  The third amendment gives the Washington Airports Authority and the \nState of Maryland priority consideration for airport improvement \ngrants.\n  Because Maryland is affected by changes to the perimeter and slot \nrules, this area should receive priority consideration.\n  In addition, to the amendments sponsored by myself and Senator \nSarbanes, we have worked closely with Senator Warner on two other \namendments to further address the needs of our constituents.\n  One amendment requires a formal environmental review and public \nhearing before new slot exemptions are granted at Reagan National.\n  I believe this is fair and necessary to ensure that our constituents \nhave a role in this process and have their voices heard.\n  A second amendment seeks to guarantee that the pending nominations to \nthe Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board are confirmed in \nan expeditious manner.\n  A fully functioning board is necessary to proceed with the \nmodernization of Reagan National and Dulles and I support the pending \nnominations.\n  Mr. President, I could not stop this bill, so Senator Sarbanes and I \ndecided to change it.\n  For the first time, we succeeded in providing funds for noise \nmitigation for our constituents.\n  While I would have preferred no changes to the slot and perimeter \nrules, I believe our amendments will go a long way to reducing noise \nimpact for our constituents.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3637\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure that certain funds made available to the \n     Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority are used for noise \n                  compatibility planning and programs)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send the first of these amendments to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3637.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 607(c), as included in the manager's \n     amendment, and insert the following:\n       (c) MWAA Noise-Related Grant Assurances.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to any condition for approval \n     of an airport development project that is the subject of a \n     grant application submitted to the Secretary of \n     Transportation under chapter 471 of title 49, United States \n     Code, by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, the \n     Authority shall be required to submit a written assurance \n     that, for each such grant made to the Authority for fiscal \n     year 1999 or any subsequent fiscal year--\n       (A) the Authority will make available for that fiscal year \n     funds for noise compatibility planning and programs that are \n     eligible to receive funding under chapter 471 of title 49, \n     United States Code, in an amount not less than 10 percent of \n     the aggregate annual amount of financial assistance provided \n     to the Authority by the Secretary as grants under chapter 471 \n     of title 49, United States Code; and\n       (B) the Authority will not divert funds from a high \n     priority safety project in order to make funds available for \n     noise compatibility planning and programs.\n       (2) Waiver.--The Secretary of Transportation may waive the \n     requirements of paragraph (1) for any fiscal year for which \n     the Secretary determines that the Metropolitan Washington \n     Airports Authority is in full compliance with applicable \n     airport noise compatibility planning and program requirements \n     under part 150 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       (3) Sunset.--This subsection shall cease to be in effect 5 \n     years after the date of enactment of this Act, if on that \n     date the Secretary of Transportation certifies that the \n     Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has achieved full \n     compliance with applicable noise compatibility planning and \n     program requirements under part 150 of title 14, Code of \n     Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to assure \nthat the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority provide funding for \nnoise abatement activities such as soundproofing of homes and schools, \nbuying homes that are affected by noise, and improving land use \nplanning. It provides that the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority will expend at least 10 percent of its FAA grant money on \nnoise compatibility planning and programming.\n  Let me note in submitting this amendment that MWAA is currently \nspending hundreds of millions of dollars of capital improvement at \nReagan National, yet it is not spending a dime on the noise abatement \nactivities. By comparison, Chicago O'Hare is currently spending $205 \nmillion of its passenger facility charges on noise abatement and \nmitigation activities.\n  In my own State of Maryland, BWI is spending a substantial portion of \nits AIP fund for noise mitigation efforts. In fact, since enactment of \nthe AIP program, the Maryland Aviation Administration has received 46 \nAIP\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\ngrants for BWI, totaling approximately $119 million. Seventeen of these \ngrants, totaling more than $52 million, were for noise mitigation. In \nother words, 44 percent of all AIP grants for BWI have been for noise \nmitigation activities.\n  In direct contrast, since 1991, when Reagan Washington National \nAirport first became eligible for AIP funds, the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority has received $106 million in AIP \ndiscretionary entitlement funds and none of those funds for financing \nof the airport's passenger facilities charges has been used for noise \nabatement activity.\n  I understand that the rationale that MWAA has given for not spending \nany funds for noise abatement was that it cannot have a 150 noise \ncompatibility plan approved by FAA. Now that it has such an approved \nplan, it is time that AIP funds be spent to provide some relief for \nnoise-impacted communities.\n  This amendment seeks to have the Federal Government address the need \nfor greater balance between airport expansion and associated \nenvironmental impact. I know this is an issue that the chairman has \ntaken an interest in. I know he raised it in confirmation hearings with \nrespect to members of the MWAA. We very much welcome his interest. We \nhave tried to work with the committee as we deal with these amendments.\n  It is my understanding that the amendment is acceptable to the \ncommittee. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to congratulate both Senators from \nMaryland who have been steadfast and tenacious in their efforts to \nfurther not only improve BWI but also Washington National and Dulles \nAirports.\n  Senator Sarbanes I think has a very important amendment. Noise \nabatement is a very serious issue. I am glad to say that at least \npartially due to his efforts, BWI has made significant improvements. \nUnfortunately, that has not been the case with Reagan National Airport, \nwhich is interesting. That is one of the things that Senator Sarbanes \nis trying to do with this amendment, and is doing at all airports in \nthe Washington metropolitan area under the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority's work on noise compatibility, planning, and \nprograms.\n  I think this is an excellent amendment. I thank the Senator for the \namendment. We obviously support it. But I know the Senator has other \namendments.\n  I want to additionally state that I understand how difficult some of \nthese issues are for the Senators from Maryland, especially Senator \nSarbanes who has been involved with these airports for many, many \nyears. I think Senator Sarbanes was involved with these airports when \nDulles was viewed as a white elephant, and now certainly it is a very \nbusy airport.\n  I was pleased--and I know Senator Sarbanes was--the other day to see \nan article in the Washington Post that says business at BWI is at an \nall-time high. It has turned into an outstanding facility.\n  I thank Senator Sarbanes not only for his amendment but the following \namendments in his efforts to help the Metropolitan Airports Authority, \nthe districts, and his willingness to work with us on what is a very \ncontentious issue amongst his constituents. I thank him for it.\n  Mr. President, I believe there is no more debate on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Hearing none, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3637) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3638\n\n   (Purpose: To mitigate adverse environmental noise consequences of \n   exemptions of additional air carrier slots added to Ronald Reagan \n         Washington National Airport as a result of exemption)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3638.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 607(a)(2), as included the manager's amendment, \n     in section 41716(c) of title 49, United States Code, as added \n     by that section, strike paragraph (2) and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(2) General exemptions.--The exemptions granted under \n     subsections (a) and (b) may not increase the number of \n     operations at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in \n     any 1-hour period during the hours between 7:00 a.m. and 9:59 \n     p.m. by more than 2 operations.''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to mitigate the \nenvironmental noise consequences of new air carrier slots added to the \nRonald Reagan National Airport inventory. By precluding air carrier \nslot clustering during the operational day, it would prohibit more than \ntwo new operations per hour during the period between 7 a.m. and 9:59 \np.m.\n  It seeks to achieve a more appropriate balance between the commercial \ninterests of air carriers, the demands of the traveling and shipping \npublic, and the concerns of residents living under the flight pattern. \nWe understand the addition of the slots. This is primarily an effort to \nspread them out over the course of the operational day and to prevent \nheavy clustering, particularly in the early morning or late evening \nhours. I understand the committee feels that this is compatible with \nthe objectives we are trying to seek.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment. I think it is \nimportant. I know both sides support it. I believe there is no further \ndebate on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3638) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3639\n\n   (Purpose: To mitigate adverse environmental noise consequences of \n    exemptions for Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport flight \n     operations by making available financial assistance for noise \n                  compatibility planning and programs)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3639.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike the first subsection designated as subsection (d) in \n     section 607, as included in the manager's amendment, and \n     insert the following:\n       (d) Noise Compatibility Planning and Programs.--Section \n     47117(e) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Subject to section 47114(c), to promote the timely \n     development of the forecast of cumulative noise exposure and \n     to ensure a coordinated approach to noise monitoring and \n     mitigation in the region of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, \n     Maryland, the Secretary shall give priority to any grant \n     application made by the Metropolitan Washington Airports \n     Authority or the State of Maryland for financial assistance \n     from funds made available for noise compatibility planning \n     and programs.''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to mitigate adverse \nconsequences of the exemptions from the rules governing Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport flight operations by requiring the \nSecretary of Transportation to make both the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority and the State of Maryland eligible for priority \nconsideration when the FAA distributes noise discretionary funds under \nthe Airport Improvement Program. With increases in the amount of \nflights at Reagan National--and these other two airports are \ninterrelated, of course, Dulles and BWI--the problem of noise pollution \nis likely to grow, and it is vital that we make prudent investments in \nnoise abatement activities.\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\n  Therefore, we seek this priority status in order to be able to ensure \nthat we are doing everything we can to soundproof homes and schools and \ntake other steps to address the noise pollution problem for those \nliving in the flight paths.\n  I understand, Mr. President, that the committee has, as it were, a \nrefinement of this amendment, and this is certainly acceptable to us.\n  I, again, express my appreciation to the chairman and the ranking \nmember for working with us in such a positive and constructive way on \nthis issue.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3640 to Amendment No. 3639\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3640 to amendment No. 3639.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7, strike through line 10 and insert the following:\n       ``(3) The Secretary shall give priority in making grants \n     under paragraph (1)(A) to applications for airport noise \n     compatibility planning and programs at and around airports \n     where operations increase under title VI of the Wendell H. \n     Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of \n     1998 and amendments made by that title.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in consultation with Senator Sarbanes, \nthis amendment basically ensures that neighborhoods around high-density \nairports are eligible for priority consideration for noise mitigation \nfunding. It is an acceptable amendment.\n  I believe the Senator from Maryland accepts it and believes it is of \nsome improvement to his amendment. I know of no further debate on the \namendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I understand it, this reference to \nthe high-density airport encompasses what I was specifically directing \ntoward, but it gives it a more general statement, and it is certainly \nacceptable to us in light of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further discussion on the amendment?\n  If there is no objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3640) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, again I thank Senator McCain and ranking \nmember Ford for their cooperation throughout this effort. As the \nchairman has recognized, this is a very sensitive problem, and we \nrecognize what the chairman and others are seeking to accomplish here \nin terms of increased competition in further flights, but we felt it \nnecessary, obviously, to press the case for the noise mitigation \nproblem. I must say both the chairman and ranking member have \nrecognized that problem. We think what we have proposed here will help \nsolve that.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator from Maryland. \nI believe we have taken significant measures to mitigate any additional \nnoise problems that may result upon passage of this legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3641\n\n    (Purpose: To require the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n Administration to conduct a demonstration project to require aircraft \n   to maintain a minimum altitude over Taos Pueblo and the Blue Lake \n  Wilderness Area of Taos Pueblo, New Mexico, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     for himself and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3641.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

AIRLINE MARKETING DISCLOSURE.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Air carrier.--The term ``air carrier'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 40102 of title 49, United States \n     Code.\n       (2) Air transportation.--The term ``air transportation'' \n     has the meaning given that term in section 40102 of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n       (b) Final Regulations.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall promulgate final regulations to provide \n     for improved oral and written disclosure to each consumer of \n     air transportation concerning the corporate name of the air \n     carrier that provides the air transportation purchased by \n     that consumer. In issuing the regulations issued under this \n     subsection the Secretary shall take into account the proposed \n     regulations issued by the Secretary on January 17, 1995, \n     published at 60 Fed. Reg. 3359.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue which \naffects many of our nation's air travelers. I am pleased to offer an \namendment to the Senate's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \nreauthorization bill which requires the Secretary of Transportation to \nimplement regulations that ensure airline passengers are more aware of \nthe true corporate identity of the airline on which they are flying.\n  I am pleased that the managers of the FAA reauthorization legislation \nhave agreed to accept my amendment to their bill. I believe this \namendment will go a long way to ensure that airline passengers are \nbetter informed.\n  As you know, Mr. President, following the deregulation of the airline \nindustry in the late 1970's, major airlines began to enter into \ncooperative agreements with smaller airlines to offer air \ntransportation service to smaller, underserved areas. Common in such \nagreements is the practice of ``code-sharing,'' where the smaller \nindependent airlines use the name and identification code of the larger \nairline. For example, for a two-leg ``code-shared'' flight, where a \nlarge air carrier operates one leg and a smaller commuter\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\ncarrier operates the other, air service for both flight segments is \nlisted under the same identification code. As such, consumers \npurchasing ``code-shared'' air service are frequently unaware of the \nactual corporate identity of the smaller commuter airline on which they \nare flying.\n  Mr. President, this lack of disclosure can cause consumers to be \ncompletely unaware of the true identity of their transporting air \ncarrier, and therefore, lessen a consumer's ability to make the most \ninformed transportation decision.\n  Mr. President, under current law, U.S. air carrier ticket agents are \nrequired to verbally indicate to consumers the corporate identity of \nthe airline they are flying on, when a ticket is purchased.\n  However, in practice, Mr. President, these verbal disclosure rules \nare difficult to enforce. Furthermore, the rules are not applied \nuniversally because they do not cover travel agents, who sell a \nmajority of the airline tickets issued in the United States.\n  As a result, Mr. President, consumers are often surprised to discover \nthat a segment of their flight, although listed under the ``code'' or \nname of a large air carrier, could be serviced by a different airline.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not mean to suggest that smaller commuter \nairlines are not safe, nor, do I mean to diminish the valuable service \n``code-sharing'' arrangements bring to many smaller and rural areas in \nthe nation. Rather, I want to help ensure that consumers are aware of \nthe true identity of the airline they are scheduled to fly on.\n  For these reasons, I offered this amendment to require stronger \nairline ticketing disclosure rules, an issue the Department of \nTransportation recently considered.\n  Indeed, in 1994, the Department of Transportation proposed a rule to \nrequire that at the time of sale, travel or airline ticket agents \nprovide consumers with written notification of each airline's corporate \nname that participate in ``code-sharing'' agreements. The Department \nasserted such steps would help to ensure that a consumer had a complete \nunderstanding of the transportation they were purchasing. However, to \ndate, the Department has not issued a final rule on this matter.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Transportation was on the right \ntrack, and we need to encourage the DOT to follow through and implement \nbetter ticketing disclosure regulations to help better inform \nconsumers. My amendment is simple and straightforward, and does just \nthat. It requires the DOT to implement regulations 90 days after \nenactment of this bill requiring improved written and oral notification \nof the corporate name of ``code-sharing'' airlines. Such requirements \nwould inform consumers of the identity of the air transportation \ncarrier actually providing service, and thereby allow consumers to make \nmore informed purchasing decisions. My amendment also grants the DOT \nflexibility in this process, and allows the Department to choose the \nmethod it deems most appropriate to achieve this goal.\n  Mr. President, the basis for my amendment is also straightforward: \nJust four years ago, a constituent of mine, Ms. Pauline Josefson, of \nWarwick, Rhode Island died in a commuter airline crash. The airline she \nflew on was listed under a major carrier's identification code.\n  Ms. Josefson had every reason to assume that the air service she had \npurchased was that of the major carrier, as her airline tickets \nindicated. However, she was flying on a plane piloted by an individual \nwho had been repeatedly criticized by other airlines for poor \nperformance and flying ability. If the little known airline's actual \ncorporate name had been disclosed when the ticket was purchased, Ms. \nJosefson would have had an opportunity to make a fully informed travel \ndecision.\n  I share the concerns of the Josefson family and others that airline \nconsumers deserve greater disclosure. That is why I have offered this \namendment today, Mr. President, which is supported by the Aviation \nConsumer Action Project, a non-profit organization dedicated to the \nsafety and protection of the flying public, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter of support for this amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Aviation Consumer\n\n\n                                               Action Project,\n\n                                               September 24, 1998.\n     Re: legislation requiring airline disclosure of code sharing \n         arrangements to consumers.\n\n     Senator Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: In response to your request for our \n     comments concerning your draft legislation on code sharing \n     disclosure, the Aviation Consumer Action Project supports \n     such a measure as necessary to curb a common deceptive \n     marketing practice by airlines which is not permitted in \n     other industries.\n       General Motors cannot sell you a Cadillac then deliver a \n     Toyota or even a Mercedes without first informing the \n     customer. Only the airlines are except from state and local \n     consumer protection and deceptive advertising laws and even \n     most federal labeling laws. The U.S. DOT is the exclusive \n     agency protecting aviation consumers since the enactment of \n     the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978.\n       Airlines, using techniques known as ``code sharing'' and \n     ``wet leases'', are now allowed to sell consumers tickets on \n     other airlines as though they were their own. So for example, \n     someone booking a flight on a U.S. carrier to Warsaw, Poland \n     may actually be flying from New York to London on an American \n     carrier and then to Poland on Lod Airlines (the Polish \n     national carrier) at both a higher cost than if tickets were \n     separately booked and with what most would regard as a lower \n     level of safety and service. Similarly, many airlines use \n     prop commuter airplanes that they do not own or operate with \n     a U.S. carrier brand name like ``Delta Connection''. After \n     the recent crash of Swissair 111 which killed all on board, \n     it was disclosed that 53 of the passengers were actually \n     Delta passengers, flying under an apparently undisclosed code \n     sharing agreement. Such marketing arrangements are inherently \n     deceptive and should be prohibited, unless disclosed in \n     advance to the airline passenger. The consumer can then \n     decide whether to purchase the ticket or call another \n     airline.\n       The consumer notice should be in the form as proposed by \n     the U.S. DOT in 1995 which was never acted upon, i.e. \n     ``IMPORTANT NOTICE: Service between XYZ City and ABC City \n     will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines'', and in advertising \n     airlines should be required to identify the carrier(s) that \n     will actually provide the service by corporate name.\n       Should you wish further comments, please do not hesitate to \n     contact the undersigned.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to talk just a few minutes on \nthis bill, particularly with respect to rural air service and some of \nthe problems that we face in areas with small towns and small \npopulations.\n  First, let me say that I certainly support what the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Kentucky are doing here. I think this is a \nvaluable bill, and I think we should move forward with it quickly.\n  I do want to emphasize, however, the difficulty that we have in rural \nAmerica with regard to air transportation. I\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\nmust confess that it is not a new problem. As we deregulate various \nindustries--and I happen to be for deregulation and letting competition \nwork--we find ourselves with some problems in rural areas, whether it \nbe telephones, or the deregulation of electricity, or air \ntransportation. The obvious effect of deregulation is that capital and \nfacilities, in this case airplanes, move to where there is the greatest \nusage, where there is the highest density.\n  So we have made some arrangements, for instance, in telephones with \nuniversal service to ensure that despite the fact that the real \nadvantages of competition go to where the heavy volume is, we do \ncontinue to provide service to rural areas.\n  My State of Wyoming is struggling to maintain dependable, scheduled, \navailable air service to airline hubs like Denver and Salt Lake City. \nWe are in the process of seeking to strengthen our economy there, to \nrecruit businesses to move to Wyoming. Travel and tourism is one of the \nthree major economic activities in Wyoming, and so transportation is a \nvital component of our future. But we are having some problems.\n  Last year, for example, Mesa Airlines, which operated as United \nExpress, pulled service from five towns in Wyoming that they had been \nservicing in years past. I worked with Senator Enzi, my associate here, \nCongresswoman Cubin, the Governor, and others, and we finally were able \nto keep service to these towns. In fact, we had to go all the way to \nthe chairman of the board of United Airlines to make this happen. \nUnfortunately, in most of these towns, we were only able to keep \nEssential Air Service (EAS). This provides just a bare minimum of \nservice and I am glad we have it, but it does not provide the kind of \nservice that is necessary if you are really going to have economic \ngrowth and development. In addition, in other Wyoming communities we \ncontinue to face cutbacks in the number of seats that are available \nevery day as well as the loss of jet service to some of these towns.\n  Those of you who are familiar with Jackson Hole, WY, know that it is \na travel town. That is where a great number of people come and go. It \nis just devastating to the local economy when there are not enough \nseats to service demand.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, I am in favor of deregulation. I think \nthat makes for healthy competition. But I am concerned that sometimes \nwe have to try another approach. As I mentioned, the investment in \ndollars nationally--and I understand it--go to where the yield is. They \ngo to where the traffic is. That, I do think we have to understand. But \nwe met with Delta Airlines which serves Salt Lake City and Jackson \nHole, WY, and talked a little bit about the fact that there is a need \nfor service, and frankly if we do not have service in some of these \nplaces I think you are going to see a continued interest in going back \nto some re-regulation in air service. I hope it doesn't come to that.\n  Part of the problem, as I understand it, is the so-called code-share \nagreements between the big carriers and the commuters airlines. If you \ngo to Denver from Casper, WY, a part of that fare subsidizes the cost \nof the trip that takes you from Denver to Washington. That does not \nseem right. That isn't the way it ought to be.\n\n  These airlines are basically moving toward a monopolistic situation \nin the large ``hub'' airports, served almost entirely by one carrier, \nwhich makes serving rural America very difficult because then those \nairlines can dictate everything--fares, schedules, you name it.\n  This is kind of unusual for me. I am a marketplace guy. I am one who \nwants competition. But I also firmly believe that when it comes to \nthese vital services, there has to be a way to ensure that all of \nAmerica will be served.\n  I have been involved, because of my chairmanship of the Subcommittee \non East Asia, in the rights to go overseas--``beyond rights.'' I have \nto think, myself, why are we spending a lot of time and energy talking \nabout expanding air service to somewhere in China when you can't go to \nCody, WY?\n  So that's the situation we find ourselves in today. I don't have all \nthe answers. But I do know that we will continue to work at this issue \nin Congress. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program works well. But we \nneed to do more. Dependable and safe air travel is an economic lifeline \nfor our State, as it is whether you are in Boston or whether you are in \nSan Francisco. We depend on tourism and small businesses to drive our \neconomy in Wyoming.\n  We need to come up with a long-term solution to this problem. \nHopefully, it will be done in the marketplace so it will be something \nthat is not forced upon the airlines. However, it is hard for me, as I \nsaid earlier, to get excited about working on ``beyond rights,'' when \nwe can't get to our own towns.\n  I am glad we are considering this bill. We need to get this done so \nour airports can be financed. I am very involved in what is going on \nwith Wyoming's air service. I happen to be a private pilot and have \nflown quite often into these airports. I know how important it is for \nus to have that air service.\n  I commend the Senators who have worked on this bill. I suggest we \nalways need to keep in mind those rural areas to which we find it \ndifficult to provide service.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3643\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the \nforeign policy catastrophe unraveling in Kosovo. Yogi Berra \nimmortalized the phrase ``this is deja vu all over again''--and that is \njust what we are seeing in Kosovo--Bosnia, all over again. Today, just \nlike yesterday and the day before, men, women, and children in Kosovo \nare living and dying witnesses to a rerun of the tragic experience \nsuffered by Bosnia for three brutal years. Hundreds of thousands of \ncivilians are, once again, the victims of our false promises and a \ndeeply flawed policy.\n  Take a minute to review the events as they have unfolded on the \nground to establish exactly what I think Belgrade has learned about \nUnited States policy. What Milosevic and his mafia have figured out \nis--we bluster and threaten,\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\nwe issue ultimatums and condemnations, but the policy is hollow, the \nthreats are empty, the show is a charade.\n  A recent Congressional Research Service chronology provides stark \nevidence of this sad pattern of Western threats and demands, always \nswiftly challenged by vicious Serbian violence and assaults against \nKosovo's civilians. And, the response to these attacks? Concessions and \ninaction.\n  The United States has not failed alone. We are joined in this \ncollective dishonor by the G-7 nations, the OSCE, the European Union, \nthe Contact Group, and even the United Nations which have individually \nand collectively reneged on commitments made to take action to stop the \nbloodshed, to produce a cease-fire, to prompt a withdrawal of Serb \ntroops, and to protect the rapidly mounting numbers of refugees and \ndisplaced people.\n  The CRS report tell us:\n  On January 8, the six nations of the Contact Group declared Kosovo a \nmatter of priority urging a peaceful dialogue to begin between parties. \nThis message was reinforced by Special Envoy Gelbard in meetings with \nMilosevic in Belgrade. The response, within days, was attacks by the \nSerbian police on a small village leaving ethnic Albanians dead and \nmore wounded. While this was a relatively small assault, the beginning \nof the coming trend was marked by 20,000 people turning out for the \nfuneral in protest of that action.\n  On February 23, Gelbard announced some minor concessions to the Serbs \nincluding restoring landing rights for their airlines. At the same time \nthe Contact Group foreign ministers issued a statement expressing \nconcern about the lack of progress in dialogue. In an attempt at \nbalance and fairness they even condemned terrorist acts by the Kosovo \nLiberation Army and reiterated their lack of support for Kosovo \nindependence.\n  What did the Serbs do in response to these generous gestures? Within \nthree days, Serbian forces launched major attacks on villages in \ncentral Kosovo. CRS reports the attacks were ``spearheaded by thousands \nof Serbian police and Interior Ministry troops and resulted in 20 to 30 \ndeaths mostly of ethnic Albanians.''\n  On March 2, the United Stats and the European Union joined voices in \ncondemning violence by Serb forces. On March 5, Serb police and special \nanti-terrorist units ``began their second largest offensive in central \nKosovo. KLA strongholds were attacked with armored vehicles and \nhelicopter gun ships * * * the assault continued for 2 days and claimed \nthe lives of 6 police officers and over 50 Kosovar Albanians.''\n  On March 4, Mr. Gelbard said, ``I guarantee you we simply won't brook \nany renewal of violence,'' followed on March 7, by Secretary Albright \nwho issued her now famous ultimatum. She said, Milosevic ``will have to \npay a price. The international community will not stand by and watch \nthe Serbian authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away \nwith doing in Bosnia.'' Her statement was backed up by a Contact Group \ndeclaration demanding Milosevic take specific steps within ten days \nincluding withdrawing paramilitary troops and allowing Red Cross access \nconflict zones.\n  As the Contact Group was issuing its statement, in a gruesome public \nspectacle, Serb troops dumped 51 bodies at a warehouse, each one an \nethnic Albanian, 25 of them were women and children. Before \ninternational forensics experts could complete autopsies, the Serbs \nbulldozed the bodies into a mass grave.\n  This pattern of challenge and brutal response continued weekly \nthrough the spring and summer. Threats of western actions have been \ndismissed by Serb attacks, after attack, after attack.\n  Villages are shelled, burned and looted. Crops and fields are burned. \nThe death toll and refugee population swells. Yesterday a Kosovo \njournalist told me that the Serbs have now destroyed 400 of the 700 \nvillages in Kosovo.\n  And, the world watches. Deja vu all over again.\n  I thought we had reached an all time low in June when 84 NATO planes \ncarried out a six nation exercise in Albania and Macedonia intended as \na show of strength and force. The Washington Post summed up the events \nsaying, ``Yugoslavia's reply to threats of NATO air strikes could be \nheard for miles around in the nightly bombardment of border villages.''\n  Mr. President, the tragedy continues. Winter's cold curtain now falls \nupon the weakened shoulders of tens of thousands of families expelled \nfrom their homes, in hiding in the mountains and forests of Kosovo. \nSoon, we will begin to see the heart-rending, pitiful images of ailing, \nelderly women, clutching babies and toddlers, every possession they \ncould salvage strapped to their backs, stagger out of hiding, hoping to \ncross borders into safe haven, but more likely, stumbling into harm's \nway.\n  And, this time, Mr. President, the consequences of inertia are deadly \nserious. I agree with Ambassador Holbrooke's assessment that Kosovo is \n``the most explosive tinderbox in the region.'' Unlike Bosnia, the \nlong-standing frictions involving Kosovars, Albanian, Serbs, and \nMacedonians have consequences in Greece and Turkey--precarious NATO \npartners in the best of times.\n  The conditions in Kosovo have demanded action for months. Instead we \nhave been a state of policy stall. Now, as much in recognition of the \nweather, the Administration has turned a lethal pattern of appeasement \ninto a dangerous policy of collaboration and containment.\n  Let me point to two examples of the current approach which seeks a \npartnership with Belgrade rather than protection of innocent refugees. \nAs conditions worsen, the Administration seems seized with a \ncontainment strategy, which balances on improving delivery of relief \nwhile controlling what they view as potentially messy regional \nspillover problem.\n  There are two prongs to this misguided effort. First, let me describe \nwhat the Administration is considering on the relief front. Earlier \nthis month, administration officials announced plans to work in Kosovo \nthrough twelve centers established by Serb security forces to \ndistribute emergency food and supplies to the victims of this savage \nwar. I am not sure what surprised me more--the fact that we would work \nwith the very forces which carried out the atrocities creating hundreds \nof thousands of victims, or the fact that we decided to encourage this \ncooperation by actually making food available to Serb troops. The new \nchief of the Bureau for Humanitarian Affairs offered and has provided \nthousands of food rations to Serb troops fresh from bloody killing \nfields. He even asked NGO representatives to cooperate with this plan \nand work through these twelve centers. As one representative described \nit to me, the NGOs were the bait, intended to lure refugees into Serb \ncenters. AID claims that this plan was agreed to by the major non-\ngovernment organizations carrying out humanitarian relief in Kosovo, \nbut I can't find one that thinks collaborating with Belgrade makes any \nsense.\n  This effort to control and contain the problem also has a military \ncomponent--but the wrong military component. Last week, the foreign \nOperations Subcommittee was briefed on Administration plans to provide \n$7.3 million in security assistance loans to Macedonia. This train an \nequip initiative will provide night vision goggles, surveillance radar, \nammunition, body armor, howitzers and trucks to 3,000 Macedonian \nsoldiers--troops with long-standing ties to Serbian security forces. \nCoincidentally, Macedonia also has an ethnic Albanian community which \nsuffer what many describe as apartheid-like conditions.\n  Arming the Macedonians is the wrong substitute for the current policy \nfailure in Kosovo. Having failed to talk Milosevic into submission, \nthis program strikes me as a complete retreat in which the United \nStates is supplying an effort to establish a cordon sanitaire isolating \nKosovo. Strengthening Macedonian troops may have a defense purpose but \nit also clearly serves an offensive one--to curb the flow of people and \nsupplies into and out of Kosovo.\n\n  I hope we all learned at least one lesson in Bosnia--we pay a huge \nprice for imposing an unfair and imbalanced embargo against only one \nparty in a conflict. In good conscience, I for one, cannot support an \ninitiative designed intentionally or otherwise to surround and choke \noff Kosovo. I have made\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\nclear to the Secretaries of State and Defense that I will not release \nthe funds for this reprogramming unless and until appropriate action is \ntaken to produce results in Kosovo.\n  Secretary Albright has repeatedly stated that the only kind of \npressure Milosevic and his mafia understand is the kind which exacts a \nreal price for his unacceptable conduct. His campaign to burn Kosovo to \nthe ground was launched as the Administration pushed Kosovars to the \nnegotiating table and continues as we speak today. it is well past the \ntime for threats of sanctions and NATO flyovers. The Administration \nmust move decisively, offering the necessary leadership to back up our \nultimatums with the effective use of air strikes and force in order to \nsecure our common goals: a cease fire, the withdrawal of Serb forces, \nand the protection of refugees, displaced people and relief efforts.\n  Balkan history provides substantial evidence that Belgrade's abuse of \nforce demands a commensurate response. Without this fundamental \nguarantee, diplomacy will most certainly fail and we will bear witness \nto yet another of Milosevic's genocidal slaughters. His victims will \nnot only be those who suffer, lose their life possessions, and die on \nKosovo's fields. He will also destroy American honor and credibility--\ntaking along with that what shred of hope there is for us to lead this \ntroubled world onto a peaceful path into the next century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10901-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10903-S10913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H. FORD NATIONAL AIR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nthank the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, \nand the ranking member, Senator Hollings, as well as Senators Ford and \nGorton for their patience and help in working with me to reach an \nacceptable agreement regarding O'Hare Airport.\n  I do not think I need to remind them how upset I was when I learned \nthey had added a provision to the FAA reauthorization bill adding 100 \nadditional flights per day at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. \nThe provision was added to the original legislation without consulting \nthe local officials who manage the airport, without input from the \nmayor of Chicago who is responsible for the airport, without input from \nthe local communities surrounding the airport who will be most affected \nby additional noise and air pollution, and without consulting either of \nthe senators from Illinois.\n  This provision immediately raised a firestorm of criticism in the \nChicago area. I have an inch-thick stack of newspaper clips from about \na 10 day period after this provision appeared in the FAA \nreauthorization bill, which attests to the deep level of interest \nChicago-area residents have in this matter.\n  O'Hare is already the busiest airport in the world. There are at \nleast 400,000 people whose daily lives are affected by the noise and \nair pollution generated by the airport. The quality of life of these \nsuburban residents must be taken into account before changes are made \naffecting the number of operations at O'Hare Airport.\n  While I was displeased that the new-flights provision was added to \nthe FAA bill without consulting me, the chairman and ranking member \nhave since been gracious and accommodating and have worked with me to \nreach an agreement on this issue. I want to thank the chairman for his \npatience, and for his willingness to work with me on a compromise that \nI believe accommodates his needs, as well as the needs of Chicago-area \nresidents.\n  The agreement we reached reduces from 100 to 30 to the number of \nadditional flights per day at O'Hare. The agreement provides that 18 of \nthe 30 slot exemptions will be reserved for ``under-served'' markets, \nand no less than six of the 18 will be ``commuter'' slot exemptions \nreserved for planes with less than 60 seats.\n  Before any of these slot exemptions are made available, the Secretary \nmust: certify that the additional flights will cause no significant \nnoise increase; certify that the additional flights will have no \nadverse safety effects; consult with local officials on the \nenvironmental and noise effects of the additional flights; and perform \nan environmental review to determine what, if any, effect the \nadditional flights will have on the environment.\n  In addition, only ``Stage 3'' aircraft, the quietest type of aircraft \nrecognized by the FAA, will be eligible to use the new take-off and \nlanding slots.\n  Finally, after three years the Secretary of Transportation will study \nand report to Congress as to whether the additional flights resulting \nfrom the new slot exemptions have had any effects on: the environment, \nsafety, airport noise, competition at O'Hare, or access to under-served \nmarkets from O'Hare.\n  The Secretary will also study and report on noise levels in the areas \nsurrounding the four ``high-density'' airports (Chicago O'Hare, \nWashington National, New York LaGuardia, and New York JFK) once the \nnational 100 percent Stage 3 requirement is fully implemented in the \nyear 2000.\n  I believe this agreement goes a long way toward addressing the \nconcerns of the local officials and residents of the cities surrounding \nO'Hare. I want to again thank Senators McCain, Hollings, Ford, and \nGorton for their attentiveness and understanding. The people of \nIllinois spoke out in response to the O'Hare provision they inserted in \nthe FAA reauthorization bill, and these Senators listened.\n  I am particularly pleased that the agreement we reached on this \nissue, that was reflected in the managers' amendment adopted yesterday, \nallows this important FAA reauthorization legislation to advance in the \nSenate. This bill must become law before the end of the year in order \nto ensure that important airport improvement projects are not delayed \nor disrupted.\n  The legislation also includes several important provisions designed \nto increase air service to small and under-served communities. In \nIllinois, some of the most serious complaints regarding air service \ncome from our small and medium-sized communities that want air service \nto O'Hare and other major airports in order to attract global \nbusinesses. I am delighted I was recently able to help restore air \nservice between Decatur, Illinois and O'Hare. The restoration of this \nservice will help the city of Decatur, which promotes itself as \n``America's Agribusiness Center,'' grow in today's global economy. \nThere are a number of communities across my state demanding flights to \nChicago and New York, and the provisions of this legislation should \nhelp them get more air service.\n  I want to again thank the chairman for his understanding.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, while we are waiting for what I hope will be \na final resolution of one remaining matter on this bill, I would like \nto speak to the bill itself, with the understanding of my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona, who knows that I am going to be critical of a \nportion of the bill. I would like to also thank my colleagues from the \ncapital area, the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, as well as Senators from Maryland, Senator Sarbanes and Senator \nMikulski, for their efforts to make some improvements in an area of \nthis bill that concerns all of us, and many others.\n  Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my strong opposition \nto interference in our region's airports that is included in the FAA \nreauthorization bill. I certainly understand that this overall \nlegislation is important for the Nation as a whole, and I fully support \nmost of the bill. We must clearly prepare for the future by investing \nin aviation infrastructure, safety, and security. This bill provides \nfor those critical investments and, for that, I thank Senators McCain \nand Ford.\n  This bill also reauthorizes the Airport Improvement Program, which \nfunds the capital needs of our Nation's airports, including millions of \ndollars for Virginia facilities. Moreover, as the bill's name implies, \nit reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA monitors \naircraft inspections, manages air traffic control, and develops new \nways to detect and prevent security threats. Without these efforts, few \npeople would want to travel by air.\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\n  But beyond all of the good and necessary things this bill does, Mr. \nPresident, it also reneges on two important Federal commitments to the \ncitizens of Virginia and this area--the existing flight limits and the \nexisting perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. \nThese two Federal commitments are extremely important to the future \nstrength and stability of both National and Dulles Airports, Mr. \nPresident. They are also extremely important to the communities that \nsurround the airports and have relied on the existing rules.\n  Mr. President, as my friend and the author of this legislation is \nquoted as saying just yesterday--but admittedly in a different \ncontext--``a deal is a deal.'' And changing that deal to the clear \ndetriment of the communities and businesses that relied on it--is \nfundamentally unfair.\n  This Congress should not involve itself in matters that are \nessentially local and regional, that serve both the airports and their \ncommunities well, and that have provided and continue to provide a road \nmap to future economic strength for the people of northern Virginia as \nwell as those throughout the metropolitan Washington area.\n  Mr. President, these changes are bad public policy because they \nbenefit, in some cases, Members of Congress, and certainly a small \ngroup of consumers, while harming a far larger group. They wreak \nserious damage on the interdependence of National Airport and Dulles \nNational Airport. They erode the quality of life for communities \nsurrounding the airports. And they fly in the face of an agreement this \nCongress made in 1986 to turn those airports over to a regional \nauthority and essentially leave them alone.\n  First, Mr. President, proponents argue that this bill would \nmarginally assist air travelers by increasing the number of daily \nflights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. But when we \nincrease the number of flights to benefit a few people, we increase the \ncongestion for everyone, and we add to the overall delays of all who \nfly in and out of National Airport.\n  In weakening the perimeter rule, we allow a few select people to take \nlong-haul flights out of National. But what about consumers who may \nlose their short-haul flights to make room for flights to California, \nNevada, and Arizona? I am concerned that once we breach the perimeter \nrule we will eventually lose small-haul flights to smaller communities \naltogether. This would be brought about in a bill intended to assist \ntravelers to underserved communities.\n  Second, adjusting the perimeter rule at National will fundamentally \nshatter the carefully crafted interdependence between National and \nDulles airports that has proven so effective in fostering growth at \nboth airports.\n  Today Dulles flourishes as an international gateway for our region. \nNational thrives, providing convenient regional service. The history of \nboth airports shows us that this constructive, vibrant interdependence \nis not by accident.\n  National first opened in 1941, before the advent of large commercial \njets such as the DC-8. And Dulles was built in 1962 because larger jets \ncould not land on National's short runways. Medium-sized jets arrived \non the scene in 1966, and National soon became overcrowded. Jets were \nforced to circle, and delays were considerable.\n  In 1966, the airlines agreed to limit the number of flights at \nNational. They also agreed to a perimeter rule to further reduce \novercrowding.\n  But these were voluntary limits and did not provide the security or \nthe stability needed to maximize the potential of either airport. So \nduring the 1970's and early 1980's, improvements were negligible or \nnonexistent at both National and Dulles, for two reasons.\n  One, National drained flights from Dulles. And so improvements at \nDulles were put on hold. Two, improvements were also on hold at \nNational. Extensive litigation and public protest over increasing noise \nlead to this freeze. And there was even some discussion of shutting \ndown National completely.\n  Congressional legislation in 1986 solved these problems by codifying \nthe perimeter and slot rules that the airlines themselves had agreed \nupon, and by creating an independent authority to manage the airports. \nThis statutorily limited the number of flights at National, along with \nthe accompanying delays and noise, and increased the business at Dulles \nproviding what we thought was long-term stability to both airports.\n  Mr. President, there is no way around the fact that weakening the \nperimeter rule will bring long-haul flights to National at the expense \nof Dulles.\n  This marriage between National and Dulles--along with the stability \nthat accompanies most strong unions--has been extremely lucrative for \nboth airports.\n  Billions of dollars have been invested by businesses in the area near \nDulles Airport based on the assumption that Dulles would remain the \nregion's major international gateway. And the public represented by the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority has made significant \ninvestments in Dulles, including more than $1.6 billion in bonds.\n  Investments in Reagan National Airport have also grown under the \nstability provided by local management and the slot and perimeter \nrules. Since the airport was transferred to the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority, more than $940 million has been invested in the \nairport. The new terminal is well designed, and represents our Nation's \ncapital well. But the new terminal at National and the substantial \ninvestments at Dulles would not have occurred, Mr. President, without \nthe perimeter and slot rules.\n  In 1986, Congress was sensitive to community outrage as well as the \nneed to improve service. In hearings on the legislation, Congressman \nHammerschmidt asked how the Congress could be sure residents would \nsupport improvements at National. Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth \nDole stated:\n\n       With a statutory bar, to more flights, noise levels, will \n     continue to decline, as quieter aircraft, are introduced.\n       Thus all the planned projects at National, would simply \n     improve the facility, not increase, its capacity, for air \n     traffic.\n       Under these conditions, I believe that National's \n     neighbors, will no longer object, to the improvements.\n\n  Mr. President, as a result of this understanding between the local \ncommunity and the Congress, we have had enormous benefits to air \nservice in this region--benefits that we shouldn't imperil by changing \nrules that have worked so well.\n  Third, Mr. President this exchange between Secretary Dole and \nCongressman Hammerschmidt illustrates that there was some concern about \nthe effect of the transfer legislation on the people who live in the \ncommunities around National Airport. We need to be sensitive and \nrespectful of their concerns and wishes today.\n  Increasing the number of flights at National Airport will increase \nthe noise level for local citizens, will exacerbate the congestion for \nresidents, will increase delays for those who fly in and out of \nNational, and could also pose safety risks for surrounding communities.\n  Weakening the perimeter rule could wreak economic hardship on Dulles, \nwhich would threaten the countless businesses and families who settled \naround the airport expecting it to remain our Nations regional \ninternational gateway.\n  By focusing on the few travelers who may benefit from increasing the \nflight limits at National, this bill ignores the harm it will cause to \nthe many northern Virginia families who are neighbors to National \nAirport. Local communities and local businesses surrounding both \nairports are in opposition to changes in the flight limits and the \nperimeter rules. It is their quality of life, their economic strength, \ntheir ability to plan for a secure future, that is at risk with this \nportion of the legislation. We have a system in place that works for \nthis region. We have a careful balance between two airports that needs \nto be preserved.\n  Finally, Mr. President, with this bill we are again meddling in the \naffairs of two airports that Congress transferred to a regional \nauthority which we created because we thought airports could be managed \nbetter by the authority than by Members of Congress.\n  The 1986 transfer legislation signed into law by President Ronald \nReagan embodied two important concepts that are demolished by the bill \nwe are considering today: That local authorities--not the Federal \nGovernment--should decide local issues; and, that the two airports work \ntogether in tandem, and with BWI, to serve the national capital region.\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, the operation of one airport cannot be \nchanged without affecting the operation of the other.\n  As the Senate Commerce Committee report noted at the time:\n\n       [I]t is the legislation's purpose, to authorize the \n     transfer under long-term lease of the two airports ``as a \n     unit, to a properly constituted independent airport \n     authority, to be created by Virginia and the District of \n     Columbia, in order to improve the management, operation, and \n     development of these important transportation assets.''\n\n  Let me quote from Congressman Dick Armey, who has the following to \nsay about transferring the airports from Federal to local control:\n\n       The simple fact is that our Federal Government was not \n     designed, nor is it suited, to the task of running the day-\n     to-day operations of civilian airports.\n       Transferring control of the airports to an ``independent \n     authority'' will put these airports on the same footing as \n     all others in the country.\n       It gets the Federal Government out of the day-to-day \n     operation and management of civilian airports, and puts this \n     control into the hands of those who are more interested in \n     seeing these airports run in the safest and most efficient \n     manner possible . . . Rather than throw limited federal funds \n     at the airports and tell them to do what they can, this \n     legislation will allow the type of coordinated long-range \n     planning necessary to keep the airports safe and efficient \n     into the future.\n\n  The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has engaged in the \ntype of long-range coordinated planning that Mr. Armey encouraged. \nEssential to that long-range plan is to balance the operations of the \ntwo interdependent airports. National is designed to handle short-haul \nflights inside the perimeter, and Dulles is designed to handle long-\nhaul flights which are essential to maintaining Dulles as an \ninternational gateway.\n  Yesterday, I heard one of my colleagues comment on the bustling \nactivities surrounding Dulles. The current robust growth at Dulles \nresults directly from the balance between the two airports. The \nlegislation we are considering today begins to tip that balance in a \nway that will harm both of the airports as well as the communities that \nsurround them.\n  As Senator Dole said during debate on the 1986 legislation:\n\n       Mr. President, I would like to take just one moment to \n     reaffirm my support for passage of the regional airport bill.\n\n  Continuing to quote Senator Dole. ``There are a few things the \nFederal Government--and only the Federal Government--can do well. \nRunning local airports is not one of them.''\n  Finally, Mr. President, in making these changes to the flight limits \nand the perimeter rule, proponents argue that we are just following the \nwisdom of the free market. I am aware that the slot and perimeter rules \nare limits on the market, and I am also aware that GAO studies have \ncriticized the rules as anticompetitive. Moreover, I believe in the \nfree market.\n  But Government has a role in checking the excesses that can flow from \nan unfettered free market. The market won't educate children, the \nmarket won't protect workers, the market won't check monopolies, and \nthe market won't safeguard our natural resources.\n  So our charge as policymakers in a capitalist economy is to allow \nindividuals and entrepreneurs and businesses the freest rein possible \nwhile safeguarding society's other concerns. Defining those concerns \nand implementing those safeguards without destroying the benefits we \nachieve from the free market is one of the most difficult tasks we \nface.\n  Mr. President, the free market doesn't care if Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport is unnecessarily congested, but we do. The \nfree market doesn't care if there are flight delays, but we do. The \nfree market doesn't care if there is excessive noise in Alexandria or \nArlington, but we do. The free market doesn't care if Dulles Airport is \nharmed, but we do.\n  We seek a balance here between the free market and the strength of \nour airports and the quality of life of our people. That balance is \nembodied in the flight limits and perimeter rule. They should not be \nsacrificed to the free market in this debate.\n  And perhaps more egregiously, Mr. President, this legislation applies \nan adherence to free market principles on an inconsistent and selective \nbasis. This bill, for example, contemplates restricting air flights \nover both small and large parks. The report on the bill states that the \nCommerce Committee ``intends that the [Federal agencies] work together \nto preserve quiet in the national parks.'' The report goes on to say \nthat while ``natural quiet is not an important attribute for all \nnational parks, such as historic sites in urban settings,'' preserving \nquiet in some parks ``may require banning commercial air tour \noperations over the park altogether.''\n  I agree with the committee, Mr. President. We should work to preserve \nthe pristine nature of our national parks for the public to enjoy.\n  But how can we abandon free market principles to preserve the \nsanctity of our parks and use free market principles to damage the \nsanctity of life here in our Nation's Capital? It would be wrong, Mr. \nPresident, to force Virginians and those who live in this area to \nendure more noise from National Airport.\n  There is a second significant inconsistency in this bill, and that \ninvolves service assistance for small communities.\n  On the one hand, the bill attempts to expand service to underserved \ncommunities. It creates the Community-Carrier Air Service Program which \nseeks to develop public/private partnerships with commercial airlines \nand the local State and Federal governments. These partnerships will \noffer service previously unavailable. In addition, the bill maintains \nthe Essential Air Service Program which now subsidizes air service in \ncommunities such as Kingman, AZ; Rockland, ME; and Seward, AL.\n  On the other hand, we jeopardize short-haul service from National. \nThis legislation weakens the perimeter rule which was created to both \nimprove service to underserved airports and to expand service at Dulles \nAirport. Again, if we weaken the perimeter rule, we weaken more than \nDulles Airport. We begin a dangerous journey that could jeopardize \nconsumer access to smaller airports across the Nation that currently \nbenefit from the perimeter rule.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, the bill before us does not erase the \nperimeter rule altogether. Unfortunately, it does damage to the rule, \nand I believe it contemplates doing away with the rule completely, \nwhich embodies its own threat to the economic performance of our \nregion.\n  Before I conclude, I want to ask that Members of this body step back \nfor just a moment and recommit ourselves to honoring the commitment \nthat we made to our regional airports in 1986. Those of us who \nrepresent this region have spent enormous time and energy over the last \ndecade trying to keep the Congress from breaking its commitment to \ncommunities that we serve. We need to stop wasting valuable time \nmicromanaging these airports. Let's put out a moratorium, if you will, \non legislating changes that are in the purview of the Metropolitan \nWashington Airports Authority. Let's give the Authority, say, 5 years \nto continue to develop a strong, vibrant air transportation system we \nwant and need for this area at the dawn of a new millennium.\n  I understand that Senators McCain and Lott will express their \ncommitment not to interfere further in the slot and perimeter rule \nshould this bill pass. I welcome that commitment. But let's acknowledge \nthat the existing rules we change with this bill were carefully \ncrafted, are based on sound public policy, and should not be altered. \nAnd let's oppose this Federal intervention in the operation of two \nairports that are doing just fine without us.\n  Mr. President, I know this bill will pass, and it should for the \nreasons I stated at the outset. But in opposition to yet another broken \npromise by this Congress to the citizens of Virginia and this region, I \nwill vote no on final passage and hope that my concerns, shared by so \nmany of our colleagues, will be addressed in conference.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10906]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. While my friends from Virginia are here on the floor, \nboth Senator Warner and Senator Robb, I want to first of all tell \nSenator Robb I appreciate all his words of criticism and scorn. They \nare well received.\n  Mr. ROBB. And friendship.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In the spirit of friendship.\n  I also want to say that both Senator Robb and Senator Warner have \nbeen staunch advocates for the people who live in the State of Virginia \nwho are directly affected by these policy changes. I understand that \nconcern and that commitment, and I think it is not only appropriate but \nlaudable. I assure both Senators, my commitment to them and their \ncitizens is we will do everything we can to see that there is not an \nincrease in noise in the neighborhoods surrounding these airports. If \nwe renege on that commitment, I will be glad to come back and revisit \nthis issue. If there is an increase of noise pollution of any kind, I \nwant to tell my two dear friends that I will come back, revisit this \nissue, so that we can repair any damage that is inflicted on the people \nof the State of Virginia--and Maryland as well, I might add. Maryland \nas well.\n  Both Senators from Virginia have been staunch opponents. They have \ndone remarkable things in preventing even this very modest--let's be \nrealistic here--this is very modest. When we are talking about a total \nof six round-trip flights a day, it is not a huge increase. But they \nhave done a great job, and I commit to them, finally, we will be glad \nto revisit this issue if problems arise as a result of this \nlegislation.\n  Also, we can put all the blame on Senator Ford because he will no \nlonger be with us at that time.\n  Mr. FORD. There he goes, talking out of school again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, may I thank our friend and colleague from \nArizona, who has worked for many, many years. He does reflect an \nongoing dialog that my distinguished senior Senator and I, and the two \ndistinguished Senators from Maryland, have had with him as well as \nSenators representing a couple of the other airports that were affected \nby both flight and perimeter rules.\n  I appreciate very much and take sincerely his offer to revisit the \nquestion on noise. I hope he will also include, at least in the spirit \nof the commitment that he makes, both congestion and diminution in the \nvitality of Dulles, which is really the other major issue that we are \ntalking about. All of these are in play.\n  But I understand and appreciate very much, as does my senior \ncolleague, both the commitment the Senator from Arizona has made as \nwell as the spirit of that commitment and the spirit with which he has \nworked with us over a very long period of time, many years, to get to \nthis particular point.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join with my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Robb, in expressing to both managers our appreciation. It is \nclear that we are about to adopt a bill which will have measurable \nimpact, in terms of the environment, on the immediate region--Maryland, \nVirginia, and the District of Columbia. I am about to make a correction \nin an amendment which will provide, I think, adequate monitoring of \nthat impact on the environment.\n  I started on the question of these airports--I can't remember, it is \nso many years ago now. Now that Senator Robb has joined me in the \nSenate, he, too, has worked very hard on the airports. I was on the \nairport commission when we transferred them from Federal ownership to \nthe current legal concept with MWAA. As a matter of fact, I think my \ncolleague was Governor; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. ROBB. If my colleague will yield just for a comment, I was indeed \nand, as a matter of fact, had an opportunity to come up and work with \nthe distinguished senior Senator and with others on this legislation. \nBefore I left the Governors' office, I appointed the first two members \nof the board.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is correct. I actually wrote the \nlegislation that was eventually adopted. But so much for history.\n  The residents of this community have to endure the hardships as \noccasioned by this growing airport. But in the course of my analysis \nhere, in the past year, of this question, I talked at great length with \nthe technical people. The margin, the incremental margin that could \nincrease both in noise pollution and safety--we should include safety \nin this, and certainly in my conversations no alarm bells were sounded. \nI hope the NEPA report eventually verifies that finding.\n  I also would like--having a few moments here with the distinguished \nmanagers of this bill, would like to talk a moment about the MWAA \nboard. I know the Committee on Commerce has had the hearing on them. \nThey are yet to go on the Executive Calendar. This is something I have \nbeen following very closely. I do not wish to say more about it, but I \njust look my constituents straight in the eye and say, ``Trust the old \nsenior Senator that somehow this thing is going to be resolved.'' I \nhave known Mr. McCain a quarter of a century as a colleague. Trust me, \nthis will be resolved.\n  I would like to place in the Record the importance of allowing last \nyear's money, and such moneys that flow from this piece of \nlegislation--exactly what those projects are. I enumerated them in the \ncourse of the hearings on the MWAA appointees, but I think it is \nimportant to put them in the Record. Foremost among them is, hopefully, \nthe elimination of those vehicles that go out between the terminals at \nDulles--how many of our colleagues have come up to me on the floor: \n``John, the time has come; we have outlived those''?--and other very \nimportant modifications, modernization for both of these airports, for \nwhich I and others have fought hard in these years.\n  At Reagan National Airport and Washington Dulles International \nAirport several major projects are virtually on hold as a result of \ninaction by the Senate on the confirmation of Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority board members:\n  (1) At Dulles, the temporary gates attached at the foot of the tower \nneed to be replaced. $11.2 million would come from PFCs; (2) an all-\nweather connector between a new, badly-needed parking garage and the \nMain Terminal would require about $29 million from PFCs; (3) for the \nMidfield B Concourse, a tunnel with moving sidewalks would replace the \nmobile lounge ride, with about $46 million provided by PFCs; (4) a new \nbaggage handling requires $31.4 million in PFC revenue.\n  At Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport there are several more:\n  (1) Rehabilitation of the historic old main terminal, now called \nTerminal A, will cost $94 million, and is to be paid for with $21 \nmillion in grants and $36 million in PFCs; (2) the ``connector'' \nbetween the old and new terminals will be widened, and moving sidewalks \nadded. The cost is $4.8 million, with $4.3 million in PFCs.\n  Mr. President, these two airports are vital to the economic \ndevelopment of Virginia and the entire metropolitan Washington area. We \nare anxious that they are physically able to support the improvements \nin air service the region so badly needs.\n  I would urge the Commerce Committee to act promptly to forward these \nnominations to the Senate for its advice and consent.\n  So I thank the managers. This is an important colloquy we have had \nright now. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Very quickly we will go--Senators Gorton and Specter are \nhere with the final amendment which we will go to in a moment.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I make a technical change?\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3639, As Amended\n\n  Mr. FORD. Prior to that, we have a pending amendment that is agreed \nto.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We have a pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the amendment \nof the Senator from Maryland is adopted.\n  The amendment, No. 3639, as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n[[Page S10907]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I assure my colleague Senator Warner on his technical \namendment, we are going to mark up the nominees to the board on \nThursday and we will report them out on Thursday.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3643 Vitiated\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, earlier the Senate adopted amendment No. \n3643, which the Senator from Virginia introduced on behalf of Senator \nRobb, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Mikulski.\n  By an innocent error, the wrong sheet of paper got into the hands of \nthe clerk. I take full responsibility.\n  I now ask that amendment No. 3643 be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment No. 3643 was vitiated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3644\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Sarbanes, Ms. Mikulski and Mr. Robb, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3644.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 43 of the Manager's Amendment beginning with line \n     21, strike through line 5 on page 44 and insert the \n     following:\n       (d) Assessment of safety, noise and environmental \n     impacts.--The Secretary shall assess the impact of granting \n     exemptions, including the impacts of the additional slots and \n     flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport provided \n     under subsections (a) and (b) on safety, noise levels and the \n     environment within 90 days of the date of the enactment of \n     this Act. The environmental assessment shall be carried out \n     in accordance with parts 1500-1508 of title 40, Code of \n     Federal Regulations. Such environmental assessment shall \n     include a public meeting.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I am pleased to offer this amendment for myself and \nSenators Sarbanes, Mikulski and Robb.\n  The purpose of this amendment is in the event the conference report \nadopts part or all of the provisions of this bill which would increase \nthe number of slots--that is in this legislation that we are now \nconsidering--the Secretary of Transportation is given authority to \ngrant additional slots and additional flights beyond the 1,250-mile \nperimeter of the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. These \nprovisions will permit 24 additional flights daily at Reagan National \nAirport.\n  I have worked with the managers of the bill for some time. I have \nexpressed my grave concern about the perimeter rule and the associated \npotential, and probably likely degradation of environmental \nconsequences from these flights.\n  So, to the extent our bill as passed through the Senate, which still \nremains to be seen but I presume it will--will contain this provision, \nthen of course, in the conference I cannot predict what will come out \nof conference. But in that event, then I think we better put a little \ninsurance policy in here as regards the environmental concerns. That is \nthe purpose of this amendment. These additional flights are permitted \nwithout any evaluation of the potential impact on noise level, safe \noperations of the airport, or other environmental impacts.\n  The amendment I offer today, together with my distinguished \ncolleagues from Virginia and Maryland, requires the Secretary of \nTransportation to conduct an environmental assessment of the potential \nimpacts of these additional flights on noise levels, safety and the \nenvironment prior to the Secretary granting any exemptions.\n  That is a very important provision. The environmental assessment \nprocess, as defined under the National Environmental Policy Act, \nensures that the Secretary will fully review possible impacts of these \nadditional flights. Also, this process provides the opportunity for the \npublic to fully participate--I underline that, the public gets a \nvoice--in making known their views on the potential impacts of these \nadditional flights.\n  I believe this amendment is critical to ensuring that the Ronald \nReagan Washington National Airport continues to be a safe and efficient \nairport for the traveling public, the area residents, and, indeed, the \nmany thousands of employees who work at this airport, together with the \naircrews who operate these aircraft.\n  Having worked the better part of the day on this amendment with the \nmanagers, it is my understanding at this time the managers indicate \nthey will accept this amendment without the necessity of a rollcall \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. My friend and colleague is not here, the manager of the \nbill from the majority side. We have discussed this between us and the \nSenator's statement, as far as I am concerned, is absolutely true. He \nhas worked hard on it, done a lot of hard work on it. I think it is \nabsolutely necessary we have it in for his protection and others. I \nwould not want to speak for my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I did speak with the manager just moments \nago, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and he has agreed. I convey \nthat to the distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. FORD. I don't doubt your word.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 3644) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FORD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair and thank the managers.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3645\n\n  (Purpose: To amend title 46, United States Code, to provide for the \n    recovery of non-pecuniary damages in commercial aviation suits)\n\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Santorum, Senator Lott and \nmyself, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] for himself, \n     Mr. Santorum and Mr. Lott, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3645.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . COMPENSATION UNDER THE DEATH ON THE HIGH SEAS ACT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2 of the Death on the High Seas \n     Act (46 U.S.C. App. 762) is amended by--\n       (1) inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``The \n     recovery''; and\n       (2) adding at the end thereof the following:\n       ``(b) Commercial Aviation.--\n       ``(1) In General.--If the death was caused during \n     commercial aviation, additional compensation for non-\n     pecuniary damages for wrongful death of a decedent is \n     recoverable in a total amount, for all beneficiaries of that \n     decedent, that shall not exceed the greater of the pecuniary \n     loss sustained or a sum total of $750,000 from all defendants \n     for all claims. Punitive damages are not recoverable.\n       ``(2) Inflation adjustment.--The $750,000 amount shall be \n     adjusted, beginning in calendar year 2000 by the increase, if \n     any, in the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for \n     the prior year over the Consumer Price Index for all urban \n     consumers for the calendar year 1998.\n       ``(3) Non-pecuniary damages.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term `non-pecuniary damages' means damages \n     for loss of care, comfort, and companionship.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     applies to any death caused during commercial aviation \n     occurring after July 16, 1996.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies the 1920 \nshipping law known as the Death on the High Seas Act which has been \ninterpreted to prohibit families of victims, such as those who were on \nTWA Flight 800, from seeking relief for other than pecuniary damages.\n  This amendment is a modification of Senate bill 943 which I had \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\nearlier with the following cosponsors Senators Santorum, D'Amato, \nLautenberg, Inhofe, Gramm of Texas, Hutchison of Texas, Moynihan, \nWellstone, Dodd, Feinstein, Torricelli, Murray, Durbin, Moseley-Braun, \nMikulski, Sarbanes, Robb and Levin.\n  We have not had an opportunity to circulate this amendment, but I do \nthink it would have very broad support since those cosponsors supported \nthe broader legislative proposal contained in Senate bill 943.\n  Mr. President, we are submitting this compromise amendment in order \nto move ahead to obtain some possible compensation for damages beyond \npecuniary damages. Specifically, the families of victims of plane \ncrashes more than 3 miles off our shores will be able to sue not only \nfor economic losses such as the lost salary of a deceased spouse, but \nalso for non-economic losses such as loss of companionship, loss of \ncare, and loss of comfort.\n  The amendment provides that a court can make an award for \nnonpecuniary damages which shall not exceed the greater of the \npecuniary loss sustained or a total of $750,000 per victim.\n  This amendment is retroactive to the crash of TWA 800, which \ntragically took 230 lives on July 17, 1996. The hardest hit community \nin the TWA 800 crash was Montoursville, PA, which lost 16 students and \n5 adult chaperones from the local high school who were participating in \na long-awaited French club trip to France. It was the parents of some \nof these children who first contacted our office about introducing \nlegislation to allow them to seek compensation other than for pecuniary \nlosses, which they believed courts would not provide.\n  Mr. President, under this amendment, the loss for noneconomic damages \nwill be the greater of the pecuniary loss sustained for a total of \n$750,000 per victim. Illustratively, if the pecuniary loss to an \nindividual was $1 million, then that individual could obtain $1 million \nfor nonpecuniary damages. But if the pecuniary damages are less than \n$750,000, the maximum that an individual can take would be $750,000.\n  I offer this amendment, Mr. President, to make the best of what I \nconsider to be a less-than-desirable situation. I am philosophically \nstrongly opposed to caps on damages. I believe that there is very \nsubstantial evidence that corporate America has disregarded damages to \nvictims on a calculated pecuniary evaluation as to what will cost them \nthe least money.\n  Illustrative of that is the famous Pinto case where Ford decided to \nleave the gas tank in the back of the car because it would cost $11 or \n$12 to move it to a safe position; and there was a calculation, as \ndisclosed in the files of the Ford Motor Company, that that judgment \nwas made because it would be cheaper to pay the damages than it would \nbe to change the location of the gas tank.\n  I have some detailed knowledge of recent litigation involving Ford \nMotor Company where there was a defective brake at issue. It was \nacknowledged to be defective and the National Transportation Safety \nBoard said it was defective, and there were efforts made to get Ford to \nrecall it, but Ford did not recall it, again, obviously, because the \ncosts they calculated would be less onerous from a financial point of \nview to allow that danger to remain. A young child aged 3 was killed as \na result of that incident.\n  And there are many, many cases--case after case--the tobacco cases, \nwhich were recently illustrative, where there is a calculation made by \nthe corporation to give false information for pecuniary gain, which \nwould warrant punitive damages; cases involving IUDs where there were \nknown defective instrumentalities; cases involving flammable pajamas \nwhere children were burned; many, many cases which have led me to \nconclude that there really ought not to be caps.\n  I have had some experience as a litigator, mostly on the defense \nside, some for claimants for personal injuries, but mostly on the \ndefense side with the firm of Barnes, Dechert, Price and Rhoads, later \nknown as Dechert, Price and Rhoads of Philadelphia, and have seen this \nissue from both sides of the fence. But it is not possible to move \nahead on the FAA reauthorization bill, which is an appropriate spot to \nhave this aviation amendment, without tying up this important \nlegislation.\n  We have had a series of meetings with interested parties and had an \namendment to the Death on the High Seas Act been enacted which would \nhave had unlimited damages, there was the announced intent to \nfilibuster the bill. However, the pending FAA bill really needs to be \nenacted because it contains very substantial money for airport \nconstruction across my State of Pennsylvania and throughout America.\n  So this is a compromise which can be worked out. The figure moved \nfrom $250,000 for nonpecuniary damages to $600,000, to the greater of \nthe pecuniary loss or $750,000. I think that the figure is too low as \nit stands now, but this is the best that can be obtained today. I would \nnote that in offering this amendment today, I make the pledge that if \nwe fail to remove them in Conference on the FAA bill, I will introduce \nlegislation in the next Congress to take the caps off because I think \none day there will be a Congress which will be sympathetic to \neliminating such caps.\n  When there was a threat of a filibuster, that was on the basis that a \nDeath on the High Seas Act amendment might be enacted without any cap \nat all. The whole issue of product liability is a complex issue. And \nthere are some who think that it ought to be curtailed to some \nsubstantial extent and others who think that it ought not to be \ncurtailed.\n  But this does advance the position of families of individuals who \nhave met with tragic death. And it is not uncommon in our Congress and \nour U.S. Senate that we reach compromises and live to fight another day \nto push the principles that we believe in. But this is the best that \ncan be done.\n  In conversations with my constituents and interested parties there \nis, I think, a sense that this is a desirable consequence today, the \n$750,000 in noneconomic damages, and that we will look to another day \nto try to remove the caps altogether.\n  I want to comment briefly about what I consider to be a very serious \npotential problem for the Senate procedurally on what has occurred in \nthis matter with respect to what amendments are in order under our \nrules and what notification Senators like me receive on that matter. It \nwas well known by all of the interested Senators--the majority leader's \noffice, the managers of the bill, and others--that an amendment on \nDeath on the High Seas would be offered.\n\n  Then there was a unanimous consent request where the matters that \ncould be presented were limited. At that time, the technical \nconsideration was raised as to what was a relevant amendment, which \nchallenged the ingenuity of the Parliamentarian as to what is relevant \nin technical Senate rules.\n  Had there been any doubt in my mind that this amendment was to be \nchallenged on the basis of relevance, and all the interested parties \nknew what it was, it would be a relatively simple matter for me as a \nSenator having a right to object to a unanimous consent agreement and \nto have this specific amendment protected so that I would not face a \ntechnical challenge on relevancy. I brought that issue to the attention \nof the distinguished majority leader and said if we were starting to \nparse semicolons in this body we would have to have a lot of Senators \non the floor to protect their interests on unanimous consent \nagreements, because it was plain that this amendment was to be offered. \nOur distinguished majority leader thought my point was well taken.\n  Thereafter, there was another unanimous consent agreement entered \ninto on the floor of the Senate without ``hotlining''--and I don't know \nthat anybody listening to C-SPAN2 cares about it, but the Senators do \ncare--and hotlining is a procedure where Senators' offices are called \nand told this unanimous consent agreement is to be entered into, which \nis more than an announcement on the floor of the U.S. Senate, which may \nbe noted or may not be noted.\n  This Senator did not have notice about a limitation on the amendments \nwhich were to be limited in the FAA bill under the unanimous consent \nagreement. Here again, all the parties were on notice that this was an \nissue which this Senator intended to pursue.\n  Now, I have made it plain in my discussions with the interested \nparties\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\nand the majority leader that I understood the importance of this FAA \nbill, that I would not take steps which would tie the bill up and that \nI was prepared to try to reach an acceptable compromise as to a figure \non noneconomic damages.\n  However, this experience has taught me something new. From what I \nhave seen in the Senate up to this point, there is a recognition of \nwhat Senators intend to offer and there is notification so that \nSenators can appear and protect their technical interests.\n  I am not claiming it is prejudice because, as I repeat, I was \nprepared to accept this compromise. But to be put in a position where, \nhad I chosen not to do so, to have been foreclosed under these \ncircumstances, I think, would have been an inappropriate limitation on \nmy rights to offer a broader amendment. If I must take the position of \nfiling an objection to every unanimous consent agreement, that is an \nalternative that I would not like. But, that may be necessary if we are \nnot to have our interests protected and to be notified where our \ninterests are known--to come and make sure our amendments can be \noffered.\n  I speak about that at some great length because I am very concerned \nabout what has happened in this case. I cannot be more emphatic in \nsaying I disapprove of the procedures which were followed here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Death on the High Seas Act was either \npassed or last amended some 70 years ago. It is an act relating to \nexactly that--death on the high seas--that sets out limitations on \ndamages that can be recovered in fault-based actions for such deaths.\n  Obviously, the absence of any change in those limitations can be said \nto be something of an anachronism at this point. The Death on the High \nSeas Act does not limit the dollar amount of actual economic damages \nthat can be recovered. The Death on the High Seas Act applies equally \nto death over the seas or on the seas as a result of an aircraft \naccident. The rationale, of course, for that kind of limitation on \ndamages is the vital importance to the people of this country, of the \nmaritime transportation of goods and passengers, and the air \ntransportation of goods and passengers over the seas of the world.\n  The view, I am sure, of those who passed the act in the first place \nwas that this was such an important part of our society, that it was so \nimportant to encourage the development of efficient, swift, and \ninexpensive transport of goods and passengers, that there should be \ncertain limitations to legal actions resulting in deaths on the high \nseas.\n  The bill to which the Senator from Pennsylvania refers was the \nsubject of a hearing in the Commerce Committee. That bill was not \nreported favorably or at all by the committee. So some portion of it or \nall of it was originally posed as an amendment to this bill on the \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, to which this \nsubject is not clearly relevant.\n  The proponents of S. 943 and of the original form of this amendment \nwanted to remove all limitations--both for noneconomic damages and for \npunitive damages--from any such actions. That seemed to me, and \ncontinues to seem to me, to be an inappropriate response. The necessity \nfor transportation by air over seas remains absolute in the world in \nwhich we live, and to subject either aircraft manufacturers or airlines \nto unlimited amounts of noneconomic damages and to punitive damages \nwould have a clearly negative impact on the design and maintenance of \nairliners and of the airlines that operate.\n  Flight 800 is not a Ford Pinto. All airlines and all aircraft \nmanufacturers, domestic and foreign, are required to meet \nextraordinarily strict safety standards imposed by the Government of \nthe United States. After 2 or 3 years of study, the greatest experts in \nthe world are not certain of the cause of that crash. They think they \nknow, but if one thing is clear to the ordinary observer, the crash did \nnot take place due to the negligence of the manufacturer or of TWA.\n  Nevertheless, in the fault-based litigation field which afflicts the \nUnited States, there is little doubt that a number of juries by trial \nlawyers could be persuaded that negligence that no one could have \ndetermined in advance was, in fact, present, and these damages would \nthereby be unlimited.\n  So as the Senator from Pennsylvania has so graciously pointed out, we \nhave here a compromise. I think that it is appropriate that certain \nnoneconomic damages be recoverable. I think they will be recoverable \nand will be recovered even though in the normal sense of the word \n``negligence'' against any of the defendants, it will never actually be \nproven. But I do not think that they should be unlimited. I do not \nthink that cases like this admit to punitive damages under any \nconceivable set of circumstances.\n  What this bill does is two things: It allows the recovery of certain \nnoneconomic damages for the loss of care, comfort, and companionship of \nthose who were killed in the aircraft crash to which this bill is \nretroactively applicable, and in future aircraft accidents, up to the \namount of actual economic damages or $750,000--whichever figure is \nlarger. I believe that is a generous award and a generous limitation \nfor aircraft accidents.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania feels they should be unlimited, and he \nrepresents a strongly held point of view held by a large number of \nother Members of this body. But this is a legislative compromise. These \ndamage limitations are far greater than they are under present law. \nThey are far less than the American Trial Lawyers Association would \nlike.\n  It does seem to me that in a body that has struggled with product \nliability legislation for the better part of two decades, and which \nincludes a majority of Members who feel that certain limits should be \nplaced on product liability litigation, but whose goals have been \nfrustrated through filibusters and the like, that to add another field \nto the kind of unlimited litigation that so plagues society at the \npresent time and has so troubled debates in this body, not just over \nproduct liability but over medical malpractice as well, that such an \nextension would be highly unwise.\n\n  As a consequence, the Senator from Pennsylvania and I disagree on the \ngeneral philosophy of the vehicle with which we are involved here. But \nI think that, in the best traditions of the Senate, our disagreements \nhave been resolved, at least for the time being, by a compromise--a \ncompromise that has limits --limits that I think are perhaps too high \non the kind of damages that can be recovered and implicitly as to \nwhether they should be recovered at all under the circumstances, and \nthe belief of the Senator from Pennsylvania that standard negligence \nrules ought to apply here as they do in many other areas.\n  We have reached compromise on this. He has proposed an amendment \nwhich he doesn't completely agree with himself, but he thinks it \nrepresents an improvement. And I agree with an amendment that I do not \ncompletely disagree with and one I think is relatively too generous. It \nmay well be that the Senator from Arizona thinks this will be the last \namendment on this bill and we will move forward from here. I guess we \ncan say that at some future time there will be another contest during \nwhich we can examine the premises of our fault-based system of \nliability and its relationship to aircraft accidents at greater length \nand at more leisure.\n  For the time being, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania and the \nother Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, who first brought this \nto my attention, and the many others who worked very hard to reach an \naccommodation. The senior Senator from Pennsylvania has done a very \ngood job on a cause in which he believes, even though he didn't get \neverything he wanted.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington for \nthose kind remarks. I thank him for saying the Senator from \nPennsylvania has done a good job. If I can attract the attention of the \nSenator from Washington, I think he has done even a better job. He and \nI were elected in 1980 and have served in this body for some \nconsiderable period of time, and we are lawyers. It may be unwise to \nmake that kind of admission publicly on C-SPAN2, but we are lawyers. We \nhave many discussions and we agree most of the time.\n\n[[Page S10910]]\n\n  I heard Don Meredith, the legendary quarterback of the Dallas \nCowboys, make a comment about lawyers one day. He said, ``99 percent of \nthe lawyers give the rest of them a bad name.'' Senator Domenici, who \nis listening, is also a lawyer and, with some frequency, he disagrees \nwith the legal profession. We will continue to take up these issues. \nThis is the conclusion for today.\n  The bill will now go to conference and, in conference, on the House \nside there has been a decision that the Death on the High Seas Act \nshould not apply to any aircraft accidents. It should apply only to \nother instrumentalities, but not to airplanes. That will be a matter \nfor conference. If the House should prevail, then the objectives of \nthis Senator would have been accomplished because there would be no \nlimitation on damages because the Act would be inapplicable to airline \ncrashes.\n  With respect to the TWA 800 incident, it ought to be noted that the \nfederal district court, the trial court, has recently ruled that the \nlimitation of the Death on the High Seas Act does not apply because, \nwhile it was outside of 3 miles, it was within 12 miles, and a certain \naction by President Reagan extended that definition of our waters to a \n12-mile limit. But that hasn't been ruled upon by the court of appeals, \nnor by the Supreme Court. So that district court judge's ruling may \nchange. There are issues that are yet to be resolved in conference and \nalso in the courts on this matter.\n  In conclusion, I think we have advanced the matter. It is in \naccordance with the traditions of the Senate to try to reach an \naccommodation and move the legislation forward and reenter the fray and \nrejoin the issue at a later date. I thank the Chair and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank my two \nlawyer colleagues. I am very pleased that I am not of that profession. \nI will refrain from telling any more lawyer jokes on the floor.\n  There were two very different positions here and strongly held views. \nI believe this is what our work here in the Senate is all about. The \nSenator from Washington, in his responsibilities as chairman of the \nAviation Subcommittee, has preserved some fundamental principles here, \nand I also think the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has taken a major \nstep forward concerning children. For the first time, now children will \nbe ranked along with everybody else in compensation and in the case of \ntragedy. I believe that the people who have fallen victim to these \nterrible aircraft tragedies owe a great debt of gratitude to Senator \nSpecter for what he did tonight. There is now some hope for them for \nsome reasonable compensation. We all know that there is no compensation \nfor the loss of a life. But there are certainly ways that we can make \ntheir lives better and give them a chance to have a decent future.\n  I thank Senator Specter for what he did here tonight. I also want to \nthank Senator Gorton, who fundamentally protected principles that he \nhas adhered to for a long period of time.\n  I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nArizona for those comments. He has done an outstanding job as chairman \nof the Commerce Committee on this bill and on other matters.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I object to that right now, and I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, because of the unanimous consent \nagreement, which limited the number of amendments, the Senator from \nPennsylvania and I have agreed to put that amendment into the managers' \npackage, which we will be proposing very shortly. It will be Senator \nSpecter's amendment. We do this only for the sake of preserving the \nprocess of the unanimous consent agreement. It will be part of the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that accurately states our agreement. For \ntechnical reasons, I will withdraw the amendment and it will become a \npart of the bill as if voted on and passed as part of the managers' \npackage. I concur with what my colleague just articulated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 3645) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Wyden has very strong views on the High Seas Act. \nWe have been working together on a colloquy that will be included in \nthe Record to reflect that.\n\n\n                    alaska exemption from title vii\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Manager, the Senator from Arizona, Chairman \nMcCain, for his able and fair management of the FAA Reauthorization \nbill. Subsection 702(b) exempts overflights in Alaska from the \nprovisions of the new section 40125 of title 40 set forth in the \nsubsection 702(a). Is that the Committee's intent?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Subsection 702(b) also exempts overflights in Alaska \nfrom the provisions of Title VII of S. 2279. Is that the Committee's \nintent?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The effect of subsection 702(b) then, is to expressly \nprohibit the federal government's prohibition and regulation of \noverflights over national park land and tribal land in Alaska, if there \nwere lands or waters in Alaska that would otherwise qualify as such \nland in the absence of this exemption.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask that the chairman of the authorizing committee for \nthe Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, Senator Murkowski, \nto comment on section 702(b) and the operation of section 1110(a) of \nthe Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Section 1110(a) of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act provides an express and affirmative right to air \naccess to federal lands in Alaska. Section 1110(a) provides as follows:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or other \n     law, the Secretary shall permit, on conservation system \n     units, national recreation areas, and national conservation \n     areas, and those public lands designated as wilderness study, \n     the use of snowmachines (during periods of adequate snow \n     cover, or frozen river conditions in the case of wild and \n     scenic rivers), motorboats, airplanes, and nonmotorized \n     surface transportation methods for traditional activities \n     (where such activities are permitted by this Act or other \n     law) and for travel to and from villages and homesites. Such \n     use shall be subject to reasonable regulations by the \n     Secretary to protect the natural and other values of the \n     conservation system units, national recreation areas, and \n     national conservation areas, and shall not be prohibited \n     unless, after notice and hearing in the vicinity of the \n     affected unit or area, the Secretary finds that such use \n     would be detrimental to the resource values of the unit or \n     area. Nothing in this section shall be construed as \n     prohibiting the use of other methods of transportation for \n     such travel and activities on conservation system lands where \n     such use is permitted by this Act or other law.\n\n  Overflights, including those conducted for profit, are a \n``traditional activity'' in Alaska, and as such currently may be \nsubject to ``reasonable regulation'' by the Secretary of the Interior \nunder section 1110(a). This policy works for Alaska. Although section \n1110(a) applies notwithstanding any other law, section 702(b) clarifies \nthat Congress is not changing its policy toward Alaska in any way.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The last time Congress enacted legislation on the \noverflights matter was in the 100th Congress under Public Law 100-91 \n(101 Stat. 674 et seq.). Prior to enactment, this legislation was \nreviewed by both the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nand the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation. As a \nCommerce Committee member then and now, I would like to discuss P.L. \n1001-91.\n  Under P.L. 100-91, Congress mandated a study by the Secretary of the \nInterior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to \ndetermine the impacts that overflights of aircraft have on park unit \nresources. Section 1(c) expressly excluded all National\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\nPark System units in Alaska from the research and the study. In a \nhearing held during the 105th Congress on S. 268, the park overflights \nbill that ultimately became Title VII of S. 2279, the National Park \nService testified that Alaska parks were not a part of the study \ncommissioned in 1987 and completed in 1995. Therefore, that study \nmandated by Congress did not provide a basis for applying S. 2279's \npark overflights provisions to Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That's clear.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I filed an amendment on this bill regarding \nthe eligibility for new slots at Reagan National Airport. I have \ndecided not to seek a vote on my amendment at this time. I appreciate \nthe efforts of my colleague, Senator McCain, the chairman of the \nCommittee, and his leadership on the FAA bill. I would like to ask if \nthe Chairman would be willing to continue to review this issue and its \nmerits as he takes this bill to conference.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Indiana has made clear his concerns \nregarding increasing the ability of airlines to compete for slots at \nReagan National. I can assure him that we will continue to look at this \nissue as we approach conference in the hopes of crafting a final \nprovision which best meets the many competing interests of members and \ntheir states, including those expressed by the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n               Consumer Access to Travel Information Act\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Arizona, the manager of this bill, in a discussion \nabout the growing concern of consumers about airline travel in this \ncountry.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced S. 1977, the Consumer Access to \nTravel Information Act of 1998. I introduced this important piece of \nlegislation to address a growing problem in the airline industry. For \nover three years, the major airlines have been moving to gain more \ncontrol over the airline travel ticket distribution system. While this \neffort may seem harmless, the ramifications to consumers are \nsignificant. Currently, most air travelers get their information from \none of the 33,000 travel agencies around the country. These agencies \nprovide consumers with unbiased and comprehensive air travel \ninformation, i.e. the best flight at the cheapest fare. Without that \nindependent source of travel information, there is no doubt that \nconsumers will be paying more, in many cases, substantially more for \nair travel.\n  S. 1977 would simply require the Secretary of Transportation to \ninvestigate the extent of possible anti-consumer, anti-competitive \nbehavior of major airlines, including discriminatory and predatory \npractices of airlines which target travel agents, other independent \ndistributors, and small airlines. This is authority that the Secretary \ncurrently has under the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, but has \nfailed to act upon. this bill would make certain this investigation is \nundertaken. If it is determined that anticompetitive, discriminatory or \npredatory practices exist, the Secretary would report to Congress those \nsteps the Department intends to take to address such practices.\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee whether he has been made aware of concerns raised by \nconsumers regarding air travel?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I want to thank the Senator from New York for raising \nconcerns in this area. I have, indeed, heard from consumer groups, \nparticularly small businessmen, regarding the high price of air travel, \nand the lack of competition in certain markets. Although most of the \nconcerns in this area focus on small, upstart, and regional airlines' \nability to compete with the big airlines, I am glad that you have \nbrought to my attention the role of the larger airlines in the ticket \ndistribution system.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator. I salute and support the efforts by \nthe manager of this bill to address the competition issue with small \nairlines. A critical part of a small airline's ability to compete is to \nhave its tickets distributed by an independent entity, mainly the \ntravel agent. Travel agents provide critical services to air travelers, \nand air travelers depend heavily on travel agents to provide an \naccurate, broad selection of schedules, fare quotes, and ticketing \nservices for all airlines.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senior Senator from Arizona if Congress \nshould address possible anti-competitive behavior with respect to the \nairline ticket distribution system?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senator raises a valid concern and I \nbelieve it is one our Committee needs to explore further. Although I \nunderstand the Senator's legitimate concern about the treatment of \ntravel agents by the major airlines, the Committee needs to investigate \nthis issue further before we pass any legislation on the matter.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I naturally would prefer to pass this \nlegislation now and have the Department begin looking into possible \nanti-competitive activities, but I understand the distinguished \nChairman's position. In addition, I realize this FAA Reauthorization \nlegislation must be signed into law by the end of this month, and I do \nnot want to delay it further. I ask the Senior Senator from Arizona if \nthe Commerce Committee could have a hearing on this matter in the near \nfuture to thoroughly examine the airline ticket distribution system and \nthe critical role of travel agents for consumers?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from New York that the Committee needs \nto explore this issue further, and I would like to work with him to put \ntogether a hearing on this matter as soon as it is feasible. The air \ntravelling consumer has a real advocate in the Senator from New York, \nand his leadership on this issue is to be commended.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator, and I look forward to working with \nhim further on this important issue.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2279. This \nis an important bill that we must finish before we adjourn. Without it \nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cannot spend any money on \nairport improvements, and airports in my state of South Carolina and \nthroughout the nation would have to stop needed improvements that will \nbring better, safer air service to local communities--service which \nallows those communities to attract and expand businesses.\n  The bill authorizes approximately $10 billion per year for the FAA \nfor fiscal years 1998 and 1999. This will allow the FAA to focus on its \nmost important mission--safety. Last year, more than 500 million \npassengers boarded planes and arrived at their destinations safely. Out \nair traffic control system is the safest in the world, but it needs to \nbe upgraded if we are to remain the world's leader.\n  The FAA is about to deploy new controller work stations--first in the \nSeattle en route center, and later in other en route centers. New \ncontroller work stations should also begin to be deployed within the \nnext year under the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System \n(STARS) contract.\n  More needs to be done. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission \n(NCARC) reported that unless something is done, the air traffic system \nfaces gridlock. The FAA has estimated that future passenger growth will \nbe about 3.5% per year through 2009, with enplanements going from 561 \nmillion in 1998 to 821 million in 2009. More controllers and more \nequipment are needed. Not only are we looking at relying on satellites \nto track aircraft, but each of our airports will need to expand. \nConcrete, new lighting systems, new terminals, and new security \nmeasures are required.\n  Right now, with the passage of last year's tax increase on the air \ncarriers, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is flush with money. The \nFAA estimates that the Trust Fund will take in total receipts of \n$10.622 billion in FY 1999. Only about 60 percent of the FAA's budget \ncomes from the Trust Fund, with the remainder coming from the General \nFund. There is more than enough money in the Trust fund to pay for the \nAirport Improvement Program (AIP), and I wish we could invest more \nfunding for the program than is included in the bill.\n  Next year I will fight to make sure that we restore the trust in the \naviation trust fund by taking it off budget. The state of South \nCarolina has an airport in every county. These airports serve small and \nlarge communities\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nthat benefit from the opportunities that are created by construction on \nan up-to-date airport. For example, runway improvements at the \nGreenville/Spartanburg Airport allowed the South Carolina Upstate to \nattract BMW to build its North American plant there. AIP funding helped \nthe former Myrtle Beach Air Force Base become the Myrtle Beach Jetport, \nbringing hundreds of tourists to vacations on the South Carolina Grand \nStrand. Whether it is Orangeburg, Marlboro County, or Hilton Head, \nSouth Carolina needs strong air transportation infrastructure. I can \ntell you as I travel around the state how critical aviation is. I have \nsupported these interests for many years. This bill allow us to \ncontinue to meet the needs of the state and country.\n  Finally, included in the managers' amendment are provisions of the \nVisit USA Act, introduced earlier this year as S. 2412 by Senator Burns \nand myself to further the international standing of the U.S. travel and \ntourism industry. As co-chairman of the United States Senate Tourism \nCaucus along with Senator Burns, I know that the tourism industry is a \nwinner for the United States. In my state of South Carolina, tourism \ngenerates over $6.5 billion and is responsible for 113,000 jobs. Over \n46 million international visitors came to the United States and spent \nover $90 billion in 1997. These visitors generated more than $5 billion \nin Federal taxes alone. To compete with other nations for a larger \nshare of international tourism over the next decade, we must support an \ninternational tourism marketing effort. Provisions of this legislation \nwould do that by authorizing appropriations for the marketing program \nof the U.S. National Tourism Organization (NTO). This authorization \nwould allow the NTO to continue operations beyond the October 11 sunset \ndate.\n  This legislation is the product of a lot of hard work by many members \nof the Commerce Committee. I would like to thank them for their \ndedication to improving America's airport infrastructure and bolstering \nthe safety of airline travel. I look forward to expeditious \nconsideration and passage of S. 2279.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3646\n\n  (Purpose: To make technical corrections in the managers' amendment)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask that a managers' amendment be \nincluded at this time, which also includes what had previously been the \nSpecter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. FORD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Friday, \nSeptember 25, the Senate turn to Calendar No. 509, S. 442, the Internet \ntax bill, and immediately following reporting by the clerk, the \nCommerce Committee substitute be agreed to, and immediately following \nthat action the Finance Committee substitute be agreed to and \nconsidered original text for the purpose of further amendments. I \nfurther ask that during the Senate's consideration of S. 442 or the \nHouse companion measure, only relevant amendments be in order.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if the acting \nleader would take the first paragraph and use that as his unanimous \nconsent request, this side is willing to accept that. The one I cannot \nagree to is: ``I further ask that during the Senate's consideration of \nS. 442 or the House companion measure, only relevant amendments be in \norder.'' I would object to that. But I would accept the upper part if \nthe Senator is willing to make that unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I can't do that, but I appreciate the \nwillingness of the Senator from Kentucky. Let me also state that I am \naware that the leadership on the other side is basically prepared \ntomorrow for us to move forward. I appreciate that. There is great \nunderstanding that this is a very important piece of legislation. The \nInternet Tax Freedom Act is of the highest priority all over America. I \nbelieve we will move to it. I believe that we will do it soon. I \nappreciate the interest and the agreement of the Senator from Kentucky \nthat we could work out some agreement on this--perhaps not tonight but \nperhaps tomorrow.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I will be more than willing to agree to a \nunanimous consent agreement to proceed to the bill without any other \nreservations or any time agreements or agreements to amendments. I \nwould be more than willing to do that. But under the circumstances, I \ndoubt if that would be acceptable so we will just have to work \novernight and tomorrow on the legislation and see if we can't come to \nsome kind of agreement. And I am hopeful, because we were close \ntonight, and I think if we had waited until morning I would not have \nbeen placed in a position to object. You do a lot of things around here \nsometimes you don't really like to do, but then I always like to be \n``Senator No.''\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky, \nespecially as we approach the end of this very important legislation \nwhich bears his name. I do not wish to end up this evening in any kind \nof disagreement with the Senator from Kentucky. It is not worth it.\n  Mr. FORD. A red letter day.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do know he is committed to passage of this legislation, \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act. He understands as well as I do, with just \na few days remaining, that if we didn't have some kind of agreement, \nwhich I do believe we will agree to, on circumscribing the number of \namendments to the bill, then it would be very difficult to get it done \nin a short period of time. I am not going to pursue this issue. Again, \nI spent too many hundreds of hours working with the Senator from \nKentucky for us to end up in some disagreement over an issue such as \nthis before completion of the bill that is called the Wendell H. Ford \nlegislation, which is very fittingly named after him as the reality is \nthat there is no Member of the Senate who has done more to further the \ncause of aviation in America than the Senator from Kentucky.\n  So, Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there will be \na vote tomorrow morning at approximately 9:50 a.m. on passage of the \nFAA reauthorization bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10913-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, the recent discovery of a sophisticated spy \nring operating in U.S. territory is a wake-up call to all who assume \nthat Fidel Castro is no longer America's tireless enemy. The Federal \nBureau of Investigation is to be congratulated for its excellent work, \nand, I ask unanimous consent that the Bureau's press release (dated \nSeptember 14, 1998) be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Federal Bureau of Investigation\n\n[Press Release--Date: September 14, 1998--contact: SA Mike Fabregas or \n                         Ausa John Schlesinger]\n\n\n                 fbi derails cuban intelligence network\n\n       Hector M. Pesquera, Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the \n     Miami Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \n     and Thomas E. Scott, United States Attorney for the Southern \n     District of Florida announce the arrests of ten (10) \n     individuals for conducting espionage activities against the \n     United States for the Republic of Cuba.\n       The arrest of ten (10) individuals in South Florida on \n     September 12, 1998, marked the culmination of a lengthy \n     investigation into subversive activities by the Cuban \n     Intelligence Service. The ten (10) individuals arrested were \n     directed to infiltrate and spy on United States agencies and \n     installations. These agents also attempted to infiltrate and \n     manipulate Anti-Castro groups within the South Florida \n     community.\n       The individuals arrested by the FBI include: Alejandro M. \n     Alonso, date of birth November 27, 1958; Ruben Campa, date of \n     birth September 15, 1965; Rene Gonzalez, date of birth August \n     13, 1956; Antonio Guerrero, Jr., date of birth October 16, \n     1958; Linda Hernandez, date of birth June 21, 1957; Nilo \n     Hernandez-Mederos, date of birth March 31, 1954; Luis Medina, \n     date of birth July 9, 1968; Joseph Santos-Cecilia, date of \n     birth October 9, 1960; Amarilys Silverio-Garcia, date of \n     birth September 23, 1961; Manuel Viramontez, date of birth \n     January 26, 1967.\n       Search warrants executed at several locations in South \n     Florida yielded disguises, radios, antennas, maps, computers, \n     money, and other items.\n       Sac Pesquera and U.S. Attorney Scott would like to commend \n     the efforts of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \n     (NCIS) who assisted greatly in this investigation.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the fact that several U.S. military \ninstallations were among the targets of this spying is evidence that \nthe Castro regime is a menace to the national security of the United \nStates. According to a reliable 1996 report, Cuban commandos have been \ntraining in Vietnam at least since 1990 to carry out strikes against \nU.S. military bases, precisely the target of the attempted \ninfiltrations of last week.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton Administration simply cannot and must not \ndefault on its clear obligation to respond to this and other hostile \nactions by Cuba.\n  First, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is obliged to pursue this \nespionage conspiracy relentlessly. Any and all Cuban personnel working \nin any diplomatic posts in Washington, D.C., and at the United Nations, \nwho had contact with this spy ring should be detained, prosecuted, and/\nor expelled without delay.\n  Future requests by Cuban ``diplomats'' to travel beyond the confines \nof Washington, D.C., or New York--particularly to South Florida--should \nbe summarily denied.\n  Second, U.S. officials, exile groups, and citizens who have been, or \nare, targets of Cuban spies should be warned by U.S. authorities of \nthis threat.\n  Third, it is imperative to hold the Russians accountable for their \ncontinued eavesdropping on U.S. defense and commercial communications \nat the state-of-the-art intelligence facility at Lourdes, Cuba. \nAccording to reliable published reports, sensitive U.S. information \ngathered at Lourdes is in the possession of Castro's Cubans and made \navailable to other rogue states to use against the United States. The \nRussians compensate Castro for this spy platform through a generous \noil-for-sugar deal--at a time when Moscow looks to the United States \nand the international community for multi-billion-dollar hand-outs of \nthe American taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton Administration at this very moment is \ncontemplating a huge increase in U.S. aid to Russia, has therefore \nsoft-peddled this grave security threat for too long. The removal of \nthe Lourdes facility and an end to the related compensation to the \nCubans must be given top priority in U.S.-Russian relations--and as a \nsubject to be considered in the instances of future U.S. aid proposals.\n  Fourth, this hostile espionage should put to rest the absurd notion--\nconceived by the Cuban regime and being considered by Administration \nofficials--that the United States should ``cooperate'' with the Cuban \ngovernment to fight drug trafficking in the Caribbean. Any serious talk \nabout anti-drug cooperation should be deferred until after Castro \nsurrenders the half-dozen senior Cuban officials who have been \nindicated in U.S. courts for smuggling drugs into the United States.\n  Fifth, senior Administration policy makers have informed members of \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff that they see no \nconnection between the spy ring and the Clinton plan to give U.S. food \naid to the United Nations for Cuba. In light of the espionage \nrevelations, it is incumbent upon the State Department and U.S.A.I.D. \nto make certain that any food that the Administration proposes to \ndonate to needy Cubans must be conducted entirely through \ninternational, independent relief groups operating under scrupulous \nmonitoring.\n  And, sixth, Mr. President, Americans have long awaited the Clinton \nAdministration's getting around to holding Castro's officials \naccountable for the terrorist attack carried out by Cuban MIGs on two \nunarmed Cessnas in February 1996. The fact that this attack on two \nsmall planes which were over international waters went unpunished has \nemboldened the Castro regime to act against us.\n  The Department of Justice should proceed promptly with an \ninvestigation of this incident in connection with the indictment of the \nCuban officials involved. It should be done under section 32 of title \nof the U.S. Code for the willful, premeditated destruction of two civil \naircraft resulting in the deaths of Pablo Morales, Carlos Costa, Mario \nde la Pena, and Armando Alejandre.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton Administration has an obligation to defend \nAmerica's national security against any country determined to do us \nharm.\n  Surely, decades of fighting tyrants has taught us that appeasement \nand unilateral concessions serve only to tempt our enemies. If the \nAdministration fails to hold Castro accountable for his repeated acts \nof treachery against us, it will tempt him to escalate them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10914-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MRS.

Purdum)\n\n       They are a rarefied roster of not quite two dozen, the men \n     and women who have served as independent counsels \n     investigating high Government officials over the last 20 \n     years. They have delved into accusations of everything from \n     cocaine use by a senior White House aide to perjury, \n     influence-peddling and favor-trading, and have produced \n     decidedly mixed results, from no indictments to convictions \n     to reversals on appeal.\n       Some of them have been harshly criticized for taking too \n     long, spending too much or criminalizing conduct other \n     prosecutors would most often not bother with. But as Kenneth \n     W. Starr's investigation of President Clinton has moved from \n     scrutiny of a tangled real estate investment to intimations \n     of intimacy with an intern, the law that created independent \n     counsels has come under attack as almost never before.\n       Interviews in the last week with seven of the people who \n     have held the job since that law, the Ethics in Government \n     Act of 1978, was adopted in the wake of Watergate produced \n     broad consensus that the statute was needed but might have to \n     be overhauled if it was to be renewed by Congress when it \n     expires next year.\n       The former counsels were unanimous on one point: all were \n     glad to have served. But a majority also said that as \n     currently written, the law covered too many officials and too \n     many potential acts of wrongdoing, and left the Attorney \n     General too little discretion about when to invoke it.\n       ``It should be limited to activities that occur in \n     office,'' said Lawrence E. Walsh, who spent six years and $40 \n     million investigating the Iran-contra affair and whose \n     suggestions for changes were among the most sweeping. ``It \n     should be limited to misuse of Government power and should \n     not include personal mistakes or indiscretions. The enormous \n     expense of an independent counsel's investigation and the \n     disruption of the Presidency should not be inflicted except \n     for something in which there was a misuse of power. That's \n     not out of consideration for the individual; it's out of \n     consideration for the country.''\n       And while the former counsels generally declined to comment \n     on Mr. Starr's investigation, virtually all of them also said \n     that wide experience as a criminal prosecutor or a defense \n     lawyer--which Mr. Starr does not have--should be a \n     requirement for the job.\n       ``I believe strongly in the concept of an independent \n     counsel to guarantee public confidence in the impartiality of \n     any criminal investigation into conduct of top officials in \n     the executive branch of our Government,'' said Whitney North \n     Seymour Jr., who won a perjury conviction against Michael K. \n     Deaver, a former top aide to President Ronald Reagan who was \n     accused of lying about his lobbying activities after leaving \n     office.\n       ``However,'' Mr. Seymour continued, in comments generally \n     echoed by his colleagues, ``appointments to that position \n     should be limited to lawyers with proven good judgment and \n     extensive prior experience in gathering admissible evidence, \n     developing corroboration and satisfying the trial standard of \n     reasonable doubt. We simply cannot afford the spectacle of \n     on-the-job training in such a sensitive position.''\n       Since Arthur H. Christy was appointed in 1979 to \n     investigate accusations that Hamilton Jordan, President Jimmy \n     Carter's chief of staff, had used cocaine at Studio 54--a \n     case that ended with no indictments--there have been a total \n     of 20 independent-counsel investigations, some conducted by \n     more than one prosecutor. The names of the targets of two \n     investigations in the Bush era, and the counsels who \n     conducted them, were sealed by court order. One investigator, \n     Robert B. Fiske Jr., was appointed by Attorney General Janet \n     Reno in 1994, at a time when the law had expired, and was \n     replaced four years ago last week by a three-judge Federal \n     panel that chose Mr. Starr instead, but Mr. Fiske had \n     essentially all the same powers.\n       Five investigations of Clinton Administration officials, \n     including Mr. Starr's, still await outcome, and Ms. Reno \n     remains under intense pressure to ask the judicial panel for \n     yet another independent counsel, to look into campaign \n     finance abuses. No effort was made to interview those \n     conducting active investigations, or the counsel who ended \n     his investigation of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown after \n     Mr. Brown's death in a plane crash in 1996.\n\n\n                  Enormous Power And Intense Isolation\n\n       A common theme in the remarks of the seven former counsels \n     who agreed to be interviewed was the momentous power and \n     isolation of the job, a universe of solitude and solemn \n     responsibility.\n       ``In terms of individual power, I never had anything like \n     this,'' said Mr. Walsh, who had served as a Federal district \n     judge and Deputy Attorney General in the Eisenhower \n     Administration. ``Night after night, I'd wake up in the \n     middle of the night. I kept a notebook by my bed, and the \n     only way I could get back to sleep was to write down whatever \n     was bothering me. I'd worry about my travel expenses, \n     thinking, `This is going to seem very high.' ''\n       When Mr. Fiske set up shop to investigate Whitewater, he \n     forsook the companionship of the only four friends he had in \n     Little Rock, Ark., who all happened to be leading lawyers \n     with ties to the city's political and legal establishment.\n       Scholarly critics of the independent counsel law, including \n     a Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia, have argued that it \n     creates built-in incentives for prosecutors to pursue \n     evidence and avenues of inquiry that law-enforcement \n     officials might otherwise decide were never likely to bear \n     fruit. Those incentives: simply the intense political \n     pressure and public scrutiny that surround any appointment, \n     and the requirement that the prosecutor produce a detailed \n     report justifying all the effort.\n       That concern was also common among the former prosecutors \n     themselves.\n       ``There ought to be some way to limit the ability of an \n     independent counsel to expand his or her investigation, to \n     keep their eye on the original target they were initially \n     appointed to investigate,'' said James C. McKay, whose \n     conviction of Lyn Nofziger, a former Reagan aide charged with \n     violating ethics laws on lobbying, was overturned on appeal \n     after an inquiry that lasted 14 months and cost $3 million. \n     ``When you think of how the Starr investigation started with \n     Mr. Fiske and Whitewater and now what's become of it, it just \n     seems that there should be some way to have prevented that \n     from occurring.''\n       Joseph DiGenova, who ultimately brought no charges after a \n     three-year, $2.2 million investigation into accusations that \n     senior Bush Administration officials improperly sought \n     information from Bill Clinton's passport files during the \n     1992 campaign, was the sole former prosecutor to condemn the \n     law altogether, and he said it should not be renewed.\n       ``All of the usual governors, both legal and practical, are \n     absent, because of the special nature of the statute,'' said \n     Mr. DiGenova, who argues that once the law is invoked, \n     prosecutors are forced to bring ``an unnatural degree of \n     targeted attention'' to the case.\n\n\n                Discretion That Cuts In Either Direction\n\n       Mr. Fiske, who like Mr. Walsh and Mr. DiGenova thinks any \n     law should cover investigation of only the President, the \n     Vice President and the Attorney General rather than the 75 or \n     so senior Government and campaign officials now automatically \n     covered, also worries about the potential for abuse.\n       ``Once the person is selected, it's like recalling a \n     missile,'' Mr. Fiske said. ``You can't recall it, and it's \n     kind of unguided, except by its own gyroscope. And so all \n     these things are judgment calls.''\n       But like his colleagues, he emphasized that a prosecutor's \n     wide discretion ultimately cut both ways. He recalled that \n     David Hale, a former municipal judge in Arkansas, having \n     pleaded guilty and begun cooperating in the Whitewater case, \n     provided much useful information, along with some that seemed \n     far afield.\n       ``There were a lot of other things that David Hale told us \n     that we could have investigated under our charter,'' Mr. \n     Fiske recounted, ``but I just said, `This is too far removed \n     from what we were supposed to be doing.' ''\n       Several of the prosecutors expressed concern that the \n     current law led too easily to the appointment of independent \n     counsels. Every time the Attorney General receives from a \n     credible source specific allegations of wrongdoing by an \n     official covered under the act, she has 30 days to decide, \n     without compelling anyone's testimony, whether a preliminary \n     investigation is warranted. If she concludes that it is, then \n     she must decide within 90 days whether there are ``reasonable \n     grounds'' to believe that further investigation is warranted. \n     If there are, she must apply to the special three-judge court \n     for appointment of an independent counsel.\n       ``That time limit now is too brief,'' Mr. McKay said.\n       But one of the former prosecutors, who spoke only on the \n     condition of anonymity, said that the law was sound as \n     written and that complaints that it invited prosecutorial \n     vendettas were overblown. Mr. Seymour also rejected \n     complaints of unbridled power, saying he had had no more \n     leeway as independent counsel than he had earlier had as \n     United States Attorney in Manhattan in the Nixon \n     Administration.\n       ``The United States Attorney for the Southern District has \n     almost unlimited\n\n[[Page S10916]]\n\n     power,'' Mr. Seymour said. ``How the responsibility is \n     carried out is another question.''\n       Similarly another former independent counsel, Alexia \n     Morrison, said that the law did not need any major changes \n     and that ``there's been a very successful campaign to lay \n     faults at the foot of the statute when in fact it is conduct \n     that got us here.'' Asked whether she meant conduct by \n     President Clinton, Mr. Starr or both, Ms. Morrison simply \n     repeated her assertion.\n       It was Ms. Morrison's investigation into whether Theodore \n     Olson, an Assistant Attorney General in the Reagan \n     Administration, misled Congress in a dispute over toxic waste \n     cleanup that led to the 1988 Supreme Court ruling unholding \n     the independent counsel law. And though she ultimately \n     brought no charges after a 30-month, $1.5 million \n     investigation, she, like some of her colleagues, said that \n     very result underscored one of the most important features of \n     the law: enhancing the public's confidence that nothing has \n     been covered up.\n       ``There are a heck of a lot of very troublesome \n     investigations that have been resolved without bringing any \n     criminal charges,'' Ms. Morrison said, ``and there was not a \n     situation in which anyone came back and said, `That's \n     outrageous.' ''\n       Mr. Fiske, too, said that in the absence of an independent \n     counsel law, there would seldom be significant public \n     controversy if high officials were charged and brought to \n     trial, whatever the outcome, but that ``the problem is when \n     the case isn't brought'' because a prosecutor decides there \n     is not enough evidence or likelihood of success. ``In many \n     respects,'' he said, ``that is where you need the independent \n     counsel most of all.''\n       But for alleged misdeeds that may have occurred before a \n     senior official took office, Mr. Walsh said, the independent \n     counsel law should not apply. Rather, the solution should be \n     to extend the statute of limitations for any such crimes and \n     investigate after the official leaves office--a suggestion \n     that Ms. Morrison seconded while acknowledging that this \n     could pose its own problems, in terms of stale evidence or \n     lost witnesses.\n\n\n               One Common Theme: Disdain for Partisanship\n\n       In one way or another, all the former counsels who were \n     interviewed deplored the partisanship now surrounding an \n     office that grew out of bipartisan concern over President \n     Richard M. Nixon's ``Saturday night massacre'' of the first \n     Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, and the two \n     highest officials of the Justice Department.\n       ``It's become so politicized now,'' Mr. McKay said, ``that \n     the ins hate it and the outs love it just for the purpose of \n     bringing the ins down. That's the part that will turn the \n     public sour.''\n       Mr. Seymour agreed, saying: ``It plainly has gotten a bad \n     name. And that comes from the public perception of recent \n     events, and I think that's unfortunate.''\n       Mr. DiGenova contended that the aftermath of Mr. Cox's \n     dismissal demonstrated that the independent counsel law was \n     not needed, since the Watergate inquiry continued under a new \n     special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, until Mr. Nixon's downfall \n     four years before the law was enacted.\n       ``There's no way that a sitting President can possibly \n     prevent his own investigation by firing anybody,'' Mr. \n     DiGenova said, ``because the political process will not \n     permit it.''\n       Ms. Morrison said it remained unclear whether the public \n     would continue to support the law.\n       ``I think most of the previous independent counsels have \n     been able to achieve a result with a general sense of public \n     confidence that the way they got there was appropriate,'' she \n     said. ``But hold your breath. It may be that Starr can spin \n     out a report that tells an incredibly interesting tale that \n     puts the lie to most of the procedural and substantive \n     assaults on him. On the other hand, if it looks like he \n     hasn't produced so much, and has used an elephant gun on a \n     flea, then maybe that won't be so well regarded.''\n       ``A Rarefied Roster'', independent counsels, the years of \n     their appointments and the results of their investigations.\n       1979, Arthur H.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify \nState and local authority to regulate the placement, construction, and \nmodification of broadcast transmission and telecommunications \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     TELECOMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to continue my strong \nobjections to proposed Federal Communications Commission rules that \ncould rob states and communities of the authority to decide where \nunsightly telecommunications towers should be built.\n  I am one of five Senators who voted against the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996. One of my fears was that the will and voice of states and \nlocal communities would be muzzled if that bill became law. \nUnfortunately, with the passage and implementation of the \nTelecommunications Act, my fears have been confirmed.\n  Mayors and citizens in Vermont towns and in towns across this nation \nare outraged that they have little control over the construction of \nthese towers. This is especially troubling when communications \ntechnology is advancing so rapidly that large towers may become \nobsolete.\n  For example, some wireless phone providers offer the older analog \nwireless service. That is now being replaced by digital phone service \nin many parts of the nation. Analog providers could provide towerless \nservice to towns by using an array of small antennas, instead of a \nlarge tower. Phone companies prefer to build one large tower with its \nswitching equipment because that is cheaper than the switching \nequipment needed to control an array of small antennas. However, if a \ntown does not want its landscape ruined with a tower, I think the \ncompany should be required to offer service through these smaller \nantennas.\n  Second, for companies offering the ``newer'' digital wireless phone \nservice, other technologies are eliminating the need for large towers. \nThe Iridium Corporation will offer phone service throughout the United \nStates in the near future that is based on more than 60 low-earth-orbit \nsatellites. Over time, this will provide a satellite communications \nlink from any place in the world, even where no tower-based system is \navailable.\n  In areas of the United States outside the range of cellular coverage \nthe Iridium phone will connect you directly to the Iridium satellite \nnetwork. Emergency communications--911 and disaster assistance--will be \ngreatly aided with this development.\n  Hospitals, ambulances and other emergency service providers will be \nlinked together by satellite directly from a hand held phone.\n  The Wall Street Journal reports that this service will cost more than \nregular cell phone service. However, they also report that other \ncompetitors and more efficiencies of scale are likely to bring down \ncosts over time.\n  In addition, I have previously discussed how the towerless PCS-Over-\nCable technology provides digital cellular phone service by using small \nantennas rather than large towers. These small antennas can be quickly \nattached to existing telephone poles, lamp posts or buildings and can \nprovide quality wireless phone service without the use of towers. This \ntechnology is cheaper than most tower technology in part because the \nPCS-Over-Cable wireless provider does not have to purchase land to \nerect large towers.\n  Since there are viable and reasonable alternatives to providing \nwireless phone service through the use of towers, I think that towns \nshould have some say in this matter. And I think that mayors, town \nofficials and local citizens will agree with me.\n  Why should a large tower be forced on a town when wireless phone \nservice can be provided without using a tower? Indeed, many argue that \ntowerless phone service is much better in a disaster situation. During \nNew England's ice storm, I am told that some towers collapsed. \nTornadoes, earthquakes or hurricanes can destroy large telephone \ntowers. But satellite phone service would not be affected by these \ndisasters. Also, the PCS-Over-Cable technology is much less likely to \nbe out of service for large areas during a disaster as compared to \nwireless phone service provided by large towers.\n  In addition, other advances in communications technology may also \nmake towers obsolete even faster than anticipated.\n  This is one reason why I am so concerned about the federal government \ntaking away the power of local communities to control where these \ntowers are located. When big, unsightly towers are proposed to be \nlocated in the wrong place, towns should be able to just say no. And if \nthe rules proposed by the FCC are implemented, towns will be further \nmarginalized and even lose their input as to where the towers are \nplaced.\n  As I have said before, I do not want Vermont turned into a \npincushion, with 200 foot towers indiscriminately sprouting up on every \nmountain and in every valley. I have heard from many Vermonters, as \nwell as town leaders and citizens from across the country, who are \njustifiably afraid that they are losing control over the siting, \ndesign, and construction of telecommunications towers and related \nfacilities. They feel that state and local concerns are being \nsacrificed to the interests of a small part of the telecommunications \nindustry that uses large towers.\n  Today I continue in my commitment to the preservation of state and \nlocal authority. I am joined by Senators Jeffords, Hutchinson, \nMoynihan, Feingold, Gregg, Moseley-Braun, Sarbanes, Dodd, and Cleland \nin introducing legislation which would repeal the authority of the FCC \nto preempt state and local regulations affecting the placement of new \ntelecommunications towers. This legislation expands and improves upon \nS. 1350, which I introduced one year ago.\n  Vermont communities and the state of Vermont must have a role in \ndeciding where towers are going to go. They\n\n[[Page S10922]]\n\nmust be able to take into account the protection of Vermont's scenic \nbeauty. This is true for other states as well.\n  In fact, by requiring the companies to work with Vermont towns, \nacceptable alternative locations of towers, acceptable co-location of \nantennas on existing towers, or the use of alternative towerless \ntechnology, could be suggested. This would be much better than allowing \nany company to just come in willy-nilly and plop down towers next to \nour backyards.\n  In my view passage of this bill will actually promote better \nemergency phone service, better phone service in disasters and the more \nadvanced digital wireless phone service.\n  The bill I am introducing today will mandate that states and towns \ncannot be ignored in the spread of telecommunications towers. This bill \nwill recognize that states and towns do have choices in this cellular \nage.\n  This bill also incorporates the concerns of the aviation industry. \nThe Federal Aviation Administration presently does not have authority \nto regulate the siting of towers. Airport officials work with local \ngovernments in the siting of towers. Silencing local governments will \nhave a direct effect on airline safety, according to the \nrepresentatives of the airline industry that we have heard from.\n  In a comment letter responding to the FCC's proposed rule, the \nNational Association of State Aviation Officials attacked preemption on \nthe grounds that it ``is contrary to the most fundamental principles of \naviation safety * * * the proposed rule could result in the creation of \nhazards to aircraft and passengers at airports across the United \nStates, as well as jeopardize safety on the ground.'' I cannot think of \nanyone who would want towers constructed irrespective of the negative \nand potentially dangerous impacts they may have on airplane flight and \nlanding patterns.\n  Make no mistake. I am for progress, but not for ill-considered, so-\ncalled progress at the expense of Vermont families, towns and \nhomeowners. Vermont can protect its rural and natural beauty while \nstill providing for the amazing opportunities offered by these \ntechnological advances.\n  To deprive states of the ability to protect their land from unsightly \ntowers is wrong, and the FCC rules should not stand. My legislation \nwould reaffirm that states have a role to play in where \ntelecommunications towers are placed and providing alternates to \nwireless providers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this new legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2514\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The placement of commercial telecommunications, radio, \n     or television towers near homes can greatly reduce the value \n     of such homes, destroy the views from such homes, and reduce \n     substantially the desire to live in such homes.\n       (2) States and localities should be able to exercise \n     control over the siting and modification of such towers \n     through the use of zoning, planned growth, and other controls \n     relating to the protection of the environment and public \n     safety.\n       (3) There are alternatives to the construction of towers to \n     meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, including the \n     co-location of antennae on existing towers or structures, \n     towerless PCS-Over-Cable telephone service, satellite \n     television systems, low-Earth orbit satellite communication \n     networks, and other alternative technologies.\n       (4) There are alternative methods of designing towers to \n     meet telecommunications and broadcast needs, including the \n     use of small towers that do not require blinking aircraft \n     safety lights, break skylines, or protrude above tree \n     canopies and that are camouflaged or disguised to blend with \n     their surroundings, or both.\n       (5) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications \n     Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182, \n     which would preempt the application of State and local zoning \n     and land use ordinances regarding the placement of broadcast \n     transmission facilities. It is in the interest of the Nation \n     that the Commission not adopt this rule.\n       (6) It is in the interest of the Nation that the memoranda \n     opinions and orders and proposed rules of the Commission with \n     respect to application of certain ordinances to the placement \n     of such towers (WT Docket No. 97-192, ET Docket No. 93-62, \n     RM-8577, and FCC 97-303, 62 F.R. 47960) be modified in order \n     to permit State and local governments to exercise their \n     zoning and land use authorities, and their power to protect \n     public health and safety, to regulate the placement of \n     telecommunications or broadcast towers and to place the \n     burden of proof in civil actions, and in actions before the \n     Commission relating to the placement of such towers, on the \n     person or entity that seeks to place, construct, or modify \n     such towers.\n       (7) PCS-Over-Cable or satellite telecommunications systems, \n     including low-Earth orbit satellites, offer a significant \n     opportunity to provide so-called ``911'' emergency telephone \n     service throughout much of the United States.\n       (8) According to the Comptroller General, the Commission \n     does not consider itself a health agency and turns to health \n     and radiation experts outside the Commission for guidance on \n     the issue of health effects of radio frequency exposure.\n       (9) The Federal Aviation Administration does not have the \n     authority to regulate the siting of personal wireless \n     telephone or broadcast transmission towers near airports or \n     high-volume air traffic areas such as corridors of airspace \n     or commonly used flyways. The Commission's proposed rules to \n     preempt State and local zoning and land-use restrictions for \n     the siting of such towers will have a serious negative impact \n     on aviation safety, airport capacity and investment, and the \n     efficient use of navigable airspace.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To repeal certain limitations on State and local \n     authority regarding the placement, construction, and \n     modification of personal wireless service towers and related \n     facilities as such limitations arise under section 332(c)(7) \n     of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).\n       (2) To permit State and local governments--\n       (A) in cases where the placement, construction, or \n     modification of personal wireless service telephone and \n     broadcast towers and other facilities is inconsistent with \n     State and local requirements or decisions, to require the use \n     of alternative telecommunication or broadcast technologies \n     when such alternative technologies are available; and\n       (B) to regulate the placement of such towers so that their \n     location or modification will not interfere with the safe and \n     efficient use of public airspace or otherwise compromise or \n     endanger public safety.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, \n                   CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF BROADCAST \n                   TRANSMISSION AND OTHER TELECOMMUNICATIONS \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) Repeal of Limitations on Regulation of Personal \n     Wireless Facilities.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that \n     follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not \n     unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally \n     equivalent services.'';\n       (2) by striking clause (iv);\n       (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and\n       (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated--\n       (A) in the first sentence, by striking ``30 days after such \n     action or failure to act'' and inserting ``30 days after \n     exhaustion of any administrative remedies with respect to \n     such action or failure to act''; and\n       (B) by striking the third sentence and inserting the \n     following: ``In any such action in which a person seeking to \n     place, construct, or modify a tower facility is a party, such \n     person shall bear the burden of proof.''.\n       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule Regarding Preemption of \n     State and Local Authority Over Broadcast Transmission \n     Facilities.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Federal Communications Commission may not adopt as a final \n     rule the proposed rule set forth in ``Preemption of State and \n     Local Zoning and Land Use Restrictions on Siting, Placement \n     and Construction of Broadcast Station Transmission \n     Facilities'', MM Docket No. 97-182, released August 19, 1997.\n       (c) Authority Over Placement, Construction, and \n     Modification of Other Transmission Towers.--Part I of title \n     III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 337. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT, \n                   CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF \n                   TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND BROADCAST TOWERS.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, no provision of this Act may be interpreted to \n     authorize any person to place, construct, or modify a \n     broadcast tower or telecommunications tower in a manner that \n     is inconsistent with State or local law, or contrary to an \n     official decision of the appropriate State or local \n     government entity having authority to approve, license, \n     modify, or deny an application to place, construct, or modify \n     a tower, if alternate technology is capable of delivering the \n     broadcast or telecommunications signals without the use of a \n     tower.\n       ``(b) Authority Regarding Production of Safety Studies.--No \n     provision of this Act may be interpreted to prohibit a State \n     or local government from--\n       ``(1) requiring a person seeking authority to locate \n     telecommunications facilities or broadcast transmission \n     facilities within the jurisdiction of such government to \n     produce--\n\n[[Page S10923]]\n\n       ``(A) environmental studies, engineering reports, or other \n     documentation of the compliance of such facilities with radio \n     frequency exposure limits established by the Commission; and\n       ``(B) documentation of the compliance of such facilities \n     with applicable Federal, State, and local aviation safety \n     standards or aviation obstruction standards regarding objects \n     effecting navigable airspace; or\n       ``(2) refusing to grant authority to such person to locate \n     such facilities within the jurisdiction of such government if \n     such person fails to produce any studies, reports, or \n     documentation required under paragraph (1).''.\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join forces \nwith Senators Leahy and Jeffords to introduce legislation which \nconfirms that zoning decisions should be the providence of local \ngovernments, not overseen by the Federal Communications Commission \nthrough the use of preemption authority.\n  It has been my position for some time that the FCC does not have a \nrole to play in local zoning, right of way management and franchising \ndecisions. I fought hard during consideration of the Communications Act \nof 1996 to ensure that local governments have the right to exercise \nthese fundamental authorities. The issues associated with the use and \nvalue of property, public and private, are most appropriately \nconsidered at the levels of government closest to the citizenry. Local \ngovernments can balance the needs of commerce and the use of property. \nIf their judgment is subject to question, it should be reviewed by the \ncourt system. It should not be checked by a federal regulator, who is \nfar less able to calculate the totality of a community's interest.\n  This legislation is needed because local governments have contended \nwith a proposed FCC rule to preempt local authority over the placement \nof broadcast towers. The rule, I understand, has been withdrawn as a \nresult of an agreement between the FCC, local and state government \ninterests and telecommunications industry interests under the auspices \nof the FCC's ``Local and State Government Advisory Committee.'' This \nagreement provides for facilities siting guidelines and informal \ndispute resolution. I applaud this agreement. I believe it represents \nthe reality that local governments, in the main, do want to work \ncooperatively with telecommunications providers who want to serve the \nresidents of a community.\n  However, I believe that this legislation is still necessary. The FCC \nsimply should not have the authority to preempt local zoning decisions.\n  I look forward to working on the progress of this bill with my co-\nsponsors and appreciate the opportunity to act in support of the \nexercise of local authority.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2515. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the amount of Social Security benefits exempt from tax for \nsingle taxpayers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                SENIOR CITIZEN TAX REDUCTION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which \nwill help alleviate a tax burden for senior citizens with modest \nincomes.\n  Until 1984, Federal taxes were not imposed on social security \nbenefits. People pay taxes their whole working life for social security \nbenefits and I do not believe that these payments should be taxed when \nthey retire.\n  This legislation will help those single persons, widows and widowers \nwith moderate incomes to keep more of their own money in their own \npockets. When you responsibly plan for your retirement, you should be \nable to count on your government to meet its obligations under the \ncontract you've made with social security.\n  Under current law, there is first, a calculation to determine whether \nany of your social security benefits are taxable. The base amount is \n$25,000 for singles and $32,000 for married persons. This base amount \nis figured by taking one-half of your social security benefits and \nadding in your other income. If you are single and the result is under \n$25,000, you don't pay taxes on your social security benefit. If the \namount is over this base amount, then a further calculation is done to \nfigure what portion of your social security benefit is taxable.\n  This further calculation determines how much of a person's benefit is \ntaxed and the answer depends on the total amount of a person's social \nsecurity benefit and their other income. Right now, if the total of \none-half of your benefits and all your other income is more than \n$34,000 for a single person and $44,000 for married persons, up to 85% \nof your benefits could be taxable. My legislation increases the single \namount to $44,000.\n  Let me give you an example of the effect my law would have. A widow \nhas $37,000 total income consisting of $10,000 in social security \nbenefits and $27,000 in other income. So for this widow, she adds half \nof her social security benefit which is $5,000 and her other income of \n$27,000 for a total of $32,000. Under the current law, since she has \nover $25,000 total income, she does the next calculation. The result is \nthat she has to include $3,500 of her social security benefits in her \nadjusted gross income. Under my legislation, none of her social \nsecurity benefits would be taxable.\n  While I realize that this may be considered a small step in removing \nan unfair tax burden, it is also an important first step to those \nseniors who have made America the greatest country in the world. I \nencourage the committee to give favorable consideration to our \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2516. A bill to make improvements in the operation and \nadministration of the Federal courts, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the federal courts improvement act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, I am introducing the Federal Courts \nImprovement Act of 1998. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, it is my responsibility to \nreview federal court processes and procedures. Every two years or so, \nthe Congress receives an official request from the Judicial Conference, \nthe governing body of the federal courts, that include changes in the \nlaw the Judicial Conference believes is necessary to improve the \nfunctioning of the courts.\n  After reviewing the latest official request from the Judicial \nConference, Senator Durbin, who is the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, and I worked together in putting together a modification \nof this request to introduce as legislation. We are introducing this \nlegislation today.\n  The bill contains four different titles including numerous changes in \nsubjects such as judicial financial administration, judicial process \nimprovements, judicial personnel administration, other personnel \nmatters and federal public defenders. While many of these items may not \nbe essential for the court system to operate, they will certainly help \nthe system function better, and hopefully, more effectively.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that we can consider this bill and pass \nit during these last few weeks of this Congress. I will work with \nSenator Durbin to try and make that happen. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport us in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \ntakes an important step toward improving the nation's federal crop \ninsurance program--the ``Crop Insurance Reform Act.''\n  Over the last year, we have witnessed devastating circumstances come \ntogether to create a crisis atmosphere for many of our nation's \nfarmers. I know that in my own state of Minnesota, multiple years of \nwet weather and crop disease--especially scab--coupled with rising \nproduction costs and plummeting commodity prices is wiping out family \nfarms in record numbers.\n  With the increased opportunities that accompany Freedom to Farm come \nincreased risks. We've seen this first hand.\n  Freedom to Farm can work, but a necessary component of it is an \nadequate crop insurance program. This component has been missing so \nfar. One of the promises made during debate of the 1996 Farm Bill was \nthat Congress would address the need for better crop insurance.\n  We must not let another growing season pass without having instituted \na new, effective crop insurance program. This overhaul is a major \nundertaking, but instituting a program of comprehensive reform must be \na priority upon our return in January.\n  And, we must start the debate now so that we can have the best system \nin place in time. The bill I'm introducing today is a first step. It is \nthe result of months of work from my Minnesota Crop Insurance Work \nGroup.\n  The Work Group consists of various commodity groups, farm \norganizations, rural lenders, and agriculture economists. We have also \nworked closely with USDA's Farm Service and Risk Management Agencies. \nBut it was my primary intention to assemble a committee of farmers and \nlenders--people who know the situation and have seen the problems first \nhand.\n  The Crop Insurance Reform Act is designed to address the coverage \ndecision a farmer must make at the initial stages of purchasing crop \ninsurance.\n  This bill allows more options for producers to choose from when \nmaking risk-management decisions. It essentially provides farmers with \nan enhanced coverage product at a more affordable price.\n  Currently, producer premium subsidies range from nearly 42% at the \n100% price election for 65% coverage, to only 13% at the 100% price \nelection for 85% coverage. Producers continue to stress that, although \nthe Risk Management Agency has recently provided better product \noptions, the subsidy levels at the higher ends of coverage make them \ncost prohibitive.\n  This bill will put in place a flat subsidy level of 29% across the \n100% price election and at all levels of coverage. This will adjust the \nproducer premiums to make better coverage more affordable.\n  When farmers are armed with the necessary risk management tools, \neverybody saves. The government saves in ad hoc disaster payments, \narguably the most expensive way to address any kind of financial \ncrisis. But more importantly, the family farmer saves.\n  This bill is just the beginning of reform. Over the next few months, \nI will continue to work with my Crop Insurance Work Group, and my \ncolleagues, Senators Lugar and Roberts, to craft a comprehensive \nprogram which directly benefits producers and protects the taxpayers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 2518. A bill to enhance family life; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the enhancing family life act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Enhancing Family \nLife Act of 1998, a bill inspired by an extraordinary set of proposals \nby one of our nation's most eminent social scientists, Professor James \nQ. Wilson. On December 4, 1997, I had the honor of hearing Professor \nWilson--who is an old and dear friend--deliver the Francis Boyer \nLecture at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). The Boyer Lecture \nis delivered at AEI's annual dinner by a thinker who has ``made notable \nintellectual or practical contributions to improved public policy and \nsocial welfare.'' Previous Boyer lecturers have included Irving \nKristol, Alan Greenspan, and Henry Kissinger. In his lecture, Professor \nWilson argued that ``two nations'' now exist within the United States. \nHe said:\n\n       In one nation, a child, raised by two parents, acquires an \n     education, a job, a spouse, and a home kept separate from \n     crime and disorder by distance, fences, or guards. In the \n     other nation, a child is raised by an unwed girl, lives in a \n     neighborhood filled with many sexual men but few committed \n     fathers, and finds gang life to be necessary for self-\n     protection and valuable for self-advancement.\n\n  Sadly, this is an all-too-accurate portrait of the American \nunderclass, the\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\nproblems of which have been the focus of decades of unsuccessful \nwelfare reform and crime control efforts. We have tried a great many \n``solutions,'' as Professor Wilson notes:\n\n       Congress has devised community action, built public \n     housing, created a Job Corps, distributed Food Stamps, given \n     federal funds to low-income schools, supported job training, \n     and provided cash grants to working families.\n\n  Yet still we are faced with two nations. Professor Wilson explains \nwhy: ``[t]he family problem lies at the heart of the emergency of two \nnations.'' He notes that as our families become weaker--as more and \nmore American children are born outside of marriage and raised by one, \nnot two, parents--the foundation of our society becomes weaker. This \ndeterioration helps to explain why, as reported by the Census Bureau \ntoday, the poverty rate for American children is almost twice that for \nadults aged 18 to 64 (19.9 percent for children versus 10.9 percent for \nadults). And it grows increasingly difficult for government to address \nthe problems of that ``second nation.'' Professor Wilson even quotes \nthe Senator from New York to this effect: ``If you expect a government \nprogram to change families, you know more about government than I do.''\n  Even so, Jim Wilson, quite characteristically, has fresh ideas about \nwhat might help. On the basis of recent scholarly research, and common \nsense, he urged in the Boyer lecture that we refocus our attention on \nthe vital period of early childhood. I was so impressed with his \nlecture that afterward I set about writing a bill to put his \nrecommendations into effect.\n  The Enhancing Family Life Act of 1998 contains four key elements, all \nof which are related to families. First, it supports ``second chance'' \nmaternity homes for unwed teenage mothers. These are group homes where \nyoung women would live with their children under strict adult \nsupervision and have the support necessary to become productive members \nof society. The bill provides $45 million a year to create such homes \nor expand existing ones.\n  Second, it promotes adoption. The bill expands the number of children \nin foster care eligible for federal adoption incentives. Too many \nchildren drift in foster care; we should do more to find them permanent \nhomes. The bill also encourages states to experiment with ``per \ncapita'' approaches to finding these permanent homes for foster \nchildren, a strategy Kansas has used with success.\n  Third, it funds collaborative early childhood development programs. \nRecent research has reminded us of the critical importance of the first \nfew years of a child's life. States would have great flexibility in the \nuse of these funds; for example, the money could be used for pre-school \nprograms for poor children or home visits of parents of young children. \nIt provides $3.75 billion over five years for this purpose.\n  Finally, the legislation creates a new education assistance program \nto enable more parents to remain home with young children. A parent who \ntemporarily leaves the work force to raise a child would be eligible \nfor an educational grant, similar to the Pell Grant, to help the parent \nenter, or re-enter, the labor market with skills and credentials \nnecessary for success in today's economy once the child is older.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a starting point. It is what Professor \nJames Q. Wilson and I believe just might make a difference. We would \ncertainly welcome the comments of others. And I would commend to the \nattention of Senators and other interested persons the full text of \nProfessor Wilson's lecture ``Two Nations,'' which is available from my \noffice or from the American Enterprise Institute. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a summary of the legislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             The Enhancing Family Life Act of 1998--Summary\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Family Life Act of \n     1998.''\n\n\n                          section 2. findings\n\n       The Congressional findings support the importance of \n     families in society and social policy.\n\n                    Title I--Assistance for Children\n\n\n                  section 101. ``second chance homes''\n\n       The bill would provide $45 million annually to establish or \n     expand ``second chance'' maternity homes for unwed teenage \n     mothers. These are group homes where mothers live with their \n     children under adult supervision and strict rules while \n     learning good parenting skills.\n\n\n                    section 102. adoption promotion\n\n       The bill would expand the number of ``special needs'' \n     children in foster care for which federal adoption subsidies \n     are available. It de-links'' eligibility for these subsidies \n     from the income level of the foster child's biological \n     parents. (Under current law, a foster child determined to \n     have special needs only qualifies for a federal adoption \n     subsidy if the child's birth parents are welfare-eligible.) \n     The subsidies would help adoptive parents meet the particular \n     emotional and physical challenges of troubled children and so \n     they can provide the children permanent homes.\n       In addition, last year's ``Adoption and Safe Families Act'' \n     authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to \n     grant child welfare demonstration waivers to ten states each \n     year. The bill would reserve three of each ten waivers to \n     states willing to test ``per capita'' approaches to finding \n     permanent homes for children in foster care, as Kansas has \n     done. Under a per capita approach, states or localities \n     contract on a fixed sum basis with agencies to reunite foster \n     children with their biological families or place them with \n     adoptive parents. Because the agency, typically a non-profit \n     social service agency, receives a fixed sum per child (rather \n     then unlimited reimbursement of costs) the agency may settle \n     the child in a permanent home more quickly.\n\n\n                section 103. early childhood development\n\n       The bill provides $3.75 billion over five years for \n     collaborative early childhood development programs. Recent \n     research has demonstrated the importance of the earliest \n     years in a child's life in the child's intellectual and \n     emotional development. States could use the funds for home \n     visiting programs, parenting education, high-quality child \n     care, and preventive health services. States would have great \n     flexibility in deciding which services to provide.\n\n\n                     section II--``parent grants''\n\n       The bill would create a new education assistance program to \n     provide grants to parents who choose to remain at home with \n     young children. The grants would allow parents to obtain the \n     training, or re-training, needed to prosper and advance \n     careers after a period of time outside the labor force. A \n     custodial parent with children under the age of six and no \n     earned income, welfare, or SSI receipt would be eligible to \n     receive a benefit equivalent to the largest Pell Grant \n     available for that year (about $2,700 in FY 1998). The \n     benefit--to be called a ``Parent Grant''--could only be used \n     for expenses associated with post-secondary education or \n     completion of high school. Parents could accumulate grants \n     (one for each year outside of the labor market) but would be \n     required to use the grant within 15 years of the year for \n     which the grant was earned. Eligibility would be subjected to \n     income limits ($75,000/year maximum, subject to revision on \n     the basis of cost estimates). The program would be \n     administered by the Education Department, in parallel with \n     Pell Grants and other financial aid programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 2519. A bill to promote and enhance public safety through use of \n9-1-1 at the universal emergency assistance number, further deployment \nof wireless 9-1-1 service, support of States in upgrading 9-1-1 \ncapabilities and related functions, encouragement of construction and \noperation of seamless, ubiquitous and reliable networks for personal \nwireless services, and ensuring access to Federal Government property \nfor such networks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC SAFETY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wireless \nCommunications and Public Safety Act of 1998 to help build a national \nwireless communications system and save lives. I would like to thank \nSenator Burns for co-sponsoring this important legislation with me, and \nI look forward to working with him to move this legislation forward \nduring the remainder of the Congress and the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, when a person is seriously injured, in a car crash or \na violent crime or in some other way, every minute counts. Medical \ntrauma and public safety professionals speak of the ``golden hour''--\nthe first hour after serious injury when the greatest percentage of \npatient lives can be saved. The quicker that person gets medical help, \nthe greater the chances of survival.\n  We would like people to be able to get medical help as fast as \npossible after serious injury. As a practical matter, it takes time--\noften a half-hour in an urban area or an hour in a rural area--before \nan ambulance completes the job of getting to the scene of\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\nan accident and transporting the injured to a medical facility, where \ndoctors can go to work saving the injured person. This bill is designed \nto help cut down that medical response time for millions of Americans, \nby helping to make sure that people can use their wireless telephones \nto call 9-1-1 immediately to get the ambulances rolling.\n  More than 60 million Americans carry wireless telephones. Many people \ncarry them for safety reasons. People count on those phones to be their \nlifelines in emergencies. A parent driving down an interstate highway \nwith children in the back seat draws comfort from knowing that if the \ncar is involved in a crash, he or she can call 9-1-1 for help and an \nambulance will be rolling in seconds. An older American driving alone \non a long trip feels more comfortable knowing that if an accident \noccurs or sudden illness strikes, he or she can use the wireless phone \nto dial 9-1-1 for help and the state police will be on the way.\n  But there's a big problem. In many parts of our country, when the \nfrantic parent or the suddenly disabled older person punches 9-1-1 on \nthe wireless phone, nothing happens. In many areas of the country, 9-1-\n1 is not the emergency number, or there simply is no wireless telephone \nservice at all. If a wireless telephone isn't within range of a \nwireless tower, a wireless call can't go through. The ambulance and the \npolice won't be coming. You may be facing a terrible emergency, but \nyou're on your own.\n\n  The same problem arises even if an emergency occurs within range of a \nwireless tower, if a person is too injured to make a 9-1-1 call, or can \nmake the call but cannot give his or her location.\n  Mr. President, this bill can be called the 9-1-1 bill--its main \npurposes are to expand the areas covered by wireless telephone service \nso that more people in more places can call 9-1-1 systems so that they \ncan deliver more information, like location and automatic crash \nnotification data. The bill is designed to tie our citizens through \ntheir wireless telephones to the medical centers, police, and \nfirefighters who can help them in emergencies.\n  The bill has four main elements.\n  First, it makes 9-1-1 the universal emergency telephone number. I \nsuspect that most Americans think that 9-1-1 already is the emergency \nnumber everywhere, but it isn't. There are many places in America \nwhere, even if you can get a telephone connection, 9-1-1 isn't the \nright number to call for help. This legislation will reduce the danger \nof not knowing what number to call. The rule in America ought to be \nuniform and simple--if you have an emergency, wherever you are, dial 9-\n1-1. The bill sets a national policy for us all to pursue together, \nbut, instead of imposing a federal mandate for executing that policy, \nallows the states and localities to decide how best to further that \npolicy in their areas.\n  The second key element of the bill is a system of grants to assist \nthe states and local governments in developing, coordinating, and \ncarrying out their plans to make wireless service available to more \ncitizens and to upgrade their 9-1-1 systems so they can provide the \nlocation of wireless callers. The bill gives the states maximum \nflexibility in designing their plans to qualify for the grants. It is \nwritten carefully so that it is not a federal mandate, and we will not \nhave federal bureaucrats micro-managing wireless telephone companies, \nstate and local public safety programs, or hospital emergency rooms.\n  The people who run our nation's 9-1-1 systems, and increasingly the \nelected officials who employ them, know they have a growing challenge \nin this area. More and more Americans are using wireless telephones to \ncommunicate, and there are over 83,000 wireless emergency calls a day \nnow. But the technology receiving those calls is often outdated, and \nnew local technology needs to be implemented. By offering substantial \nfederal grants funded from the fees the government receives from \nwireless carriers who place their towers on federal land, the bill \nencourages the states to bring the stakeholders together to make the \ndecisions necessary to deploy these life-saving technologies. The \nimplementation problems here are not technological; they are financial \nand legislative. This bill will provide federal support, but the key \nleadership and decisions will come from state and local officials.\n  The the third key element of the bill is research and development of \nnew lifesaving technology for motor vehicles. Proper medical care could \nbe dispatched almost immediately if a car that was involved in a crash \nautomatically signaled to public safety officials that the car had \ncrashed, where it had crashed, and how bad the crash was. The trauma \nexperts tell us they can predict the kinds of injuries a victim has \nthis crash data--so they will know whether to send a helicopter, an \nadvanced care ambulance, or just a wrecker and a ride home. We can use \nwireless technology to make these automatic reports. This bill will \nauthorize the necessary investments to develop the know-how to tie \ntogether our cars, our public safety officials, and our hospitals for \nrapid response in vehicles emergencies\n  The fourth key element of this legislation is using federal property \nto help expand the wireless network. Current law and Administration \npolicy say that federal agencies should encourage wireless facilities \non federal property so as to expand the availability of wireless \nservice, but agencies have been slow to open up their land and \nbuildings. This bill will establish a clear and enforceable policy of \nallowing wireless facilities on federal property when it doesn't \ninterfere with the agency's mission or use of the property. The agency \nwill be allowed to charge fees for the use of the property, and those \nfees will go into a fund that will pay for grants to states and crash-\nnotification investments under the bill.\n  It is also important to note what this bill does not do. It does not \naffect in any way the ability of state or local governments to impose \ntaxes or fees on any business. It does not preempt in any way the \ncurrent power of state and local government regarding antenna siting \nover property under their authority. And, indeed, it provides an \nexplicit statutory requirement of notice and comment for state and \nlocal officials on siting applications for use of federal property. \nThese three changes I made from earlier drafts resolve some of the \nconcerns that were raised by some leaders of local and county \ngovernments.\n  Some organizations sought additional changes to the legislation.\n  The Department of the Interior, for example, wanted to change the \nprovision on judicial review of federal agency denials of requests for \naccess to federal property so that the burden of proof in court would \nbe on the person challenging the agency's decision not to grant the \nrequested access. This bill instead adopts the standard used in the \nFreedom of Information Act, which puts on the agency the burden of \nsustaining its action. Since the agency has superior access to all the \nrelevant information, it is appropriate for the agency to bear the \nburden of going forward with evidence and persuading the court of the \ncorrectness of the agency's decision.\n  Also, some have suggested that the bill should be changed so that the \nsate and local law would apply to the citing of wireless antennas on \nfederal property. That would be inconsistent with current law and run \ncounter to the basis purpose of this legislation. To allow state and \nlocal officials to extend state and local zoning laws to the placement \nof antennas on federal property would give states and localities an \nunprecedented ability to control decisions by federal officials with \nrespect to federal property, and reduce the revenue generated by the \nfederal leases or antenna siting. We simply cannot have a situation in \nwhich a locality could be allowed to hold the interests of the region \nor the country hostage to parochial interests. The requirement in my \nlegislation that state and local officials have notice and an \nopportunity to comment with respect to requests for antenna siting on \nfederal property gives state and local officials their appropriate \nrole. They will have the opportunity to present their views, but will \nnot have a veto over placement of antennas on federal property. It is \nimportant to remember what is at issue here--the ability of people to \ncall for help in emergencies and get a prompt public safety response--\nin short, save lives.\n  This legislation has been developed in consultation with a wide range \nof groups that have great expertise in the\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\nsubjects covered by the legislation, including state and local \nofficials who run our nation's 9-1-1 systems, trauma experts, the \nAmerican Automobile Association, the wireless industry and others. The \nbill has the strong support of a diverse coalition that includes these \nand many other groups. To the extent that some groups have concerns \nabout a few of he bill's provisions, I intend to continue to work with \nthem to try to address these concerns.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important step forward to helping \nstate and local emergency agencies do their jobs, offering them \nsignificant grants to improve their capabilities. This bill also will \ngo a long way toward helping the nation expand its wireless network. It \nwill help make sure that Americans everywhere can dial 9-1-1 to summon \nprompt assistance in an emergency.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Commerce \nCommittee on this important life-saving legislation, an I urge all my \ncolleague to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Quiet Communities Act of \n     1998''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) for too many citizens of the United States, noise \n     from aircraft, vehicular traffic, and a variety of other \n     sources is a constant source of torment; and\n       (B) nearly 20,000,000 citizens of the United States are \n     exposed to noise levels that can lead to psychological and \n     physiological damage, and another 40,000,000 people are \n     exposed to noise levels that cause sleep or work disruption;\n       (2)(A) chronic exposure to noise has been linked to \n     increased risk of cardiovascular problems, strokes, and \n     nervous disorders; and\n       (B) excessive noise causes sleep deprivation and task \n     interruptions, which pose untold costs on society in \n     diminished worker productivity;\n       (3)(A) to carry out the Clean Air Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. \n     7401 et seq.), the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 U.S.C. 4901 \n     et seq.), and section 8 of the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 \n     (92 Stat. 3084), the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency established an Office of Noise Abatement \n     and Control;\n       (B) the responsibilities of the Office of Noise Abatement \n     and Control included promulgating noise emission standards, \n     requiring product labeling, facilitating the development of \n     low emission products, coordinating Federal noise reduction \n     programs, assisting State and local abatement efforts, and \n     promoting noise education and research; and\n       (C) funding for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control \n     was terminated in 1982 and no funds have been provided since;\n       (4) because the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency remains responsible for enforcing \n     regulations issued under the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4901 et seq.) even though funding for the Office of \n     Noise Abatement and Control has been terminated, and because \n     that Act prohibits State and local governments from \n     regulating noise sources in many situations, noise abatement \n     programs across the United States lie dormant;\n       (5) as the population grows and air and vehicle traffic \n     continues to increase, noise pollution is likely to become an \n     even greater problem in the future; and\n       (6) the health and welfare of the citizens of the United \n     States demands that the Environmental Protection Agency once \n     again assume a role in combating noise pollution.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title--\n       (1) $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1999, 2000, and \n     2001; and\n       (2) $8,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DORGAN AMENDMENT NO. 3628\n\n  Mr. DORGAN proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2279, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. ____.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) contaminated sediments can pose a serious and \n     demonstrable risk to human health and the environment;\n       (2) persistent, bioaccumulative toxic substances in \n     contaminated sediments can poison the food chain, making fish \n     and shellfish unsafe for humans and wildlife to eat;\n       (3) potential costs to society from contaminated sediments \n     include long-term health effects such as cancer and \n     children's neurological and intellectual impairment;\n       (4) contamination of sediments can interfere with \n     recreational uses and increase the costs of and time needed \n     for navigational dredging and subsequent disposal of dredged \n     material;\n       (5) since the enactment of the amendments to the Federal \n     Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) made by \n     the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990 (104 Stat. \n     3000) and the enactment of the National Contaminated Sediment \n     Assessment and Management Act (33 U.S.C. 1271 note; Public \n     Law 102-580), the Nation has gained considerable experience \n     with and understanding of sediment contamination;\n       (6) a report on the incidence and severity of sediment \n     contamination in surface waters of the United States, \n     required under section 503 of the National Contaminated \n     Sediment Assessment and Management Act (33 U.S.C. 1271), \n     identified 96 areas of probable concern where contaminated \n     sediments pose potential risks to fish and wildlife and to \n     people who eat fish from those areas;\n       (7) the assessment and remediation of the contaminated \n     sediment program under the Federal Water Pollution Control \n     Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) and subsequent studies have \n     demonstrated that there are some effective tools for--\n       (A) determining the extent and magnitude of sediment \n     contamination;\n       (B) assessing risk and modeling the changes that would \n     result from remedial action; and\n       (C) involving the public in solutions;\n       (8) prompt response after discovery of sediment \n     contamination can prevent subsequent spread through storm \n     events, thereby minimizing environmental impacts and response \n     costs;\n       (9) the United States needs a better understanding of the \n     sources of sediment contamination in order to prevent \n     subsequent recontamination and minimize the recurrence of \n     environmental impacts and response costs;\n       (10) the response to releases of contaminated sediments \n     should reflect the risk associated with the contamination, \n     and remedies should reflect the potential for beneficial \n     reuse of sediments;\n       (11) coordination in the use of government authorities and \n     resources for remediation has not kept pace with the growth \n     in knowledge of effective remediation measures, and responses \n     have not been timely or adequately funded;\n       (12) the resources of the Federal Government should be \n     brought to bear on the problems referred to in paragraph (11) \n     in a well-coordinated fashion; and\n\n[[Page S10932]]\n\n       (13) the Federal Government should use the funding and \n     enforcement authorities of the Superfund program to respond \n     to the serious environmental risks that can be posed by \n     contaminated sediment sites.\n\n     SEC. ____03.

PILOT PROGRAM ON PREVENTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the costs of dredging for navigational purposes are \n     increased by contamination, including contamination from \n     ongoing activities;\n       (2) sediment quality problems are not solely the legacy of \n     past discharges;\n       (3) the ``polluter pays'' principle has not been \n     consistently applied to contamination of sediments, because \n     parties contributing to the contamination have not \n     necessarily been held responsible for their share of the \n     increased costs of dredging or remediation attributable to \n     the contamination;\n       (4) prevention measures that control the volume or toxicity \n     of sedimentation should lower the costs of dredging that \n     eventually becomes necessary;\n       (5) it may be easier and less expensive to prevent \n     contamination of sediment than to remedy it;\n       (6) the relationship between prevention measures and \n     remediation needs to be better understood;\n       (7) an improved understanding of the sources of \n     contamination and an improved ability to link sedimentation \n     and contamination to their sources are needed; and\n       (8) there should be a closer linkage between actions to \n     prevent sediment contamination and the cost savings that can \n     be attained when future remediation becomes unnecessary.\n       (b) Pilot Program.--The Task Force shall establish a pilot \n     program to--\n       (1) improve the understanding of the relationship between \n     upstream prevention and control measures; and\n       (2) provide incentives for upstream measures that can lower \n     the costs of dredging, disposal, or treatment or reuse of \n     dredged materials.\n       (c) Competitive Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--The pilot program shall provide for \n     competitive grants to be administered by agencies represented \n     on the Task Force with experience in developing and managing \n     programs that address upstream concerns.\n       (2) Purposes.--The grants shall provide assistance for--\n       (A) development of plans for reduction in sediment \n     contamination;\n       (B) technical support for implementing those plans;\n       (C) measurement of impacts of implementation measures, in \n     comparison to baselines; and\n       (D) coordinating the use of available authorities to reduce \n     further contamination of sediments.\n       (3) Eligibility.--The grants shall be awarded to States or \n     substate organizations that can develop and implement the \n     plans described in paragraph (2) on a watershed basis.\n       (4) Criteria.--The Secretary and the Administrator shall \n     develop criteria for evaluating grant proposals under this \n     subsection.\n       (d) Technical Assistance.--Using the data gathered under \n     section 516(e) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1996 \n     (33 U.S.C. 2326b(e)), after entering into an interagency \n     agreement with the Administrator, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, and the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary \n     may provide technical assistance to communities in reducing \n     contamination of sediments.\n\n     SEC. ____10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Task Force and Priority Setting.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     section ____04.\n       (b) Technology Demonstration.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out section ____08 $50,000,000.\n       (c) Pilot Program.--There is authorized to be appropriated \n     to carry out section ____09 $5,000,000.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am submitting for the Record and \nmy colleagues' consideration an amendment to S. 2131, the Water \nResources Development Act (WRDA) of 1998, which I hope will be included \nin that legislation. It is a relatively simple measure. Contaminated \nsediments are a serious problem in our nation's waterways and ports and \na potential threat to human and environmental health. S. 2131 presents \na long overdue and perfectly appropriate opportunity to begin \naddressing this problem.\n  The EPA submitted a report to Congress this year on the quality of \nsediments across the nation, pursuant to WRDA of 1992. The report shows \nthat we have cause to worry. Ninety-six areas of probable concern are \nidentified where public and environmental health may be threatened by \ncontaminated sediments. Yet, we have at least six different Federal \nstatutes with implementation responsibilities spread over seven Federal \nagencies, including a great many specific provisions regarding the Army \nCorps of Engineers' duties in recent WRDAs, two major programs--\nSuperfund and Clean Water--within EPA, and numerous state and local \ngovernments coming at the problem of contaminated sediments in a \nvariety of ways. The inefficiency of this setup and the lack of \ninformation exchange and data availability reduces the chances of an \nexpeditious solution. My amendment is intended to improve communication \nand cooperation among agencies, affected parties and all levels of \ngovernment, and motivate them to address the problem sooner rather than \nlater.\n  My amendment requires the National Contaminated Sediment Task Force, \nas authorized in section 502 of WRDA of 1992 but never funded, to \nactually meet and make recommendations on how to improve contaminated \nsediment management practices. Also, this Task Force would have to \nreport on the status of remedial actions on contaminated sediment sites \nacross the nation, including Superfund sites, within one year. This \nreport would also have to identify remediation status, programs and \nfunding for cleanup, the nature and sources, etc. of contaminated \nsediments.\n  EPA and the Army Corps would jointly publish a recurring report on \nways to assess the threat of contaminated sediment, on the status of \nany guidelines issued designed to protect human and environmental \nhealth or to reduce deposition of toxics into sediment, and on \nguidelines issued intended to encourage the beneficial use of dredged \nmaterial.\n  Finally, the amendment makes modifications to cost-share provisions \nfor environmental dredging, remediation technology assistance, and \nestablishes a pilot program to give grants to communities that try to \nreduce contamination of downstream sediments.\n  Mr. President, there have been years of inaction on contaminated \nsediments. My amendment is primarily intended to gather information and \nstimulate the agencies with jurisdiction to take this matter seriously \nand begin working together. If the information I am seeking is prepared \nin a timely way, the reauthorizations of Superfund and the Clean Water \nAct will be greatly enhanced from an environmental perspective, insofar \nas my colleagues would like to truly address the multi-media threat \nposed by contaminated sediments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10931-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10933-S10936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n WENDELL H.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue \nthe Senate addressed yesterday, amendment #3616 by Senator Harkin. \nWhile I cast my vote against tabling this Sense of the Senate, I must \nadmit I did so with great personal reluctance. I respect the \nindependence of the Federal Reserve Board, and I particularly respect \nthe judgement and ability of its Chairman, Alan Greenspan.\n  Our country has experienced an unprecedented period of economic \ngrowth and stability. Congress took the politically difficult step of \nputting our financial house in order by enacting the 1994 budget \nreconciliation legislation. But the steady hand of the Federal Reserve \nBoard and its Open Market Committee has helped that seed grow. With the \nable leadership of Alan Greenspan, the Fed has helped guide our country \nfrom the brink of recession to an unprecedented period of economic \ngrowth.\n  But even the Fed is looking at the current economic conditions and \nre-evaluating its interest rate policies. We have a problem with \nliquidity of capital in this country, which makes it harder for other \ncountries to stabilize their currencies. As they try to acquire \ndollars, two things happen.\n  First, our foreign trading partners find it increasing more difficult \nto purchase American goods. Just ask any farmer in Montana whether this \nhas negative economic consequences for our country and you will get an \nearful. If farmers can't sell their products in the export market, they \ncannot survive economically. Communities that are economically \ndependent upon farmers find themselves in their own downward spiral, as \nbusinesses who rely on farmers to buy their goods are also squeezed \neconomically. This same pattern can be repeated in other communities \naround the country, whether their economic health is tied into farm \nexports or any other kind of exports.\n  The second consequence of tight capital is that it can lead to what \nis known as deflation. It has been a long time since we have had to \nworry about a deflationary spiral in this country, but it certainly \nseems to me that this\n\n[[Page S10938]]\n\ntime has regretfully arrived. Our foreign trading partners need dollars \ndesperately because of the devaluation of their own currencies, so they \ntry harder to sell their goods to American consumers. The lower price \nof these goods drives down the price of domestically produced goods \ntoo. American companies cut production, which forces them to also cut \nemployment. As unemployment begins to edge up, consumer confidence and \npurchasing drops, which causes further drops in price.\n  So whether we can't sell our products abroad, or too many lower-\npriced foreign goods are being sold here, the result is the same--a \ndeterioration of our own domestic economy.\n  I believe the signs all point to an inevitable lowering of interest \nrates by the Fed. Whether it is done at this next meeting or at some \nfuture one, I cannot see another alternative. So while this is a hard \nvote for me, because of my natural inclination to defer to Mr. \nGreenspan and the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee, I \ntruly believe it is the right answer not only for our domestic economy \nbut for our global economy as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10937-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Consumer \nBankruptcy Act of 1998, but I did so with some reservations. I commend \nthe efforts of the members of the Judiciary Committee, especially \nSenators Durbin and Grassley and Senators Hatch and Leahy in taking on \nthe challenge of reforming this important and highly complex area of \nour laws. They have made an important effort to bring about some badly \nneeded reforms and hopefully reduce the number of bankruptcies in our \ncountry.\n  As many of you know, the most recent statistics from the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts state that more than 1.4 \nmillion people filed for bankruptcy during the 12-month period ending \nJune 30, 1998, an all-time high. This represents an 8.5% increase from \nthe same period last year. Statistics also show that there has been a \n400 percent increase in personal bankruptcies since 1980. Clearly we \nneed to reform our bankruptcy laws.\n  This bill will provide enhanced procedural protections for consumers, \nand enhanced penalties for creditors who fail to obey the requirements \nof the bankruptcy code. It also will crack down on abusive and repeat \nChapter 13 filings, discourage predatory home lending practices, and \nprovide for the appointment of new bankruptcy judges.\n  Perhaps most importantly, this bill, as opposed to prior versions, \nprovides stronger safeguards for children and families involved in \nbankruptcy proceedings. Several months ago, I and 30 of my colleagues \nwrote to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee about the \nneed for this legislation to include stronger safeguards for the \nchildren of people involved in bankruptcy proceedings. In simple terms, \nwe voiced our concern that children should come before creditors, which \nessentially has been the law for the last 95 years. Under current law, \noutstanding spouse and child support, in addition to back taxes and \neducational loans, are debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy \nlike other debts. This sound policy is premised on the belief that our \nlaws should minimize the risk of impoverishment of our children and \nfamilies.\n  In response to that letter, and my conversation with the Committee \nChairman, the Committee Chairman acknowledged the potential adverse \nconsequences the legislation could have upon child support recipients, \nand he offered an amendment at the full committee mark-up which \naddressed these problems. The amendment, which passed by a unanimous \nvote, would raise the legal priority of child support from number 7 to \nnumber 1; permit the conditioning of a Chapter 13 confirmation upon the \npayment of child support payments; allow the conditioning of a Chapter \n13 discharge upon the payment of all post-petition child support \nobligations; and add other provisions that should help children and \nfamilies collect child support debts.\n  I offered and had accepted 3 amendments on the Floor that, in my \nview, further strengthen this bill. The first amendment would: (1) \nprotect income from sources legitimately dedicated to the welfare of \nchildren from being dissipated and misdirected to pay debts and \nexpenses unrelated to the care and maintenance of these same children. \nChild support payments, foster care payments, or disability payments \nfor a dependent child should go to that child and not to a creditor; \nand (2) ensure that in bankruptcy, children and families are able to \nkeep certain household goods which typically have no resale value. I am \nspeaking about items such as toys, swings sets, video cassette \nrecorders or other items used to help them raise their children.\n  The second amendment would protect duly established college savings \naccounts which were set up for the benefit of children from being \ndistributed to creditors. Just because a child's family has gone \nthrough a bankruptcy does not mean a child should not be able to go to \ncollege.\n  Lastly, the third amendment, which I co-authored with Senators \nSarbanes and Durbin, contains an important new consumer protection \nregarding credit card debt. Today, many consumers are unaware of the \nimplications of carrying credit card debt and making only the minimum \nmonthly payment on that debt. For instance, assume a consumer has $3000 \nin credit card debt. Then assume the interest rate that the consumer is \npaying on that debt is 17\\1/2\\%, which is roughly the industry average. \nIf the consumer makes only the monthly minimum payment on that debt, it \nwill take 396 months or 33 years to pay it off. And with interest, the \nconsumer will have paid a total of 9,658 dollars. This amendment, which \nI worked on with Senators Sarbanes, Durbin, Grassley and Hatch will \nrequire credit card issuers to inform consumers on their monthly \nbilling statement not only how long it will take them to pay off a debt \nat the minimum monthly rate, but also how much money they will have \npaid in interest and principal on that debt.\n  I thank Senators Grassley and Durbin and Senators Hatch and Leahy who \nhave worked with me to assure that these protections for children, \nfamilies and consumers were included in the bill.\n  I am disappointed that my amendment regarding the extension of credit \nto young people under the age of 21 was tabled. This amendment was \ndesigned to curtail the most aggressive and abusive credit card \nmarketing to people under the age of 21 by requiring that the credit \ncard issuer obtain an application that either contained the signature \nof a parent or guardian willing to take financial responsibility for \nthe debt, or information indicating an independent means of repaying \nany credit extended. Most responsible credit card issuers already \nobtain this information from their applicants. This amendment would \nhave merely required that the less responsible credit card issuers \nfollow the ``best practices'' already in place for much of the \nindustry.\n  I am, at the same time, concerned that this legislation will force \nmore debtors into Chapter 13 bankruptcy while eliminating several of \nthe provisions that enabled debtors to meet the terms of their Chapter \n13 payment plan considering the fact that two-thirds of the repayment \nplans under current law are not completed, this calls into question \nwhether Chapter 13 really results in the repayment of debts, as \nadvertised.\n  Moreover, I'm concerned, not withstanding strong objections by the \nNational Partnership for Women and Families, more than 20 women's \ngroups, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights and a variety of \nother organizations, that new provisions regarding the non-\ndischargeability of certain types of unsecured debt remain in the bill. \nThese groups expressed their concern that these provisions will impede \nthe ability of debtors to pay both for their post-bankruptcy expenses \nand to care for their dependents. I hope the Conference looks into \nthese issues more carefully so that we can truly accomplish balanced \nand effective bankruptcy reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10938-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10938-S10939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST-BAN TREATY: TWO YEARS AND COUNTING\n\nMr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today is the second anniversary of \nthe signing of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. It is also \nnearly a year since\n\n[[Page S10939]]\n\nthe President submitted that treaty to the Senate for its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n  Much has happened since then. For example, Congress funded the \nDepartment of Energy's Stockpile Stewardship program to ensure that \nU.S. nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable in the absence of nuclear \ntesting.\n  We are building new state-of-the-art facilities that will enable \nscientists to replicate processes that occur in nuclear explosions. We \nare developing new computers to permit the complex modeling that is \nnecessary to understand nuclear explosions and to test new component \nmaterials or designs. We are conducting sub-critical experiments that \nare permitted under the Test-Ban Treaty.\n  We are also inspecting annually each type of nuclear weapon in our \narsenal, so that problems associated with the aging of those weapons \ncan be identified and corrected without a need for nuclear weapons \ntests. These inspections and corrective actions enable our nuclear \nweapons establishment to certify on an annual basis that there are no \nproblems that require renewed nuclear testing.\n  In short, then, the United States is showing the world that it is, \nindeed, possible to maintain nuclear deterrence under a test-ban \nregime.\n  We are also showing the world that it is possible to verify \ncompliance with the Test-Ban Treaty. Verification is never perfect, but \nthe nascent International Monitoring System has functioned well enough \nto severely limit what a nuclear power can learn from undetected \ntesting.\n  Last May, India and Pakistan conducted nuclear weapons tests. Critics \nof the Test-Ban Treaty note that the International Monitoring System--\nsome of which is already in place--did not predict those tests. Of \ncourse, the verification system was never intended to predict nuclear \nweapons tests, only to detect them and to identify the country \nresponsible.\n  The International Monitoring System and other cooperating seismic \nstations did a fine job, in fact, of locating the Indian and Pakistani \ntests and estimating their yield. By comparing this year's data to \nthose from India's 1974 nuclear test and from earthquakes in the \nregion, seismologists have shown that this year's tests were probably \nmuch smaller--and less significant in military terms--than India and \nPakistan claimed.\n  Most recently, the Senate voted to fund continued development of the \nInternational Monitoring System. The national interest requires that we \nlearn all we can on possible nuclear weapons tests. I am confident that \nthe Senate made the right choice in voting to restore these funds.\n  When it comes to the Test-Ban Treaty itself, however, the Senate has \nyet to speak. The Committee on Foreign Relations has yet to hold a \nhearing, let alone vote on a resolution of ratification.\n  In the great Sherlock Holmes mystery ``The Hound of the \nBaskervilles'' the crucial clue was the dog that did not bark. On this \ntreaty, the Senate has been such a hound.\n  Now, why won't this dog bark? I think it's because the Senators who \nkeep this body from acting on the Test-Ban Treaty know that it would \npass. A good three-quarters of the American people support this treaty. \nIn fact, support for the treaty has increased since the Indian and \nPakistani nuclear tests, despite disparaging comments by some treaty \nopponents.\n  Worse yet, as far as some treaty opponents are concerned, India and \nPakistan are talking about signing the Test-Ban Treaty. That would chip \naway mightily at the claim that this treaty will never enter into \nforce, even if we ratify it. The fact is that with U.S. leadership, we \ncan get the world to sign up to a ban on nuclear explosions. I am \nconfident that we will do precisely that.\n  Treaty opponents have it within their power to stifle America's role \nin the world and diminish our ability to lead. They also have it within \ntheir power, however, to help foster continued American leadership in \nthe coming year and the coming century. I believe that, in the end, \ntheir better instincts--and a sober recognition of where the American \npeople stand--will prevail.\n  The Senate will give its advice and consent to ratification of this \ntreaty--not this year, but next year. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-\nBan may be two years old today, but it is also the wave of the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10938-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10939-S10940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CTBT ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today marks the two-year \nanniversary of the opening for signature of the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. On September 24, 1996, President Clinton was the first to the \nsign the CTBT at the United Nations in New York. A total of 150 nations \nhave not signed the treaty, including all five declared nuclear weapons \nstates, and 21 nations have ratified the CTBT.\n  This week also marks one year since the President transmitted the \nCTBT to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification. \nUnfortunately, one year later the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nhas yet to hold its first hearing on this historic treaty.\n  Mr. President, this delay in considering the Treaty not only hinders \nthe Senate from carrying out its constitutional duties; in light of the \nevents in India and Pakistan, it is irresponsible for the Senate to \ncontinue to do nothing. It is irresponsible for the security of this \nnation and the world.\n  The Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests in May served as a wake up \ncall for the world. We are confronted with the very risk of a nuclear \narms race beginning in South Asia. India and Pakistan, as well as their \nneighbors, have emerged less secure as a result of these tests. I \nbelieve that these tests demonstrate the tragic significance of the \nSenate's failure to take action on the CTBT. We can no longer afford to \nignore our responsibility to debate and vote on the treaty.\n  Today's press reports that both India and Pakistan have stated their \nintention to sign the CTBT by September 1999. I want to welcome these \nannouncements by India and Pakistan. The steps are in part the result \nof an intensive U.S. diplomatic effort, and I congratulate the \nAdministration on this success. India's and Pakistan's commitment to \nhalt nuclear testing is critical to reducing tensions and preventing a \nnuclear arms race in South Asia.\n  The adherence of India and Pakistan to the CTBT will also enhance \nprospects for the treaty to enter into force sooner. According to its \nprovisions the CTBT will enter into force when 44 countries have \nnuclear technology have ratified it. With India's and Pakistan's \nsignatures, all 44 of these countries except one, North Korea, will \nhave signed the CTBT. The addition of India and Pakistan as Treaty \nsignatories marks a significant step toward making the CTBT a reality.\n  Now more than ever, it is imperative that the Senate begin its \nconsideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Senate action on \nthe CTBT would send a clear signal to India and Pakistan that nuclear \ntesting must stop. It would strengthen U.S. diplomatic efforts to \nreduce tensions between these two countries and persuade them to give \nup their nuclear ambitions. But signature of the CTBT by India and \nPakistan is only the first step in the process of bringing stability to \nSouth Asia. Senate action on the CTBT can help build momentum as \nadditional measures are sought for defusing the violative situation.\n  Ratification of the CTBT is also critical to U.S. leadership in \nstrengthening the international nonproliferation regime. The risk of \nnuclear proliferation remains a clear and immediate security threat to \nthe international community as a whole.\n  Our efforts to reduce the threat of nuclear proliferation have \nproduced significant successes this decade. Several countries, \nincluding South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina have abandoned nuclear \nweapons programs. Under the START Treaty nuclear weapons have been \nwithdrawn from Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.\n  The United States must continue to lead international efforts to halt \nand reverse the spread of nuclear weapons. For the United States to be \neffective in strengthening international nonproliferation measures, we \nneed to demonstrate our own commitment to a universal legal norm \nagainst nuclear testing.\n  U.S. ratification of the CTBT is in our national security interest. \nThe United States has observed a testing\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\nmoratorium since 1992. The other declared nuclear weapons states, \nBritain, France, Russia, and China, have joined us in halting their \nnuclear testing programs. It is in our interest for these countries to \ncontinue to refrain from such testing, which might otherwise contribute \nto their designing more advanced weapons that are smaller and more \nthreatening.\n  The treaty would not prevent the United States from doing anything we \notherwise would plan to do, There is no need for renewed U.S. nuclear \ntesting. Nuclear weapons experts from my home State of New Mexico tell \nme that they have a high level of confidence in the reliability and \nsafety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile.\n  We are committed through the Stockpile Stewardship Program to \nensuring the future safety and reliability of our stockpile in the \nabsence of nuclear testing. Our strong support for this program in the \nyears ahead is critical for U.S. national security under a \ncomprehensive test-ban regime.\n  Mr. President, the American people recognize the grave danger that a \nnew nuclear arms race in South Asia would pose, not only to U.S. \nnational security but also to the security of the international \ncommunity. They understand that further nuclear testing threatens to \nundermine international efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. That's why a recent nationwide poll conducted by the Mellman \nGroup found that 73 percent of the American public believe that the \nSenate should approve the CTBT, while only 16 percent believe we should \ndisapprove the treaty (11 percent responded ``don't know''). This \nfinding of overwhelming support for the treaty occurred after India \nconducted is nuclear tests.\n  Therefore, I urge the Senate to begin debate on the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty. I have sent a letter to the Chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee requesting that the Committee begin holding hearings \non this historic treaty. We need to bring in the experts from the \nmilitary, intelligence, and scientific communities so we can hear what \nthey have to say. I believe that through such hearings Senators' \nconcerns will be resolved in favor of a CTBT.\n  For the sake of our security and that of future generations, we must \nnot let this historic opportunity to achieve a global end to nuclear \ntesting slipaway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10939-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10940-S10941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNITION OF HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN GEORGIA\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as designated by the Senate, \nSeptember 14-20, 1998, is celebrated as National Historically Black \nColleges and Universities Week. I am pleased to take this opportunity \nto recognize the achievements of these fine institutions of higher \neducation and to pay a special tribute to the ten Historically Black \nColleges and Universities located in my home State of Georgia. The 104 \nhistorically black institutions of higher learning throughout the \nUnited States are cornerstones of African-American education and play \nan integral role in the lives of African-Americans and in American \nhistory.\n  Historically Black Colleges and Universities have set a high standard \nfor providing quality instruction and valuable, lifelong experiences to \nstudents. Though sometimes faced with adversity, historically black \ncolleges and institutions have provided students with the opportunity \nto broaden their horizons and to reach their fullest potential.\n  As I have mentioned, my state of Georgia has the privilege of being \nserved by ten of these fine institutions: Albany State University, \nClark Atlanta State University, Fort Valley State University, \nInterdenominational Theological Center, Morehouse College, The \nMorehouse School of Medicine, Morris Brown College, Paine College, \nSavannah State University, and Spelman College.\n  Albany State University, the previous Albany Bible and Manual \nTraining Institute, Georgia Normal and Agricultural College and Albany \nState College, was ranked by U.S. News and World Report among the top \ncolleges and universities in the South in September 1997. In a recent \nspecial report to Black Issues In Higher Education Magazine (July 9, \n1998), ASU was ranked among the top 100 producers of degrees for \nAfrican Americans in three key areas--education, health professions, \nand computer information Science.\n  Clark Atlanta State University is a comprehensive, private, urban, \ncoeducational institution of higher education with a predominantly \nAfrican American heritage. It offers undergraduate, graduate, and \nprofessional degrees as well as non-degree programs to students of \ndiverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. U.S. News and \nWorld report lists Clark Atlanta among the best universities in the \nUnited States in its 1996 ``America's Best Colleges'' guide.\n  Fort Valley State University, founded in 1890, is a public, state and \nland-grant co-educational liberal arts institution located in central \nGeorgia's Peach County. The Georgia Board of Regents designated Fort \nValley State as a fully accredited University on June 12, 1996, \ncontinuing in its leadership role as the only senior college or \nuniversity in the University System with a mission in all four \ndisciplines--academics, research, extension and service.\n  Interdenominational Theological Center, established in 1958, \nmaintains its position as the nucleus of theological education for \nAfrican Americans in the world. Six historic African American \nseminaries comprise ITC. They are: Gammon Theological Seminary (United \nMethodist), Charles H. Mason Theological Seminary (Church of God in \nChrist), Morehouse School of Religion (Baptist), Phillips School of \nTheology (Christian Methodist Episcopal), Johnson C. Smith Theological \nSeminary (Presbyterian Church USA) and Turner Theological Seminary \n(African Methodist Episcopal).\n  Morehouse College, founded in 1867 as the Augusta Institute, is a \nsmall, liberal arts college with an international reputation for \nproducing leaders who have influenced national and world history. The \ninstitution is best known for the work of graduates such as Nobel Peace \nPrize laureate Martin Luther King Jr., former Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services Louis Sullivan, MacArthur Fellow Donald Hopkins, \nOlympian Edwin Moses, filmmaker Spike Lee, and a number of Congressmen, \nfederal judges, and college presidents. These alumni, and a long list \nof other Morehouse men from one generation to the next, have translated \nthe College's commitment to excellence in scholarship, leadership, and \nservice into extraordinary contributions to their professions, their \ncommunities, the nation, and the world.\n  The Morehouse School of Medicine became independent of Morehouse \nCollege in 1981. The Morehouse School of Medicine is a predominantly \nblack institution established to recruit and train minority and other \nstudents as physicians and biomedical scientists committed to the \nprimary health care needs of the underserved and is fully accredited by \nthe Liaison Committee on Medical Education and the Southern Association \nof Colleges and Schools.\n  Morris Brown College, founded in 1867, is a private, coeducational \nliberal arts college engaged in teaching and research in the arts, \nhumanities, education, social and natural sciences. The College is \ncommitted to developing, through strong academic, continuing education \nand cultural enrichment programs, the skills needed to function as a \nliterate citizen in society for persons of all socio-economic status.\n  Paine College, founded in 1880, has a history tied to the history of \nthe Christian Methodist Episcopal Church and the United Methodist \nChurch. The College was founded to establish an educational institute \nto train Black ministers and teachers. Throughout its history, Paine \nhas been a distinctively Christian college. It has maintained deep \nconcern for the quest for truth and has been resolute in blending \nknowledge with values and personal commitment. Paine has been \nhistorically dedicated to the preparation of holistic persons for \nresponsible life in society.\n  Savannah State University, founded in 1890, is the oldest public \nhistorically black college in the state of Georgia. SSU offers 26 \nundergraduate and graduate degrees in three schools--the College of \nBusiness Administration, the College of Liberal Arts and Social\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\nSciences and the College of Sciences and Technology. Special programs \nat SSU include the Marine Sciences program and the Naval Reserve \nOfficers Training Corps.\n  Spelman College was founded in 1881 as the Atlanta Baptist Female \nSeminary to increase educational opportunities for Black women in \nAtlanta. Spelman's mission is to help students to think objectively, \ncritically and creatively within a moral framework and to use their \ntalents to solve problems that are ever present in a rapidly changing \nand complex environment.\n  The extraordinary contributions of historically black colleges and \nuniversities in educating students and in enriching our communities \ncannot be overstated. They are a valuable national resource which are \nbeing rightly honored for their exemplary tradition in higher \neducation. Mr. President, please join me and our colleagues in \ncongratulating and celebrating a rich legacy and tradition of the \nexcellence, determination, strength, and perseverance of historically \nblack colleges and universities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10940-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      25TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG RECOVERY CENTERS, INC.\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAlcohol and Drug Recovery Centers, Inc. of Hartford, Connecticut, on \nits 25th Anniversary. ADRC provides much-needed services to the \nresidents of 29 Greater Hartford communities: helping men and women \nfirst confront then overcome their addictions so they may live \nproductive, substance free lives.\n  For a quarter of a century, the dedicated workers of ADRC have lent a \nhelpful hand to their neighbors, regardless of race, sex, sexual \norientation, disability, or economic circumstances. Their work has had \na tangible impact on the community and I am proud to honor ADRC for its \nwork on behalf of Hartford-area families.\n  This dynamic and proactive organization has continually blazed a \ntrail for other community groups to follow.

Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Amy Rosen's \nnomination to the Amtrak Reform Board of Directors. Ms. Rosen has the \nright blend of business and financial knowledge, talent and creativity \nneeded to lead Amtrak into the next century.\n  Mr. President, the next few years will be crucial for Amtrak. To \nincrease ridership, modernize and cut costs while reducing its \ndependence on federal assistance, Amtrak needs Board members with \ndemonstrated business and financial skills. I believe Amy Rosen is \neminently qualified to serve on Amtrak's Board and can make that kind \nof contribution at this critical juncture in Amtrak's history. She has \nbusiness acumen derived from extensive professional experience in the \nprivate sector, along with her work in the public sector.\n  Currently, Ms. Rosen is Managing Partner of Public Private \nInitiatives, a financial services and consulting firm that employs \ninnovative financing techniques to benefit public sector, non-profit \nand private sector clients. At PPI, she is directly involved in \napplying creative financial tools, such as tax-advantaged leasing and \nasset securitization to enhance government services.\n  For example, under Ms. Rosen's tenure, New Jersey Transit has \nleverage-leased $1.8 billion worth of equipment and facilities, for a \nnet benefit of $100 million to New Jersey Transit and its ridership. \nPrior to starting Public Private Initiatives, Ms. Rosen was Senior Vice \nPresident of Marketing and Managing Director of Lockheed-Martin IMS, \nwhere she was responsible for the oversight of all domestic and \ninternational marketing initiatives, and state and federal relations. \nShe also was very involved in the Lockheed merger with Martin Marietta. \nThroughout her tenure, she worked to re-shape the corporation's \nmarketing and acquisition needs in the midst of defense budget cuts. \nThese positions required the kind of skills and expertise that can help \nAmtrak deal effectively with the challenges it faces today.\n  Ms. Rosen also has relevant and extremely valuable experience in the \npublic sector. She served as Deputy Commissioner for the New Jersey \nDepartment of Transportation under Governor Byrne and currently serves \nas Vice Chair of the New Jersey Transit Board of Directors. As a result \nof her service in these posts, she has hands-on experience in state \ngovernment and will be able to build strong relationships between \nAmtrak and the states it serves.\n  Mr. President, while professional experience and particular skills \nare important for effective service, Ms. Rosen also has the kinds of \npersonal strengths and attributes that the Senate looks for in nominees \nto high posts. She is bright, energetic, extremely hard working and \ncommitted to the goals and mission the Congress has set out for Amtrak. \nI can also personally attest to her integrity and ability to work well \nwithin a group.\n  Mr. President, I strongly support Ms. Rosen's appointment and I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10941-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I will have a few additional remarks \ntomorrow. I made a speech one night and read it, and going home that \nevening Mrs. Ford said, ``Did you ever think about just speaking from \nnotes and off the cuff? It seems more sincere.'' So the next time we \nwent out, I made this speech from just three or four notes, and I \nthought I did very well. We were going home, and I said, ``Well, how \ndid I do tonight?'' There was a hesitation, and she said, ``I believe \nI'd go back to reading.'' And so I will be off the cuff tomorrow, with \nprobably some prepared remarks. As you all know, this is probably the \nlast piece of aviation legislation I will have any input into as a \nSenator.\n  I appreciate all the cooperation and good humor that has been \ndisplayed as we have moved along the way. I have been impressed by the \nstaff that Senator McCain has assembled to assist him. I have been \namazed at the staff that we have, and how they work together and \nultimately get it done. One of the things we worried about was having \nall the amendments maybe worked out before we got on the floor. And \nthat came close.\n  But I remember something that Senator Robert Byrd told me a long time \nago: If you cannot get an agreement, start, and it will create a \nvacuum. So I think that is exactly what has occurred here, along with \nthe hard work on both sides of the aisle. It has been a good ride, and \nI look forward to the vote in the morning at 9:50, and then I will make \nsome comments after that.\n  I am grateful to my colleague for his patience with me. We look \nforward to several more weeks of working together and accomplishing \nmany things that he and I want to do. We are going to try. Whether we \naccomplish those things or not, only time will tell. But if there is \nanything in trying to get it done, Senator McCain and I will accomplish \nour end purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will have some more remarks tomorrow about my dear \nfriend from Kentucky, because I would like to have more of my \ncolleagues hear them. But hearing him speak in his own unique and \nfrankly straightforward and candid fashion reminds me of all the years \nnow, 12, that he and I have been working together. Perhaps that is not \na long time in some areas of life, but it certainly is a long time when \nyou consider the long, long list of issues concerning aviation that he \nand I have addressed together and the fact that I freely acknowledge, \nwith great pride, that he has taught me an enormous amount, not only \nabout aviation issues but how to achieve legislative results.\n  I will have more to say about that tomorrow. But as it is kind of \nquiet here in the Senate tonight, it makes one a bit nostalgic at this \nlate hour.\n  Mr. FORD. Maybe it is the best time to say it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I will stop before becoming maudlin.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/24/senate-section/article/S10942-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
