My own wisdom and that of all about me \nseemed insufficient for the day.'' When asked whether the Lord was on \nhis side, he responded, ``I am not at all concerned about that, for I \nknow that the Lord is always on the side of the right. But it is my \nconstant anxiety and prayer that I--and this nation--should be on the \nLord's side.''\n  Let us pray. Holy, righteous God, so often we sense that same longing \nto be in profound communion with You because we need vision, wisdom, \nand courage no one else can provide. We long for our prayers to be an \naffirmation that we want to be on Your side rather than an appeal for \nYou to join our cause. Forgive us when we act like we have a corner on \ntruth and our prayers reach no further than the ceiling. In humility, \nwe spread our concerns before You and ask for Your marching orders and \nthe courage to follow the cadence of Your drumbeat. Through Him who \ntaught us to pray, ``Your will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.'' \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S679-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to make some statements dealing \nwith health care. There has been a lot of discussion on health care and \nimproving the quality of health care. Some of our colleagues have \nintroduced legislation dealing with the quality of health care. I think \nthat is important. But I think it is also very important that we \nactually improve quality, not improve the number of regulations.\n  Today, Mr. President, Americans enjoy the highest quality of health \ncare in the world.\n  In 1993, President Clinton proposed a plan that would have devastated \nhealth care quality. It would have limited the amount of health care \nthat Americans could receive by limiting the amount of money, whether \nprivate or public, that could be spent on health care services. It \nwould require that everyone have the same one-size-fits-all package of \nhealth insurance benefits. And it would have enrolled everyone in \nmanaged care plans.\n  Had President Clinton had his way, Americans would now be trapped in \na health care system with the efficiency of the post office and the \ncompassion of the IRS at Pentagon prices. The Republicans led the fight \nagainst President Clinton's health care plan because we believe \nAmericans deserve the best. We believed it then and we believe it \ntoday.\n  Now President Clinton wants to lead an assault on private managed \ncare plans. The man who wanted to put everyone in an HMO now wants the \nGovernment to wage war on HMOs. That is a pretty dramatic change. But \none thing has not changed: President Clinton still wants Government-run \nhealth care. As he said to the Service Employees International Union \nless than 5 months ago regarding his rejected universal health care \nprogram:\n\n       If what I tried before won't work, maybe we can do it \n     another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a time, \n     until we eventually finish this.\n\n  President Clinton is now attempting to impose on you his newest \nattempt at Government-run health care and masking his efforts with the \nname ``quality.''\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\n  Mr. President, Republicans want only the highest quality health care. \nBut I have not seen anything to convince me that bigger Government, \nmore regulations, and expanded bureaucratic control is the means to \nhigher quality.\n  Look at just one example of Government-controlled health care: The \nMedicare system. I am a member of the Finance Committee, the tax-\nwriting committee of the Senate. We have been looking at the IRS and \nits treatment of taxpayers. There are 12,000 pages that deal with tax \npolicy. I might mention, that is about 10 times the size of the Bible \nand, unlike the Bible, has no good news.\n  Well, there are 12,000 pages dealing with tax policies. That is a \nlot. But, Mr. President, do you know how many pages govern Medicare? \nForty-five thousand, about four times as much as we have on tax policy. \nThat comes from Dr. Robert Waller, the Mayo Clinic, Health Care \nLeadership Council. Forty-five thousand pages, yet the system is \narchaic, inefficient, and on the path of bankruptcy despite \nastronomical tax increases.\n  We know many people have believed they were denied coverage that \ntheir plans were supposed to cover. We recognize that some individuals \nfear that their health care plans will not give them access to \nspecialists when they need them. We know that some Americans think \ntheir health care plans care more about cost than they do about \nquality. These are real fears of unacceptable conditions. We must do \nbetter. I think we can do better.\n  But the way to do better is not by politicizing health care quality \nor entrusting Government bureaucrats with policing health insurers. The \nway to do better is to emphasize what makes our system the best in the \nworld--employers who insist their employees have access to the best \nplans, doctors and hospitals who aspire to excellence, and informed \nconsumers who will not settle for anything less than the best. Quality \nhealth care cannot be managed and directed from Washington, DC.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, in the rush to respond to both real and \nperceived problems in managed care, members of both parties have \nintroduced comprehensive proposals which potentially threaten--not \nenhance--the quality of health in our health care system.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask how I can make such a statement. You \nonly have to look back to the end of the 104th Congress to illustrate \nmy point. A majority of Congress supported an effort last year to \nmandate that all insurance plans cover 48-hour maternity stays in \nhospitals. Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle felt that \nit was socially unacceptable to discharge newborns and mothers from the \nhospital after only 24 hours and crafted legislation largely around \nsocial opinion.\n  Many Members felt great about voting for something positive for women \nand children. However, several months following the passage of that \nlegislation an article appeared in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation. And here is what the clinical researchers and physicians \nhad to say about what Congress accomplished.\n\n       While the spirit of the current legislation may be \n     laudable, its content does not solve the most important \n     problems regarding the need for early postpartum/postnatal \n     services.\n       The legislation may give the public a false sense of \n     security. It may call into question the reasonableness of \n     relying on legislative mechanisms to micromanage clinical \n     practice.\n       Good clinical judgment, based on careful consideration of \n     available evidence, suggests that the difference between a \n     postpartum stay of 24 hours and a stay of 48 hours is \n     unlikely to be a critical determinant of newborn or maternal \n     health outcomes.\n\n  In other words, Congress made a nice, laudable attempt. We said we \nare going to mandate 48 hours, but it has had no appreciable \nimprovement on the quality of health care.\n  It appears that our so-called victory in passing 48 hours may have in \nfact done more harm than good in helping women and newborns. This \nexperience, and others like it, should have taught us what not to do. \nSo what should our guiding principles be? I believe that there are \nthree.\n  Whatever the proper role for Government in the health care debate, we \nmust assure that it does not increase health insurance premiums, reduce \nthe number of people who have health insurance coverage, or create \nmassive new bureaucracies that will harm health care quality.\n  Why are these things important? Well, let us take a look at cost. We \nhave a bill pending in Congress--the Patients Access to Responsible \nCare Act--and that is a pretty nice title. It is one of many that \nattempts to address health care by expanding Government control. But a \nrecent study concluded that provisions in that bill alone would raise \npremiums by an average of 23 percent. That was done last year, 1997, by \nMilliman and Roberts.\n  Let us take a look at what that means. To the average family, that is \nan increase of about $1,220 per year. That is over $100 per month. That \nis real money. And I think a lot of families cannot afford that.\n  Cost is a very real issue. We do not want health care costs and \nprices to rise. We already know from the Congressional Budget Office \nthat without any additional regulations at all, the growth in private \nhealth care premiums will be about 5.5 percent in 1998. That is up from \n3.8 percent in 1997. So why in the world would we want to do anything \nthat would accelerate the increase? I do not think we should.\n  No. 2, we do not want to do anything that will drive people from \nhealth insurance.\n  For a long time we have heard people beat up employers for not \noffering health care to their employees. But what are the facts? Well, \nsomeone looked into it and now we know that more employers than ever \nare offering health insurance. The problem is that employees are \nchoosing not to take advantage of it because of cost. That came out \nfrom a study in 1997 by Cooper and Schone.\n\n  A separate study concludes that every 1 percent increase in private \nhealth insurance premiums results in 400,000 additional uninsured \nAmericans. That was from a 1997 Lewin study. So, 400,000 additional \nuninsured Americans every time health insurance premiums increase 1 \npercent in real terms.\n  Now, wait a minute. If the PARCA bill--the Patient Access to \nResponsible Care Act--is estimated to increase costs by 23 percent, and \nevery one of those percentage points equals 400,000 additional \nuninsured Americans, my calculations work that out to over 9 million \nAmericans would lose their health insurance.\n  Mr. President, we do not want to do that. That may not be sound \nscience, but the potential for such an outcome would be a disaster. It \nis too big of a gamble, in my opinion. Higher prices and more uninsured \nAmericans does not sound like better health care quality to me. So let \nus not do that.\n  Thirdly, and finally, we want to make sure that the very best entity \nis monitoring the health care industry. And what are the options?\n  Many in Congress seem to think the answer is Government, so let us \ntalk about Government overseeing health care. I can think of a few \nexamples of the government's bad track record. We have the Indian \nhealth care in New Mexico and Oklahoma. There is an Indian hospital in \nOklahoma right now that provides, I am going to say, pathetic service. \nAnd it happens to be bankrupt. We have had this problem, in addition to \nMedicaid and veterans hospitals and on and on and on. I mention that \nGovernment facilities, 100 percent Government-run facilities, are not \nthe solution. It is probably some of the poorest quality of health \ncare, not the best quality of health care. We want to improve quality, \nnot reduce quality.\n  Some of the Nation's leading health care facilities today are \nexpressing their concerns about Government oversight. I am thinking of \nthe Mayo Clinic, Baylor Health Care System, and the Cleveland Clinic. \nThey are all raising their voices in opposition to more Federal \nregulation of health care quality. I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a few of their comments. I will ask unanimous consent that \ntheir letters be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  Baylor Health Care System--I will just read a couple of the \nparagraphs. It says:\n\n       There has been an enormous commitment on the part of Baylor \n     Health Care System and providers throughout the country to \n     evaluate and put in place the processes for continuous \n     quality improvement. We believe it must be done at this \n     level. Providers of care are in the unique position, based on \n     their personal commitment to the well-being\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\n     of the individual patient, to drive quality improvement \n     initiatives. Nothing could stifle innovation quicker than \n     external mandatory standards.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       We strongly believe that the private sector is heavily \n     committed and working very diligently on continuous quality \n     improvement and that this will bring about the best outcome \n     for the patients and communities we serve.\n\n  The Cleveland Clinic--one paragraph says:\n\n       Second, we are already subject to extensive federal, state \n     and private regulations through oversight by private payors \n     and accrediting bodies. Adding yet another layer of \n     regulation will only further complicate matters, add \n     administrative costs to our organization, and in all \n     likelihood have little or no effect on the actual quality of \n     care provided.\n\n  Dr. Bob Waller of the Mayo Clinic has stated:\n\n       Quality is a continuous process that must be woven into the \n     fabric of how we think, act and feel. Government regulation \n     places a stake in the ground that freezes in place a quality \n     standard that may become obsolete very quickly. The \n     Government simply cannot react quickly to the changing \n     quality environment. The goal of quality is to \n     continuously improve patient care--not to achieve some \n     defined regulatory standard.\n\n  On January 28, several organizations--including the Joint Commission \non Accreditation of Health Care Organizations, the National Committee \nfor Quality Insurance and the American Medical Association--sent a \nletter to the President and Republican leadership stating their concern \nand opposition to the Federal Government preempting the private sector \nand creating new Federal agencies and entities. Specifically, they said \nquality would:\n\n       * * * become hamstrung by political considerations, with \n     the practical effect of retarding innovation and advance in \n     the field of accreditation and performance measurement. In \n     our experience, the private sector is more capable of keeping \n     pace with the rapid changes in health care delivery and \n     medical practice that affect quality of care considerations. \n     Therefore, we cannot support proposals that might have the \n     unintended effect of undermining marketplace incentives for \n     rigorous accreditation programs and robust performance \n     measures.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't think the Government is the best caretaker of \nhealth care quality. I'm much more inclined to trust the independent \norganizations like the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care \nOrganizations and the National Committee for Quality Insurance. Because \nthe Government alternatively leaves oversight to the folks at the \nDepartment of Labor and the Health Care Finance Administration--who, I \nmight mention, took 10 years to implement a 1987 law establishing new \nnursing home standards; who have not bothered to change the fire safety \nstandards for hospitals since 1985; and--in a most egregious instance--\nwho are running end-stage renal disease facilities under Medicare using \n1976 health and safety standards.\n  I think the answer is plain. We will not and we must not create \nmassive new bureaucracies that will harm health care quality.\n  We have a real challenge ahead. We have to figure out how we can best \naddress the very real complaints and concerns of the American people \nwhile not rushing to pass legislation that will exacerbate the problems \nor create new problems altogether.\n  To that end, our majority leader has instructed me to take a hard, \nhonest look at issues that affect health care quality. At his \ninstruction, I have put together a health care quality task force to \nexamine the problems in our current system. Senators Roth, Chafee, \nCoats, Collins, Frist, Santorum, Hagel and myself will be working \ntogether to find real answers to hard questions.\n  I know some of my colleagues have introduced legislation and they \nhave very good intentions. We want to work with those colleagues, but \nagain we want to make sure that we don't pass legislation that \nincreases health care costs, we want to make sure we don't pass \nlegislation that will put millions of people into the uninsured \ncategory for the first time. That would be a real mistake, and we don't \nwant to pass legislation that will increase bureaucracy and reduce \nquality health care.\n  Mr. President, we have a big challenge: We will ask what the real-\nlife impact of proposals like PARCA and President Clinton's Consumer \nBill of Rights has on cost and on coverage. What will it mean to \nquality? We will ask whether Americans, given the choice, would rather \nhave cutting edge institutions like Johns Hopkins setting trends in \nhealth care quality or the folks at the Department of Labor, or the \nHealth Care Finance Administration. We will ask whom Americans should \ntrust to monitor health care quality. Should the Federal Government do \nit or independent organizations who have been studying the issue and \nsetting the pace for many years?\n  It is incumbent upon us as elected leaders to address these questions \nfairly, honestly, openly, and with an eye toward what is best for the \nhealth of a nation and not what is politically expedient.\n  Our objective at the very minimum is to do this: Ensure that Congress \nin its haste to do good does not cause an increase in the cost of \nhealth insurance, that we do not pass legislation that will \nunintentionally force individuals to give up their coverage, and we \nwant to protect consumer quality by ensuring that the best possible \ncaretakers are monitoring the quality of your health care, and not \nbureaucrats at the Department of Labor or at HCFA.\n  Mr. President, I want to make something very clear. This Republican \nCongress will not hijack the quality of our Nation's health care for \npolitical gain. We will, however, thoroughly and thoughtfully debate \nthis issue and ensure that Americans continue to enjoy the highest \nquality health care in the world.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters previously mentioned be printed \nin the Record, in addition to a letter that is signed by the American \nMedical Accreditation Program, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of \nHealth Care Organizations, and the National Committee for Quality \nInsurance.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Medical Accreditation Program,\n                                                 January 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Senate Majority Whip and Assistant Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Whip Nickles: As the nation's leading \n     independent health care accrediting organizations, we are \n     writing to recommend an alternative approach to certain \n     quality oversight provisions contained both in proposals now \n     before Congress and in the preliminary recommendations of the \n     Presidential Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and \n     Quality in the Health Care Industry.\n       First, we would like to commend both this Congress and the \n     Commission for taking up the issue of health care quality and \n     consumer protections. Our health care system continues to \n     undergo dramatic change, and there is a pressing need to \n     answer the public's concerns with better information, \n     improved oversight, and increased choice. Critical to these \n     efforts will be enhanced consumer protections, and all three \n     of our organizations stand ready to work with this Congress \n     and the Administration to see that this happens.\n       Separate from the issue of consumer rights and protections, \n     however, is the attempt by some to preempt private sector \n     accreditation and performance measurement activities with \n     proposals that favor the creation of new federal agencies and \n     entities. Because these proposed federal agencies and \n     entities would be charged with establishing minimum criteria \n     for accreditation and core sets of performance measures, we \n     have a keen interest in their potential outputs. Our basic \n     concern is that this output will become hamstrung by \n     political considerations, with the practical effect of \n     retarding innovation and advances in the field of \n     accreditation and performance measurement. In our experience, \n     the private sector is more capable of keeping pace with the \n     rapid changes in health care delivery and medical practice \n     that affect quality of care considerations. Therefore, we \n     cannot support proposals that might have the unintended \n     effect of undermining marketplace incentives for rigorous \n     accreditation programs and robust performance measures. We \n     believe that the work of accreditors should be highlighted \n     and encouraged.\n       As an alternative to these new federal bureaucracies, we \n     are intent on together developing a comprehensive quality \n     measurement and reporting strategy that engages consumers and \n     private and public sector purchases; minimizes duplication; \n     and maximizes the incentives for organizations and \n     individuals to undergo accreditation and report standardized \n     performance information. Our organizations have recently \n     engaged in some noteworthy collaborative efforts such as the \n     National Patient Safety Foundation; the Joint NCQA-JCAHO Work \n     Session on Protecting Patient Confidentiality in a Managed \n     Care Environment; cross-representation on the AMAP governing \n     body; and coordination among our respective performance \n     measurement councils. We intend to build on these ventures \n     and ones already ongoing with others to keep excellence in \n     patient care our number one priority.\n\n[[Page S682]]\n\n       We believe the federal government should reward high \n     quality health plans and providers. As the largest purchaser \n     of health care services, the federal government must take a \n     leadership role in value-based purchasing. The federal \n     government is already benefiting from closer coordination \n     with private sector accreditation bodies, and the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997 contains provisions for even greater \n     collaboration. However, in addition to using those private \n     sector accreditation and performance measurement tools \n     developed by organizations such as ours, the federal \n     government must progressively adopt the posture of leading \n     private-sector purchasers and insist on high quality care for \n     the 67 million Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and the 9 \n     million federal employees, retirees, and their dependents.\n       We appreciate your consideration, and stand ready to work \n     with this Congress and the Commission to build upon the \n     successes of private sector accreditation without interfering \n     in the operation of a marketplace that has produced programs \n     as rigorous as ours. Please do not hesitate to contact any of \n     our offices.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dennis S. O'Leary, MD,\n       President, Joint Commission on the Accreditation of \n     Healthcare Organizations.\n     Margaret E. O'Kane,\n       President, National Committee for Quality Assurance.\n     Randolph D.

Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: First, let me thank you very much for \n     your leadership and for your commitment to health related \n     issues, specifically the matter of quality health care.\n       There has been an enormous commitment on the part of Baylor \n     Health Care System and providers throughout the country to \n     evaluate and put in place processes for continuous quality \n     improvement. We believe it must be done at this level. \n     Providers of care are in the unique position, based on their \n     personal commitment to the well being of the individual \n     patient, to drive quality improvement initiatives. Nothing \n     could stifle innovation quicker than external mandatory \n     standards.\n       Quality improvement is the key strategic objective for \n     Baylor Health Care System. An example is the creation of our \n     Institute for Quality which is driven by the board of \n     trustees, physicians and senior management and extends \n     throughout our organization. On a community level, we are \n     involved with the Dallas-Ft. Worth Business Group on Health \n     in building quality initiatives.\n       We strongly believe that the private sector is heavily \n     committed and working very diligently on continuous quality \n     improvement and that this will bring about the best outcome \n     for the patients and communities we serve.\n       Again, we appreciate your support and look forward to \n     working with you on this important issue.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Boone Powell, Jr.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Cleveland Clinic Foundation,\n\n                                 Cleveland, OH, February 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, a \n     not-for-profit health care organization devoted to patient \n     care, education and research in care for the ill, has serious \n     reservations about many of the bills now pending in Congress \n     to regulate quality in health care delivery. Our reservations \n     are twofold.\n       First, quality is an elusive matter to quantify. \n     Individual's versions of quality may vary considerably from \n     their perspective of the health care system. A physician's \n     emphasis, for example, is on the content of the care \n     provided; a patient may judge quality more by the process of \n     care delivered. In both instances, the standards are in flux \n     as both the quality and process are constantly changing in \n     response to new learning and new ways of better relating to \n     patients and their families.\n       Second, we are already subject to extensive federal, state \n     and private regulations through oversight by private payors \n     and accrediting bodies. Adding yet another layer of \n     regulation will only further complicate matters, add \n     administrative costs to our organization, and in all \n     likelihood have little or no effect on the actual quality of \n     care provided.\n       We would urge that Congress proceed cautiously as it begins \n     its debate about whether federal authority should be expanded \n     in this important but necessary complex area of patient care.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Floyd D. Loop, M.D.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized to speak up to 45 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I may not use that 45 minutes. I expect \nfive or six Senators to join me and they have given me their \nstatements. If they do not come I will place their statements in the \nRecord.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \nMikulski, and Mr. Kempthorne pertaining to the introduction of S. Res. \n176 are located in today's Record under ``Submission on Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, and especially the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, my lovable colleague from \nRhode Island, Senator John Chafee, that old crusty New Englander, whom \nI greatly admire, for including some very important provisions in S. \n1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997, or \nISTEA II. In my statement today, I will focus on the important \nprovisions in the committee-reported bill that will expedite the \ndelivery of desperately needed transportation projects to the American \npeople--that is, if we ever get the opportunity to debate and amend and \nadopt this important bill.\n  I think most members would agree that addressing environmental issues \nin this body in a strong bipartisan way is--to say the least--\ndifficult. Yet, Senator Chafee has managed to accomplish what few \nSenators have been able to do--craft legislation that enjoys strong \nsupport from Senators on both sides of the aisle that would help put \norder and efficiency in the way transportation projects are reviewed by \nboth state and federal agencies, and as a result, reduce the time it \ntakes to plan a project by as much as three years.\n  The ISTEA bill as reported by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, recognizes that every day counts when planning and \nconstructing a highway or bridge in this country are undertaken. The \nproblem that was addressed in S. 1173 is a serious one. It now takes \nten years to plan, design, and construct a typical transportation \nproject in this country. I am sure that if Senators contacted their own \nstate transportation departments, they would be disturbed to find the \nnumber of transportation projects that are being delayed due to \noverlapping and often redundant regulatory reviews and processes. These \ndelays increase costs and postpone needed safety improvements that \nwould save lives. One of the lives it saves may be yours. Think about \nit. I can tell my colleagues that, in my state of West Virginia, these \nnumerous regulatory reviews have delayed critical improvements to the \ntwo most dangerous segments of roadway in the state.\n  Why does it take so long to plan a project? These delays are \noccurring because the development of a transportation project involves \nmultiple federal and state agencies evaluating the impacts of the \nproject and possible alternatives, as required by the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA). While it would seem that the NEPA \nprocess would establish a uniform set of regulations and procedures for \nthe submission of documents nationwide, this has not been the case.\n  For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Corps of \nEngineers, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and their \ncompanion state agencies each require a separate review and approval \nprocess, forcing separate reviews guided by separate regulations and \nrequiring planners to answer separate requests for information. \nMoreover, each of these agencies issues approvals according to separate \nschedules. The result: the time period\n\n[[Page S683]]\n\nfrom project beginning to completion has grown to at least 10 years in \nmany instances, and that assumes that the project is not controversial \nand that adequate funding is available. If either of these assumptions \nis not the case, the time period may be even longer.\n  The highway bill reported by the Environment & Public Works Committee \neffectively improves the project planning process by establishing a \ncoordinated environmental review procedure within the U.S. Department \nof Transportation. This change would allow all reviews, all analyses, \nand all permits to be performed concurrently and cooperatively within a \nmutually-agreed-upon schedule, by both the federal and state agencies \nwith jurisdiction over the project. Effective environmental \ncoordination, as envisioned under the ISTEA bill, would result in less \nstaff time and less expense for all the agencies and stakeholders in \nthe NEPA process and reduce the time it now takes in reaching a final \ndecision with respect to receiving project approvals and permits.\n  The committee studied a problem, the committee sought a solution, and \nthe committee put that solution in their bill. I understand that \nfurther improvements to those provisions may be offered on the Senate \nfloor, if and when we finally take up and debate S. 1173, the 6-year \nhighway authorization bill. But here is the problem: we are not \nconsidering S. 1173. We are not considering the 6-year highway \nauthorization bill. When will the bill be brought up? How long, Mr. \nPresident, must we wait? Every day counts when planning and \nconstructing a transportation project. But soon, there will be no more \ndays to count because the program--the short-term, 6-month highway \nauthorization measure--will have expired and the funds will have dried \nup. Counting today--counting today--there are only 42 session days \nremaining through May 1.\n  So, we count today, and we count the day of May 1. And counting these \n2 days, there are only 42 session days remaining. The time bomb is \nticking. You can hear it tick. And with every tick a minute, an hour, a \nday will be gone. The time bomb is ticking--tick, tick, tick, tick. No \nprojects will be delivered under any review process after May 1, \nbecause that is the drop-dead date in the short-term extension \nlegislation presently in place, beyond which no State may obligate any \nFederal dollars.\n  Let's pause to read the language that is in the law--the law which \nCongress passed last November and which was signed by President Clinton \non December 1 of last year. Read the language in the law. Read the \nlanguage, I say to the Governors and the mayors and the highway \nagencies and to Senate and House Members. Read it. Here it is. I now \nread from Public Law 105-130: The Surface Transportation Extension Act \nof 1997. Here it is. Read it. Hear me as it is:\n  `` . . . a State shall not--\n  It doesn't say ``may not.''\n  `` . . . a State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal-aid \nhighway program project after May 1, 1998 . . . .''\n  Let me read it again. This is the language in the law which the \nSenate and House passed and which the President signed. Here is the \nlanguage:\n  `` . . . a State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal-aid \nhighway program project after May 1, 1998 . . . .''\n  As I say, counting today, and May 1, also, we have only 42 days in \nwhich the Senate will be in session, not counting Sundays, not counting \nSaturdays, not counting holidays. We have 42 session days. The time \nbomb is ticking.\n  The clock is ticking. The days are counting down now before this \ndeadline. If an ISTEA reauthorization bill is not enacted by midnight \non May 1, highway program obligations will cease and projects will not \nmove forward.\n  Any delay in the planning and construction phases of a project may \ncause the price of the project to rise considerably. In addition, a \ndelay in federal funding can cause a logjam of projects to be let for \nbidding, resulting in a ``crowding'' of a large number of proposed \nprojects into the latter part of a construction season.\n  The construction seasons are soon going to be upon us, when\n\n       The lark's on the wing;\n       The snail's on the thorn;\n       God's in his heaven--\n       All's right with the world.\n\n  Spring will be here. But will a 6-year highway authorization bill \nhave been passed?\n  This increased workload may strain the capacity of the construction \nindustry and subsequently increase the cost of projects.\n  Stopping the Federal-aid highway program, even for a brief period, \nwill also impact project delivery schedules in the long run. If \npreliminary engineering and design work is not allowed to proceed, then \nconstruction will not occur and, in fact, will be deferred into a \nsecond construction season, thus crowding out and delaying projects \nthat were planned for the second year. Such a delay would have a ripple \neffect--a ripple effect--from which it may take years for states to \nfully recover. Remember, we are talking about critical transportation \nprojects designed to improve highway safety, reduce traffic congestion, \nand clean our air.\n  We hear much about global warming--much about global warming. This is \nthe place to start. Pass a highway bill. Cut down on the traffic \ncongestion, the traffic jams, and the long lines of cars. Cut down on \nthe pollution that is filling the air while those cars sit and idle and \nthe time bomb ticks away.\n  The programmatic reforms in the committee-reported bill that I have \ndiscussed here are very important. They will save time, they will save \nmoney, and they will save lives. Yet, because we have not begun \nconsideration of the bill in this session, not one of these gains has \nbecome a reality. The single most important factor that will determine \nthe timeliness of project delivery in 1998 will be the timely \nreauthorization of ISTEA --the 6-year highway reauthorization bill.\n\n  So the time bomb is out there. It is in that language that I read a \nmoment ago from the law. The American people cannot afford to wait even \n1 day past May 1 for the United States Congress to reauthorize ISTEA. \nThe U.S. Senate has the time now to consider ISTEA, and that is what we \nshould do.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 43 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Let me close for now with a passage from the Book of Isaiah, 58th \nchapter and the 12th verse. And I read only from the King James version \nof the Bible. In all probability, that is the version that our \nforefathers brought over on the Mayflower--the King James version. Read \nthese other versions, and they will say, ``In my father's House are \nmany dwelling places.'' But the King James version says ``In my \nfather's House are many mansions.'' Ah, how much more beautiful is that \nelegant language!\n  I read now from the King James version of the Bible, 58th chapter and \nthe 12th verse.\n\n     And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste \n           places:\n     thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations;\n     and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach,\n     The restorer of paths to dwell in.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge the majority leader to be the ``Repairer of the \nBreach'' by calling up ISTEA now, so that we may be one step closer \ntowards enacting the provisions called for in S. 1173 that would help \naccelerate the delivery of vitally-important transportation projects to \nthe American people.\n  Let me say again as I have said here before, I have been majority \nleader. I was majority leader during the years 1977, 1978, 1979, and \n1980, and I was again the majority leader during the 100th Congress in \n1987-1988. I know the pressures that are on any majority leader. I have \nfelt them. I have walked in those same footprints that other majority \nleaders have tread on the sands of time. I know that it is very \ndifficult, and many times impossible, to adhere to the wishes, to the \npleas of those who implore, those who beseech, those who importune the \nmajority leader to do this, to do that, to do something else. The \nmajority leader cannot please everybody.\n  This is not a partisan bill. This is a nonpartisan bill. There is no \npartisanship in this bill. There is no partisanship in the amendment \nthat I have offered with Senator Gramm, Senator Baucus, and Senator \nWarner as the\n\n[[Page S684]]\n\nchief cosponsors. There are 54 Members of the Senate who are \ncosponsoring the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, and they are from \nboth sides of the aisle. They are Republicans and Democrats, about \nevenly divided, I would say, among those names that are on that \namendment.\n  There is no partisanship here. There is no partisanship in my urging \nthe majority leader to call up ISTEA--no partisanship. I know he is \nunder great pressure from some of the Senators on the Budget Committee, \nincluding, I am sure, the distinguished chairman, Mr. Domenici, a man \nwho has one of the finest brains in this Senate. He does not want the \nISTEA bill brought up, he and Mr. Chafee. Mr. Chafee has said so. So I \nam not saying anything behind their backs that I would not say \nanywhere. They prefer to wait until the budget resolution is called up.\n  Mr. President, the country needs a 6-year highway authorization bill, \nand the time is ticking. Failure to call it up will only undermine the \nvery necessary progress that this bill is designed to make.\n  I believe that if the majority leader were left to his own pursuits--\nhe has not told me this--he would call this bill up. But my good \nfriend, Senator Domenici, is a very powerful Senator. He was here a \nmoment ago. He will be back later today. And I am not saying anything \nto make him feel that I am taking any advantage of him. But if he would \njust leave it to the majority leader, I think we would get this bill \nup. That is my own opinion.\n  Mr. President, failure to take up the bill, as I say, will undermine \nthe very necessary progress that that bill is trying to make, and it \ndeprives me and other Senators from calling up amendments to that bill. \nOur transportation system, our people's safety, and the country's \neconomy all await action by the Congress on the 6-year highway \nauthorization bill. What are we waiting for? How long, Mr. President, \nhow long will we have to wait? How long?\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 35 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. How many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-five minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I reserve that time until later in the \nday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to be allowed \nto speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S682-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S684-S685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE LINCOLN LEGACY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 189th anniversary of \nhis birth, to pay tribute to an American of commonsense ways and \nuncommon character.\n  Let me read to you from the autobiography of Abraham Lincoln, which \nhe penned in December of 1859.\n\n       I was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. \n     My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished \n     families. . .\n       There was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for \n     education. Of course, when I came of age I did not know much. \n     Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to the Rule of \n     Three; but that was all. I have not been to school since.\n       The little advance I now have upon this store of education, \n     I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of \n     necessity.\n\n  Lincoln concluded his autobiography just four paragraphs later with \nthese words: ``There is not much of it, for the reason, I suppose, that \nthere is not much of me.''\n  That was in 1859, one year before the election that thrust Abraham \nLincoln into the Presidency--before the Civil War broke out and helped \ncrystallize all that he believed about his nation--before everything he \nbelieved about himself was tested.\n  Never again could Abraham Lincoln truthfully make the claim that \n``there is not much of me.''\n  Mr. President, on the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, poet and \nbiographer Carl Sandburg traveled here to the Capitol in 1959 to \naddress a joint session of both Houses of Congress.\n  The description he painted that day of the man born in Hardin County, \nKentucky, was delivered in words far more eloquent than any I could \noffer up:\n  He said,\n\n       Not often does a man arrive on earth who is both steel and \n     velvet, who is as hard as rock and soft as drifting fog, who \n     holds in his heart and mind the paradox of terrible storm and \n     peace unspeakable and perfect. . .\n       The people of many other countries take Lincoln now for \n     their own. He belongs to them. He stands for decency, honest \n     dealing, plain talk, and funny stories. . . Millions there \n     are who take him as a personal treasure. He had something \n     they would like to see spread everywhere over the world.\n       Democracy? We cannot say exactly what it is, but he had it. \n     In his blood and bones, he carried it. In the breath of his \n     speeches and writings, it is there. Popular government? \n     Republican institutions?\n       Government where the people have the say-so, one way or \n     another telling their elected leaders what they want? He had \n     the idea. It is there in the lights and shadows of his \n     personality, a mystery that can be lived but never fully \n     spoken in words.\n\n  Mr. President, there are many American leaders I admire--for their \nconvictions, their passion, and their pursuit of truth--but Abraham \nLincoln towers above most all of them.\n  At a troubled moment in our nation's history, he gave a voice to the \ngrowing number of Americans who felt out of place with the politics of \nthe time. America is a place of inclusion, they argued, not exclusion. \nA place of freedom, not of slavery. The United States must stay united, \nthey said, not severed into disparate parts. Abraham Lincoln spoke for \nwhat America was meant to be when he spoke of inclusion, unity, and \nequality, and by the sheer force of his single-minded dedication, his \nvoice kept the Union from splintering forever apart.\n  If any one man is responsible for preserving the nation during the \nCivil War, that man is Abraham Lincoln.\n  ``Important principles may and must be inflexible,'' said President \nLincoln in his last public address, delivered in Washington, and for \nthat unflinching commitment, his detractors hated him.\n  Lincoln was unfit, they said, ``shattered, dazed, utterly foolish'' . \n. . ``a political coward'' . . . ``timid and arrogant.'' And those were \nthe words of his fellow Republicans. Outside his party, they labeled \nhim ``a mole-eyed monster with a soul of leather'' and ``the present \nturtle at the head of the government.''\n  But his simple words and powerful resolve endeared him to the people, \nwho looked on him as ``Honest Abe,'' a straightforward and sympathetic \nleader. He was their president, but he was also one of them. So, it was \na brutal shock to the country when he was shot to death just ten blocks \nfrom here, during an evening performance at Ford's Theater.\n  Mr. President, poised on the edge of the Reflecting Pool on the \nNational Mall, overlooking Washington from its place of honor, rests a \ngraceful tribute to our sixteenth president. Outside, the Lincoln \nMemorial possesses the lines of a classic Greek temple--inside, you \nwill find the soul of an American patriot. Lincoln himself rises 19 \nfeet toward the sky, sculpted in Georgia White marble, larger than \nlife, his eyes forever focused forward. He cannot speak, but the walls \nspeak for him. Etched into the stone around him are his words, and each \ntime I visit I am struck by the visual marriage of man and message. One \nphrase in particular always makes me pause, a quotation from Abraham \nLincoln's Second Inaugural Address, spoken just 28 days before his \nassassination:\n\n       With malice toward none, with charity for all, with \n     firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let \n     us strive on to finish the work we are in.\n\n  We have come so far as a nation since those words were first spoken. \nMore than one hundred years have passed since brother last took up arms \nagainst brother, and we are no longer divided by allegiance to a \nConfederate or Union flag. By heritage, we are black Americans, white \nAmericans, Italian Americans, Polish Americans, Norwegian Americans--\nand united under the Constitution, we are simply Americans.\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\n Abraham Lincoln did not live to finish the work he began, but the \npursuit of liberty and inclusion he inspired in a nation has endured.\n  More than once in the million recorded words he left behind, Abraham \nLincoln considered his death and the reputation that history would \naccord him. In keeping with everything else we know about the man, \nhowever, he sought not a legacy, but his place in humanity. ``Die when \nI may, I want it said of me that I plucked a weed and planted a flower \nwherever I thought a flower would grow.'' Mr. President, Abraham \nLincoln plucked many weeds during his too-brief life, and sowed a great \ngarden of humanity in their place. On the anniversary of his birth, we \ncelebrate the towering truths we have reaped from his planting.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business. I \nseek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator may speak \nup to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S684-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S685-S686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ADDRESSING IRAQ IN CONTEXT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we as a nation are obviously wrestling with \nthe issue of how to address the events presently occurring in the \nMiddle East, specifically as they relate to Iraq. The Congress has \nconsidered taking up a resolution, which has been passed around and \nreviewed by many of us, but for a variety of reasons it does not appear \nthat we are going to take such a resolution up during this week, and \nsince we are adjourning, we will not be taking it up next week either. \nSo I did want to make a few comments on this issue, because it is \nclearly the question of most significance that faces our country at \nthis time.\n  I do not believe that we can address the question of how we deal with \na dictator such as Saddam Hussein in isolation. We have to look at the \nquestion in the context of the other nations which surround Iraq and in \nthe context of the history which has led us to this point. This is \nespecially true when we deal with Iraq--or any nation in that region of \nthe world--because the history of that region is so convoluted and \ninvolves so many crosscurrents, it being, quite literally, the crossing \npoint of thousands of years, of generations of individuals, of numerous \ncultures both East and West, Bagdad specifically being the center, for \nliterally centuries, of commerce from the east to the west and from the \nnorth to the south. As a result, it was a place where many cultures \nmerged.\n  Therefore, when we as a nation, a new nation in the context of \ndealing with the Middle East, set ourselves down in the center of that \npart of the world, I think we have to be aware of the variety of forces \nwhich come to bear as a result of the historical events and prejudices \nand attitudes and cultures and religions that confront us there. I am \nnot sure that we have been, really, in dealing with this issue.\n  For example, let's begin at the outer reaches of the question from a \nterritorial or geographic perception. Let's look at Russia. Clearly our \ncapacity to deal with Iraq requires our capacity to encourage support \namongst other nations for our position. We have had fairly limited \nsuccess in that. In fact, you might almost call this administration's \napproach to alliance relative to Iraq as the English-speaking approach, \nbecause, as far as I can tell, it appears to be only English-speaking \ncountries who are supporting this administration's present policies in \nan open manner.\n  There are a few of the gulf states that have supported us, which is \nsomething we should not underestimate. But as a practical matter, I \nhave noted with a great deal of sadness, actually, that the White House \nwas taking great pride in the fact that yesterday it had been joined by \nAustralia in support of its position. That's what they were heralding. \nWe greatly appreciate Australia's support and admire them as a nation. \nBut I think we also recognize that in the issue of the Middle East, it \nis not Australia that is important; it is nations such as Russia and \nour former Arab allies. I say former Arab allies because it appears \nthat that is no longer the case--such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, who \nare critical, and Turkey.\n  But in the area of Russia, for example, this administration appears \nto think that they can go to the Soviets--to Russia, my mistake--and \ndemand that Russia follow our policies in Iraq and insist on their \nsupport on Iraq, but at the same time this administration proposes an \nexpansion of NATO. You have to recognize, if you were a Russian leader, \nyou would find a certain irony in a request that was coupled in that \nterminology. Because, of course, an expansion of NATO, especially to \nPoland, is an expression that can only be viewed in Russia with some \nconcern and possibly viewed by some as an outright threat.\n\n  NATO expansion is represented to us here in the United States as \nsimply: Well, let's ask these three nice nations in Eastern Europe to \njoin us in our alliance. But, of course, NATO is a security issue. It \nis an alliance made for the purposes of defending nations from threat, \nmilitary threat. It is not an economic group, as everybody has noted \nfor many years. As a practical matter, the capacity to expand NATO \nmeans that you are essentially saying to these nations that they are \njoining, for the purposes of their own national security, against some \nthreat. What is the threat in Eastern Europe? Of course, the threat in \nEastern Europe has always been either Russia or Germany. Since Germany \nis a member of NATO and is not a threat, clearly an expansion of NATO \nis addressing the threat from Russia. Therefore, when we ask Poland \nespecially to join us in NATO, we are saying to Poland that we are \ngiving you security against Russia, and clearly we are implying, \ncertainly indirectly if not directly, that Russia may be the threat.\n  So you can understand that Russia might view a push to expand NATO at \nthe same time as we are asking them to support us in Iraq as being \ninconsistent and a bit ironic. And it reflects, unfortunately, I think, \nthis administration's failure to understand the linkage--and linkage is \nthe right term--between working with a nation like Russia and our \ncapacity to do things in the Middle East and moving forward with the \nNATO expansion at the exact same time. Yet, if you were to listen to \nthe leadership of this administration, they will tell you that there is \nno relationship, they have no overlap on those two issues. Of course \nthat is not true, and that is one of the reasons we are having problems \nwith Russia.\n  It is equally a reason that we are having problems with our former \nArab allies. Just yesterday or the day before yesterday--I lose track \nof the calendar here when we go to Egypt--but the Arab League met in \nCairo, and they endorsed the French and Russian proposal, which was \nessentially a restatement, to a marginal degree, of the Iraqi proposal, \nas a league. The Arab League endorsed that as a league. Why would they \ndo that? Because the Arab League essentially is dominated by Egypt, \nwhich has been our ally and which certainly, in many ways, is a friend \nof our Nation. I am a great admirer of the Egyptian people. They have \ncertainly worked hard as a nation to try to bring about a constructive \nresult, or progress in the Middle East in their relationship to Israel \never since President Sadat and through the present leadership in Egypt.\n  You wonder why the Arab League would openly endorse the French and \nRussian program? Essentially, they do it because of the situation that \npresently exists in Israel and Palestine, the fact that the peace \nprocess is, for all intents and purposes, dead. Yet, if you were again \nto listen to this administration, as the Senator in the chair has \npointed out in a number of conferences that we have had, this \nadministration's attitude is that there is no relationship between the \npeace process in Israel and Palestine and the question of Iraq. Of \ncourse, there is. They are intimately related. In fact, if we were able \nto make progress or to get back on line the process of peace between \nIsrael and Palestine, we would probably relieve dramatically the \ntension in that part of the world and it would inevitably lead to \nhaving support from Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the key allies, on the \nissue of how we address Iraq.\n  So the failure of this administration to understand, again, the \nlinkage between those two issues is a failure of fundamental \nproportions in their capacity to address the Iraq issue.\n  The third area that this also reflects is the issue of Turkey. Turkey \nis not\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\ndiscussed a great deal in our Nation and it should be discussed more \nbecause Turkey is a unique and special nation in relationship to \nourselves. Throughout the cold war, Turkey was essentially the front \nline. It was a nation which did not really ask for much, yet gave us \nits alliance and its assistance. We have truly, as a nation, and this \nadministration, as an administration, has truly treated Turkey poorly. \nThis goes to the issue of Cyprus and it goes to the issue of Greece. \nYet if you were to ask this administration, what is the relationship \nbetween the Turkish-Greek issue and the Cyprus issue and the capacity \nto deal with Saddam Hussein, they would say that there is none, that \nthere is no relationship there. That is maybe why they have abandoned \nthe effort to bring to resolution that very critical issue of \ninternational importance. Yet we find today that Turkey, again, is \nhesitant to allow us to use its bases in order to address the Iraq \nissue.\n  So, three major elements of the capacity to address the Iraq issue in \na coordinated and effective way are tied to a variety of different \nhistorical and geographic and national and international \nconfrontations, which this administration either, No. 1, doesn't \nappreciate or, No. 2, is actively ignoring. As a result, our capacity \nas a country to unite a coalition which can effectively address Saddam \nHussein has been undermined.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Most critical, of course, to this is the issue of how we \ndeal with Iran and the fact that, once again, this administration has \nfailed to reflect effectively on the policy dealing with that nation. \nIran, as we recognize, has been dominated by a fundamentalist \nleadership which has viewed its purpose as promoting an aggressive \nreligious philosophy internationally. It has viewed the United States \nas its enemy in this undertaking. But this fundamentalism cannot \nsurvive forever. It is much like when we confronted the Communist \nleadership after World War II and President Truman and President \nEisenhower recognized that, through the process of constructive \ncontainment, we would be able to bring down that system of government \nbecause it would fall of its own weight because at some point, after a \ncertain period of years, the fundamental flaws of that system and that \nphilosophy would simply undermine it and decay it from within. And that \nis true also of the fundamentalist movement in Iran.\n  The Muslim religion is an extremely powerful and great religion, and \nit is a religion that is based on some very wonderful precepts. But the \nfundamentalism that captured a certain element of the Muslim believers \nis, as it is practiced in Iran, inherently self-destructive. If we are \nable to contain Iran but at the same time encourage within Iran the \nmore moderate elements, we will, over a period of time, see, I believe, \na collapse of the fundamentalist energy from within and a rising of a \nstate which will be responsible. But this administration has passed \nover a series of opportunities to promote that option, which has been \nunfortunate.\n  If you are going to contain Iraq, then you must understand that in \nthe process of containing Iraq, you must neutralize Iran as a threat to \nthe region. Because if you were to eliminate Iraq as a force within \ntheir region, you would create a vacuum into which a fundamentalist \nIran would step and be a threat to its neighbors of even greater \nproportions--greater proportions--than Iraq is. So, reflecting \nadequately on how we deal with Iran, and approaching Iran as part of \nthe solution to how we deal with Iraq, is critical, critical to the \ncapacity to take on the Iraqi issue. Yet this administration, in my \nopinion, has once again left the ball on the side of the field when it \ncomes to understanding or pursuing that course of action.\n  So, where does that leave us? Unfortunately, where it leaves us is \nwith a 19th century dictator who has 20th century weapons of mass \ndestruction, in Saddam Hussein, an individual who lives by a code which \nis horrific to the sensibilities of a civilized world. It is a code \nthat follows in the course of people like Adolph Hitler and Mussolini \nand others, who sought to promote themselves in the name of some cause \nwhich was really just superficial to their own megalomania.\n  But our capacity to address Hussein and to be able to deal with the \nsituation in Iraq is fundamentally undermined by our inability, one, to \nfocus on the situation with an international alliance and, two, to have \nthe capacity, because we do not have an international alliance, to take \naction which will end up being definitive.\n  So we find ourselves with this administration stating that we are \nbuilding up an arms capability to make an attack on Iraq without an \nalliance supporting it with a stated objective that nobody understands, \nbecause Secretary Cohen has said that a military attack will not \nreplace Saddam Hussein, and the President said it is not our goal to \nreplace Saddam Hussein. Secretary Cohen has stated that a military \nattack will not eliminate the weapons of mass destruction, and we know \nthat to be the case. So what is the result of the military attack?\n  There is no clear understanding as to what it is. It will not be that \nSaddam Hussein is replaced. It will not be that the weapons of mass \ndestruction are eliminated. It will not be that the alliance we had in \nthe gulf war of 1991 are being reinstated. I have no idea what the \nconclusion of a military attack would be.\n  I think the unintended consequences of it will be dramatic. Some may \nbe positive. We may successfully eliminate some weaponry that might \notherwise be used against our neighbors. Some may be horrific. We may \nfind that Saddam Hussein uses his weaponry in some other theater or \nsome other place. It may even be here in the United States. But those \nare unintended consequences, because there appears to be no intended \nconsequences.\n  Literally, there are no intended consequences. If the intended \nconsequence is not to replace him and the intended consequence is not \nto destroy the weapons, what is the intended consequence of military \naction? I don't know what it is. Therefore, before we go forward with a \nresolution in this body--and I understand that we are not going to do \nthat this week--before we go forward with a resolution in this body, I \nbelieve we have to bring some definition to the purpose of the process.\n  I believe, first, we have to recognize and we have to retouch our \nallies and our friends and people who should be our allies and our \nfriends. We have to go back to Russia and understand their concerns. We \nhave to go back to Turkey and understand their concerns. We have to go \nback to Egypt and understand their concerns. We have to go to Israel \nand talk about the need to get the peace process started again and to \nreturn to the concepts of Rabin as versus the concepts of Netanyahu.\n  More important, we, as a nation, have to know what is our purpose and \nwhat is our goal.\n  I believe our purpose and goal should be, first, to create a united \napproach on this to bring into the effort an alliance which is broader \nand more substantive than what we presently have, something more than \nan English-speaking alliance.\n  Second, it must be to remove Saddam Hussein and his government. We \nshould have as our stated goal and purpose of any military action that \nwe intend to have a democratic government in Iraq.\n  And, third, it should be that the weapons of mass destruction are \ndestroyed; not that they will survive, but that they are destroyed.\n  These should be our goals, and I hope as we move down the road to \nconsidering the issue of what we do in Iraq and before we move forward \nwith military action that we at least get some clarity of the process, \nhopefully along the lines I stated.\n  I appreciate the patience of the Chair, and I especially appreciate \nthe patience of the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

Mr. President, as I have noted on earlier occasions, \nthis country continues to face a major drug\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nproblem. It is a problem that affects us all. No community escapes the \nconsequences of drug use. Our streets and neighborhoods are made \ndangerous and unwelcoming by those who peddle illegal drugs. Our places \nof work are not drug free. Today, we live in a country where even our \nschools are not safe havens from the ravages of drugs.\n  In just a few days, the Administration will release its newest drug \nstrategy. It will be welcome, even though it is two weeks late. I look \nforward to it, even as the Administration undertakes efforts to do away \nwith an annual drug strategy. The budget for drugs will be increased. \nThat, too, is welcome. But we need to remind ourselves that despite \nsteady increases in our counter-drug spending, we have seen increases \nin drug use by kids.\n  This is a fact that the Administration has tried to sugar coat. It \nhas tried to disguise the fact that drug use among kids has steadily \nincreased throughout its tenure. Despite recent efforts by the \nAdministration to paint over this fact with rhetoric, the facts remain.\n  We cannot fight drug use among our kids by being less than honest. We \nshould not even try. But there is another lesson in our current and \ngrowing problem. I believe that the Administration has not done as much \nas it ought to do. I believe it has left undone much that it should do. \nBut, our drug problem is a national concern that must go beyond what \ngovernment can do. We must remind ourselves that this is a problem that \nwe must all confront. Parents, community and religious leaders, the \nbusiness community, local politicians, the media, Hollywood, and our \nopinion leaders must come together. We need more than just money. We \nneed commitment. We need more than rhetoric.\n  Every day more of our kids start using illegal drugs. We need to roll \nup our sleeves and get to work.\n  For these reasons, I am today presenting a ten-point program to fight \nback. This is my agenda to try to get our counter-drug efforts back on \nthe front burner. We need to better define the problem, and we need to \nbe doing more. As Chairman of the International Narcotics Control \nCaucus, I will work to push a more visible and effective national \ncounter-drug effort.\n  The first item on my agenda is to continue work to strengthen local \ncommunity counter-drug problems. Last year, I sponsored legislation in \nthe Senate, later signed into law, that provides funding to local \ncommunity counter-drug coalitions. I will continue my efforts to ensure \nthat this legislation is fully, speedily, and responsibly implemented.\n  Second, I will continue to work on implementing a statewide coalition \neffort in Iowa that I began last year. The aim of this effort is to \nhelp create a framework to complement state and local efforts to combat \nillegal drugs in communities across Iowa. Working with such national \norganizations as Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, we are \nengaged in a project that can become a template for other states. The \ncoalition will foster input and guidance from a non-political steering \ncommittee and six task forces. These include members from Iowa business \nand union leaders, the education community, religious leaders, and \nrepresentatives from law enforcement. They also involve contributions \nfrom the media, doctors, and community anti-drug groups.\n  Third, I will be calling upon our national business leaders and \nadvertisers to renew their commitment to drug-free advertising. We have \nseen in recent years a decline in this commitment. That decline lead to \nthe use of public money to pay for advertizing.\n  But more to the point, I am concerned about what it says about the \ndeclining commitment of our business community to support a national \neffort to fight drug use. This is especially true given the problems \nthat drug use creates in the workplace.\n  Fourth, I will be seeking more resources for communities across the \ncountry to deal with an emerging drug problem. This is the double \nwhammy of methamphetamine. Communities in the West and Middle West face \nnot only growing meth use problems. They also face a new trend: Mexican \ncriminal organizations are increasingly building meth labs in our \ncommunities and rural areas. Meth is being funneled into Iowa by these \norganizations. Labs are also increasingly being discovered. These \ncreate an environmental hazard that is often beyond the resources of \nlocal police or fire organizations to deal with. Last year, I co-\nsponsored an effort to increase funding to these communities for meth \nlab clean up. I will expand that effort to ensure sustainable funding \nto help local communities.\n  Fifth, I will continue to press the Administration for a \ncomprehensive drug strategy. One of the major deficits in our current \neffort is not a lack of funding but a lack of focus. I propose to deal \nwith that through greater oversight of our national efforts. In \nparticular, I will push for a more comprehensive southern tier \napproach. Too often, our efforts to control access to our southern \nborder have been piecemeal and fragmented. The forthcoming national \ndrug strategy will perpetuate that imbalance.\n  While we build a dyke in one area, the traffickers open a hole \nsomeplace else. We need a more focused effort that brings resources to \nbear consistently. We also need to ensure that our major drug control \nagencies receive adequate resources that implement consistent, well-\nconceived and integrated plans.\n  As part of this effort, I will pursue more vigorous oversight of our \ncounter-drug programs.\n  I will do this through insisting that we maintain a strong commitment \nto the annual certification process on international drug control. I \nwill continue efforts to investigate specific programs and activities \nto ensure that our efforts are on track and producing results. I will \nalso seek to ensure that our efforts to protect the integrity of our \nlaw enforcement activities is a priority.\n  I will also pursue legislation that will provide greater authority to \nour law enforcement community to break the link between drug \ntrafficking and alien smuggling. Many of our local communities find \nthat drugs are introduced or produced by illegal aliens. I have \nsupported increased resources to both U.S. Customs and the INS. I will \ncontinue my personal efforts to ensure adequate resources and focus at \nour borders and in our local communities.\n  As the eighth point in my agenda, I will pursue tougher penalties for \nthose who traffic and sell drugs. In particular, I will seek enhanced \npenalties for trafficking or selling near our schools and for peddling \ndrugs to minors.\n  As an integral part of this effort, I will also seek to toughen, not \nweaken, cocaine sentencing guidelines. I believe it sends an entirely \nwrong signal to lessen mandatory minimum sentences for those who \ntraffick in crack cocaine. The Administration is proposing to weaken \nsentencing at a time when drug use is increasing. It is typical of the \ndisconnect between the rhetoric we hear and the reality we see. Like \nthe Administration, I will support efforts to bring powder cocaine \nsentencing into line with crack cocaine. But I will seek to do this by \nsupporting Senator Abraham's efforts to enhance the sentences for \ntrafficking powder cocaine, not by weakening our efforts.\n  Finally, as part of my action plan, I will continue to work to \nstrengthen our ability to deal with money laundering and organized \ncriminal activities. The drugs that reach our streets and target our \nkids do not get there by accident. They are directed there by well-\norganized, international criminal gangs. Their purpose is to make money \nat the expense of our kids. I will work to pass legislation that I \nintroduced last year to go after the profits of these drug thugs. I \nwill also continue to press the Administration to develop comprehensive \nlegislation to go after international criminals wherever they may hide.\n  This agenda is my personal commitment to do what one Senator can do \nto deal with this nation's drug problem. I will pursue this agenda as \nChairman of the Drug Caucus. In the coming days and weeks, I will be \nintroducing specific legislation to deal with many of the things I have \ntalked about today. I will be coming to my colleagues for support. I \nwill be expecting the Administration to live up to its obligations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nCongressman. The House of Representatives is paying tribute today to \nour Vietnam prisoners of war. It was 25 years ago this month that those \nbrave men began returning home to America.\n  Among those heroes was Sam Johnson. Sam was a prisoner 6 years 10 \nmonths 18 days and 23 hours, which he can tell you to this day.\n  All of us who know Sam know he is a fighter. He was called \n``diehard'' by his North Vietnamese captors.\n  Sam was one of 11 prisoners whose total defiance to prison authority \nresulted in banishment to a high security prison that was dubbed \n``Alcatraz.'' The prisoners were placed in tiny cubicles in an earthen-\nwalled facility that was dug out of the center courtyard of the North \nVietnam Ministry of Defense in downtown Hanoi. Sam and the other 10 \nwore leg irons and suffered from severe malnutrition.\n  Sam's defiance continued to the end, until February 13, 1973, when \nSam boarded a plane at Gia Lam Airport to return home.\n  Our Nation recognized Sam Johnson's contributions by making him one \nof the most highly decorated aviators of his era. During Sam's military \ncareer, he was awarded two Silver Stars, two Legions of Merit, the \nDistinguished Flying Cross, one Bronze Star with Valor, two Purple \nHearts, four Air Medals, and three Outstanding Unit awards.\n  Mr. President, I would like to note also that here in the Senate \nthere are many heroes from among us from World War II, the Korean war \nand the war in Vietnam.\n  Today, 25 years after the POWs in Vietnam began to come home, it is \nalso appropriate to recall the sacrifice made by our own colleague, my \ngood friend, John McCain. John returned from Vietnam after his own \ncapture and imprisonment 25 years ago next month.\n  Patriots like Senator John McCain and Congressman Sam Johnson remind \nus of what makes America great--honor, courage, and duty. They enrich \nthe Congress and remind us every day of the important responsibility we \nhave as stewards of the young men and women in our armed forces. As we \nprepare for a possible conflict in Iraq, I have no higher priority than \nthat those troops will get everything they need to do the job if they \nare sent.\n  As Americans we have many things for which to be thankful. But \nperhaps we should be most thankful for the brave Americans throughout \nour history who have fought the wars to keep America free. It is their \nsacrifice that has preserved democracy. It is their sense of patriotism \nand duty that Americans must always embrace if we are to remain free. \nCommemorating this 25th anniversary is one way that we will make sure \nthat Americans do not forget the sacrifices that have been made for us \nto be able to stand here in this Senate Chamber and speak on an \nunfettered basis and openly and freely.\n  I want to say that I am proud that Sam Johnson is my Congressman. I \nalso want to pay tribute to his wife, Shirley. Shirley and Sam are \nfriends of Ray's and mine, and have been for years.\n  But Shirley is a hero, too. Sometimes we do not talk about those who \nwere left home for 6 years to raise the children, to give them the hope \nand strength and love that both parents would normally give. It is to \nthe Shirley Johnsons, also, that we owe a great debt of gratitude, \nbecause she was there never giving up, making sure that America never \nforgot that some were missing and some were imprisoned. She, too, \nshould be commended today on this 25th anniversary.\n  I am honored to serve with Sam Johnson and Senator John McCain. As we \nhonor them, we make sure that those who came home know how much we \nappreciate them. And, most of all, we remember those who did not come \nhome.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on on \ntwo topics. The first is that our dear friend and colleague, \nCongressman Sam Johnson, one of America's great warriors and one of \nAmerica's great individuals, came home from Hanoi 25 years ago today, \nhaving been held as a prisoner of war for almost 7 years.\n  Sam grew up in Dallas. He graduated from Southern Methodist \nUniversity. He went into the Air Force. He became one of the great \npilots in the postwar period. He commanded the Top Gun school. He was a \nThunderbird.\n  In fact, Senator McCain loves to tell the story about the time when \nhe and Sam were campaigning together in Texas--as all of you know, \nSenator McCain was a great aviator in his own right and a great warrior \nand a real American hero--and he loves to tell the story when he and \nSam were on a plane riding in the back and they came in pretty fast, \nand Sam calmly turned to Senator McCain and said, ``We're going to run \noff the runway.'' Senator McCain said, ``What makes you think so?'' \njust as they hit the railing and went off the runway.\n  The point being that Sam Johnson was a great aviator. He was flying a \nmission over North Vietnam. He was shot down. He was taken to prison in \nHanoi. The North Vietnamese correctly concluded that he was a diehard \nand a recalcitrant, so they put him in solitary confinement year after \nyear, basically a dugout, a little dungeon.\n  After 7 years in prison, enduring almost unbelievable hardship, he \ncame home 25 years ago.\n  Now, the remarkable thing about all this is not all the medals that \nSam Johnson won. We honor those and we should. It is not really the \nhardship that he endured, though I doubt many of us would be capable of \ndoing it. But what is remarkable to me is that after 7 years in a \ndungeon in Hanoi, Sam Johnson came home and started his life again. He \nnever complained about the 7 years he lost. You never see him that he \ndoesn't have a smile on his face. He is a sweet, gentle, loving man. It \nis remarkable to me that somebody could go through 7 years of that kind \nof hardship--hunger, exhaustion, fear, physical and mental abuse--and \nyet come back home and be all the things that Sam Johnson is.\n  I wanted, on this 25th anniversary of the day that he came home to \nAmerica, to stand on the floor of the Senate today and say to our \ncolleague, Congressman Sam Johnson, that we are proud of him and that \nwe are proud to associate with him. For most of us, the highest \ncredential we are ever going to have other than being members of our \nfamily and being associated with our kinfolks is that we served in \nCongress. Many of us get whatever stature we might have from the \nposition we hold, a position that was given to us in trust by the \nvoter. But Sam Johnson is one of those rare people who brought stature \nto Congress with him when he came. He is a wonderful man. I love Sam \nJohnson.\n  I think in an era where there are a lot of people who kind of think \npoliticians don't represent the best that America has to offer, that \nsomehow politicians aren't exactly the kind of people you want your \nchildren to grow up to be, I ask them to look at Congressman Sam \nJohnson. He is the kind\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\nof person I want my sons to grow up to be.\n  On this very special day for him, 25 years ago coming home to \nAmerica, being set free in Hanoi, I wanted to congratulate Sam and \nthank him not just for the service he provided during 29 years in the \nAir Force, not just for 7 years in a dungeon in North Vietnam, but I \nwant to thank him for the service he is providing for America today. We \nappreciate that. I am very proud to have him as one of my Congressman \nrepresenting me and my State. I am also proud to have him as a friend.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ALLARD. My wife, Joan, and I are pleased to recognize that both \nShirley and Sam are very close friends of ours. I had come to the floor \nto speak on another matter but I feel so fortunate to have been here at \nthe time you are making these comments.\n  You are right on the mark.

Mr. President, let me turn to my final subject today. As \nall Members of the Senate know, Senator Byrd and I have embarked on \nwhat for us is a crusade. It is a crusade to try to force the Federal \nGovernment to live up to the commitment that it makes to Americans when \nthey go to the gas pump and fill up their car or truck and pay about a \nthird of the cost of a gallon of gasoline in taxes, and they are told \nthe taxes are being used to build roads, that this is a user fee tax \nwhere the money is dedicated to road construction.\n  As those of us who serve in Congress, as those who follow these \nmatters very closely know, that commitment is not being fulfilled. \nBetween 25 and 30 cents out of every dollar of gasoline tax that is \npaid by American motorists goes not for transportation needs, not to \nnew roads, but instead is spent on everything but highway construction. \nThis is a diversion of funds that violates the commitment that we have \nmade to American taxpayers. At a time when many Americans this morning \ngot up and drove to work and waited in what seemed to be endless lines \nof congestion, when people drove over potholes that were dangerous and, \nin some cases, caused damage to their car, and when people endured \nunsafe conditions. There are 31,000 miles of road in my State that are \nsubstandard. We have thousands of bridges that are structurally \nunsound. I think people are rightly outraged when they discover that \nover 25 cents out of every dollar they paid in gasoline taxes, which \nthey thought was going to highway construction, is in fact being spent \non other things in Government.\n  Senator Byrd and I now have 54 cosponsors on our bill, with the \nobjective of trying to force the Government to live up to the \ncommitment it makes to the American people and require that when money \nis collected in gasoline taxes for the purpose of building roads, that \nthat money actually be spent for that purpose.\n  Now, many of the things that we work on here have an effect, but \nafter a long period of time, from the time that the actual work is \ndone, and often especially when you are working on big issues that \naffect economic growth and inflation, it's hard to sort of pinpoint the \npositive impact on it. But if we can bring up the new highway bill and \npass the Byrd-Gramm amendment, on May 2 States across America will get \nroughly a 25 percent increase in the amount of money that is available \nto fill up these potholes, to build new roads, to modernize the \nexisting system, to reduce the delays and traffic jams and hazards that \nwe all face on the road every day, and do it by taking the money away \nfrom all the programs that never should have gotten the highway money \nto begin with and spending the money for the purpose that it is being \ncollected.\n  Senator Byrd and I, all week, have reminded our colleagues that we \nare running out of time. The highway bill expires on May 1. And all \nover America today, States are beginning to cancel contracts. Michigan \ncanceled a major contract yesterday. We are having employees notified \nby highway builders that they are going to be laid off as of the 1st of \nMay when this highway bill expires. Senator Byrd and I want to move on \nwith this issue, bring it up. If people want to vote no, if they want \nto continue to take highway trust fund money collected in gasoline \ntaxes, where we tell people the money is being spent for roads but \nwhere we spend it on something else, if people want to vote to continue \nthat diversion, they have the right to vote for that. But 54 Members of \nthe Senate have already said that they want to change it.\n  So I urge our leadership to bring up this bill and give us an \nopportunity to let the Senate work its will. It is very important that \nwe not let the highway bill expire. It is very important that we get on \nwith highway construction, which the country desperately needs. I also \nbelieve it is important, especially in this era of cynicism about \nGovernment that when we tell people that money is being collected in \ngasoline taxes, to go into a highway trust fund to be spent on roads, \nthat that money be spent on roads, that it not be spent on other \nthings. Fundamentally, that is what this issue is about.\n  So I am hopeful that in the week when we come back--we are going on \nrecess, perhaps tonight, and we will be back a week from this coming \nMonday--that we are going to be able to bring up the highway bill and \nlet people decide where they stand on this issue.\n  And let me, as a final point, say that the Byrd-Gramm amendment does \nnot bust the budget. The Byrd-Gramm amendment does not raise the \nspending caps. But what it does do is say that all these other programs \nthat have been beneficiaries from the piracy that has occurred in the \nhighway trust fund are going to have to give up that money so that it \ncan be spent on roads.\n  Now, I know some of our colleagues have said: Great, if you spend \nthis money on roads, we were planning to spend it otherwise. I have \nlikened their attitude to a cattle rustler who steals your cattle and \nyou come out and you arrest him and you catch him red-handed stealing \nyour cattle, and his only response is, ``OK, so you make me stop \nstealing your cattle, but where am I going to get my beef?'' Well, \nthat's not my problem. What we are talking about is doing what we tell \npeople we are doing. So I'm not saying the programs that have pirated \nthe trust fund aren't, in some cases, worthy. In some cases they are \nnot worthy, but in other cases they are very worthy.\n  The point is that we collected the money to build roads, not to pay \ndues to the U.N.; we didn't collect money to pay for Legal Services \nCorporation; we didn't collect the money to use in welfare; we \ncollected the money for the purpose of building roads. That's the \npurpose to which the money should be put and only that purpose.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, no Senator from the State of Illinois \ncould rise on February 12 without noting the birth date of Abraham \nLincoln. Abraham Lincoln never served in the Senate, although he did \nserve in the U.S. House of Representatives. One of his most famous \npolitical experiences was in 1858 when he ran against Stephen Douglas \nfor the Senate seat which I am honored to occupy. Lincoln lost that \nelection. Of course, following the course of the lengthy debates with \nDouglas, which became part of the legend of American politics and an \nimportant part of our history, by 1860 Lincoln was elected President. \nAnd we all know his leadership was so critical in one of our Nation's \ngreatest hours.\n  We in Illinois dote on Abraham Lincoln. We have his name on license \nplates. In my hometown, we are consumed with the Lincoln legend and \nwith all that he has given to the State and to the Nation. I hope that \nthose who are witnessing the events in this Chamber today will reflect \nfor a moment on this great man and the great legacy he left to the \nUnited States. Lincoln was known very well for his leadership at the \ntime the Nation was in great peril with the Civil War. He did so many \nthings with vision, and I think it is a perfect lead in to my reason \nfor standing before the Senate today. I hope those of us who are in \nsuccessor generations to Abraham Lincoln can rise to the challenges and \ncan show the same type of vision and leadership on the challenges now \nfacing Americans across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S690-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S690-S692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     QUALITY CHILD CARE IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just left a meeting, partisan meeting, \nDemocrats, Senators and Congressmen, with the President and Vice \nPresident where we discussed our agenda for this year. At the end of \nthe meeting, President Clinton said that he hoped we could reach across \nthe aisle to the Republican side and find common ground, concede honest \ndifferences of opinion but move forward on an agenda which is \ncritically important to all of America's population and families.\n  I know it is ambitious to think that in a year with an abbreviated \nschedule we will achieve even a majority of the ideas that were \npropounded at this meeting or that the Democrats stand for--for that \nmatter, that the Republicans stand for--but we would be remiss if we \ndidn't try. I think we were all sent here to use our best efforts to \nfind common ground and to resolve those difficulties that ordinary \nAmericans face.\n  One of them I have taken a special interest in and over the last \nmonth or so have really focused on in the State of Illinois is the \nissue of child care. I have visited 16 or 18 child care centers in my \nState from far south in Cairo, as we pronounce it, to Chicago and \nacross the length and breadth of a very diverse State, my home State of \nIllinois.\n  What I find in child care for working families in Illinois is \nextraordinary diversity. Just about every community in which you stop \nhas a little different approach. It seems that some are blessed with \nthe support of larger institutions. Maybe the most modern, up-to-date \nand impressive facility was at a U.S. Air Force base, Scott Air Force \nBase near Belleville, IL. But, of course, the Federal Government has \nmade a rather substantial investment so that the children of the men \nand women who are working on that base have the very best in child \ncare. I then went as well to the Belleville Community College and saw \nwhere the community college made the same type of commitment. It makes \na difference. You can just feel it in terms of what is being offered.\n  That is not to diminish the efforts being made in a lot of different \nsettings. When I would go down to Marion, IL, into the back of a church \nand find a very small and crowded room with the happiest kids I have \never run into, being supervised by a lady who is probably close to 60 \nyears of age but who truly is devoted to these children, it tells you \nthat what is part of the success of child care in America has to do \nmore with the people involved in it than any Government program or any \nstructure or building or any bricks or mortar.\n  But having said that, I came away from this tour sensitized to the \nfact that this is a real issue. So many people in America look at the \nSenate and the House of Representatives and wonder what newspapers we \nare reading, what people we are talking to, as we are consumed with \nissues that seem totally irrelevant.\n  Now, some of those issues are truly important, but for the average \nworking family their concerns are much more down to earth. I have yet \nto meet a working mother or a working family with small children where \nI don't find a genuine concern about day care. My wife and I raised \nthree kids, and we were fortunate; my wife was able to stay home until \nthe kids were all off to kindergarten at least. And I think that was \nthe very best that we could give to them. I look back on it as \nsomething that really made a positive impression, a positive difference \nin their life, and yet we know today that so many parents cannot make \nthat choice, that both parents have to work or if it is a single parent \nthat there is just no alternative but to turn the children over to a \ncare giver during the day. And we also know that care giving in day \ncare is occurring at a critical moment in that child's development. \nSeventy-five percent of the human brain is developed in the first 18 \nmonths on Earth. Most of the day care centers I visited would not \naccept a child until they had reached the age of 2 or until they were \nout of diapers. And so for the first 2 years of critical brain \ndevelopment in these children it was a gamble. Was there someone nearby \nthat could be counted on, a neighbor or relative, perhaps some other \nsetting where the child would get honest, good, safe care?\n\n  What the President has proposed in his State of the Union Address and \nI hope that Democrats and Republicans can debate is what we can do to \nhelp working families provide for quality child care. I honestly \nbelieve that the investment in early childhood development is the best \ninvestment this Nation can make. You often wonder how a child born in \nordinary or even poor circumstances has much of a chance. They usually \nhave a chance if they have loving parents with the skills and the time \nand the resources to make their living meaningful. I came from a family \nof modest means but, thank goodness, had a mother and father who cared, \nand I think that is why I am standing here today.\n  But for a lot of kids that option is strained because a lot of \nparents do not have resources, and as a consequence they look around in \nthe system and find precious few alternatives. First, most child care \nis expensive. It is expensive for families that are trying to get by \nand trying to pay the bills.\n  What the President has suggested is that we, through money raised in \nthe tobacco bill, send those revenues back to States to make available \nto working families. So that those families that are out struggling, \ntrying to get by will have a helping hand from the Government to pay \nfor child care. I think that is money well spent, and there is no two \nways about it.\n  Secondly, we have to ask who will work in these child care centers. \nIt is a fact of life that most of the people working there receive \nprecious more than the minimum wage, and they look for alternatives. \nThe turnover rate nationally is 40 percent and in some communities even \nhigher each year as child care workers move on to another job.\n  In Illinois, we demand of these workers 2 years of college education \nand then give them a minimum wage. High school dropouts are paid a \nminimum wage. These students who stayed in school and worked hard to \npass the courses are basically being asked to work for the same. Then, \nof course, we know that businesses that invest in child care really do \nbond with their employees. Employees value this as one of the most \nimportant benefits of work.\n  So the President has said not only money to help families pay for \nchild\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\ncare, also some resources to make certain we can help the students who \nwant to get the education, qualify to be child care assistants but \nencouragement as well in the Tax Code to businesses to set up child \ncare centers.\n  Each day, three out of five children under the age of 6 in America \nincluding almost half of the babies and toddlers spend some or all of \ntheir day being cared for by someone other than their parents. In my \nhome State, we estimate about 600,000 children each day under the age \nof 6 are in child care. The cost--$4,000 to $10,000 a year. Think about \na person struggling by on a low-wage job and facing $4,000--$80 a \nweek--that has to be out of pocket and paid for child care.\n  In our agenda, the Democratic agenda, we set out to change this, to \ntry to make certain that working families are given a helping hand.\n  I have tried to reflect about the course of history when it comes to \ncaring for children in America. We all remember child labor laws and \nthings that have been done to help kids, but in the 19th century we \nmade the most significant decision when we said in America that we \nwould embark on creating a system of public education so that if you \nhappened to be a child from a family of modest means you still had a \nfighting chance. America cared and America made a commitment through \nthe State and local units of Government to make certain that public \neducation would be there starting at the age of 6 and it was a sensible \ncommitment, not only for the good of the child but the good of the \nNation.\n  Here today as we embark on the 21st century we know so much more. We \nknow that by the age of 6 many children have gone through important \nformative years, many children have been trained, for good or bad, and \nthat that training is going to be part of that child for years to come.\n  So what more can we do? What more should we do? We have created a \nHead Start program which is designed to give these kids, at least those \nfrom 3 to 5, a chance to have a structured, positive learning \nenvironment. It is a very good program and one that needs to be funded \nat higher levels. But now we know even more is needed. Are we ready in \nthis Chamber, Democrats and Republicans alike, to really engage in a \nnational debate about whether the model for the 19th century of public \neducation is adequate for the 21st century for America?\n  Most educators, if they give you an honest appraisal, will say, if \nthey were given the option of one additional year of mandatory \neducation, they would not put it after high school, they would put it \nbefore kindergarten. Bring the children in earlier.\n\n  Talk to teachers, if you will, who are in classrooms every day. They \ncan identify kids who come from a good family and home, where one \nparent stayed home to help raise the child or they went through some \ngood child care and received the right training, and they can identify \nthose kids who did not. Some of them fall behind, never to catch up. So \none of the things we are striving for this year is to follow the \nPresident's lead and make sure we make a commitment here in the Senate \nand the House of Representatives to help these families.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is now recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might ask unanimous consent to have 5 \nadditional minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for yielding this \ntime.\n  Crucial to this question of providing help for child care is \nproviding the revenue. I find it curious that a year ago, in my first \nyear in the Senate, if you would have come to this Chamber about this \ntime, you would have seen Senator Orrin Hatch, our colleague from Utah, \nstanding at that desk with a stack of budget books almost up over his \nhead, saying this is the legacy of deficits, these are the unbalanced \nbudgets that we cannot come to grips with, and arguing for the passage \nof a new constitutional amendment to force us to come to balance in our \nbudget. That was a year ago. That amendment did not pass.\n  A year later, where are we? We are at a point where the Congressional \nBudget Office gave us their forecast yesterday that, indeed, we would \nbalance the budget. We have reached the point where the budget is in \nbalance. Ironically, instead of talking about a constitutional \namendment to force a balanced budget, we are now engaged in a debate \nabout spending a surplus. Imagine, 12 months later we have gone from \ndeficit talk to surplus talk. The President counsels us to be patient, \nto make sure the surplus is true and honest and to first dedicate it to \nSocial Security.\n  So, of course, you are going to say, ``Senator Durbin, having said \nthat, how are you going to pay for child care? How will the President \npay for it? These are good ideas, but they have to be paid for.''\n  The money is to come from the tobacco bill. This is a bill I have \nsupported both as introduced by Senator Kennedy and yesterday by \nSenator Conrad, because it is a bill which addresses the reality of \nwhat we face today with tobacco. This bill imposes a $1.50 health fee \non each package of cigarettes. We know that discourages kids from \nbuying them. They are too expensive. It takes the revenues from that to \nnot only educate young people about the dangers of smoking but also to \nuse it for other good purposes: for example, to increase the number of \npublic school teachers across America to 100,000 so that no child in \nthe first, second or third grade will have a classroom with more than \n18 students, or to put money into medical research.\n\n  Let me tell you that has to be the most widely popular Federal \nexpenditure there is. Not a family touched by cancer, heart disease, \ndiabetes, HIV, would ever suggest that that is not a good investment, \nto put the money into medical research. But, also, a portion of it for \nchild care.\n  So, in order to make this work, it is not enough for us, as Democrats \nand Republicans, to make speeches about child care. We have to roll up \nour sleeves and pass this tobacco legislation, and we have to do it on \na bipartisan basis. The tobacco companies will resist us every step of \nthe way. They have. They will continue to. But I think the American \npeople have decided they have had enough of the tobacco companies and \nthe fact that they have had unreasonable sway over Washington for too \nlong a period of time.\n  This year, 1998, is a year of political testing for Senators and \nCongressmen as to whether they will rise to the challenge and join in \npassing tobacco legislation, reducing the scourge of children who are \ntaking up smoking, and raising revenues for things that are critically \nimportant for America's future--like child care.\n  I am happy to support the legislation that has been introduced, and I \nhope that we come up with bipartisan approval to make sure that it is \npassed. It is not just a question of raising this revenue, but the core \nreason for the tobacco legislation is to discourage the young Americans \neach day who take up smoking. Today in the United States of America, \nand every single day this year, 3,000 children will start smoking \ncigarettes for the first time. I have never, repeat never, met a parent \nwho has said to me, ``I got the best news last night. My son came home \nand announced he started smoking.'' I have never heard that. In fact, \njust the opposite. Parents are concerned because they know this is a \nhealth concern.\n  Tobacco companies have deceived the public. They have deceived \nCongress. They have gone after kids for decades. Now we have a chance \nto call an end to that and to hold these companies accountable to \nreduce sales to minors and to make certain that our kids have a \nfighting chance for a bright future.\n  So, I will conclude by saying our agenda is filled this year. We may \nhave more items on the agenda than they have days in session. But we \nneed to pick and choose those that are critically important. I hope my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, will agree that passing \nthe tobacco bill is the first important step, then taking the revenues \nfrom that to help working families bring their children up under the \nbest circumstances and to give these children a fighting chance to \nenter school ready to learn and to have a bright future.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n\n[[Page S692]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, as many of my colleagues may already be \naware, in a decision announced today by Judge Thomas F. Hogan of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia, the Line \nItem Veto Act has been found to be unconstitutional, an \nunconstitutional delegation of the Congress' power over the purse. \nWhile I congratulate each of the plaintiffs and their attorneys, this \nvictory does not belong to them alone. This is a victory for the \nAmerican people. It is their Constitution, it is their Republic, and \ntheir liberties that have been made more secure.\n  Judge Hogan's opinion parallels a previous decision by Judge Thomas \nPenfield Jackson, also for the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia, in Byrd v. Raines, as well as the opinions expressed by \nSupreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens in that same earlier case. \nWhile I fully expect this decision today to be appealed and I, \ntherefore, recognize this as a first step, I nevertheless regard it as \nan important step.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to take just a few \nmoments to read pertinent excerpts from Judge Hogan's decision. I read \nnow, beginning with that section titled ``Procedural Requirements of \nArticle I.''\n  I continue to read from Judge Hogan's opinion:\n\n       The Constitution carefully prescribes certain formal \n     procedures that must be observed in the enactment of laws. \n     The Line Item Veto Act impermissibly attempts to alter these \n     constitutional requirements through mere legislative action. \n     Because the act violates Article I's ``single, finely wrought \n     and exhaustively considered, procedure,'' . . . it is \n     unconstitutional.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Both Houses of Congress, through a process of discussion \n     and compromise, had agreed upon the exact content of the \n     Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act. These laws \n     reflected the best judgment of both Houses. The laws that \n     resulted after the President's line item veto were different \n     from those consented to by both Houses of Congress. There is \n     no way of knowing whether these laws, in their truncated \n     form, would have received the requisite support from both the \n     House and the Senate. Because the laws that emerged after the \n     Line Item Veto are not the same laws that proceeded through \n     the legislative process, as required, the resulting laws are \n     not valid.\n       Furthermore, the President violated the requirements of \n     Article I when he unilaterally canceled provisions of duly \n     enacted statutes. Unilateral action by any single participant \n     in the law-making process is precisely what the Bicameralism \n     and Presentment Clauses were designed to prevent. Once a bill \n     becomes law, it can only be repealed or amended through \n     another, independent legislative enactment, which itself must \n     conform with the requirements of Article I. Any rescissions \n     must be agreed upon by a majority of both Houses of Congress. \n     The President cannot single-handedly revise the work of the \n     other two participants in the lawmaking process, as he did \n     here when he vetoed certain provisions of these statutes.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Whatever defendants wish to call the President's action, it \n     has every mark of a veto.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Finally, Congress' ``indirect attempt[] to accomplish what \n     the Constitution prohibits . . . accomplishing directly'' \n     cannot stand. . . . ``To argue otherwise is to suggest that \n     the Framers spent significant time and energy in debating and \n     crafting Clauses that could be easily evaded.'' Congress knew \n     that a single Line Item Veto, performed prior to the \n     President's signature, would violate Article I's requirement \n     that the president sign or return the bills in toto. This \n     limitation on the President has been clear since George \n     Washington's tenure.\n\n  Let me quote the words of George Washington as they are quoted in \nJudge Hogan's opinion:\n\n     (``From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all \n     the parts of a Bill, or reject it in toto.'') Congress cannot \n     evade this long-accepted requirement by merely changing the \n     timing of the President's cancellation.\n       Because the Line Item Veto Act produced laws in violation \n     of the requirement of bicameral passage, because it permitted \n     the President unilaterally to repeal or amend duly enacted \n     laws, and because it impermissibly attempts to evade the \n     requirement that the President sign or reject a bill in toto, \n     the Act violates the requirements of Article I. For that \n     reason alone, the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional.\n\n  Now, under the heading ``Separation of Powers,'' in Judge Hogan's \nopinion, I find these words, and I quote from his opinion:\n\n       Furthermore, the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional \n     because it impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among \n     the three branches of government. The separation of powers \n     into three coordinate branches is central to the principles \n     on which this country was founded. . . . The declared purpose \n     of separating and dividing the powers of government was to \n     ``diffuse power the better to secure liberty.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Pursuant to the doctrine of separated powers, certain \n     functions are divided between the legislative and executive \n     branches. Article I, section I vests all legislative \n     authority in Congress. Legislative power is the authority to \n     make laws[,]\n\nSays Judge Hogan.\n\n     Executive power, on the other hand, is to ``take Care that \n     the Laws be faithfully executed.''\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       With regard to lawmaking, the President's function is \n     strictly a negative one: to veto a bill in its entirety.\n       While it is Congress' duty to make laws, Congress can \n     delegate certain rulemaking authority to other branches, as \n     long as that delegation is appropriate to the duties of that \n     branch. (``[T]he lawmaking function belongs to Congress . . . \n     and may not be conveyed to another branch or entity.'');\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Line Item Veto Act impermissibly crosses the line \n     between acceptable delegations of rulemaking authority and \n     unauthorized surrender to the President of an inherently \n     legislative function, namely, the authority to permanently \n     shape laws and package legislation. The Act----\n\n  Writes Judge Hogan,\n\n     enables the President, in his discretion, to pick and choose \n     among portions of an enacted law to determine which ones will \n     remain valid. The Constitution, however, dictates that once a \n     bill becomes law, the President's sole duty is to ``take care \n     that the laws be faithfully executed.'' His power\n\n  Writes Judge Hogan,\n\n     cannot expand to that of ``co-designer'' of the law--that is \n     Congress' domain. Any subsequent amendment of a statute falls \n     under Congress' responsibility to legislate. The President \n     cannot take this duty upon himself; nor can Congress \n     relinquish that power to the Executive Branch.\n\n  I shall not quote further excerpts from the opinion of Judge Hogan, \nbut I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the entire \nopinion, following the remarks of Mr. Moynihan and my remarks. I \nunderstand the Government Printing Office estimates it will cost $1,532 \nto print this opinion in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, next Monday is the official observance of \nthe birthday of our first President, George Washington, who so wisely \nobserved, as did Judge Hogan, ``From the nature of the Constitution, I \nmust approve all the parts of a bill or reject it in toto.'' How right \nGeorge Washington was! I can think of no greater tribute to his wisdom \nthan this decision today.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my distinguished colleague who joined in \npreparing the amicus and who has, all the way from the beginning of \nthese debates, which have gone on for years now, stood like the Irish \noak in opposition to giving the President of the United States--any \nPresident, Republican or Democrat--a line-item veto.\n  I salute my friend, and I am very grateful to him for the work that \nhe has done and for his constant support and leadership as we have \nstood together with Senator Carl Levin, who cannot be here today \nbecause he is in Europe. If Senator Moynihan had been at the \nConstitutional Convention, even though Judge Yates and Mr. Lansing left \nthe Convention early, leaving only Alexander Hamilton to sign that \ngreat document, Senator Moynihan would have been there to attach his \nsignature. And not only that, he would have joined with Hamilton and \nMadison and Jay in writing one of the greatest documents of all time, \nthe Federalist Papers. I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is an honor to speak following the \nstatement by our revered, sometime President pro tempore, Robert C. \nByrd of West Virginia, a man who has brought to our Chamber a \nsensibility concerning the Constitution that, I would argue, is \nunequaled since those awful days that led to the Civil War, days in\n\n[[Page S693]]\n\nwhich his lucidity and courage could have produced a very different \noutcome.\n  We have a matter before us of equal consequence. I would offer the \npersonal judgment that in the history of the Constitution, there has \nnever come before us an issue considering the relations between the \nexecutive and the legislative branches as important as this one. It is \na course of a peculiar inexplicability that this Chamber is empty--the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer from Utah, our President pro tempore \nsometime from West Virginia and myself--empty because of a particular \npolitics that for a long time said this was a desirable measure and \nenacted it and now faces the court saying, ``But it's \nunconstitutional.''\n  The courts, I dare to say, at the level of those asides that are well \nknown in our judicial history, the court is also saying, ``Don't you \nknow your Constitution? Don't you understand what is at stake for \nyou?'' The courts are not themselves directly involved here, but they \nare trying to tell us, in brilliant decisions by Judge Jackson, now by \nJudge Hogan, singularly literate decisions.\n  Judge Hogan begins his historical analysis, if you will, with a \ncitation from Gibbon's ``Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'':\n\n       The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably \n     lost when the legislative power is nominated by the \n     executive.\n\n  That is how he saw the decline of the Roman Senate, inexorably \nfollowed by the decline of Roman civilization. That is what we are \ndealing with here today.\n  As Senator Byrd has so forcefully stated, George Washington, whose \nbirthday we observe on Monday, who presided over the Constitutional \nConvention, in his later writings put it as explicitly as only he could \ndo with that clarity and simplicity he had. Washington said:\n\n       From the nature of the Constitution, I must approve all the \n     parts of a Bill or reject it in toto.\n\n  That could not be more plain. And we find the courts saying to us--I \ndon't presume to say this is obiter dicta, but I can see the courts \npleading: ``Senators, do you not know what is at stake?''\n  As for the claims of efficiency and economy and this and that--\nlegitimate claims--but the court refers in this particular decision, \nJudge Hogan refers to a wonderful passage from Chadha, which was so \ntrue about the original understandings of the political and Government \nprocess of the founders. He said in the Immigration and Naturalization \nService v. Chadha, a decision in 1983--as I recall, it is on the one-\nHouse veto--the court said:\n\n       The fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, \n     convenient and useful in facilitating functions of government \n     standing alone will not save it if it is contrary to \n     the Constitution. Convenience and efficiency are not the \n     primary objectives or the hallmarks of democratic \n     government.\n\n  That was the great perception of our founders. In the Federalist \nPapers, which Senator Byrd has so generously mentioned, they ask \nopenly, given the fugitive and turbulent existence of earlier \nrepublics, the Roman Republic, what makes you think this Republic will \nwork?\n  They said, fair question, but we have a new science of politics. It \nis a science that does not assume virtue in men, it assumes conflict, \nand it provides for the resolution of conflict by equal and opposing \nforces. It does not fear debate. It welcomes it, it assumes self-\ninterest on the part of regions, of sectors in the economy, of groups \nin the population. No fear.\n  And here is a central idea which was part of our amicus brief and \nwhich we find, I think, echoed in Judge Hogan's remarks, which I don't \nassert but I offer the thought. When we put together on the Senate \nfloor a bill--I will say a Finance Committee bill, as I am now ranking \nmember, was one time chairman of Finance--we think of balancing \ninterests, conflicting or often unrelated, but there are 100 Members of \nthis Chamber. They represent 50 States and 550 different points of \nview. We accommodate them. We provide for this interest and for that \ninterest and hope and, I think, in the main see that the public \ninterest is served by the opportunities of governing.\n  If you were to take one of those provisions out or two or three, it \nwould be quite possible you would not have the votes to pass the bill. \nThere could be a filibuster, or there simply could not be the 51 votes.\n  However, with the line-item veto, the President can subsequently take \nout such provisions such that the statute books will contain a law \nwhich never could have passed the U.S. Congress.\n   How say we, the statute books will have a law that could not have \npassed the Congress? Here it is, this is the arrangement. The courts \nare so clear on this, and I so look forward to a final decision by the \nSupreme Court.\n  It is interesting, if I may say, just to give an illustration of the \ncompound interests of people involved, on the one hand we have two \nplaintiffs here, the City of New York, et al. The City of New York \nbeing the Greater New York Hospital Association, those great hospitals \nand the union of hospital employees which work there. The city, great \nscience centers, ordinary persons who clean floors and care for \npatients. They are one group.\n\n  Across the continent, another group, the Snake River Potato Growers, \nIncorporated--about 30 farmers. They grow potatoes. They have an \ninterest. It was in a bill, and it was taken out. That interest, I \nthink, would have had real effect on the decision how to vote of the \ntwo Senators in this Chamber who represent those potato growers.\n  So you have radiologists and potato growers and people who scrub \nfloors and people who go beyond the limits of conceivable knowledge in \nthe biological and medical sciences. All these interests are always \nrepresented here, and only here.\n  Congress makes the laws. The President is required to see that they \nare faithfully executed. But, sir, and in closing, if nothing else will \nbring this Chamber to its wits, perhaps this will. The President's \npower under this line-item veto is likely rarely to be directly \nexercised. It will be threatened.\n  A President will say to a Senator, ``You know, I would so very much \nlike to be of assistance to Utah as regards irrigation and other \nmatters which are so important to me, but there's a foreign policy \nmatter which also is important to me. And cannot I expect, in the \nspirit of exchange and understanding, that I will have your support \nhere in return for my choice not to veto a measure now enacted by \nCongress?'' It will go on over and over again. It is the formula for \nexecutive tyranny.\n  Sir, within this day, one of the most learned, experienced men I know \nin Washington said, ``If LBJ,'' meaning Lyndon B. Johnson, ``had had \nthis power, we would have had Nero.'' I mean no disrespect; I was a \nmember of President Johnson's subcabinet, and served him as well as I \ncould do. But you have to have experienced Lyndon Johnson close up, \nwithout this power, to know what the powers of persuasion of a \nPresident can be.\n  But given this power, you produce an imbalance in your constitutional \nsystem which the founders pleaded with us not to do. They produced a \nsystem that has worked well. We are the oldest continuous \nconstitutional government on Earth. If we wish to change the \nConstitution there is a way to do that, too, but not through statute. \nAnd that is what the court has now for the second time ruled, and I \nhope that the Supreme Court will agree.\n  I would particularly like to thank Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New \nYork, who stepped right up to this issue when many people suggested he \nnot do. And most particularly, to the counsel who have served us pro \nbono so well: Michael Davidson; Charles J. Cooper; Paul A. Crotty, \nformer Corporation Counsel of the City of New York; Louis R. Cohen, \nLloyd N. Cutler, Alan Morrison. And finally, sir, any number of \nprofessors of law have offered their counsel. Most particularly \nLaurence H. Tribe, of the Harvard Law School, and Michael J. Gerhardt, \nthe dean of Case Western Reserve Law, have been unstinting in their \nwillingness to advise us in a matter they consider just as important as \nwe do.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for its courtesy. I thank my leader, \nmy beloved and revered leader, Senator Byrd.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S694]]\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n [United States District Court for the District of Columbia, Civ.

Before reaching \n     the constitutional challenge, however, the Court must first \n     conclude that it has jurisdiction to hear the case, by \n     determining that Plaintiffs in this action have Article III \n     standing.

The \n     Line Item Veto Act therefore is unconstitutional.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of exhibit.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                             I. Background\n\n     A. The Line Item Veto Act \\2\\\n       Unable to control its voracious appetite for ``pork,'' \n     Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Line \n     Item Veto Act. Pub. L. No. 104-130, 110 Stat. 1200 (1996).\\3\\ \n     The Act is designed as an amendment to, and an enhancement \n     of, Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \n     Control Act of 1974 (``ICA''). 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 681 et seq. \n     The ICA authorized the President to defer spending of \n     Congressional appropriations during the course of a fiscal \n     year or other period of availability, as long as Congress \n     intended for those appropriations to be permissive rather \n     than mandatory. Id. The President also could propose the \n     total rescission of an appropriation to Congress, but unless \n     Congress approved the rescission, the President was obligated \n     to release the funds. Id. Sec. Sec. 683(b), 688. Because it \n     generally failed to make the rescissions recommended by the \n     President, Congress found this arrangement to be an \n     unsatisfactory mechanism for controlling deficit spending.\\4\\\n       As large deficits persisted, Congress considered various \n     amendments to the ICA to alleviate its perceived defects. One \n     proposal, called ``expedited rescission,'' would amend the \n     ICA to streamline the process for Congressional approval of \n     rescissions proposed by the President. See e.g., H.R. 2164, \n     102d Cong. (1991). Other proposals included amending the \n     Constitution to give the President a line item veto, see \n     e.g., H.R.J. Res. 6, 104th Cong. (1995); H.R.J. Res. 4, 103d \n     Cong. (1993), or adopting a congressional procedure for \n     presenting each spending provision to the President as a \n     separate bill, for approval or veto. See, e.g., S. 137, \n     104th Cong. (1995); S. 238, 104th Cong. (1995). Congress \n     settled on an ``enhanced rescission'' proposal, codified \n     in the Line Item Veto Act, that makes Executive \n     rescissions automatic in defined circumstances, subject to \n     congressional disapproval. By making appropriations \n     ``conditional'' during the period in which the President \n     has authority to veto provisions, and ``by placing the \n     onus on Congress to overturn the President's cancellation \n     of spending and limited tax benefits,'' H.R. Conf. Rep. \n     No. 104-491, at 16 (1996), the Line Item Veto Act reverses \n     the appropriation presumptions under the 1CA.\n       The Line Item Veto Act gives the President the authority to \n     ``cancel in whole,'' at any time within five days (excluding \n     Sundays) after signing a bill into law, (1) ``any dollar \n     amount of discretionary budget authority;'' (2) ``any item of \n     new direct spending;'' and (3) ``any limited tax benefit.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 691a (1997).\n       A ``dollar amount of discretionary budget authority'' is \n     defined as ``the entire dollar amount of budget authority'' \n     that is specified in the text of an appropriations law or \n     found in the tables, charts, or explanatory text of \n     statements or committee reports accompanying a bill. Id. at \n     Sec. 691e(7). An ``item of new direct spending'' is a \n     specific provision that will result in ``an increase in \n     budget authority or outlays'' for entitlements, food stamps, \n     or other specified programs. Id. at Sec. Sec. 691e(8), \n     691e(5). A ``limited tax benefit'' is a revenue-losing \n     provision that gives tax relief to 100 or fewer beneficiaries \n     in any fiscal year, or a tax provision that ``provides \n     temporary or permanent transitional relief for ten or fewer \n     beneficiaries in any fiscal year'' \\5\\ Id. at Sec. 691e(9).\n       With respect to any dollar amount of discretionary budget \n     authority, the Act defines ``cancel'' as ``to rescind.'' Id. \n     Sec. 691e(4)(A). Cancellation of an item of new direct \n     spending or a limited tax benefit prevents it from having \n     ``legal force or effect.'' Id. at Sec. 691e(4)(B). Canceled \n     funds may not be used for any purpose other than deficit \n     reduction. Id. at Sec. Sec. 691c(a)-(b).\n       To exercise cancellation authority, the President must \n     submit a ``special message'' to Congress within five calendar \n     days of signing a bill containing the item being canceled. \n     Id. at Sec. 691a(c)(1). The President's special message must \n     set forth the reasons for the cancellation; the President's \n     estimate of the ``fiscal, economic, and budgetary effect'' of \n     the cancellation; an estimate of ``the . . . effect of the \n     cancellation upon the objects, purposes and programs for \n     which the canceled authority was provided;'' and the \n     geographic distribution of the canceled spending. Id. at \n     Sec. 691a(b). The President may exercise this authority only \n     after determining that doing so will ``(i) reduce the Federal \n     budget deficit; (ii) not impair any essential Government \n     functions; and (iii) not harm the national interest.'' Id. at \n     Sec. 691(a)(A).\n       A cancellation takes effect upon Congress' receipt of the \n     President's special message. Id. at Sec. 691b(a). Congress \n     can restore a canceled item by passing a ``disapproval \n     bill,'' which is not subject to the President's Line Item \n     Veto authority, but is subject to the veto provisions \n     detailed in Article I. Id. Disapproval bills must comport \n     with the requirements prescribed in Article I, section 7, \n     although the Line Item Veto Act provides for expedited \n     consideration of these bills. Id. at Sec. Sec. 691e(6), \n     692(c). If a disapproval bill is enacted into law, the \n     President's cancellation is nullified and the canceled \n     items become effective. Id. at Sec. 691b(a).\n       In terms of judicial review, the Line Item Veto Act \n     provides that ``[a]ny member of Congress or any individual \n     adversely affected . . . may bring an action in the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia, for \n     declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on the ground that \n     any provision of [the Act] violates the Constitution.'' Id. \n     at Sec. 692(a)(1). The Act provides for direct appeal to the \n     Supreme Court and directs both Courts ``to expedite to the \n     greatest possible extent the disposition of any matter \n     brought under [this provision.]'' Id. at 692(b)-(c).\n     B. Factual Background in New York City v. Clinton\n       The City of New York plaintiffs consist of the City itself, \n     two hospital associations (Greater New York Hospital \n     Association, or GNYHA, and New York City Health and Hospitals \n     Corporation, or NYCHHC), one hospital (the Jamaica Hospital \n     Medical Center), and two unions that represent health care \n     employees (District Council 37, American Federation of State, \n     County and Municipal Employees and Local 1199, National \n     Health and Human Service Employees).\n       The City of New York Plaintiffs' claims arise out of a \n     dispute over Federal Medicaid payments to the State of New \n     York. The Health Care Financing Administration of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services (``HCFA'') provides \n     federal financial participation (``FFP'') to match certain \n     state Medicaid expenditures. (See Brown Decl., Defs.' Ex. 1 \n     at para.3.) The FFP provided by the Federal Medicaid program \n     to match state expenditures is reduced by the revenue that \n     the state receives from health care related taxes. Id. at \n     para.4. The FFP is not reduced, however, by tax revenue that \n     meets specific criteria, including that the taxes are \n     ``broad-based'' (i.e., applied to all health care providers \n     within the same class) and ``uniform'' (i.e., applied equally \n     to all taxed providers). Id.\n       New York State taxes its health care providers and uses \n     this tax revenue to pay for health care for the poor. (See \n     Wang Decl., Pls.' Ex. 2 at para.4.) The State exempts certain \n     revenues (e.g., those derived from particular charities) of \n     some health care providers (e.g., the plaintiff health care \n     providers) from the health care provider tax. (See van Leer \n     Decl., Pls.' Ex. 3 at para.3.) That is, New York exempts \n     plaintiff health care providers from taxes that other health \n     care providers must pay.\n       On December 19, 1994, HCFA notified New York State that 19 \n     of its tax programs violated HCFA's requirements. (See Dear \n     State Medicaid Director Letter, Pls.' Ex. 2D.) Since then, \n     New York has submitted over 60 waiver applications to HCFA, \n     which to date have neither been approved nor denied. (See \n     Wang Decl., at para.7.) A finding by HCFA that a State's \n     taxes are impermissible effects a disallowance of the State's \n     Medicaid expenditures and allows HCFA to recoup the matching \n     funds that it has already paid to the State. Id. at para.6. \n     If HCFA denies a waiver request, the State may appeal the \n     denial to the Departmental Appeals Board. (See Brown Decl. at \n     para.6.)\n       If HCFA ultimately deems New York's taxes impermissible, \n     New York State law provides that those health care providers \n     that were previously excluded from the taxes must pay them \n     retroactively. (See Wang Decl. at para.8.) For example, \n     NYCHHC's tax liability is estimated to be more than $4 \n     million for each year at issue. In total, $2.6 billion may be \n     subject to recoupment from New York State. Id. at \n     para.para.7-8.\n       The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Pub. L. No. 105-33, \n     included a provision, section 4722(c), that would have \n     alleviated this exposure to liability. It established that \n     New York State expenditures derived from certain health care \n     provider taxes qualified for FFP under the Medicaid program. \n     Id. at para. 9. This section signified that New York State \n     would not have to return the funds in question to HCFA; for \n     Plaintiffs, it meant that they were relieved of their \n     liability to New York State should HCFA deny New York's \n     waiver requests.\n       The President signed the Balanced Budget Act into law on \n     August 5, 1997. Six days later, he identified section 4722(c) \n     as an item of new direct spending and canceled it, thus \n     reinstating Plaintiffs' exposure to liability. Cancellation \n     No. 97-3, 62 Fed. Reg. 43,263 (1997). The President adopted \n     the Congressional Budget Office's estimate that the \n     cancellation of section 4722(c) would reduce the federal \n     deficit by $200 million in FY 1998. Id.\n\n[[Page S695]]\n\n     C. Factual Background in Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. v. \n         Rubin\n       Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. is, according to \n     Plaintiffs, an ``eligible farmers' cooperative'' within the \n     meaning of section 968 of the Taxpayer Relief Act. (See \n     Cranney Decl., Pls.' Ex. 2 at para. 9.) Its membership \n     consists of approximately 30 potato growers located \n     throughout Idaho, who each owns shares of the cooperative. \n     Plaintiff Mike Cranney, a potato grower with farms located in \n     Idaho, is a member, Director and Vice Chairman of the \n     cooperative. Id. at para. 2. Snake River was formed in May \n     1997 to assist Idaho potato growers in marketing their crops \n     and stabilizing prices, in part though a strategy of \n     acquiring potato processing facilities. Id. at para. 9. These \n     facilities allow individual growers to aggregate their crops \n     and process and deliver them to market jointly. Furthermore, \n     they allow members to retain revenues formerly paid out to \n     third-party processors. Id. at para. 13.\n       On August 5, 1997, the President signed into law the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act, Pub. L. No. 105-34, 111 Stat. 788 \n     (``TRA''). Section 968 of the TRA amended the Internal \n     Revenue Code to allow the owner of the stock of a qualified \n     agricultural refiner or processor to defer recognition of \n     capital gains on the sale of such stock to an eligible \n     farmers' cooperative. That is, it would have allowed a \n     processor to sell its facilities to an eligible cooperative \n     without paying tax currently on any capital gain. The stated \n     purpose of section 968 was to aid farmers' cooperatives in \n     the purchase of processing and refining facilities.\\6\\ (See \n     Dear Colleague Letter by Reps. Roberts and Stenholm of 12/1/\n     95, Pls.' Ex. 5.) On August 11, 1997, the President \n     identified this provision as a ``limited tax benefit,'' \n     within the meaning of the Line Item Veto Act, and canceled \n     it. Cancellation No. 97-2, 62 Fed. Reg. 43,267 (1997). In his \n     cancellation message, the President estimated that sellers \n     could have used section 968 to defer paying $98 million in \n     taxes over the next five years, and $155 million over the \n     next ten. Id.\n       Snake River had actively pursued at least one transaction \n     that could have taken advantage of section 968. In May 1997, \n     when Congress initially was considering the proposals in \n     section 968, Mike Cranney and another officer of Snake River \n     discussed with Howard Phillips, a principal owner of Idaho \n     Potato Packers (``IPP''), the purchase by Snake River of the \n     stock of a company that owned an IPP potato processing \n     facility in Blackfoot, Idaho. (See Cranney Decl. at para. \n     19.) Plaintiffs contend that this company would have been a \n     ``qualified processor'' under section 968 and that a deal \n     with Phillips could have been structured so as to comply with \n     all requirements of section 968. Id. at para.para. 21-\n     23. Plaintiffs maintain that Phillips was interested in \n     pursuing the sale because he could defer taxes on his gain \n     if section 968 passed. Id. at para. 23. The negotiations \n     did not continue after the President canceled section 968. \n     Id. at para. 24.\n\n                           II. Justiciability\n\n       Before tackling the merits of this case, the Court must \n     first determine whether it has jurisdiction to hear it. Under \n     Article III, section 2 of the Constitution, the federal \n     courts have jurisdiction over a dispute only if it is a \n     ``case'' or ``controversy.'' See Raines v. Byrd, 117 S.Ct. \n     2312 (1997). The Supreme Court has regarded the case or \n     controversy prerequisite as a ``bedrock requirement'' and has \n     observed that ``[n]o principle is more fundamental to the \n     judiciary's proper role in our system of government than the \n     constitutional limitation of federal-court jurisdiction to \n     actual cases or controversies.'' Id. citing Valley Forge \n     Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of \n     Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 471 (1982).\n       The central jurisdictional requirement that controls the \n     analysis of these consolidated cases is the doctrine of \n     standing. The Supreme Court has emphasized that the standing \n     inquiry is ``especially rigorous when reaching the merits of \n     the dispute would force us to decide whether an action taken \n     by one of the other two branches of the Federal Government \n     was unconstitutional.'' Raines, 117 S.Ct. at 2317-18. It has \n     cautioned,\n\n     ``the law of Art. III standing is built on a single basic \n     idea--the idea of separation of powers.'' In the light of \n     this overriding and time-honored concern about keeping the \n     Judiciary's power within its proper constitutional sphere, we \n     must put aside the natural urge to proceed directly to the \n     merits of this important dispute and to `settle' it for the \n     sake of convenience and efficiency.\n\n     It is with these admonitions soundly in mind that this Court \n     proceeds with its standing analysis regarding the plaintiffs \n     now before it.\n     A. Standing\n       While the Supreme Court has candidly acknowledged that \n     ``the concept of `Article III Standing' has not been defined \n     with complete consistency in all of the various cases decided \n     by this Court which have discussed it.'' \\7\\ Valley Forge \n     Christian College, 454 U.S. at 475, certain basic principles \n     have been distilled from the Court's decisions:\n\n     To establish an Art. III case or controversy, a litigant \n     first must clearly demonstrate that he has suffered an \n     ``injury in fact.'' That injury, we have emphasized \n     repeatedly, must be concrete in both a qualitative and \n     temporal sense. The complainant must allege an injury to \n     himself that is ``distinct and palpable,'' as opposed to \n     merely ``abstract,'' and the alleged harm must be actual or \n     imminent, not ``conjectural'' or ``hypothetical.'' Further, \n     the litigant must satisfy the ``causation'' and \n     ``redressability'' prongs of the Art. III minima by showing \n     that the injury ``fairly can be traced to the challenged \n     action'' and ``is likely to be redressed by a favorable \n     decision.'' The litigant must clearly and specifically set \n     forth facts sufficient to satisfy these Art. III standing \n     requirements. A federal court is powerless to create its own \n     jurisdiction by embellishing otherwise deficient allegations \n     of standing.\n\n       Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149 (1990) (internal \n     citations omitted). Here, the principal standing inquiry is \n     whether Plaintiffs can demonstrate sufficient injury, \n     ``actual or threatened.'' See Valley Forge Christian College, \n     454 U.S. at 472.\n       Although these plaintiffs do not neatly fit into any \n     category of plaintiffs that the Supreme Court has already \n     found to have standing, this Court finds that they meet the \n     Article III requirements. The President directly injured both \n     the City of New York plaintiffs and the Snake River \n     plaintiffs when he canceled legislation that provided a \n     benefit to them.\n       1. City of New York Plaintiffs\\8\\\n       Plaintiffs suffered an immediate, concrete injury the \n     moment that the President used the Line Item Veto to cancel \n     section 4722(c) and deprived them of the benefits of that \n     law. The Court thus finds that Plaintiffs have suffered \n     sufficient injury to have Article III standing.\n       When the President signed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     section 4722(c) became law. See La Abra Silver Mining Co. v. \n     United States, 175 U.S. 423, 454 (1899). Consequently, every \n     New York State tax program held not to meet HCFA's \n     requirements was deemed permissible by federal legislation. \n     The State's liability was eliminated and the hospitals upon \n     which that liability would fall were exonerated of their \n     burden. Plaintiffs possessed a valuable protection against \n     any liability that otherwise might befall them. This \n     protection constituted a benefit to Plaintiffs. When the \n     President canceled section 4722(c), Plaintiffs were divested \n     of the benefit conferred upon them by the legislation. In the \n     simplest terms, Plaintiffs had a benefit, and the President \n     took that benefit away. That is injury.\n       Defendants argue that, because there are still \n     administrative options available to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs \n     were not injured by the President's cancellation of this \n     legislative solution. The Court disagrees. Plaintiffs had two \n     independent avenues that they could have pursued to avoid \n     potential liability: one legislative and one administrative. \n     The legislative approach yielded complete success. The fact \n     that there are two mechanisms that could produce a result \n     does not mean that a party is not injured when one of those \n     mechanisms produces the desired result, and then that result \n     is obliterated. Analogously, if Plaintiffs were pursuing a \n     challenge to a final agency action, the fact that there might \n     also be pending legislation would not deprive them of \n     standing to challenge the final agency action. See INS v. \n     Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 936-37 (1983) (Burger, C.J.) (finding \n     that the existence of other speculative avenues of relief \n     does not constitute a prudential bar to the Court's \n     consideration of a case). The Court finds that the \n     availability of administrative relief does not eliminate \n     Plaintiff's injury in the legislative arena.\n       Plaintiffs also have shown with reasonable certainty that \n     they will be liable for millions of dollars now that Section \n     4722(c) has been canceled. Under the current law, it is \n     highly likely that the State of New York will be required to \n     return to HCFA at least some of the funds that HCFA paid to \n     the State. First of all, HCFA has already deemed the taxes \n     impermissible. HHS has stated that in the absence of \n     legislation (like Section 4277(c)), by August 1998, ``the \n     Secretary will move forward to complete the process already \n     begun to apply with full force the current law.'' (Dear State \n     Medicaid Directors Letter, Pls.' Ex. 2D.) Next, to exercise \n     Line Item Veto authority, the President was required to \n     certify that the veto would reduce the federal deficit; he \n     complied with that requirement by certifying that \n     cancellation of Section 4277(c) would result in a reduction \n     in federal outlays in FY 1998 of $200 million. Cancellation \n     No. 97-3, 62 Fed. Reg. 43,263 (1997). Finally, at a press \n     briefing on the cancellation, Office of Management and Budget \n     Director Franklin Raines described Section 4722(c) as ``a \n     provision that provided special relief to the State of New \n     York for provider taxes that had been determined by HCFA to \n     be illegal under a 1991 statute.'' (Pls.' Ex 2C (emphasis \n     added).) Raines added that ``New York will not be able'' to \n     use the taxes to increase its FFP. Id. Thus, this Court \n     concludes that it is more likely than not that the State of \n     New York will be required to refund at least some of the \n     payments it has received from HCFA.\n       Likewise, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are highly likely \n     to be required to indemnify the State for its HCFA \n     recoupments. Defendants do not dispute that New York State \n     law imposes automatic liabilities upon hospitals and nursing \n     homes upon a finding that New York's provider taxes are not \n     permissible. (See Wang Decl., Pls.' Ex. 2 at para.8). \n     Plaintiffs would avoid liability only in the unlikely event \n     that the State of New York would rescind these laws or \n     decline to enforce them. Again, the Court finds that this \n     scenario is less likely than one in which Plaintiffs are \n     required to indemnify the State.\n       Therefore, by finding that the City of New York plaintiffs \n     have demonstrated sufficient\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\n     injury, the Court concludes that they have standing to \n     challenge the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act.\n       2. Snake River Plaintiffs\n       Like the City of New York plaintiffs, the Snake River \n     plaintiffs suffered an immediate, concrete injury when the \n     President canceled section 968. Section 968 conferred a \n     benefit on Plaintiffs by putting them on equal footing with \n     investor-owned businesses. Before section 968 was passed, \n     investor-owned businesses could structure acquisitions of \n     processing facilities as tax-deferred stock-for-stock \n     exchanges. Farmers' cooperatives could not exchange their \n     stock because a cooperative's stock can be held only by its \n     members. Section 968 would have allowed sellers to defer \n     capital gains taxes on sales to farmers' co-ops, thus putting \n     co-cops in the same competitive position as investor-owned \n     businesses.\\9\\\n       The Supreme Court has held that the inability to compete on \n     an equal basis in the bidding process is injury in fact. See \n     Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated Gen. \n     Contractors of America v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656 \n     (1993). In that case, the Court found that contractors that \n     regularly bid on, and performed, construction work for the \n     City of Jacksonville, and would have bid on designated set-\n     aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed, had \n     standing, even though they failed to allege that they would \n     have been awarded a contract but for the challenged \n     ordinance. Here, regardless of whether Plaintiffs can prove \n     that they would have actually consummated purchases under \n     section 968, they are injured by the fact that section 968 \n     put them on equal footing with their competitors and its \n     cancellation disabled them from competing on an equal basis. \n     When the President canceled section 968, Plaintiffs were \n     divested of the benefit conferred upon them by the \n     legislation and therefore were concretely injured.\n       In addition, it is highly likely that the Snake River \n     plaintiffs would have been able to take advantage of the \n     benefits conferred by section 968 and that they therefore \n     will be injured by the President's cancellation of it. Snake \n     River Potato Growers, Inc. was formed for the purpose of \n     acquiring potato processing facilities. Although the sellers \n     of processing and refining facilities would be the direct \n     beneficiaries of the capital gains tax deferral, it is likely \n     that the fact that the processors would be able to defer \n     these taxes would benefit Plaintiffs in a concrete way.\\10\\ \n     For example, in a deal in which there are not other \n     prospective purchasers, even if a seller chose to completely \n     absorb the monetary benefits of the capital gains tax \n     deferral, the fact that the seller would be able to defer the \n     taxes would, at the very least, likely give Plaintiffs some \n     room to negotiate in terms of price; in a competitive \n     situation, it would allow Plaintiffs to pay a lower purchase \n     price than they would have in a scenario in which they were \n     not on equal footing with the other would-be purchasers.\\11\\\n       While Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate with certainty that \n     they would be able to take advantage of the benefits provided \n     by section 968, such certainty is not required. In Bryant v. \n     Yellen, 447 U.S. 352 (1980), for example, farm workers \n     wishing to purchase land had standing even though they could \n     not with certainty establish that they would be able to \n     purchase it. In that case, a reclamation law forbid delivery \n     of reclamation project water to any irrigable land held in \n     private ownership by one owner in excess of 160 acres. If \n     this law were enforced, owners of land in excess of 160 acres \n     would probably sell their excess acreage and would probably \n     be forced to sell at below current market prices. The Court \n     reasoned that farm workers who desired to purchase farmlands \n     in the area had standing, because it was ``unlikely'' that \n     the owners of excess lands would sell at below-market prices \n     without the law, and it was ``likely'' that excess lands \n     would become available at less than market prices if the law \n     were applied.\n       Likewise, the Snake River plaintiffs need only show that \n     the existence of section 968 would have made it more likely \n     that they could acquire processing and refining \n     facilities. As illustrated above, by putting Plaintiffs on \n     equal footing with other bidders, it is likely that \n     Plaintiffs would be able to make a purchase by offering \n     less than they would have without the benefit of section \n     968. Also, the tax deferral would, at the very least, give \n     Plaintiffs more room to negotiate in terms of price. Thus, \n     section 968 would have helped the Snake River plaintiffs \n     in their efforts to purchase processing and refining \n     facilities.\n       Defendants argue that Plaintiffs cannot meet the \n     redressability requirement of the standing doctrine. They \n     cite Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26 \n     (1976), and Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737 (1984), to support \n     their contention that there is no way for the Court to know \n     whether any sellers would be motivated by the benefits of \n     section 968 to sell to Plaintiffs. This case is \n     distinguishable from Simon and Allen, however, because here, \n     Plaintiffs have sufficiently demonstrated that if this Court \n     struck the Line Item Veto Act and reinstated section 968, \n     they would be more likely to be able to competitively bid on, \n     and prevail in purchasing, processing and refining \n     facilities.\n       In Simon, the Supreme Court determined that low-income \n     plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge a tax regulation \n     establishing the amount of free medical care that a \n     charitable hospital must provide to maintain its tax-exempt \n     status. The Supreme Court explained that it was ``purely \n     speculative'' to assume that the challenged regulation caused \n     charitable hospitals to provide less service that they would \n     otherwise provide free of charge, and it was ``equally \n     speculative'' to assume that increasing the amount of free \n     service required for tax exemption would in fact increase the \n     amount of free service provided. Simon, 426 U.S. at 42-43. \n     The Court commented that the hospitals might elect to forgo \n     favorable tax treatment to avoid the financial drain of \n     providing more free treatment.\n       In Allen, the Supreme Court concluded that parents of \n     public school children lacked standing to challenge the \n     legality of a tax exemption that benefitted racially \n     discriminatory private schools. The plaintiffs claimed that \n     the tax exemption made it easier for white children to enroll \n     in private schools, the result being that the public schools \n     were less diverse, to the plaintiffs' detriment. The Supreme \n     Court indicated that it would be ``entirely speculative'' to \n     conclude that withdrawal of the tax exemption would lead any \n     private school to change it exclusionary policies. Allen, 468 \n     U.S. at 758.\n       In both of these cases, there was arguably some \n     disincentive to the institutions' taking advantage of the tax \n     benefit. The hospitals in Simon would have to admit more non-\n     paying patients; the schools in Allen would have to admit a \n     more diverse student body, against their wishes. In these \n     cases, it may indeed have been speculative to attempt to \n     determine whether the hospitals and schools would be willing \n     to make these changes in order to take advantage of the tax \n     incentive. Here, Defendants do not allege that there is any \n     ``cost'' to the selling processors and refiners in taking \n     advantage of the tax benefits that section 968 would offer. \n     Unlike the schools and hospitals in Allen and Simon, the \n     sellers' decision likely would be a purely financial one.\n       Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs' submissions \n     regarding Mike Cranney's planned purchase of the IPP \n     processing facility are barren of facts that would \n     demonstrate whether section 968 would have had any impact on \n     that transaction, because of the specific requirements of \n     section 968.\\12\\ While the Court will not speculate as to \n     whether Cranney's deal with Phillips would have been brought \n     to fruition but for the President's cancellation of section \n     968, or even if that particular deal would have satisfied the \n     requirements of section 968, the negotiations at the very \n     least make it clear to the Court that Plaintiffs were \n     actively spending their time and money pursuing purchases and \n     that the President's cancellation of section 968 interfered \n     with those plans. Compare, Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n     504 U.S. 555 (1991) (holding that plaintiffs lacked standing \n     to challenge an environmental regulation because, although \n     plaintiffs had a desire to return to the habitat of certain \n     endangered species, they failed to present any concrete plans \n     of an actual visit).\n       The Court finds that the Snake River plaintiffs suffered an \n     injury when the President canceled Section 968. Plaintiffs \n     lost the benefit of being on equal footing with their \n     competitors and will likely have to pay more to purchase \n     processing facilities now that the sellers will not be able \n     to take advantage of section 968's tax breaks. The Court \n     therefore concludes that the Snake River plaintiffs have \n     demonstrated sufficient injury to have Article III standing.\n\n         III. Constitutional Analysis of the Line Item Veto Act\n\n       Having determined that it has jurisdiction to hear this \n     case, the Court now turns to the merits of Plaintiffs' \n     constitutional challenges. The Court begins with the \n     presumption that the Line Item Veto Act is valid. See e.g., \n     INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 944 (1983). The Chadha Court \n     cautioned, however,\n\n     The fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, \n     convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of \n     government, standing alone, will not save it if it is \n     contrary to the Constitution. Convenience and efficiency are \n     not the primary objectives--or the hallmarks--of democratic \n     government . . .\n\n     Id.\n       The Court's constitutional analysis is two-fold. First, the \n     Court examines the Line Item Veto Act in terms of the \n     procedural requirements set forth in Article I, section 7; \n     next, the Court discusses the doctrine of separation of \n     powers. The Court concludes that the Line Item Veto Act fails \n     both of these examinations.\n     A. Procedural Requirements of Article I\n       The Constitution carefully prescribes certain formal \n     procedures that must be observed in the enactment of laws. \n     The Line Item Veto Act impermissibly attempts to alter these \n     constitutional requirements through mere legislative \n     actions.\\13\\ Because the Act violates Article I's ``single, \n     finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure,'' \n     Chadha, 462 U.S. at 951, it is unconstitutional.\n       Article I, section 7 of the Constitution sets forth dual \n     requirements for the enactment of statutes: bicameral passage \n     and presentment to the President. See U.S. Const. art. I, \n     Sec. 7, cl. 2 (``Every Bill which shall have passed the House \n     of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a \n     Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If \n     he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return in . \n     . .'') (the Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses). The \n     considerations behind the Great Compromise, under which one \n     House was viewed as representing the People and the other, \n     the States, dictated that the\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n     Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses would serve essential \n     constitutional functions. ``By providing that no law could \n     take effect without the concurrence of the prescribed \n     majority of the Members of both Houses, the Framers \n     reemphasized their belief . . . that legislation should not \n     be enacted unless it has been carefully and fully considered \n     by the Nation's elected officials.'' Chadha, 462 U.S. at 948-\n     49. At the heart of the notion of bicameralism is the \n     requirement that any bill must be passed by both Houses of \n     Congress in exactly the same form.\n       The Constitution requires that both the amendment and \n     repeal of statutes also conform with these Article I \n     requirements. Chadha, 462 U.S. at 954. It makes only four \n     narrow exceptions to this single mechanism by which the \n     provisions of a law may be canceled. See U.S. Const. art. I, \n     Sec. 2, cl. 6; art. 1, Sec. 3, cl. 5; art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2; \n     art. II, Sec. 2, cl. 2. Congress may not add to this \n     exclusive list without amending the Constitution. In the \n     words of the Chadha court,\n\n     The bicameral requirement, the Presentment Clauses, the \n     President's veto, and Congress' power to override a veto were \n     intended to erect enduring checks on each Branch and to \n     protect the people from the improvident exercise of power by \n     mandating certain prescribed steps. To preserve those checks, \n     and maintain the separation of powers, the carefully defined \n     limits on the power of each Branch must not be eroded. To \n     accomplish what has been attempted [here] requires action in \n     conformity with the express procedures of the Constitution's \n     prescription for legislative action: passage by a majority of \n     both Houses and presentment to the President.\n\n     Chadha, 462 U.S. at 957-58.\n       Here, while the initial passage of the Balanced Budget Act \n     and the Taxpayer Relief Act complied with the Article I \n     requirements, the Line Item Veto Act then authorized the \n     President to violate those requirements by producing laws \n     that had not adhered to those requirements. Both Houses of \n     Congress, through a process of discussion and compromise, had \n     agreed upon the exact content of the Balanced Budget Act and \n     the Taxpayer Relief Act. These laws reflected the best \n     judgment of both Houses. The laws that resulted after the \n     President's line item veto were different from those \n     consented to by both Houses of Congress. There is no way of \n     knowing whether these laws, in their truncated form, would \n     have received the requisite support from both the House \n     and the Senate. Because the laws that emerged after the \n     Line Item Veto are not the same laws that proceeded \n     through the legislative process, as required, the \n     resulting laws are not valid.\n       Furthermore, the President violated the requirements of \n     Article I when he unilaterally canceled provisions of duly \n     enacted statutes. Unilateral action by any single participant \n     in the law-making process is precisely what the Bicameralism \n     and Presentment Clauses were designed to prevent. Once a bill \n     becomes law, it can only be repealed or amended through \n     another, independent legislative enactment, which itself must \n     conform with the requirements of Article I. Any rescissions \n     must be agreed upon by a majority of both Houses of Congress. \n     The President cannot single-handedly revise the work of the \n     other two participants in the lawmaking process, as he did \n     here when he vetoed certain provisions of these statutes.\n       Defendants, curiously, contend that, despite its title, the \n     Line Item Veto Act does not authorize the President to \n     ``veto'' anything. They maintain that under the Act, ``[t]he \n     Bill stays as law, unless the President were to exercise his \n     constitutional power to veto. Nothing changes about the bill. \n     The law remains law. . . . The law remains on the books and \n     the law remains valid.'' (Tr. of Mot. Hr'g, Jan. 14, 1998 at \n     71, 78.) The Court does not follow Defendants' logic. In the \n     words of Richard Cardinal Cushing, ``When I see a bird that \n     walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a \n     duck, I call that bird a duck.'' Whatever defendants wish to \n     call the President's action, it has every mark of a veto. The \n     Line Item Veto Act states explicitly that ``cancel'' means \n     ``to rescind'' or to render the provision as having no \n     ``legal force or effect.'' How a ``canceled'' provision \n     ``remains on the books'' and ``remains valid'' defies logic. \n     The only way to restore these canceled provisions is for \n     Congress to pass and present new bills according to the \n     procedure prescribed in Article I. Clearly, this is an \n     indication that the canceled law no longer exists. Therefore, \n     despite Defendants' contentions, the Court finds that when \n     the President canceled these provisions pursuant to his Line \n     Item Veto authority, he unilaterally repealed duly enacted \n     provisions and amended duly enacted laws, which Article I \n     does not permit him to do.\n       Finally, Congress' ``indirect attempt[] to accomplish the \n     Constitution prohibits . . . accomplishing directly'' cannot \n     stand. U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U.S. 779, 829 \n     (1995). ``To argue otherwise is to suggest that the Framers \n     spent significant time and energy in debating and crafting \n     Clauses that could be easily evaded.'' Id. at 831. Congress \n     knew that a simple Line Item Veto, performed prior to the \n     President's signature, would violate Article I's requirement \n     that the president sign or return the bills in toto. See Line \n     Item Veto: The President's Constitutional Authority, Hearing \n     on S. Res. 195 Before the Subcomm. on the Constitution of the \n     Comm. on the Judiciary, 103d Cong. (1994). This limitation on \n     the President has been clear since George Washington's \n     tenure. See 33 Writings of George Washington 96 (John C. \n     Fitzpatrick ed. 1940) (``From the nature of the Constitution, \n     I must approve all the parts of a Bill, or reject it in \n     toto.'') Congress cannot evade this long-accepted requirement \n     by merely changing the timing of the President's \n     cancellation.\n       Because the Line Item Veto produced laws in violation of \n     the requirement of bicameral passage, because it permitted \n     the President unilaterally to repeal or amend duly enacted \n     laws, and because it impermissibly attempts to evade the \n     requirement that the President sign or reject a bill in toto, \n     the Act violates the requirements of Article I. For that \n     reason alone, the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional.\n     B. Separation of Powers\n       Furthermore, the Line Item Veto Act is unconstitutional \n     because it impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among \n     the three branches of government.\\14\\ The separation of \n     powers into three coordinate branches is central to the \n     principles on which this country was founded. See, e.g., \n     Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 380 (1989). The \n     declared purpose of separating and dividing the powers of \n     government was to ``diffuse power the better to secure \n     liberty.'' Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. \n     579, 635 (1952). In writing about the principle of separated \n     powers, Madison stated, ``No political truth is certainly of \n     greater intrinsic value or is stamped with the authority of \n     more enlightened patrons of liberty.'' The Federalist No. 47, \n     at 324 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Madison later wrote, ``But the \n     great security against a gradual concentration of the several \n     powers in the same department, consists in giving to those \n     who administer each department, the necessary constitutional \n     means, and personal motives, to resist encroachments of the \n     others.'' The Federalist No. 51, at 349 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). \n     The Framers ``regarded the checks and balances that they \n     built into the tripartite Federal Government as a self-\n     executing safeguard against the encroachment or \n     aggrandizement of one branch at the expense of the other.'' \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 122.\n       Pursuant to the doctrine of separated powers, certain \n     functions are divided between the legislative and executive \n     branches. Article I, section 1 vests all legislative \n     authority in Congress. Legislative power is the authority to \n     make laws. Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). \n     Executive power, on the other hand, is to ``take Care that \n     the Laws be faithfully executed.'' U.S. Const., art. II, \n     Sec. 3. With regard to lawmaking, the President's function is \n     strictly a negative one: to veto a bill in its entirety.\n       While it is Congress' duty to make laws, Congress can \n     delegate certain rulemaking authority to other branches, as \n     long as that delegation is appropriate to the duties of that \n     branch. See Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 388. Congress may not, \n     however, delegate its inherent lawmaking authority. See, \n     e.g., Loving v. United States, 116 S.Ct. 1737, 1744 (1996) \n     (``[T]he lawmaking function belongs to Congress . . . and may \n     not be conveyed to another branch or entity.''); Field v. \n     Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692 (1892) (``That Congress cannot \n     delegate legislative power to the president is a principle \n     universally recognized as vital to the integrity and \n     maintenance of the system of government ordained by the \n     Constitution.''); Edward Gibbon, History of the Decline and \n     Fall of the Roman Empire 33 (1838) (``The principles of a \n     free constitution are irrecoverably lost, when the \n     legislative power is nominated by the executive.''); Sir \n     William Blackstone, 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England, \n     146 (9th ed., reprinted 1978) (1783) (``In all tyrannical \n     governments the supreme magistracy, or the right of both \n     making and of enforcing the laws, is vested in one and the \n     same man, or one and the same body of men; and wherever these \n     two powers are united together, there can be no public \n     liberty.'').\n       The line between permissible delegations of rulemaking \n     authority and impermissible abandonments of lawmaking power \n     is a thin one. As one court described the distinction, ``The \n     legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law, but it \n     can make a law to delegate a power to determine some fact or \n     state of things upon which the law makes, or intends to make, \n     its own action depend.'' Field, 143 U.S. at 694. Stated \n     another way, ``The true distinction . . . is between the \n     delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily \n     involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring \n     an authority or discretion as to its execution, to be \n     exercised under and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot \n     be done; to the latter no valid objection can be made.'' \n     Hampton v. United States, 276 U.S. 394 (1928).\n       The Line Item Veto Act impermissibly crosses the line \n     between acceptable delegations of rulemaking authority and \n     unauthorized surrender to the President of an inherently \n     legislative function, namely, the authority to permanently \n     shape laws and package legislation. The Act enables the \n     President, in his discretion, to pick and choose among \n     portions of an enacted law to determine which ones will \n     remain valid. The Constitution, however, dictates that once a \n     bill becomes law, the President's sole duty is to ``take care \n     that the laws be faithfully executed.'' His power cannot \n     expand to that of ``co-designer'' of the law--that is \n     Congress' domain. Any subsequent amendment of a statute falls \n     under Congress' responsibility to legislate. The President \n     cannot take this duty upon himself; nor can Congress \n     relinquish that power to the Executive Branch.\n\n[[Page S698]]\n\n       The Defendants contend that the Line Item Veto is no \n     different than the many delegations of legislative authority \n     that Congress has made in the past. See, e.g., Field v. \n     Clark, 143 U.S. 649. Unlike other delegations of \n     Congressional authority, however, the Line Item Veto Act \n     authorizes the President to permanently extinguish laws. \n     These laws cannot be revived even if the President (or his \n     successor) feels that they are needed. Further, the Line Item \n     Veto Act empowers the President to make permanent changes to \n     the text of the Internal Revenue Code, as he did in the Snake \n     River case. Such delegations are unprecedented.\n       Defendants further urge the Court to find that the Line \n     Item Veto provides the President with ``intelligible \n     standards'' as required by the delegation doctrine. See \n     Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372. While it is true that the \n     delegation doctrine has enjoyed a liberal reading in the last \n     60 years or so, see, e.g., Federal Radio Comm'n v. Nelson \n     Bros., 289 U.S. 266 (1933) (upholding a delegation based on \n     ``public convenience, interest or necessity''), by trying to \n     bypass the maxim that Congress can delegate authority only if \n     that authority is, in fact, delegable, the Government \n     attempts to ``leap a chasm in two bounds.'' (Benjamin \n     Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield.) It is irrelevant whether the \n     Line Item Veto Act provides intelligible principles in its \n     delegation of authority to the President because, as \n     discussed above, the Act impermissibly attempts to transfer \n     non-delegable legislative authority to the Executive Branch.\n       The separation of powers between the President and Congress \n     is clear:\n\n     In the framework of our Constitution, the President's power \n     to see that laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea \n     that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits his \n     functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of \n     laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad. \n     And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about \n     who shall make laws which the President is to execute.\n\n     Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 587-88. By ceding inherently \n     legislative authority to the President, the Line Item Veto \n     Act violates this constitutional framework. For that reason, \n     and for the reason that it violates the letter and spirit of \n     the procedural requirements of Article I, the Line Item Veto \n     Act is unconstitutional.\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n       Although the Line Item Veto Act may have presented an \n     innovative and effective manner in which to control runaway \n     spending by Congress, the Framers held loftier values. The \n     Chadha Court recognized this tension between uncomplicated \n     administration of government and the values honored in the \n     Constitution:\n\n     The choices we discern as having been made in the \n     Constitutional convention impose burdens on governmental \n     processes that often seem clumsy, inefficient, even \n     unworkable, but those hard choices were consciously made by \n     men who had lived under a form of government that permitted \n     arbitrary governmental acts to go unchecked. There is no \n     support in the Constitution or decisions of this court for \n     the proposition that the cumbersomeness and delays often \n     encountered in complying with explicit Constitutional \n     standards may be avoided, either by the Congress or by the \n     President. With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness, \n     and potential for abuse, we have not yet found a better way \n     to preserve freedom than by making the exercise of power \n     subject to the carefully crafted restraints spelled out in \n     the Constitution.\n\n     Chadha, 462 U.S. at 959. Because the Line Item Veto \n     impermissibly violates the central tenets of our system of \n     government, it cannot stand.\n       Therefore, because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have \n     demonstrated the requisite injury to have standing and, \n     furthermore, that the Line Item Veto Act violates the \n     provisions of Article I, section 7 of the United States \n     Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine, this \n     Court declares that the Line Item Veto Act is \n     unconstitutional. Accordingly, the Court will grant \n     Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary Judgment and deny Defendants' \n     Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment. An Order \n     will accompany this Opinion.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Amici curiae briefs were submitted by Senators Robert C. \n     Byrd, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and Carl Levin, in support of \n     Plaintiffs' motions to declare the Line Item Veto Act \n     unconstitutional; the United States Senate, in support of the \n     constitutionality of the Act; and Congressman Dan Burton, in \n     support of the constitutionality of the Act.\n     \\2\\ The Constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act was \n     litigated in this court a mere six months before the \n     complaints in this case were filed. See Byrd v. Raines, 956 \n     F.Supp. 25 (D.D.C. 1997). In Byrd, Judge Jackson declared the \n     Act unconstitutional. Id. On a direct appeal of that District \n     Court decision, the Supreme Court held that appellees, six \n     members of Congress, lacked standing to bring the suit, and \n     therefore vacated the District Court opinion and directed \n     that the complaint be dismissed. See Raines v. Byrd, 117 \n     S.Ct. 2312, 2323 (1997).\n     \\3\\ President Clinton signed the Line Item Veto Act into law \n     on April 9, 1996, it became effective January 1, 1997, and it \n     remains effective until January 1, 2005.\n     \\4\\ Since 1974, Presidents have recommended $72.8 billion in \n     rescissions, but Congress has passed legislation rescinding \n     only $22.9 billion. S. Rep. No. 104-13, at 2 (1995).\n     \\5\\ The Joint Congressional Committee on Taxation is \n     responsible for identifying cancelable items in tax bills. \n     Id. at Sec. 691f.\n     \\6\\ Before the passage of section 968, farmers' cooperatives \n     were at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis investor-owned \n     businesses. Co-ops could not exchange their stock for the \n     stock of processing companies, because a cooperative's stock \n     can be held only by its members. (See Cranney Decl. at para. \n     15.)\n     \\7\\ But see Ralph Waldo Emerson, Essays: Self-Reliance \n     (1841), ``A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little \n     minds.''\n     \\8\\ The Court's standing analysis focuses on the plaintiff \n     health care providers. As long as the Court determines that \n     at least one of the New York plaintiffs has standing, it does \n     not need to consider the standing issue as to the other \n     plaintiffs in that action. See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. \n     714, 721 (1986).\n     \\9\\ As a simplified example, if an investor-owned business \n     and a farmers' co-op each offered $1 million for a processing \n     plant, the investor-owned business would always prevail \n     because the processor would actually net $1 million from that \n     sale, whereas it would net less than $1 million from the sale \n     to the farmers' co-op, because it would have to pay capital \n     gains tax on that sale. Therefore, to compete for a piece of \n     property with an investor-owned business, the farmers' co-op \n     would have to offer more than the investor-owned business to \n     make up for the capital gains tax that the purchaser would \n     have to pay.\n     \\10\\ Defendants argue that because Plaintiffs themselves \n     would not have received the capital gains tax deferral, they \n     are not the beneficiaries of section 968. The Court \n     disagrees. The express purpose of section 968 was to help \n     farmers to buy refining and processing facilities by \n     eliminating a tax obstacle facing sellers who sell to them. \n     Thus, although the direct recipient of the tax deferral was \n     the sellers, it was plainly understood that the intention was \n     to benefit the farmers; a cancellation of the tax deferral \n     would really injure the farmers, not the owners of the \n     processing plants, because the owners could already get the \n     tax deferral simply by selling to investor-owned businesses.\n     \\11\\ For example, in the illustration provided in footnote 9, \n     supra, instead of having to offer, say, $1.3 million to \n     compete with the investor-owned business, the co-op could \n     offer an amount in the $1 million range.\n     \\12\\ To qualify for a deferral of capital gains taxes under \n     section 968(g), the seller must transfer 100% of the stock of \n     the qualified processor to the farmers' cooperative. Section \n     968(a) requires that, during the one-year period preceding \n     the date of sale, the qualified refiner or processor purchase \n     at least 50% of the products to be refined or processed from \n     the farmers who make up the eligible farmers' cooperative \n     that is purchasing the corporations' stock or from the \n     cooperative itself.\n     \\13\\ This approach has been cautioned against since the \n     founding of our democracy. ``If in the opinion of the People, \n     the distribution or modification of the Constitutional powers \n     be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an \n     amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But \n     let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one \n     instance may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \n     weapon by which free governments are destroyed.'' George \n     Washington, Farewell Address, September 19, 1796 in 35 The \n     Writings of George Washington 229 (John C. Fitzpatrick ed., \n     1940).\n     \\14\\ While this analysis focuses on the balance of powers \n     between the legislative and executive branches, the Line Item \n     Veto could also affect judicial independence. It is possible \n     that the President might use the Line Item Veto to manipulate \n     the judiciary's budget, thus exerting pressure on its \n     members. See Robert Destro, Whom Do You Trust? Judicial \n     Independence, the Power of the Purse & the Line Item Veto, \n     44-Jan. Fed.

Hogan,\n                                              U.S. District Judge.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I hesitate to intrude on this debate, but \nconfession is good for the soul.\n  I campaigned on behalf of a line-item veto. I worked on this floor \nfor the passage of the line-item veto. I enthusiastically voted for the \nline-item veto. I learned one thing in basic training when I was in the \nmilitary service of this country that has remained with me. One of the \nthings they taught us was that the best time to escape is immediately \nafter you are captured. Don't wait until you have been taken to the \nback lines. Don't wait until you have been put in a prison camp to try \nto plot your escape. Escape immediately after you are captured, when \nyou are within 100 yards of your own lines. You are in the confusion of \nthe battlefield, you are under the control of troops who are not \ntrained to hold on to prisoners.\n  I have applied that principle in my life. When I make a mistake I \nwant to escape from it as quickly as possible instead of waiting until \nI have been put into prison later on behind the enemy lines.\n  I reasoned that the experience of State Governors, 47 of whom have \nline-item vetoes, bade well for the line-item veto. My own Governor in \nthe State of Utah has it. And it has not been the source of mischief in \nthe process of legislation in the State.\n  I have seen that it has become the source of mischief here in this \nbody. And, as I said to my revered colleague on the Appropriations \nCommittee when this came up--and our chairman was expressing his usual \nenthusiasm; in this case in anger for his position--it may be that I \nwill have to eat a little crow.\n  So as I receive the news of the action having been taken by the court \nin this case, I stand now to say that I would not support an effort to \ntry to overturn that decision. The time to escape is immediately after \nyou are captured. And we have been captured. And I will escape from my \nprevious posture.\n\n[[Page S699]]\n\n  I apologize, albeit much too late, to my primary opponent who stood \nin opposition to the line-item veto. And this was a matter of \ndifference between the two of us in the primary. I think I made some \nprogress because as we got near the vote he recanted and came to my \nside so as to try to get the people who were in favor of a line-item \nveto to vote for him instead of me.\n  But I believe the arguments that have been repeated here, the \ninformation given here from the decision of the judge, are sufficiently \npersuasive that I need to make this apology and this recanting of a \nprevious position. While I may not be with my two colleagues on many \nother matters, I try to be with them on constitutional matters.\n  It is on this basis that I opposed a constitutional amendment \nregarding flag burning. That puts me at odds with my senior colleague \nfrom Utah, which always distresses me. It is for this purpose that I \noppose McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform because I think it is \nunconstitutional. I believe the courts have ruled in similar cases that \nthe guts of the McCain-Feingold bill is in fact an intrusion on the \nfirst amendment.\n  But I think there is no more important function that we have in this \nChamber, whatever our disagreements on the specifics, than the function \nof protecting the Constitution against the whims of the hour.\n  And so I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Moynihan for their \nscholarship and for their leadership on this issue, and I, as one \nSenator at least on the other side of the issue, throw in the towel, \neat a little crow, and declare my willingness to escape from a previous \nposition.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield very briefly?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nremarks.\n  Diogenes walked the streets of Athens in broad daylight with his \nlighted lantern. He was asked why. He answered, ``I am looking for a \nman.'' Plato, when visiting Sicily, was asked by Hiero, the tyrannical \nhead of the Government, why he came to Sicily. He said, ``I am seeking \nan honest man.''\n\n  May I say, Mr. President, today I have found an honest man --the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. There could be \nno higher tribute. I am grateful to him.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I add, not only honest but a courageous man. In \nsome 21 years on the Senate floor I have not heard a more refreshing \nand inspiriting statement. It is not surprising coming from the Senator \nfrom Utah, but it is all the more amazing. There are few places in this \nworld today where such a statement could be made and praised.\n  It is a tribute to you, sir; also a tribute to the U.S. Army, I \nbelieve. But we will not get into that. I thank you for your remarks, \nsir.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the senior Senator from New York.

Mr. President, today's article from today's Washington \nPost is yet more indication, unfortunately, of the bad faith with which \nRussia has been dealing with us on the transfer of sensitive technology \nto rogue nations, particularly, dual use and missile technology.\n  I am on the Foreign Affairs Committee and chair the Middle East \nSubcommittee. And something that has been very troubling to me is the \nintroduction into the Middle East, particularly into Iran and into \nIraq, of technology that can be used for missile development, for use \nof the delivery of weapons of mass destruction, even the development of \nweapons of mass destruction like biological warfare, biological and \nchemical warfare weapons.\n  Evidence was in the Washington Post, again, today, that once again--\nnot just the first time--but once again Russian companies, with links \nto the Government, were involved in violating the U.N. authorized \nembargo on sales to Iraq of dual-use equipment. And this is outrageous. \nAnd it is preposterous that they would be doing it.\n  The transfer to Iraq--which is a rogue nation, with a leader who does \nnot operate under internationally recognized civilized codes--of any \ndual-use technology is unacceptable. And yet once again today we have \nanother example.\n  The transfer of equipment, such as the fermentation equipment, which \nwas alluded to today, which can be used to develop biological weapons, \nand the possible collusion with the Iraqis against UNSCOM to hide \ntechnology and weapons, is proof of a cynical bad faith which is \nuntenable. If this information is true--and I am told it is well \ngrounded--the Russians are making a mockery of a very serious issue, \nand, more importantly, they are putting U.S. forces at increased risk.\n\n  This type of behavior has immense implications for a policy towards \nIran as well and the administration's efforts to curb these sales of \nequipment that can be used to deliver or to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction. This cynicism should not be rewarded.\n  I understand that we have been holding up Senate bill 1311, the Iran \nMissile Proliferation Sanctions Act, in deference to the Russians to \ngive them time to prove their good faith and in deference to the Vice \nPresident's meeting with them in March. In view of the latest \ndevelopments and this information, I believe such deference is \nmisplaced. I request that Senate bill 1311 be moved up on the Senate \ncalendar. I will make that request known to the leadership and ask that \nthey proceed forward because this ``good faith'' that we are offering \nhas obviously been received in a way of making bad-faith steps by the \nRussians and is further proof today this cannot be allowed to continue. \nEvery day it is allowed to continue, more and more U.S. lives are at \nrisk. It cannot be allowed to continue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for 10 \nminutes as in morning business. I do that with the agreement of the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S699-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S699-S700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SITUATION IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Secretaries of Defense and State have \nbeen pursuing political support, both in the Congress and among our \nallies, for the use of military force against Iraq.\n  I come to the floor today to express my support for a military strike \nagainst Iraq and to urge our colleagues and our allies to join us in \nsupporting our troops and our Commander-in-Chief. The unfortunate \nimpasse which has precluded a full and conclusive Senate debate on a \nformal resolution of support should not be misconstrued. Clearly, when \nand if the time comes, an overwhelming majority in this body will \nsupport decisive action to end the threat to our security that Iraq \ncontinues to pose. Saddam Hussein should have no doubt about that.\n  We in government are frequently accused of demonizing our enemies in \norder to garner popular support here at home for the kind of actions we \nare currently contemplating with regard to Iraq. President Bush was \naccused of doing precisely that during Operation Desert Shield. There \nis a considerable wealth of information pertaining to Saddam Hussein's \nyears in power, though, that clearly indicates that we are dealing with \nas ruthless and brutal a dictator as exists anywhere in the world \ntoday. That is not demonizing an individual; it is accurately \ndescribing a man with the moral and ethical foundation required to \nemploy chemical weapons against his own population; to assassinate any \nand all political rivals; to have his own sons-in-law executed; to \nmassacre Kurdish populations in the north and Shiite communities in the \nsouth; to invade Kuwait and impose a\n\n[[Page S700]]\n\nbarbaric occupation of that nation; and to continue to threaten \nneighboring countries despite the open revulsion with which much of the \nworld has reacted to his years of rule.\n  This is a regime that recognizes no restraint upon its conduct save \nthat which is imposed by force of arms. As I have repeatedly stated \nhere on the floor of the Senate, the actions for which Saddam Hussein \nmust be held accountable represent nothing more than what is expected \nof any country that seeks to exist within a community of civilized \nnations. The Government of Iraq has imposed untold hardships on its \npeople solely so that it can continue to develop and stockpile weapons \nof mass destruction--weapons that it has no moral compunction about \nusing at the earliest opportunity and against any nation or segment of \nsociety.\n  Linkages are repeatedly made between the U.S. posture toward Iraq and \nour role in the Middle East peace process. Mr. President, that argument \ncries out for denunciation at the highest levels of every government. \nWe may not like the way every policy of or tactic by the democratically \nelected government in Israel, but the physical pain and psychological \ntrauma that afflicted Israel as a result of completely unprovoked \nmissile attacks by an Iraqi regime seeking to tear asunder the \nmultinational coalition arrayed against it and Tel Aviv's refusal to \nretaliate despite ample justification for doing so stands in strong \ncontrast to the Government of Iraq. There is no basis for comparison, \nand U.S. policy toward Iraq should not legitimize the perception of \nlinkage by deferring to it.\n  The United Nations must enforce its resolutions and do so with \nconviction. And this body must acknowledge that only the United States \npossesses the capability to conduct the kind of military operations \nmost of us agree are warranted and essential. That means conveying to \nthe President, to the American people, and to the world, the message \nthat Congress stands firmly behind the Commander-in-Chief in carrying \nout his responsibility to ensure that the threat to regional stability \nposed by Iraq is not permitted to endure in perpetuity.\n  Mr. President, we should make clear to the American people and to the \nworld that the Congress agrees with the proposition that evil should \nnot be permitted to triumph. The United States must respond forcefully, \nfar more so than it has in the past, to Iraq's unceasing provocations \nand it must adopt whatever measures will ensure the removal from power \nof the ruling regime in Baghdad.\n  We must prepare the groundwork for a process that may take years to \nbear fruit and that will certainly entail loss of life. Opposition \nforces friendly to and supported by the United States were badly \ndecimated by Iraq's 1996 incursion into supposedly protected territory \nin northern Iraq. Survivors are understandably bitter and reluctant to \ncast their lot with us again. That is why the air and missile strikes \nwe launch against Iraq must be decisive and not the kind of exceedingly \nlimited response characterized by the 27 cruise missiles launched \nagainst targets unrelated to that violation of the northern exclusion \nzone.\n  We must support a long-term operation involving opposition forces \ntrained and equipped to conduct a successful revolution. This is not an \neasy course that I and others are recommending. But it is the only \nviable approach to removing a threat to the most volatile region in the \nworld--a threat that could include the brandishing of chemical, \nbiological, and some day, nuclear weapons. That is not a situation any \nof us want to see develop. But develop it will, if we do not act to \nprevent it.\n  Mr. President, I am confident the Congress will soon have the \nopportunity to express formally its support for the use of force to \nrespond to that threat. Were there another way, I would gladly accept \nit, but experience teaches that there is not. I would never want to see \nmyself viewed as beating the drums of war, but I would rather live with \nthat image than look into the mirror and see a Member of Congress who \nfailed to do his duty of supporting our troops in harm's way and our \nCommander-in-Chief in taking the kind of measures I sincerely believe \nare necessary to resolve the Iraqi problem once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I again express my appreciation for the courtesy of \nthe Senator from North Dakota in allowing me to make this statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished floor \nleader of the Democratic caucus, the Senator from North Dakota, for \nallocating this time to talk about something that is very important.\n  I also want to commend as well the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments about Iraq. Certainly his experience and his leadership for \nthese many years carries special weight with people on both sides of \nthe aisle. I hope that we can continue to demonstrate the spirit that \nhe has articulated today as we deal with this grave situation in that \nfaraway place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S699-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S700-S704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NEW SOLUTIONS FOR A NEW CENTURY: 1998 DEMOCRATIC AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, 10 days ago, the President delivered to \nCongress the first balanced budget in 30 years.\n  Yesterday we learned that the Federal deficit actually will be gone \nby the end of this year, four years ahead of schedule.\n  That remarkable accomplishment was set in motion five years ago, when \ncongressional Democrats joined the administration to return fiscal \ndiscipline to Washington.\n  Because we did the right thing five years ago, our economy is \nstronger today than it's been in a generation.\n  Our foundation is solid.\n  Now we need to build on that foundation.\n  For the last six months, congressional Democrats have worked with the \nadministration to develop a unified agenda for the American people. We \ntalked a lot about what the options were, and what our priorities \nshould be. After a great deal of deliberation, we agreed on a series of \nproposals that merit--that really demand--our action this year.\n  This morning, House and Senate Democrats met with the President and \nthe Vice President and senior White House officials to ratify those \nproposals and begin the process of translating them into action, to \nconfront real problems facing the American people with real solutions.\n  We call our agenda ``New solutions for a New Century.'' These \nproposals address the most urgent concerns facing the American people \ntoday. We want to reach across the aisle and work with our Republican \ncolleagues to adopt them this year.\n  We need to increase the take-home pay of America's families. By \nbreaking the wage cycle that continues to pay working women 71 cents on \nevery $1 that a man earns. By making child care safer and more \naffordable. And by raising the minimum wage by $1 an hour over the next \n2 years.\n  We need to make America's public schools the best in the world. By \nhiring 100,000 new teachers so we can reduce the average class size to \n18 students per classroom in the first three grades. By making sure \nthat every school in America is connected to the Internet so that \ncomputer screens are as common in classrooms as blackboards. And, by \nhelping communities repair or replace school buildings that are \novercrowded or obsolete or downright dangerous.\n  We also need to protect our children this year from the deadly \nepidemic of smoking. We need to say that the days when tobacco \ncompanies can spend millions of dollars to get kids hooked on \ncigarettes are over. From now on, they will pay to keep kids away from \ncigarettes.\n  America's families need to know their health insurance will be there \nwhen they need it, that they can go to a hospital emergency room when \nand where they need to. They need to know they can see a medical \nspecialist if they need one. And they need to know that the things they \ntell their doctor in confidence will be kept confidential. We can give \nthem that peace of mind this year by passing our Patient's Bill of \nRights.\n  America's families need to be able to plan for their retirement. They \nneed stronger private pension plans that are portable and protected. \nThey deserve assurances that Medicare and Social Security will be there \nwhen they need\n\n[[Page S701]]\n\nthem. And early retirees and older displaced workers who have no way to \nbuy private health insurance on their own deserve the opportunity to \npurchase health insurance through Medicare.\n  Finally, we need to make our neighborhoods safer this year. And we \nwill. By helping communities create after-school safe havens to keep \nkids out of trouble. And by creating special juvenile courts and \ntoughening the Federal penalties for gang violence so that the kids we \ncan't reach, the hard-core few who are violent repeat offenders, will \nbe locked up for a long time.\n  A sound economy, stronger schools, a secure retirement, safe \nneighborhoods. That is the Democratic agenda for America's families. \nThey are not sound bites; they are sound policies. They are new ideas \nfor a new century.\n  Today, we pledge to do all that we can to enact these new ideas into \nlaw and make a real difference in people's lives.\n  We have little time left in this Congress, Mr. President, to deal \nwith this and all of the leftover elements of the agenda from last \nyear. But let us be clear, we need to finish our unfinished business--\nthe highway bill, IRS reform, strengthening family farms, and reforming \nour campaign finance system. We need to finish that business and pass \nthis agenda this year.\n\n  Our economy is strong. Our foundation is solid. Now, brick by brick, \nwe need to keep building to take this prosperity to the next level and \ngive people the tools and the opportunities to make their lives better \nin a new century.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate my gratitude to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota for assuring that we could allocate the time for this very \nimportant discussion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Democratic leader. He has provided \nextraordinary leadership to this caucus and this Congress. The document \nthat we developed over time and announced today with the President, the \nVice President, Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt, and the joint \nDemocratic caucuses of the House and Senate is one that I am enormously \nproud of and one that, if enacted, would substantially improve this \ncountry.\n  We come here, almost all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, \nbecause we have a passion for public policy and feel very strongly \nabout a range of issues and how those issues might affect our country's \nfuture. While we might have substantial differences in how we go about \nachieving certain goals, I think all of us understand that we sit in \nthis Chamber as American citizens in a democracy wanting the best for \nour country. The question is, how do we achieve that? How do we achieve \nthe goals that we establish for our country's future?\n  Senator Daschle mentioned the things that we have accomplished, the \nthings that we have yet to do, the fiscal policy. I can recall, going \nback 5 years to 1993, when we had a very, very significant debate on \nthe floor of the Senate about fiscal policy, what kind of policies \nwould put this country back on track, heading in the right direction; \nwhat kind of policies would continue us in the direction that we had \nbeen moving in with higher debt, higher deficits, higher unemployment, \nhigher inflation. So we had a significant debate about it. Those of us \nwho felt very strongly that there was a better way and a better \ndirection won by one vote--one vote here and one vote in the other \nbody. A margin of one vote determined the new fiscal policy for this \ncountry. It was a tougher fiscal policy. It wasn't words; it was \naction. So it was controversial. For some, it was difficult. Some of my \ncolleagues who voted for it are not here any longer; they lost their \nseats in Congress because of it. But it was medicine to cure what was \nwrong in this country's fiscal policy and to put this country on the \nright course. And it worked.\n  It substantially reduced the Federal budget deficit. It told all the \nAmerican people that there was a new group of Members of Congress, a \nnew President who said there is a better way and a different way, and \nwe are going to tackle this fiscal policy and tackle the Federal budget \ndeficit and change things. It's very interesting that, because this \neconomy rides on a cushion of confidence, when we made that decision, \nthe American people were confident about the future once again, and \nwhen they are confident, they make decisions like buying a home, buying \na car, taking a vacation, buying a new refrigerator. When they are not \nconfident about the future, they don't make those purchases and they \ndon't make those decisions. When they feel like that, the economy \ncontracts. When they feel confident about the future, the economy \nexpands. Because the economy has expanded and because people have had \nmore confidence, this budget deficit has shrunk. It is down, down, \ndown, way down. We will balance the budget.\n  Crime is down, unemployment is down, inflation is down, welfare is \ndown. All of the things that are important in our lives about how we \nare doing in this country show signs of substantial improvement and \nshow signs that this country is moving in the right direction.\n  I want to make one other point about fiscal policy and some of the \nother problems we face. In our agenda, we talk about Social Security--\n``save Social Security first,'' the President proposes. And ``save \nSocial Security first,'' we propose as a caucus. Some wring their hands \nevery day of the week about Social Security. Some never liked it in the \nfirst place. Some think it doesn't work and they wring their hands and \nsay, ``Woe, what are we to do with Social Security?''\n  I want them to understand, as many Americans do, that the Social \nSecurity problem that exists is born of enormous success. We would not \nhave a problem financing Social Security for 150 years if we went back \nto the old mortality rates. In the 1930s, you were expected to live to \nage 63 in this country. Now you are expected to live, on average, to \nabout 77 years in America. Why? Because we have done a lot of good \nthings in this country. We have invested in health care, technology, \nand breathtaking medical research. Now people, when they reach a \ncertain age and their knees wear out, they get new knees, or they get \nnew hips, or have cataract surgery, or their heart muscle is unplugged \non an operating table. Some people may be worth a million dollars after \nall that medical help. But the point is that people are living longer \nand better lives, and all of these problems are born of the success of \ngreater longevity. Does that cause some pinching in Social Security and \nMedicare in the long term? Yes, but it is not catastrophic. Adjustments \ncan be made that are not significant, which will provide solid, assured \nfinancing for Social Security and Medicare for the long term.\n  That is what this President says. As we tame the fiscal policy \ndeficits, and as we begin to accumulate surpluses, let us use those \nsurpluses to save Social Security first. Those who believe that is not \na wise course, those who believe that is not appropriate fiscal policy, \ncome to the floor of the Senate, because we are going to have a healthy \nand aggressive debate about that. Many of us feel very strongly that it \nis precisely what this country ought to do. We have tamed the Federal \ndeficit. Now let's make the right investment. And the first commitment \nought to be to save Social Security first.\n  Now, within the context of other spending we do in the budgets and \nother investments, there are other things we can do. I know we will \nhave Members who don't want to do anything. They have never wanted to \ndo anything. I mean, there are people who have said there is no role \nfor Government. There are people who put seatbelts on when they drive \nthrough a car wash. They're so conservative they don't want to do \nanything ever. Much of what we have accomplished in this country has \nbeen because we have made the right kind of investments.\n  This proposal that we have developed jointly says that one of those \ninvestments that is very important is in the area of health care \nresearch down at the National Institutes of Health, where breathtaking, \nnew medical research occurs. We are saying we can invest substantially \nmore money and you can, as a result of that, save an enormous amount of \nmoney and save lives and improve the lives of the American people. I am \nvery excited about that. What better investment is there in this \ncountry than to invest in the kind of medical and health care research \nat the\n\n[[Page S702]]\n\nNational Institutes of Health which has provided breakthroughs in \nmedicine that have allowed people to live much longer and more \nproductive lives?\n  Another investment that the President and we call for in our joint \npolicy message is an investment in education. Education is our future. \nOur children are our future. Investment in our children represents our \ntomorrow. We talk about investing in schools, investing in good \nteachers, and deciding that we can do this country a significant amount \nof good by understanding that the priority is educating our children. \nThomas Jefferson once said, ``Anyone who believes a country can be both \nignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can \nbe.'' He was right about that 200 years ago. The reason this country \nhas done so well is because we have always established that education \nis a priority. It must remain a priority, and that is what our caucus \nand our policy choices are committed to doing.\n\n  A couple of other items--and I don't want to cover them all because \nsome of my colleagues will cover some. Teen smoking is part of our \nagenda. We need to end that, to combat teen smoking. You have all heard \nthe message that you don't find people deciding at age 25, as they sit \naround in a recliner thinking about life, or wondering what on Earth \ncan I do to further enrich my life, or what is missing from my life, \nand they come up with the answer: Smoking; I would like to start \nsmoking. Nobody does that at age 25 or 30. If you are not smoking by \nthe time you are a kid, you are not going to be a future user of \ntobacco.\n  The tobacco companies have always known that, and that is why they \nhave always targeted their future customers, who are the children. Does \nanybody know anybody who is 25 or 30 years of age who says, how can I \nenrich my life further? and then comes up with the answer that I would \nlike to start smoking? Nobody does that. We also understand that we can \nsave lives by combating teen smoking, and there are plenty of ways to \ndo that. A thousand kids a day will die--3,000 kids a day will start \nsmoking, and a thousand will die of that cause. We can save lives with \na national campaign to combat teen smoking.\n  Drunk driving. This agenda of ours also deals with the question of \ndrunk driving. That is not some mysterious illness or disease. We know \nwhat causes fatalities on the roads--drunk driving. Everyone in this \nChamber and every family represented here knows that--friend, neighbor, \nrelative, acquaintance. I am not even very logical about this question. \nThe night that I got the call that my mother had been killed by a drunk \ndriver, I'll never forget the moment, and I'll never forget how I have \nfelt from that day forward. People who drink and drive turn automobiles \ninto instruments of murder. The fact is, it's not just the .08 we are \ngoing to debate, the question of when are you drunk. There are six \nStates in this country where you can get behind the wheel of a car and \ntake a fifth of whiskey in one hand and the steering wheel in the other \nand drive off, and you are perfectly legal. That ought not happen \nanywhere in America. We can change that. There are some 20 States in \nwhich, if the driver can't drink, everybody else in the car can be \ndrinking. Vehicles on roads in this country ought not to have open \ncontainers of alcohol in them, period. That is something we can address \nin this Congress.\n  Finally, campaign finance reform is also part of what our caucus is \ncommitted to doing. There are a lot of discussions about what pieces \nwill work and what pieces will not work with respect to campaign \nfinance reform. I want to describe one little piece that I think is \nimportant. The most significant kind of air pollution in America today \nis the 30-second political ad that does nothing but tear down someone's \nopponent. It is a 30-second slash and burn, cut and run ad that \ncontributes nothing to our country. The first amendment gives everybody \nthe right to do that. We won't change that. But there is a little thing \nwe can change. We can, by Federal law, say that every television \nstation is required to offer the lowest rates on the rate card during \npolitical advertising during a certain period. I propose that we change \nthat law to say that low rate is only available to candidates who run \nadvertisements that are at least 1 minute in length. Let's require \npeople to say something significant in one in which the candidate \nhimself or herself is in the advertisement 75 percent of that 1 minute.\n  Some people may not like that. I do. Can you think of any other \nbusiness, other than American politics, where the competitor says--for \nexample, can you conceive of a car company who does all of its \nadvertising saying: By the way, if you buy a Chevrolet, you are going \nto kill yourself because they are not safe; or fly American, or United, \nor Northwest and, by the way, their mechanics are a bunch of drunks. Do \nwe see that in any other part of our lives? No. That is not the way \ncommercial enterprises compete against each other. But it is the way we \ncompete in politics. Shame on us. We can change that. It ought to be a \ncompetition of ideas and about what we want for the future of this \ncountry. I hope one of these days we can have campaign finance reform \nthat gets to that point. But at least a little proposal I am \nsuggesting, on top of all of the other things that we are talking about \nin campaign finance reform as a caucus, might finally stop some of this \nair pollution or at least lessen the pollution that permeates every \ncampaign in this country.\n\n  Then there is food safety, clean air, and clean water. Our caucus \nstands for things that are positive in the lives of the American \npeople. Some say they want to debate politics with the same old \nstereotypes. Unfortunately, it won't work anymore. To those who say, \n``There are the good guys, and there are the tax-and-spend people,'' I \nsay that doesn't work. Our caucus, in this Congress, with this \nPresident, made a decision that we were going to do some awfully \nimportant things to put this country back on course, and we did it--at \ngreat cost and expense to our caucus. But the American people, 5 years \nlater, see the results for this country of what we have done. We say \nthat the job isn't finished. There is much to do to make this a better \ncountry. That is the purpose of the message and the purpose of the set \nof public policies that tell the American people: Here is why we are \nhere and what we want to fight for to improve America's future.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me commend our colleague from \nNorth Dakota for a very eloquent statement and the Democratic leader, \nSenator Daschle of South Dakota, for laying out one of the primary \nobjectives of a Democratic agenda for this session of the 105th \nCongress.\n  I think there are issues that ought to enjoy and attract strong \nbipartisan support--sustained growth in our economy, a balanced budget, \na growing surplus, and investments in the educational and health needs \nof young people. I certainly hope that on managed care issues, in \nparticular, we can find consensus--making sure that people across this \ncountry have the right to choose their own doctors and are not going to \nbe forced out of the hospital prematurely. A bill of rights for \npatients is something that is long overdue. I know that the people of \nAmerican are hoping that this Congress will address these issues before \nwe adjourn.\n  I want to commend those who are responsible for putting this agenda \ntogether and to address a few aspects of it more fully.\n  Shortly we will be hearing from our colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, who has led a task force over the past several months \nto fashion a bill to deal with the difficult issue of tobacco use by \nyoung people--a bill which I was pleased to cosponsor. As Senator \nDorgan just discussed, the facts on youth smoking are not in \ncontroversy--3,000 young people start smoking every day, and 1,000 of \nthose will die prematurely.\n  This is an issue that ought to unite Americans regardless of \npolitical persuasion or ideology. We all pay when children become \naddicted to tobacco. It is not just the children who pay with \nabbreviated lives that might have produced far more for themselves, for \ntheir families, and for their Nation. But all of us in a sense suffer \nwhen we, by our silence, by our inaction promote or at least don't try \nto retard the\n\n[[Page S703]]\n\ngrowth of a problem that so negatively affects young people. So, I am \nhopeful in these few legislative days we have remaining, we will do \nsomething meaningful to reduce the harmful impact of tobacco on the \nchildren in this country.\n  We all know that a tax increase, which makes tobacco less affordable, \nis one of the ways to do that. I'd like to cite some facts from a \nrecent survey done in my State--in Fairfield County, CT. This county is \na one of great affluence--it contains the towns of Greenwich and \nWestport some of the more affluent communities in the Nation. It is \nalso a county that is the home of Bridgeport, CT, one of the poorest \ncities in the Nation. In a relatively small area of geography, you have \ngreat diversity in income.\n  This survey looked at young people's smoking habits. Interestingly, \nabout 30 to 35 percent of the young people in the more affluent suburbs \nin the communities of Fairfield have already begun to smoke or abuse \nalcohol. In Bridgeport, however, the percentage of teenagers was much \nlower--10 to 13 percent. Why? There are many factors, but, clearly \neconomics play a major role. The people who conducted this survey \nconcluded that money does make a difference--that the ability of a \nteenager to buy a pack of cigarettes actually does affect the \nlikelihood that he or she will smoke.\n  Senator Conrad has included in his bill a tobacco tax of $1.50--the \namount that public health experts tell us is necessary to effect a \ndecrease in youth smoking. Senator Conrad has also laid out a plan for \nmaking use of the revenue raised by this increased tax on tobacco. I \nsuspect that I was somewhat of a pest over the last 72 hours as he was \ngetting ready to introduce this bill--in making repeated suggestions \nabout how he could best make use of those funds. I am very pleased that \nSenator Conrad will be directing $14 billion of the revenues--of the \n$80 billion that will be generated in the next 5 years or so--toward \nimproving the affordability, availability and quality of child care.\n  My colleagues know, going back during the years of my tenure in the \nSenate, that I have spent a lot of time advocating for children's \nissues, particularly child care. So, I am deeply, deeply grateful to my \ncolleague from North Dakota for agreeing to allocate such a substantial \npart of these dollars to the needs of children. I know my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, Jack Reed, who was one of the first cosponsors on \nour comprehensive child care bill introduced last week and an active \nmember of the Democratic Strike Force--Right Start 2000 that we formed \nin the Senate here to focus on children's issues, joins me in \nexpressing our appreciation.\n\n  While we are on the topic of child care, Mr. President, I'd like to \nshare with my colleagues some new findings in the child care debate \nthat relate to the issues of the cost and quality of child care.\n  Mr. President, after we passed the welfare reform package in 1996 I \nasked the General Accounting Office if they would do a survey of States \nand give us some idea of how this law would affect the child care needs \nof families in this country. The GAO, just in the last few days, \ncompleted its survey and issued a report to the Subcommittee on \nChildren and Families, of which I serve as ranking member.\n  Let me just briefly share some of the conclusions of this GAO study \nabout how welfare reform is affecting not only welfare recipients, but \nalso working families. I think these findings highlight why the \nallocation that the Senator from North Dakota has directed to \nchildren's needs in his tobacco bill is so critically important.\n  This report's findings are based on a survey of several States--\nCalifornia, Louisiana, Oregon, Texas, Washington, and Connecticut. \nFirst, let me offer the good news. According to the GAO States have \ndone a very good job in meeting the needs of welfare recipients. Most \nfamilies who need child care assistance in order to begin to enter the \nworkplace are receiving it. Now, for some of the bad news. In order to \nhelp all of the welfare recipients, States had to severely limit the \naccess of working families to child care subsidies. People who are \nright on that margin--not on welfare, but just over the line--are not \ngetting the assistance they need.\n  The survey indicates that access of working families to subsidies has \nbeen severely curtailed. Even if States draw down all of the Federal \nfunds available, more than half--52 percent of working families in this \ncountry who need affordable child care--will be denied it.\n  In Texas, one of the seven States surveyed, this means that over \n37,000 working families remain on waiting lists for child care \nassistance. In California, even more dramatically, 200,000 working \nfamilies are on waiting lists for child care assistance--some for over \n2 years. Tragically, in my State of Connecticut, we just stopped \npretending. We don't even keep waiting lists for new families.\n  In this survey, the States also told the GAO about severe problems \nwith the availability of child care. As we have known for years, \ncertain types of care are not available at any cost--infant care, care \nfor children with disabilities and care during nonstandard work hours.\n  The GAO found that States are particularly concerned that the work \nparticipation requirements of welfare could exacerbate the shortage of \ninfant care. Under welfare reform, mothers with children over the age \nof 1 are told they must work. Some States have chosen even tougher \nstandards. In Wisconsin and Oregon, mothers with children older than 3 \nmonths must work. I find it somehow ironic that we now have Republican \nlegislation pending that would offer incentives for parents to stay \nhome with children under the age of 3 years--a wonderful idea--but yet \nwe have in place a work requirement for welfare recipients with \nchildren over 3 months in some States.\n  In many communities, child care for very young children is so limited \nthat parents must sign up while they are still pregnant to have any \nchance of finding that care at all.\n  Welfare reform is also exacerbating, according to GAO, the lack of \nchild care during nonstandard work hours. Many welfare parents are \nfinding jobs in service industries where shift work is required. Yet in \nmost communities child care on weekends or after 6 p.m. is nonexistent.\n\n  When it comes to improving the quality, it is clear that States are \nmaking an effort. States are trying to improve provider training, to \nincresae provider compensation and to help facilities meet licensing \nstandards, but they are still concerned that they are falling short. \nThey are concerned, and rightly so, that as work participation \nrequirements rise, quality may be compromised.\n  This report is not about blaming the States. They are doing the best \nthey can with a very big job. This is not about pitting welfare \nrecipients against working families in the battle for limited child \ncare dollars. It should be about making sure that the Federal \nGovernment provides sufficient resources so that parents who need safe \nand affordable child care in order to work can find it in this country.\n  Senator Conrad's bill and the $14 billion in funding that it will \nprovide will go a long way towards meeting those needs. I am pleased \nthat the Senator from North Dakota has included in his tobacco \nlegislation language directing these funds to the programs outlined in \nthe Child Care A.C.C.E.S.S. bill which I introduced last week. I think \nit will go a long way toward ensuring that working families are going \nto get the kind of child care assistance and support they need.\n  Again, I want to say to my colleague from North Dakota that I commend \nhim immensely for the tremendous job he did, and I apologize to him \npublicly for being the source of some annoyance to him as I tried to \nget more money out of him for child care over the last several days. He \nvery generously doubled the investment in child care from $7 billion to \n$14 billion. I thank him for that. Hope springs eternal. There may even \nbe some additional resources made available for child care as we go \nthrough this debate. I am grateful to him and members of the tobacco \ntask force for their attention to the needs of children and child care \nin their legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from \nConnecticut for his gracious assistance, as we move to introduce the \ntobacco legislation. I also want to thank him for his\n\n[[Page S704]]\n\nforceful advocacy. That is what this place is all about. And there is \nno more forceful advocate for children in this Chamber than the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd. He cares deeply about this subject. He \nfights for what he thinks is an appropriate allocation of resources to \nmake the changes that are desirable.\n  So it is not a matter of irritation. It was a matter of tough \nnegotiation, and he is a darned good negotiator. Anybody who is able to \nincrease an allocation they care about by 100 percent--there is only \none person in that category: The Senator from Connecticut. But it was \nfor a good cause, and we very much appreciate his support for the \nlegislation.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Baucus \npertaining to the introduction of S. 1638 are located in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield to my very, very good friend, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia who is the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee and has held more titles around \nhere than I can think of. It is an honor to yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.

Mr. President, it is an unfortunate fact of life in today's \nSenate that, as Members go about the business of fulfilling their \nduties, it is increasingly difficult to find time in our hectic \nschedules to acknowledge the personal milestones of our colleagues. I \nintend to rectify this situation in part today by taking just a few \nminutes to congratulate my friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Arlen \nSpecter, on the occasion of his 68th birthday.\n  Oh, Mr. President, only to be 68 again. Oliver Wendell Holmes said, \n``Oh, just to be 70 again.'' Well, I feel very much in that same mode.\n  Born in the prairie town of Wichita, Kansas, at the start of the \nGreat Depression, Arlen Specter, through the diligent application of \nhis intellect and his tenacity, has become the 1,750th individual to \nserve this great nation as a United States Senator.\n  Mr. President, Senators serve with Presidents. I hope Senators will \nremember that. Senators don't serve under Presidents. Senators serve \nwith Presidents. President is another office, a high office, indeed, in \nthe executive branch. But Senator Specter is the 1,750th individual to \nserve this great Nation as United States Senator, and he has served \nwith Presidents in both parties.\n  Woodrow Wilson reportedly said, ``The profession I chose was \npolitics; the profession I entered was law. I entered the one because I \nthought it would lead to the other.'' Mr. President, I do not know if, \nin Senator Specter's case, he came to the same conclusion or if \npolitics was for him a natural calling, but whatever the case, the \nmelding of politics and law in the person of this thoughtful, soft-\nspoken Pennsylvanian has resulted in an inspired result for the people \nof the Keystone State.\n  A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University Law \nSchool, Arlen Specter began his remarkable public career as an \nassistant district attorney in Philadelphia, where he won the first \nconviction in the Nation of labor racketeers, fought consumer fraud, \nand relentlessly prosecuted corrupt public officials. That willingness \nto take on the tough fights, no matter where they might lead, has \nbecome the hallmark of the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. \nSpecter.\n  But dogged pursuit of righting criminal wrongs is only one facet of \nArlen Specter's many-faceted character. As a Member of the \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate, Senator Arlen Specter has \nworked long hours, and with great determination, in an effort to see \nthat Federal dollars are wisely usedto combat breast cancer, prostate \ncancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Indeed, I believe it is \nfair to say that my friend from Pennsylvania takes a second seat to no \none when it comes to his commitment to doing all that he can to provide \na better, healthier life not only for those whom he represents in \nPennsylvania, but also for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, it is this fortuitous combination of legal acumen, \ntenacity, and compassion for the difficulties of others that has made \nArlen Specter a highly-respected Member of this body, one whose counsel \nis so valuable to all who know him and work with him. As Henri Frederic \nAmiel noted in his Journal on April 7, 1851, ``man becomes man only by \nthe intelligence, but he is man only by the heart.'' Senator Specter is \na superior example of what Henri Frederic Amiel meant by that \npronouncement. So I offer my friend and colleague my heartfelt \ncongratulations, and also my thanks to him for his wisdom, his \ncharacter, and his decency on this day which marks the beginning of his \n68th--almost the beginning--I suppose it is the beginning of his 68th \nyear. Oh, but to be 68 again.\n  So I say to my friend from Pennsylvania:\n\n       The hours are like a string of pearls,\n       The days like diamonds rare,\n       The moments are the threads of gold,\n       That bind them for our wear.\n       So may the years that come to you\n       Such wealth and good contain\n       That every moment, hour and day\n       Be like a golden chain.\n\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend from Montana for his kindness in \nyielding to me. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I join my colleague in congratulating our friend, Senator \nSpecter from Pennsylvania, on his 68th birthday. I have watched Senator \nSpecter over the years, and I can say I do not think there is a Senator \nwith a finer legal mind than the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nparticularly from a criminal law perspective, constitutional law \nperspective, and a prosecutorial perspective as a former prosecutor in \nPennsylvania.\n  He brings to this body tremendous experience and tremendous judgment. \nAnd I join my colleague in wishing our colleague from Pennsylvania the \nvery best returns on his 68th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S704-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S704-S706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NEED FOR ISTEA\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues, to \nurge the Senate to begin the debate on the ISTEA reauthorization bill.\n  That is important for a number of reasons, that I will get to in a \nmoment. But first let me comment on why we find ourselves in this \nposition.\n  As my colleagues know, the current ISTEA legislation expired on \nSeptember 30th of last year.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee, under the leadership of \nour chairman Senator Chafee and our subcommittee chairman Senator \nWarner, reported the 6-year reauthorization bill on October 1.\n  About that same time, the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee reported a stop gap 6-month extension. Unfortunately, as we \nall recall, the Senate bill got caught up in an unrelated debate over \ncampaign finance reform.\n  So, regrettably, last session ended with the Congress--both House and \nSenate--unable to complete action on a long-term bill to reauthorize \nthis important legislation. The best we could do was to extend the \nfunding until May 1 of this year.\n  Now, there is plenty of blame to go around for this unfortunate \nsituation. Whether it was the failure to invoke cloture, or the filling \nof the amendment tree, which prevented Senators from offering \namendments, there were lots of reasons for our failure last year.\n  But that was then, and this is now. And the plain fact is that \npointing fingers at one another about what did, or did not, happen last \nyear will not help us move a reauthorization bill this year.\n\n[[Page S705]]\n\n  So let us stop blaming one another for last year and let us start \nfiguring out how to get the ISTEA legislation reauthorized quickly this \nyear.\n  Now, Mr. President, let me talk about why we need to move quickly \nwith ISTEA. The simple fact is that without quick action, highway \nprojects, safety programs, and transit projects will begin to lose the \nability to meet our country's transportation needs.\n  Already State highway officials tell us that they are beginning to \ndelay projects. Why should this be so?\n  Why are States slowing down, or stopping, some projects--even though \nthere are still 42 days of funding left until the May 1st deadline?\n  The reason is that most highway projects take a long time to \ncomplete. It is not unusual for even relatively simple projects to take \nthree, four or five years to finish. Sometimes even more. And \ncomplicated or controversial projects, such as the Central Artery in \nBoston, can take a decade or two to go from conception to completion.\n  In the highway business, you don't start a project unless you know \nyou will have the funds to complete it.\n  After all, these projects cannot be turned on and turned off like a \nfaucet. Doing so wreaks havoc on the construction itself, on the \nneighborhood, on traffic congestion, and so on.\n  Because these projects extend over many years, they require a \ncertainty in funding that extends over a comparable period. That is why \nhighway bills need to last for several years. ISTEA ran for 6 years. \nThe Senate-reported bill also lasts for 6 years. This time provides a \ngood sense of stability to the financing of projects and allows states \nand communities to plan their transportation programs efficiently.\n  But a short-term extension gives you uncertainty, not stability. \nEspecially for large projects, if states cannot assure that Federal \nmatching funds will be available to finish it, they won't even start \nit. So they delay projects, even if there may be a few weeks of funding \nleft.\n  At the end of my remarks, I will list a few of the States that are \nbeginning to delay projects. I hope my colleagues will pay close \nattention to it. Because the longer we delay a reauthorization bill, \nthe longer this list will grow.\n  Now, let me talk for a few minutes about how the highway program \nworks on the ground. And the process I will describe is essentially the \nsame in every State.\n  Each project normally has three distinct stages--planning, \ndevelopment, and construction. Each stage can last from weeks to years, \ndepending on the specific project. The charts I have here today focus \non the project development stage, that is, the process of taking a \nproject proposed by local government and getting it ready for \nconstruction.\n  As my colleagues can see, it is not simple. A highway project goes \nthrough a very complicated process.\n  The chart on my right shows the first phase--the ``survey phase''.\n  This is the part of a project where State Departments of \nTransportation do such things as prepare for public hearings; begin to \ndraft environmental documents; collect soil samples; begin preliminary \nengineering; assess traffic noise impacts; begin subsurface utility \nrelocation; and assess wetlands and water quality impacts.\n  The second chart, on my left, shows the ``design phase''. Here, \nStates must prepare the design documents for a project. These documents \ninclude traffic access plans; wetland mitigation plans; review of soil \nsamples for hazardous materials; and applications for water quality \npermits.\n  Of course, it also includes preparation of final construction \ndrawings, route alignments, schedules of materials, and the like.\n  The third chart covers the ``right-of-way'' phase. In this phase, \nStates prepare the final environmental documents; determine where \nrights-of-way must be acquired; determine utility relocations; \ndetermine final traffic access controls; obtain wetlands permits; and \nreview all of the documents from the previous design phase.\n  And as I said before, all this must be done before one shovelfull of \ndirt is turned.\n  Now, Mr. President, I explain this process to my colleagues so that \nthey can begin to understand the complicated nature of the highway \nprogram. Every project in every State must go through this type of \nprocess. In Montana, we have over 450 projects going through it. In \nStates with larger transportation budgets, there can be as many as \n1,500 projects in the pipeline.\n  No project can be ready to go to construction if it has been held up \nat any point in the development process. And States will not obligate \nfunds to prepare a project for construction if they are uncertain they \nwill actually be able to construct it at some point.\n  For some projects that are large and complicated, the project \ndevelopment process can be longer than others. But the typical \ndevelopment time for a major construction project can range from five \nto seven years. That is, it can take five to seven years for a project \nto reach the point that it is ready for construction.\n  Once a project is ready for construction, States must still advertise \nthe project--which can take 3 to 4 weeks. Then States must receive \nbids, open the bids and award the contracts. That can take an \nadditional 4 weeks. And workers, equipment and materials must be \nmobilized and brought to the construction site. More time.\n  Finally, there is the time spent on actual construction.\n  With such a complicated, time consuming process, it is important that \nMembers of the Senate understand that even brief interruptions during \nproject development can cascade into lengthy delays in construction.\n  That is why the ISTEA bill runs for six years, to give the States \nsome assurance they will not face wasteful delays and disruptions \ncaused by funding uncertainties. That is also why a short-term \nextension, or worse, a series of short term extensions, is so \ndisruptive.\n  I have heard many Members ask ``what does it matter if we wait until \nlate March or April to do this bill?''. I hope that once Members and \nstaff become more familiar with this program, that will be a simple \nanswer.\n  If we wait to begin the debate until ``later'', this bill will not be \ndone by the May 1st deadline. That means more projects will be delayed. \nIt means thousands of workers will lose jobs. And I am afraid that such \njob losses will begin to happen soon.\n  I have heard of one contractor who plans to lay off his construction \nworkers on May 1st and will not rehire them until at least 30 days \nafter the final conference report is agreed to.\n  That same contractor will not be placing any orders with his \nsuppliers until 45 to 60 days after a new bill is in place because he \nis uncertain he will have construction contracts to work on. And I am \nconfident there are more contractors throughout the country making the \nsame business decision.\n  Mr. President, the hardworking Americans who lose their jobs because \nof these delays will do so through no fault of their own. These folks \nwill be ready to show up for work every day and do a good job. And yet \nthey will be told they must find other work because Congress couldn't \nresolve its differences and get the ISTEA bill reauthorized in time.\n  Every State will feel this pain. Yes, some will hurt more than \nothers. But every State will have to delay projects.\n  As I mentioned earlier in my remarks, some States have already listed \nthe projects that will most likely be delayed if a reauthorization bill \nis not signed into law by May 1st. These are real projects.\n  These are projects that communities were counting on. These are \nprojects that are important for the safety and mobility of drivers and \npedestrians and to relieve congestion in these States.\n  The States that have already made plans to delay projects include: \nKentucky, South Dakota, Maine, Wyoming, Georgia, Nevada, Texas, \nMissouri, Oklahoma, Indiana, New Hampshire, Indiana, North Dakota and \nUtah.\n  More States are expected to announce their plans soon.\n  Mr. President, let's not treat the reauthorization of ISTEA as a \npolitical football. The consequences for all of our States are very \nreal. For those Senators who doubt the impacts, I simply ask that they \ncall their State Department of Transportation. Ask them what they plan \nto do in the coming weeks. I can assure you that it will not be good \nnews.\n  So we have a very important job to do--to reauthorize ISTEA. Let's \nget to it.\n\n[[Page S706]]\n\n  I stand ready to work with the Majority Leader, with Senator Daschle, \nwith my committee leadership, with Senators Byrd and Gramm, with the \nBudget Committee and all my colleagues to find a way to bring this bill \nup as soon as possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for his remarks on this \nvery important subject. I sat and listened to them. I found them to be \nvery illuminating, very interesting, very informative and refreshing.\n  I have been around a good many years. I didn't realize all of the \nsteps, the lengthy process, the consumption of time that is required \nfrom the alpha to the omega of planning and completing the highway. \nThis has been most edifying to me as I have listened. I thank the \nSenator.\n  I recommend to all Senators that they read in the Congressional \nRecord the statement that has been made today by Senator Baucus. He \nsits on the authorizing committee, and he has had an opportunity \nbecause of the jurisdiction of that committee over highways, he has \ninvested many years in the study of this subject matter, and it is a \nreal privilege to have him part of the Senate. I thank him for \nimparting to me, and I am glad I took the time and sat here and \nlistened to him.\n  This vast knowledge--I am sure he could speak all afternoon on this \nsubject without notes. I thank him. His comments have been very \nhelpful. I hope all Senators will read these remarks in the Record and \nthat Senators will join in cosponsoring the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner \namendment.\n  If the Senator will allow me 10 more seconds, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following three Senators be added as cosponsors to the Byrd-\nGramm-Baucus-Warner amendment numbered 1397 to the bill S. 1173, the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997: Senator Dodd, \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend from West Virginia. Nobody has \nworked harder on this issue than he.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to a \nserious and deeply troubling crisis in our country. This is a crisis of \nconfidence, of credibility, and of integrity. Our Nation is indeed at a \ncrossroads. Will we pursue the search for truth, or will we dodge, \nweave, and evade the truth?\n  I am, of course, referring to the investigation into serious \nallegations of illegal conduct by the President of the United States--\nthat the President has engaged in a persistent pattern and practice of \nobstruction of justice. The allegations are grave, the investigation is \nlegitimate, and ascertaining the truth--the whole truth, and nothing \nbut the unqualified, unevasive truth--is absolutely critical. The \nsearch for truth is being led by a highly capable former Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States and a former judge of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit, Kenneth Starr.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply troubled today because Judge Starr's \npursuit of the truth is being undermined every step of the way, every \nsingle day, in the press by those whose sole mission is to attack and \nimpugn the court-appointed independent prosecutor and the \ncongressionally created process. These attackers are not the \njournalists or the broadcasters.\n  Mr. President, what troubles me the most here is that these reckless \nattacks and ruthless onslaughts are being carried out by the closest \nadvisers to the President of the United States.\n  Just this past Sunday on Meet the Press, Paul Begala, Assistant to \nthe President, accused Judge Starr of leaks and lies and called him \n``corrupt.'' That is not a paraphrase, that is a direct quote. He \nactually used the word ``corrupt.'' The smear campaign is being \norchestrated by the White House.\n  Obviously, I can't vouch for the truth or falsity of the obstruction-\nof-justice charges against the President. But what I can tell you is \nthat the assaults on Judge Starr, the character assassination against \nthe court-appointed independent prosecutor, is authorized and approved \nby the President of the United States. And it should stop.\n  The White House and the First Lady have announced that the \nPresident's problems are nothing more than a ``vast right-wing \nconspiracy.'' As many commentators have pointed out, this so-called \nconspiracy is so vast and so broad that it encompasses both the media \nand a White House intern.\n  But I would like to point out today that the vast and broad \nconspiracy just got bigger. Apparently, this vast right-wing conspiracy \nis so sweeping and so pernicious that, in 1993, it compelled a \nDemocrat-chaired Ethics Committee in a Democratic-controlled Congress \nto appoint Judge Kenneth Starr to help investigate whether Republican \nSenator Bob Packwood should be expelled from the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, let me refresh the recollection of the Senate \nregarding the 3-year Packwood investigation, which began in late 1992 \nand ended with Senator Packwood's resignation in 1995.\n  I was the vice chairman, and later the chairman, of the Ethics \nCommittee during that investigation. As everyone will recall, that \ninvestigation was a very sensitive, personal and serious matter. It \ninvolved the allegation that Senator Packwood had ``engaged in sexual \nmisconduct'' and ``attempted to intimidate and discredit the alleged \nvictims, and misuse[d] official staff in attempts to intimidate and to \ndiscredit.''\n  During this lengthy investigation, Senator Packwood objected to the \nEthics Committee's review of his personal diary entries in the fall of \n1993. The committee proposed a process where the diaries would be \nreviewed by an independent hearing examiner who would serve two \nfunctions: First, the examiner would review the diaries to ensure that \nthe committee would see all relevant and probative information. Second, \nthe examiner was asked to protect the privacy interests of Senator \nPackwood, his family and friends.\n\n  The Ethics Committee had to choose a person who was fair, impartial, \nprudent, and trustworthy. Someone who wouldn't be on a vendetta against \nDemocrats or Republicans; someone who had earned the clear respect of \nboth parties; someone with the highest integrity; someone with a clean \ntrack record; a man with sound credentials, who was above reproach. And \nthe Ethics Committee chose such a man.\n  They chose a man who was the son of a Baptist minister, a graduate of \nDuke University Law School, a former clerk for Chief Justice Warren \nBurger. The Ethics Committee--chaired at the time by a Democrat in a \nDemocrat-controlled Congress--chose a man who was the former Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States, a former judge of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals.\n  That man was Kenneth Starr.\n  Let me tell you who was on the committee at that time. The committee \nwas chaired by my colleague from Nevada, Dick Bryan. The Republicans on \nthe committee included myself, Senator Craig and Senator Bob Smith of \nNew Hampshire. The other Democrats were my dear colleagues, Senator \nMikulski of Maryland and the current minority leader, Senator Tom \nDaschle.\n  The matter was not quiet and secretive. The entire U.S. Senate knew \nwho would be called upon to exercise impartiality, discretion, and \njudgment in a highly important and highly sensitive matter. We actually \ndiscussed this matter on the floor of the Senate because there was a \nneeded Senate action to enforce the subpoenas. Senator Alan Simpson \nreferred to Judge Starr as ``a splendid man,'' and ``a man of judgment, \nhonesty, integrity, and common sense.''\n  Senator Arlen Specter stated, ``Many people have spoken about\n\n[[Page S707]]\n\n[Judge Starr's] integrity, and the committee has already endorsed his \nstanding. . . . If Judge Starr makes a judgment, that is the judgment. \nThat is it.''\n  My colleagues on the other side didn't object or dispute that notion. \nFor example, Senator John Kerry, of Massachusetts, voiced the consensus \nopinion when he declared on the Senate floor that ``Judge Starr is \ncertainly a neutral party.''\n  And, it didn't stop with the Democratic-chaired Ethics Committee and \nthe Democrat-controlled Congress. In 1994, the U.S. District Court in \nthe District of Columbia had to choose someone to serve as a special \nmaster to help enforce the Ethics Committee's subpoena for the Packwood \ndiaries.\n  The court had to choose a man who was fair, impartial, prudent, and \ntrustworthy; again, someone who wouldn't be on a vendetta against \nDemocrats or Republicans; again, someone who had earned the clear \nrespect of both parties, and someone with the highest integrity, who \nwas above reproach.\n  The court chose such a man, Mr. President. It chose the former \nSolicitor General of the United States and a former judge of the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals, Kenneth Starr.\n  So, today, we examine the White House's ludicrous, self-serving claim \nof a ``vast right-wing conspiracy'' and find that the conspiracy has \nensnared even more than we would have ever imagined. The ``vast right-\nwing conspiracy'' can now count as members the Democrat-chaired Ethics \nCommittee in 1993 and the then Democrat-controlled Senate. And, lest we \nforget, the conspiracy can also count the Federal District Court for \nthe District of Columbia as one of its members.\n  My point here, Mr. President, is simple: The attacks on Kenneth Starr \nare unfounded and unproductive. The attacks are, in fact, \nunconscionable.\n  Let me point out, as far as this crazy conspiracy theory is \nconcerned, most people would agree that the Senator from Kentucky has \nfairly solid conservative Republican credentials. If somebody were \nengineering a ``vast right-wing conspiracy,'' I think I might have \ngotten wind of it. Furthermore, let me point out that I don't know Ken \nStarr. I do not recall ever meeting him in my 14 years in Washington. \nIf he were a fire-breathing Republican ideologue, one would think that, \nas active in Republican politics as I have been over the last 15 years, \nI might have run into him someplace along the line.\n  The crisis in the White House is a crisis for our entire country. The \ncrisis will only be resolved by a fair and sober search for the truth. \nIt is clear from the record that Judge Starr is the right man for this \njob. I think that it is important for the President and his people to \nstop this smear campaign. Let Ken Starr do his court-appointed job and \nlet the American people learn the truth, the whole truth, and nothing \nbut the truth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S706-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S707-S708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the legislative \npriorities announced today by President Clinton, Vice President Gore, \nSenator Daschle, and Congressman Gephardt.\n  These priorities contain a number of major Democratic initiatives to \nprotect Social Security and to help working families across the country \non key issues such as jobs, education, health care, and the \nenvironment. And I look forward to their enactment this year.\n  One of the pillars of our Democratic agenda is a commitment to raise \nthe minimum wage by 50 cents in each of the next 2 years. Our proposal \nwill increase the minimum wage from its current level of $5.15 an hour \nto $5.65 an hour on January 1, 1999, to $6.15 an hour on January 1 in \nthe year 2000. In 1996, after a hard-fought battle in the last \nCongress, we raised the minimum wage by comparable amounts with no \nadverse effects whatever on the economy. The scare tactics about lost \njobs proved to be as false as they are self-serving.\n  A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute contains documents \nthat the sky hasn't fallen as a result of the last increase. Raising \nthe minimum wage does not cause job loss for teenagers, adults, men, \nwomen, African Americans, Latinos, or anyone else. Twelve million \nAmericans benefited from raising the minimum wage, and they deserve the \nincrease that we are proposing.\n  To have the purchasing power it had in 1989, the minimum wage today \nwould have to be $7.33 an hour. That figure is still well above the \nlevel that we are proposing. That fact is a measure of how far we have \nnot just fallen short but actually fallen back in giving low-income \nworkers their fair share of our extraordinary economic growth.\n  In the past 30 years, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has \ngone up by over 100 percent while the purchasing power of the minimum \nwage has gone down by 30 percent. We know who these minimum wage \nworkers are. Sixty-percent are women. Nearly three-quarters are adults. \nHalf of those who would benefit work full time. Over 80 percent work at \nleast 20 hours a week. They are teacher's aides, child care providers. \nThey are single heads of households with children. They are people who \nclean office buildings in countless communities across the country \nworking 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year.\n  Minimum wage workers earn $10,712 a year, $2,600 below the poverty \nlevel for a family of three. Low-income workers don't just deserve a \nwage; they urgently need a raise. Nationwide, soup kitchens, food \npantries, and homeless shelters are increasingly serving the working \npoor--not just the unemployed.\n\n  In 1996, according to a recent U.S. Conference of Mayors study, 38 \npercent of those seeking emergency food aid held jobs, up from 23 \npercent in 1994. Low-paying jobs are now almost the most frequently \ncited cause of hunger. Officials in 77 percent of cities cited this \nfactor.\n  The American people understand the unfairness of requiring working \nfamilies to subsist on a subpoverty minimum wage.\n  I look forward to the early enactment of the increase we are \nproposing. Twelve million working Americans deserve a helping hand.\n  In good conscience we cannot continue to proclaim and celebrate the \nNation's current prosperity while consigning millions who have jobs to \nlive in continuing poverty. No one who works for a living should have \nto live in poverty in the United States of America.\n  The second pillar of the Democratic agenda is the Patient's Bill of \nRights on health insurance.\n  Few issues are more important to all working families than quality, \naffordable health care. Every family needs and deserves good medical \ncare when a loved one is ill. Every family that has faithfully paid its \npremiums to its insurance plan deserves to receive the benefits the \nplan has promised. The American family knows that this promise is \nbroken too often because unscrupulous insurance companies put profit \nahead of patients.\n  In movie theaters across the country today audiences erupt in \nspontaneous cheers when the character portrayed by actress Helen Hunt \nexplodes in frustration over the callous treatment that she and her son \nreceived from her managed care plan. The movie ``As Good As It Gets'' \nhas been nominated for major academy awards.\n  But managed care today isn't receiving any awards, and neither is \nCongress for our lack of needed action to end these flagrant abuses.\n  The problems are obvious. Insurance company accountants should not be \nallowed to practice medicine. It is time to guarantee women the right \nto see a gynecologist. No breast cancer patient should be forced by \nhealth insurance plans to have a drop-by mastectomy when hospital care \nis needed. No patients with a rare or dangerous disease should be \ndenied the right to be treated by a specialist. No child's health or \nvery life should be at risk because a parent feels forced to drive past \nthe nearest emergency room to a more distant hospital that is the only \nhospital covered by the group plan. No doctor should be subjected to \ngag rules, financial incentives, or financial penalties to prohibit or \ndiscourage them from giving patients the best medical advice. \nReasonable review procedures should be available to anyone denied \ncoverage or treatment by their insurance plan. Patients with an \nincurable\n\n[[Page S708]]\n\nillness should be allowed to participate in clinical trials of new \ntherapies that offer the hope of improvement and cure.\n  The Republican leadership has told the special interests to ``get off \ntheir butts and get out their wallets'' to fight any legislation that \nputs the interests of working families ahead of the interests of \nunscrupulous insurers. But with the President and the congressional \nDemocrats unified for reform, I am confident that we will prevail and \nthat our Patient's Bill of Rights will be signed into law this year.\n  A second health issue that is critical to millions of families is \naccess to health insurance for those too young for Medicare but too \nhold for affordable private coverage.\n  Our Democratic agenda offers these families immediate health and \nhope. We propose to allow them to buy into Medicare at a price that is \nfar more affordable than the private market offers, if it offers them \nany insurance at all.\n  Three million Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have no health \ninsurance. The consequences are often tragic. As a group they are in \nrelatively poor health, and their health continues to deteriorate the \nlonger they are uninsured. They have no protection against the cost of \nserious illness. They are often unable to afford the routine care that \ncan prevent minor illnesses from turning into serious disabilities, or \neven becoming life threatening. The number of uninsured in this group \nis growing every day.\n\n  Between 1991 and 1995, the proportion of today's workers whose \nemployers promise them benefits if they retire early dropped 12 \npercent. Barely a third now have such a promise. In recent years too \nmany who have counted on employer commitment have found themselves with \nonly a broken promise and their coverage canceled after they have \nalready retired.\n  The plight of older workers who lose their jobs through layoffs or \ndownsizing is equally grim. It is difficult to find a new job at 55 or \n60, and it is even harder to a find job that comes with health \ninsurance.\n  For these older Americans who are left out and left behind for no \nfault of their own after decades of hard work, Democrats are offering a \nhelping hand. By allowing these workers to buy affordable coverage \nthrough Medicare, our Democratic proposal is a lifeline for millions of \nthese Americans. It provides a bridge to help them through the years \nbefore full Medicare eligibility. It is a constructive step towards the \nday when every American of any age will finally be guaranteed the \nfundamental right to health care.\n  Our proposal places no additional burden on Medicare. It is fully \npaid for by premiums from the beneficiaries themselves and by savings \nfrom fraud and abuse.\n  Democrats will fight hard for this commonsense approach to helping \nolder workers and their families. And Congress should respond.\n  In addition, on education, President Clinton and the Democrats in \nCongress have also made it a top priority to see that America has the \nbest public schools in the world. We intend to do all we can to see \nthat we have reached that goal.\n  Successful schools need a qualified teacher in every classroom making \nsure that children get the individual attention they need. That is why \nanother main pillar of the Democratic agenda is to provide 100,000 new \nteachers for America's public schools. The shortage has forced school \ndistricts to hire more than 50,000 uncertified teachers a year, or ask \ncertified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise. One in \nfour new teachers dot not fully meet State certification requirements, \nand 12 percent of new hires have no teacher training at all.\n  In Massachusetts, 30 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools do \nnot even have a minor degree in their field.\n  Our Democratic proposal will also encourage State efforts to reduce \nclass size by providing additional teachers needed to fill the smaller \nclassrooms.\n  Our proposal will also help schools meet their urgent needs for \nrepair, renovation, modernization, and new construction.\n  Investing in schools is one of the best investments America could \npossibly make. For schools across America, help can't come a minute too \nsoon, and our Democratic proposal provides it.\n  On key issues, such as the minimum wage, health care, and education, \nthe Democratic priorities put working families first.\n  Our proposals are investments in a better life for all of our \nfamilies and a better future for the country. Special interests will \nfight hard to keep these proposals from becoming law. But Democrats in \nCongress and the President will fight harder because we know that the \nAmerican people are with us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S707-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S708-S716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe that Senator Daschle will join me \non the floor shortly because he and I would like to, in effect, have a \njoint statement with regard to Iraq because we want the message to be \nunambiguous, very clear to America and to our allies around the world, \nand to Iraq about our attitude and what our intentions are with regard \nto this very important matter.\n\n  I just had a call from Senator John Warner, who is in Russia today \nalong with Senator Carl Levin. They are escorting Secretary of Defense \nBill Cohen. They have already been to six countries since they were in \nGermany. I believe perhaps even the Senator from Arizona, the Presiding \nOfficer, was there. They have gone throughout the Arab world, and now \nthey are in Russia.\n  He tells me that he believes that when they return, Secretary Cohen \nand the two Senators will bring a great deal of helpful information to \nthe Senate and to the American people about what they have heard in the \nArab world and what they have heard from our allies in those areas' \nmeetings. They believe that they will be able to answer some of the \nvery important questions that Senators have been asking.\n  So we will look forward to their return.\n  I had hoped that we could get to the point where we could pass a \nresolution this week on Iraq. But we really developed some physical \nproblems, if nothing else. Senator Warner and Senator Levin would like \nvery much to be a part of the discussion about what the situation will \nbe and how we should proceed on Iraq. They would like to be here. And \nother Senators are necessarily not going to be able to be here beyond \nthis afternoon.\n  So we have decided that the most important thing is not to move so \nquickly but to make sure that we have had all the right questions asked \nand answered and that we have available to us the latest information \nabout what is expected or what is going to be happening with our allies \nin the world.\n  I was noting, I say to Senator Daschle, that I just talked to Senator \nWarner in Russia, and he was telling me that Secretary Cohen and \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin are looking forward to coming back and \ngiving us a full report on their trip to the Arab world. Now they are \nin Russia today.\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that the entire world is watching the \ncurrent crisis between Iraq and the international community unfold. \nThis is another showdown caused by Saddam Hussein.\n  The Iraqi dictator has decided that his weapons-of-mass-destruction \nprogram is more important than the welfare of his own people. At a time \nwhen we have been getting reports--in fact, we have seen children \nsuffering from malnutrition--this dictator has been building $1.5 \nbillion in additional palaces. He has already endured 7 years of \nsanctions so that he can develop biological, chemical, and nuclear \nweapons --and the means to deliver them.\n  This is a very serious matter. For some time we--and I mean America \nand our allies--have been working to develop a resolution on Iraq that \nhas broad bipartisan support and also one that would bring the \nsituation under control there by diplomatic efforts hoping to avoid \nmilitary action. But that has not happened yet.\n  I believe we are moving toward a consensus in the Senate on a number \nof the key issues that must be addressed as we look to the future. And \nhere they are.\n  First of all, Saddam Hussein does pose a real threat to the region \nand to\n\n[[Page S709]]\n\nthe entire world. I believe the Senate recognizes that. I hope that the \nAmerican people recognize that. This is not a hypothetical danger that \nhas been dreamed up by some armchair strategists. There is a long track \nrecord in this area of actions by Saddam Hussein. He poses a clear and \npresent danger without equal in the post-cold-war-world. He is \ndangerous. He is a threat to his neighbors. He is a destabilizing force \nin the whole region. And, yes, he is actually a threat all over the \nworld including the United States. This is a man who has already \ninvaded two of his neighbors. Iraq has used chemical weapons inside and \noutside its borders. It has launched missiles against Saudi Arabia and \nagainst Israel. Hussein tried to murder former President George Bush in \n1993.\n  Now, we should not make any mistake and think that a military action, \nif it comes to that, is going to rehabilitate Saddam Hussein or even \neliminate him. He does not have any desire to join the civilized world, \napparently, and he has shown that he can survive even when the whole \nworld has concerns with his conduct and has taken unified action to \nstop his aggression.\n  Second, I think there is a consensus in the Senate that military \nforce is justified if diplomatic actions fail in responding to the \nthreat that Saddam Hussein poses. The threat is serious and our \nresponse must be serious.\n  Now, any military force that is used does entail risks, to our \nmilitary, to our allies and even to our country if there is an attempt \nat retaliation. The American people need to understand that, and we \nneed to think about it carefully. And we need to talk about the risks \nthat are involved. That is one reason why, when we bring up a \nresolution, if it is necessary--and I assume it will be--we must make \nsure that every Senator who wants to be heard can be heard.\n  I remember when we had a similar debate back in the early nineties. I \nthink some 80 Senators spoke. Now, this time we won't have 500,000 \ntroops amassed on the ground ready to go in, but it is still a very \nserious matter, and I want to make sure that we don't try to restrict \nSenators. In fact, we could not. Senator Daschle knows if we asked \nunanimous consent to bring this resolution up today and vote on it in 4 \nhours, we would not get it; the Senate is known for its deliberate \nactions. And the longer I stay in the Senate, the more I have learned \nto appreciate it. It does help to give us time to think about the \npotential problems and the risks and the ramifications and to, frankly, \npress the administration. I feel better this week than I did last week \nbecause of the responses we are getting about how this is being thought \nout and what would be the military action and what will be the long-\nterm plans to deal with Saddam Hussein. We are beginning to get some \nanswers now. I believe the administration is thinking harder about what \nthose answers should be because the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, \nhas raised these questions, not in a critical way, not in a threatening \nway, but in an honest way of saying, have you thought about this? What \nabout this approach? Can we do more? I think that has served a very \npositive purpose.\n  Some people have said to me, even back in my own State, ``This is not \na threat to us. Let them deal with that over there.'' Who? Who is going \nto deal with it? If America does not lead, who is going to lead? Nobody \nelse.\n  Now, our allies can, should, and, I believe, will join us if action \nis necessary. But we are going to have to lead the way. We are going to \nhave to make the tough decisions. And people need to understand that \nthis threat could even apply to us. While it may be a direct threat of \na Scud missile in the region with a chemical warhead even, it could \nvery easily be a threat to Paris or some city in the U.S. involving \nanthrax that's been produced by Saddam Hussein.\n  These are terrible things to even think about, but you are dealing \nwith a person who has already used terrible actions against his own \npeople. And so he is not so far removed. We are the ones who have to \nprovide the direction. And we have to make sure people understand it is \na threat to the whole world.\n  In my view, the decisive use of force against Iraq coupled with the \nlong-term strategy to eliminate the threat entails less risks in the \nlong run than allowing Saddam Hussein's actions and ambitions to go \nunchecked. You cannot do it when you are dealing with a situation like \nthis. In the words of former Secretary of State Jim Baker, ``The only \nthing we shouldn't do is do nothing.'' We cannot allow that to be the \nresult or what we do is nothing.\n  The administration has agreed with us that funding for the operations \nin and around Iraq require supplemental appropriations. We had very \ngrave concerns by the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and Senator \nDomenici about how much will this cost? How is it going to be paid for? \nWe cannot continue to say ``just take it out of your hide'' to the \nPentagon; it is having an effect on morale, quality of life, on \nreadiness and modernization. We already have a very high tempo for our \nmilitary men and women in the Navy and Air Force. We are satisfied that \nthey now have made a commitment that they are going to come up and ask \nfor funding for both these purposes, in Bosnia and, if necessary, in \nIraq. And these will be emergency requests so it will not come out of \nnecessary improvements in barracks or spare parts for aircraft, which \nare very important.\n\n  There is a consensus on seriously examining now I believe long-term \npolicy options to increase the pressure on Saddam Hussein. The \nadministration and Congress and our allies all look forward to dealing \nwith a post-Saddam regime. But the question is how to get there.\n  That is intended not to be a threat or say we should violate the law; \nit is intended to start the discussion, start the thinking about how \ncan we increase these pressures. And we have to have a strategy to deal \nwith whatever comes after the military option. Many things have been \nsuggested. Toughen sanctions--not loosen sanctions, toughen sanctions. \nWhat about an embargo, what about expanding no-fly, no-drive zones? \nWhat about the support of opposition forces?\n  There is a long list of suggestions, some that I will not even put in \nthe record here, but they are worth thinking about. Our model should be \nthe Reagan doctrine of rollback, not the Truman doctrine of containment \nin this instance. And I don't mean that as critically as it sounds. It \nis just that there are two different doctrines, and the doctrine here \nshould be rollback, not containment.\n  Despite our areas of agreement that we have clearly reached--Senator \nDaschle and I have been working together making sure every word is \nsanitized in the potential resolution--it is obvious we cannot get it \ndone this week for physical reasons as much as anything else. And I \nremind my colleagues and the American people it was 5 months after \nSaddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, 5 months before Congress passed a \nresolution authorizing the use of force to expel him. In this case, we \nhave a bipartisan effort, trying to make sure that the right thing is \ngoing to be done and that the right language is developed. Unlike what \nwe had in the early 1990's when the Speaker and majority leader were \nworking to defeat the administration's policy, you now have a Speaker \nand a majority leader and the Democratic leader and the minority leader \nin the House all working together with the administration to make sure \nthat the language is right and that the actions are right.\n  Yes, more time may be needed for diplomacy and more time to think \nabout the long-term plans, but a point will come when time will run out \nand action must go forward. When that comes, when U.S. Armed Forces are \nsent into harm's way, by the President of the United States, they will \nhave the backing of the Senate and the American people. If the \nPresident makes the decision to deploy military force against the \nthreat posed by Iraq, America will be united, united and praying for \nthe safety of our men and women in uniform, united in hoping casualties \nare kept to a minimum, and united in hoping for and supporting a \nsuccessful effort.\n  I just want to make that point clear today. Nobody should interpret \nthe fact that we don't vote on a resolution today as meaning that we \nare not united in the fundamental principles. We are. But we want to \nmake sure that when we do take military action, we have thought about \nall the ramifications and the resolution that we come up with will have \nthe involvement of\n\n[[Page S710]]\n\n100 Senators, with 100 Senators being present and voting, and that \nevery word is the appropriate word that reflects the best interests of \nthe American people.\n  So I am pleased to stand here this afternoon and make this statement \nand to assure my colleagues that I will continue to work with every \nSenator on both sides of the aisle to make sure we take the appropriate \naction, if it is necessary, when we return week after next.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I am looking forward to hearing \nSenator Daschle's comments on this subject.\n  Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I begin by complimenting the majority leader on his \nremarks and on the manner in which he has conducted himself and his \nleadership with regard to this issue. He has noted the strong desire on \nthe part of all four leaders in Congress to demonstrate with absolute \nclarity the need for bipartisanship when it comes to sending as clear a \nmessage as we can. His remarks and his actions have demonstrated that, \nand I support fully his decision not to bring the resolution to the \nfloor today.\n  Obviously, there are times when matters of this import need to be \nfully discussed and must by their nature involve every Senator. Two of \nthe most important Senators to provide contributions to this debate are \ntraveling on one of the most important missions related to this whole \nexercise and cannot be with us today.\n  In addition to that, we continue to consult with colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle in an effort to come up with the clearest and most \naccurate statement with regard to the position to be expressed by the \nSenate. So for all of those reasons and many others, Senator Lott and I \nwill continue to work with our colleagues and schedule a time that will \nprovide for the opportunity for all Senators to be heard and for debate \nto take place on this very important matter.\n  But, so that there will be no misunderstanding, we come to the floor \ntoday jointly--and we will be joined by several others--to speak with \none voice to condemn in the strongest possible terms Iraq's refusal to \ncomply with international law. To condemn Iraq's refusal to fulfill its \ncommitments to the international community. To send a clear message to \nSaddam Hussein that American resolve to force Iraqi compliance with \ninternational law and their own commitments is unwavering; to make \nclear that U.S. national interests are threatened if Saddam Hussein is \nallowed to thwart the international community's efforts to shut down \nhis development of weapons of mass destruction programs.\n  Although Senator Lott and I come from different political parties and \nmay differ on issues from time to time, there ought to be no mistake \nabout our position today. We stand united in sending the message to \nIraq that it has no option other than to comply with the terms of the \nU.N. Security Council resolutions.\n  We have chosen to speak together today to send this important message \nas the President and members of his Administration work diligently to \ndemonstrate to Iraq and the world the strength of our commitment to \ninternational security. It is a demonstration of our resolve--which is \nshared by the American people--that Iraq shall not be permitted to \ndevelop and deploy an arsenal of frightening chemical and biological \nweapons under any circumstances.\n  U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 requires Iraq to disclose and \ndestroy its weapons of mass destruction capabilities and to commit \nunconditionally to never reviving those programs. Resolution 687 \nestablished the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) to verify \nIraqi compliance with these provisions and required that international \neconomic sanctions against Iraq remain in place until those conditions \nare met.\n  The Iraqi government has repeatedly and deliberately impeded UNSCOM's \nattempts to ensure that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs are \ndestroyed. The Iraqis have consistently thwarted UNSCOM's efforts to \nconduct their inspections unhindered--despite clear concerns about \nIraq's remaining chemical and biological weapons capabilities. UNSCOM \npersonnel have served admirably under extremely difficult, and often \ndangerous, conditions. In the face of concerted Iraqi intimidation and \ndeception, UNSCOM has discovered numerous violations of U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions requiring an end to Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction programs. In fact, more Iraqi chemical and biological \nweapons have been destroyed as a result of UNSCOM's inspections than \nduring all of Operation Desert Storm.\n  Iraq's actions pose a serious and continued threat to international \npeace and security. It is a threat we must address. Saddam is a proven \naggressor who has time and again turned his wrath on his neighbors and \non his own people. Iraq is not the only nation in the world to possess \nweapons of mass destruction, but it is the only nation with a leader \nwho has used them against his own people.\n  It is essential that a dictator like Saddam not be allowed to evade \ninternational strictures and wield frightening weapons of mass \ndestruction. As long as UNSCOM is prevented from carrying out its \nmission, the effort to monitor Iraqi compliance with Resolution 687 \nbecomes a dangerous shell game. Neither the United States nor the \nglobal community can afford to allow Saddam Hussein to continue on this \npath.\n  Secretaries Albright and Cohen, in their trips to the Persian Gulf \nand elsewhere, are sending the important message that, while the United \nStates certainly prefers a diplomatic course, we are willing to use \nforce to block Iraq's ability to develop and use an arsenal of chemical \nand biological weapons if diplomatic efforts do not achieve this \nresult. While there are clear differences among the leaders they have \ntalked with, they have found unanimity on at least 2 issues.\n  First, U.N. weapons inspectors must have unfettered access to suspect \nIraqi sites. Second, Saddam Hussein is solely responsible for creating \nthis crisis by not adhering to the Security Council resolutions in the \nfirst place.\n  The foreign ministers of the 6-member Gulf Cooperation Council--Saudi \nArabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Qatar--stated \nthis most clearly just yesterday:\n\n       The current crisis is a direct result of Baghdad's \n     reluctance to cooperate with United Nations weapons \n     inspectors and its determination to defy the will of the \n     international community with respect to the elimination of \n     its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction . . . The only \n     solution to spare the people of Iraq additional hardship and \n     dangers is the Iraqi regime's implementation of the U.N. \n     resolutions which it had previously accepted.\n\n  The United States continues to exhaust all diplomatic efforts to \nreverse the Iraqi threat. But absent immediate Iraqi compliance with \nResolution 687, the security threat doesn't simply persist--it worsens. \nSaddam Hussein must understand that the United States has the resolve \nto reverse that threat by force, if force is required And, I must say, \nit has the will.\n  Secretary Albright sent the message in its purest form: ``Saddam does \nnot have a menu of choices, he has one: Iraq must comply with the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolutions and provide U.N. inspectors with the \nunfettered access they need to do their job.''\n  We are here today to affirm that we and the American people stand \nwith the President and the international community in an effort to end \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and preserve our vital \nnational and international security interests.\n  The Senate has been working on a concurrent resolution expressing \nCongress's concern about Iraq's refusal to cooperate with U.N. weapons \ninspectors and urging the President to respond to this threat. In doing \nso, the Senate has grappled with some of the very difficult issues \nsurrounding Congress's role in the decision to use military force. \nPerhaps too much had been made of the differences among Members of \nCongress about exactly how to approach this problem. That is \nunderstandable. There are always ways\n\n[[Page S711]]\n\nin which to change the wording. But there is no way in which to change \nthe message. The message is fundamentally and unequivocally clear, the \nmost important message of all. Iraq must comply. There is no choice. We \nstand united in our determination to do whatever is necessary to \nachieve our goal. Iraq must comply. The United States has the resolve \nto ensure that compliance and we stand united today in an effort to \narticulate that very clear message as loudly, as unequivocally, and in \nas much of a bipartisan way as we can.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, no one should doubt for a moment the \nresolve of the United States to respond with force, if necessary, to \nIraq's continued flagrant violation of United Nations Security Council \nresolutions.\n  Vigorous diplomacy has been pursued over the past three months, but, \nthus far, Saddam Hussein has shown that he has no interest in a \npeaceful solution on anything other than his own terms. We cannot allow \nthis tyrant to prevail over the will of the international community. \nOur national security would be seriously compromised by a failure to \nstand up to the challenge he has confronted us with.\n  Our strategic objective is to contain Saddam Hussein and curtail his \nability to produce the most deadly weapons known to mankind--weapons \nthat he has unleashed with chilling alacrity against his own people. \nLeft unchecked, Saddam Hussein would in short order be in a position to \nthreaten and blackmail our regional allies, our troops, and, indeed, \nour nation.\n  Let me take just a moment to recount how we have come to the point \nwhere military force may be employed in the near future.\n  For nearly seven years, Iraq has engaged in a cat and mouse game with \nthe international inspectors that comprise the United Nations Special \nCommission. It has obstructed UNSCOM from fulfilling its mandate to \nmonitor, investigate, and destroy Iraq's capacity to produce weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  In spite of Iraq's tenacious efforts at concealment and obstruction, \nUNSCOM has uncovered and destroyed more weapons of mass destruction \nthan were destroyed during the entire gulf war. UNSCOM has revealed \nIraqi lie after Iraqi lie.\n  Last October, Iraq threatened to expel all American members of the \nspecial commission. Ambassador Richard Butler, the chairman of UNSCOM, \nresponded appropriately by withdrawing all inspectors rather than \nhaving his staff of professionals segregated on the basis of their \nnationality.\n  The ensuing stand-off led to diplomatic intervention by Russia. \nEventually, Iraq relented by allowing UNSCOM back into the country.\n  But the central issue of unconditional and unfettered access by \nUNSCOM was left unresolved. Ambassador Butler visited Baghdad in \nDecember to try to resolve this issue, but to no avail.\n  Then, last month, Iraq refused to cooperate with a team of inspectors \ninvestigating Iraq's efforts at concealment. It made preposterous \ncharges that the American head of the team, Scott Ritter, was a spy.\n  During a subsequent visit by Ambassador Butler, Iraq struck a defiant \nnote. It vowed never to open so-called ``presidential and sovereign \nsites'' to inspection. In a recent speech, Saddam Hussein stated his \ndecision to expel UNSCOM by May 20 if sanctions remain in place.\n  The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly condemned Iraq's \nnon-compliance. Since October of last year, on seven separate \noccasions, the Security Council has demanded that Iraq fulfill its \nobligations.\n  But Saddam Hussein has made clear that it is more important to him to \nretain the capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction than it is \nto comply with the resolutions that would allow sanctions to be lifted. \nOnce again he has proven what little regard he has for the suffering of \nhis people.\n  The international community has exhibited enormous patience with \nIraq. But that patience has reached its limit.\n  Time has run out. If Iraq does not comply immediately and \nunconditionally with United Nations Security Council resolutions \ndemanding unfettered access for U.N. weapons inspectors, I believe that \nPresident Clinton will have no choice but to order the use of air \npower.\n  Unfortunately, we have learned over the past several years that the \nIraqi Government, and more specifically its leader, only seem to \nunderstand the blunt language of force.\n  In recent weeks, several questions and criticisms have been raised \nwith respect to President Clinton's policy. I would like to take a \nmoment to respond to some of these comments.\n  Questions have been asked about our objectives. The objectives have \nbeen defined precisely. They are to curtail and delay Saddam Hussein's \ncapacity to produce and deliver weapons of mass destruction and his \nability to threaten his neighbors. We have been told by the Joint \nChiefs of Staff that a military plan has been developed that would \nfulfill these objectives.\n  In a sense, the international coalition now assembling forces in the \nPersian Gulf will accomplish through the use of force what UNSCOM would \nbe doing were it allowed to do its job. Secretary Cohen has told us \nthat there is no substitute for having UNSCOM on the ground, but we are \nleft with little choice if UNSCOM is prevented from carrying out its \nduties.\n  When the objectives have been explained, the next question that \narises is what are the next steps. But this question is based upon the \nflawed premise that the use of force reflects a new policy. In fact, \nthe use of force for the purposes outlined by the President is an \nintegral part of the long-standing policy of containing Iraq.\n  Containment is a very unsatisfying policy at an emotional level. It \nlacks finality and it requires patience and staying power. But it meets \nour strategic objective of preventing Iraq from threatening our \nnational security interests.\n  Containment is the best of three bad options available to us. The \nother two options would be to do nothing, or to send in several hundred \nthousand ground troops to occupy Iraq. Neither of these policies is \nviable.\n  Doing nothing would encourage Iraqi defiance and lead to a complete \ncollapse of the constraints that have been placed upon Iraqi behavior \nsince the end of the gulf war. It would be the surest way to \nrehabilitate Saddam Hussein.\n  Just as unpalatable is the prospect of sending in several hundred \nthousand ground troops to change the Iraqi regime. I believe that there \nis little support for such an operation in the Congress or the public. \nIt would also raise a series of questions:\n  Would we be prepared to occupy and rebuild Iraq over a period of \nseveral years?\n  Would we be prepared for the real possibility that a march on Baghdad \nmight lead Saddam Hussein to unleash his weapons of mass destruction?\n  Would any other nation support us for an action that is clearly \noutside the bounds of security council resolutions? To this point those \nresolutions have provided the basis for all U.S. military action \nagainst Iraq since the gulf war.\n  In the end, the only policy that stands up to scrutiny is that of \ncontainment, which the Clinton administration has followed and the Bush \nadministration before it followed.\n  Finally, another question that has arisen is whether the President \nshould obtain specific authorization to use force. I believe that the \nPresident would be wise to obtain such authorization.\n  The executive branch contends that it already has sufficient legal \nauthority, under Public Law 102-1--the use of force resolution passed \nby Congress before the gulf war. The argument, as I understand it, may \nbe summarized as follows:\n  In Public Law 102-1, Congress authorized the President to use United \nStates Armed Forces:\n  ``Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678. \nSecurity Council Resolution 678, passed by the Council in November, \n1990, authorized members of the United Nations to ``use all necessary \nmeans to uphold and implement Resolution 660 (1990) (The resolution \nwhich called for Iraqi forces to leave Kuwait) and all subsequent \nrelevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in \nthe [Persian Gulf] area.''\n  Following the gulf war, in April, 1991, the Security Council passed \nResolution 687, which set the terms of the cease-\n\n[[Page S712]]\n\nfire and required Iraq to accept the destruction or removal, under \ninternational supervision, of its weapons of mass destruction. By its \nterms, it reaffirmed Resolution 678, and all prior council resolutions \nregarding Iraq.\n  Because Security Council Resolution 678 provided broad authority for \nnations to enforce ``all subsequent relevant resolutions'' and ``to \nrestore peace and security in the area,'' and, because peace and \nsecurity has not been restored to the Persian Gulf--indeed, Iraq is \ncurrently in violation of the cease-fire resolution--then the \nresolutions from 1990 and 1991, both by the Security Council and \nCongress, the administration contends, would still have legal force.\n  Moreover, Congress has never modified or repealed Public Law 102-1, \nso absent further congressional action, and absent the restoration of \npeace and security to the gulf, the President still has the legal \nauthority to use military action against Iraq. Or so the \nadministration's argument goes.\n  As a strong advocate of Congress exercising its powers under the \nConstitution in authorizing the use of force, I must admit to some \nskepticism about this theory. In my own research of the question, I \nhave consulted several eminent constitutional scholars. My conclusion \nis that the administration's argument may be legally tenable--if barely \nso--and would probably be sustained in a court of law.\n  But merely because the position may be legally sufficient--and the \ncourts are notoriously deferential to the executive in matters of war \nand peace (if they agree to consider the case at all)--I do not believe \nit would be wise precedent, or wise policy, of the President to proceed \nwith renewed military action against Iraq without a clear \nauthorization, newly enacted by this Congress. Indeed, because the \nquestion is a close one--and because we have a different President than \nwe did in 1991, and a significant change in the membership of Congress \nsince that time--it would be prudent for President Clinton to seek a \nnew expression of legal authorization from Congress.\n  Mr. President, we should all hope for a genuine diplomatic solution \nto this stand-off, but no one should doubt our resolve to use force if \nit becomes necessary.\n  We have little choice in this matter. Important principles and vital \nnational interests are at stake.\n  First and foremost, an Iraq left free to develop weapons of mass \ndestruction would pose a grave threat to our national security. The \ncurrent regime in Iraq has repeatedly demonstrated its aggressive \ntendencies toward its neighbors. It has also displayed a callous \nwillingness to use chemical weapons to achieve its aims.\n  Recently, we have heard chilling reports of possible biological \nweapons experiments on humans. An UNSCOM Inspector has spoken of \ninformation that points to a secret biological weapons production \nfacility. And Ambassador Richard Butler has told us that Iraq could \nwell have missile warheads filled with anthrax capable of striking Tel \nAviv.\n  An asymmetric capability of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons \ngives an otherwise weak country the power to intimidate and blackmail. \nWe risk sending a dangerous signal to other would-be proliferators if \nwe do not respond decisively to Iraq's transgressions. Conversely, a \nfirm response would enhance deterrence and go a long way toward \nprotecting our citizens from the pernicious threat of proliferation.\n  Second, a failure to uphold United Nations resolutions would diminish \nthe credibility of the Security Council. As much as we might like to \ndeal with every threat we face on our own, in reality it is impractical \nand unrealistic. Instinctively, we all know that we are much better off \nwhen we have the support of the international community when facing \ncommon threats.\n  But in order for the Security Council to respond effectively to \nthreats to international peace and security that might arise in the \nfuture, it is important that those who would violate the will of the \ninternational community pay a steep price for their actions. Iraq \noffers an important test case for the Security Council. Capitulating to \nIraqi defiance could spell a dismal future for the Security Council in \nhandling the central matters of international peace and security for \nwhich it was created.\n  I hope that the Russians, French, and Chinese keep in mind that it is \nnot in their interest to see the authority of the Security Council \ndiminished.\n  It is difficult to overstate the stakes involved.\n  Fateful decisions will be made in the days and weeks ahead. At issue \nis nothing less than the fundamental question of whether or not we can \nkeep the most lethal weapons known to mankind out of the hands of an \nunreconstructed tyrant and aggressor who is in the same league as the \nmost brutal dictators of this century.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I, too, want to commend our two \nleaders for working together on this very important issue. I think all \nof us believe that it is our responsibility, as the U.S. Senate, to \nwork in a bipartisan way with the President of the United States on an \nissue as grave as attacking another country and sending our troops into \nharm's way. I believe the administration will work with this Congress \nand I believe we will have a comfort level that there is a plan and \nthat our troops will be sent on a mission that is very clear. That is \nwhat this is all about.\n  The message we are sending to Saddam Hussein today is clear: You may \neither join the community of nations, abide by the resolutions of the \nUnited Nations, or there will be serious consequences. I don't know \nanyone who disagrees with that proposition.\n  We have often debated the importance of international arms control \nagreements, such as the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty among others. What is clear is that without the resolve \nof the international community to enforce these standards, they are \nmeaningless. Saddam Hussein has threatened the peace in the Middle East \nbefore. His people have suffered mightily for it. But even at that time \nhe did not deploy weapons of mass destruction. We cannot provide him a \nsecond chance.\n  International inspectors have concluded that he is continuing to \ndevelop an arsenal of these horrible weapons. He has used them in the \npast, so why wouldn't we believe that he would use them again, unless \nhe is stopped? Just to put this in perspective, when you talk about \nchemical weapons or biological weapons, someone may say, ``So, what is \nthat? Does that make that much difference? Is that really something \nthat could harm the neighbors of Iraq, or harm the people of any other \ncountry?''\n  Anthrax is one of these weapons. A few pounds--think of what that is. \nIt's something that is about this big. A few pounds of anthrax could \nwipe out a city the size of Washington, DC. We know that Saddam Hussein \nhas the capability to produce this type of weapon. We know he has Scud \nmissiles, we have seen them. Put that on top of a Scud missile and what \ndoes that do to the security of the neighbors of Iraq?\n  Chemical or biological agents could be introduced into the water \nsupply of any city and kill thousands of people. That is the kind of \nweapon we are talking about. So, if you are talking about, is this \nreally an issue? Is this something that we need to stop? I just ask \nyou, if a few pounds of this kind of agent can kill the inhabitants of \na city the size of Washington, DC, who in the world is safe, if someone \nis manufacturing these and has used them on innocent people before?\n  The United States led in the gulf war. We will lead again. And we \nwill do so with the support of the American people. We are going to \nstand against nuclear, chemical or biological weapons in the hands of \nsomeone so irresponsible as Saddam Hussein, who has a record that is \nknown of killing innocent people. We look for support from the \ninternational community as we had it in Desert Storm, and as I hope we \ncan count on for the future.\n  We must not let there be a doubt of the resolve of the American \npeople. Saddam Hussein must know that we speak with one voice. We need \nthe resumption of inspections, for Saddam Hussein to show that he wants \nto be a part of the international community. Military force is \njustified as part of an overall strategy. Our leader has said that. \nWhat Congress will be looking\n\n[[Page S713]]\n\nfor, what the American people will be looking for from the President \nand his advisers, is an overall strategy so we know what we are looking \nat, what our troops are going to be asked to do; so that we can provide \nour troops with all the means they need to do the job and the \nprotection they need when they are in the field.\n  I hope that part of an overall strategy will be the beginning of the \ncommunication directly with the people of Iraq, with the good and \ndecent people who have fled the country, to say we want to support you \nand we want you to know that the weapons that are being held could be \ntotally deadly to you, to your children, and to the people that live \nthroughout the country of Iraq. What we want to do is make that a safe \narea so the people will be free and so they can join the community of \nnations for a lasting peace in the Middle East. Our forces are \nprepared. They will be capable of dealing a harsh lesson once again. I \nhope it will not be necessary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to express my personal gratitude \nto the Senate majority leader, to the Senate Democratic leader, to my \ncolleague from Texas who has just spoken for their eloquent statements, \nbut really more for the unmistakable message that they send, which is \nthat there are ultimately times of conflict abroad that involve the \nvital interests of the United States, as the current situation in Iraq \ndoes, no Democrats, no Republicans, only Americans standing side by \nside in support of the Commander in Chief and all those Americans in \nuniform who serve under him.\n  That, I hope, is the message that will be heard in Baghdad, most \nimportantly. If the Commander in Chief of the United States decides \nthat military force is necessary to be employed against Iraq, the \noverwhelming majority of Members of the U.S. Senate will stand strongly \nbehind him and behind those American personnel in uniform who will \ncarry out that policy.\n  Mr. President, the statements of the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader are the finest examples of bipartisanship and \nstatesmanship. They remind us, though there may be disagreements in \nthis Chamber on partisan lines, that, again, when challenged, when it \ncomes to America's vital interests abroad, we will stand together above \nparty lines.\n  The administration has been very accessible, very forthcoming in \nconsulting with both Houses of Congress about the challenge that Saddam \nHussein and Iraq represent to us and to the security of our allies in \nthe region and our soldiers in the region and of the world in general. \nI think we have to express our appreciation to the administration for \nthat dialog that continues.\n  What is at stake in Iraq today? For one, something that might be \nconsidered quaint in some quarters, meaningless in other quarters, \ninternational agreements are at stake, agreements to end the gulf war, \npromises made by Saddam Hussein about allowing inspections which would \nenable us--the world--to guarantee that he was keeping his promises to \ndisarm, a request justifiably made by the victorious forces in \nOperation Desert Storm and required of those who were vanquished in \nthat conflict. So it is the integrity of these agreements, in the first \ninstance, that is at stake.\n  Secondly, there are consequences, which is the threat that Saddam \nHussein will use those weapons of mass destruction that we know he has; \nthat he will use the ballistic missile, the delivery system capacity to \ndeliver those weapons of mass destruction that we know he has in \nrudiment and is developing even further.\n  We know, as one of my colleagues said a moment ago--I believe it was \nSenator Daschle--unlike other leaders in the world, including \ndictatorial leaders of rogue nations who possess weapons of mass \ndestruction, this particular leader, Saddam Hussein, has used those \nweapons against his neighbor, Iran, in the Iran-Iraq war in the \neighties, and against the Kurdish population of his own country.\n  So our anger, our anxiety, our unease, our judgment that we have \nvital interests at stake is not theoretical. It is based on a course of \nbehavior by this particular leader of this particular nation. We went \nthrough the entire cold war with enormous amounts of nuclear power in \nour hands and in the hands of the Soviet leaders, but there was, in the \nend, a kind of understanding based on a strange form of civilized \npremise, which is that those weapons would not ultimately be used, and \nthey were not ultimately used. I don't think we can reach that same \nconclusion about this leader based on his own course of behavior.\n  There is a way in which there is a line to be drawn in this case, \njust as we drew a line in the post-cold-war-world, when Saddam invaded \nKuwait and threatened our neighbors and vital economic interests and \nenergy supplies in that region and we acted, reacted and reacted \nforcefully and rolled him back. Just as in Bosnia, we saw ethnic \nconflict could divide Europe and create broader conflict there, and we \nacted and stopped it. So, too, in this case, we are called upon to show \nthat we are willing to draw a line, a preventive line, against those \nwho possess weapons of mass destruction--chemical and biological; some \nhave called them the poor nations' nuclear weapons--that we will draw a \nline and say we won't tolerate it. We are going to act to impose a \nregime of promises to disarm and if those promises are not kept, the \ninternational community will act to enforce them.\n  We have vital interests at stake in the region. We have thousands of \nsoldiers there within range of these weapons of Saddam Hussein. We have \nallies in the region in the moderate Arab nations and in Israel, and we \nhave vital economic interests in the oil supply in that region.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that all of those interests, all that we \nhave at stake there--international promises made by Saddam as a \ncondition to the end of the cold war, the threat of weapons of mass \ndestruction and delivery systems, the vital interests in the region, \nthe necessity to draw a line against the use of chemical and biological \npoisons, which all of the military experts tell us will characterize \nand intensify the security threats to our region and most of the rest \nof the world in the next century--all of those threats are not just to \nthe United States, they are surely to our allies in the region and are \nto most of the rest of the world.\n\n  That is perhaps why so many nations have come to our side as we face \nthe reality that the United Nations, not the United States, tell us of \nthe refusal of Saddam Hussein to allow the inspections that he promised \nand, therefore, the fact that we have gone now more than 5 months with \nthose sites uninspected and day by day the threat rises.\n  That is why our closest and most steadfast ally, Britain, have joined \nus, are ready to stand and fly side by side with us. But they are not \nalone. Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Bahrain, Kuwait, Israel and \na growing number of others are prepared to join us.\n  As much as we are heartened by this support, we don't see the same \nrange of the coalition that we had leading up to the gulf war. Maybe \nthat is understandable because the threat that the current crisis poses \nis not as immediate and accomplished, it is mostly imminent. In 1990, \nSaddam Hussein invaded his neighbor Kuwait and threatened Saudi Arabia \nand the rest of the Persian Gulf states, oil-producing states. In that \ncircumstance, with a danger that was real and experienced, it was \neasier to assemble the broad-based coalition that we did.\n  Today, the threat may not be as clear to other nations of the world, \nbut its consequences are even more devastating potentially than the \nreal threat, than the realized pain of the invasion of Kuwait in 1990, \nbecause the damage that can be inflicted by Saddam Hussein and Iraq, \nunder his leadership, with weapons of mass destruction is incalculable; \nit is enormous.\n  Therefore, I hope, though the circumstance may not be as clear, that \nother nations that have not yet forcefully expressed their willingness \nto stand with us and Britain and the other allies I mentioned will come \nto an understanding of that. It has been my hope all along that if the \nUnited States continued to lead, as we have, that the full range of \ncoalition allies would, once again, stand by our side.\n  I always remember the Biblical evocation which is, if the sound of \nthe\n\n[[Page S714]]\n\ntrumpet is not clear, then who will follow in battle? If the sound of \nthe trumpet is clear, then I hope that the widest range of other \nnations in the world will follow into battle, if that is necessary, not \nsimply to follow our leadership, but because their vital interests are \nat stake, in the resolution of this problem.\n  Mr. President, I think the administration has made clear, and that is \nwhy I believe there is broad support for the possible attacks that may \noccur on Iraq, that its goals here are limited. If air attacks occur, \nthese are not acts of revenge, these are not punitive acts which have \nno meaning. These would be acts and attacks that are aimed at \naccomplishing what the inspections were supposed to accomplish, that \nare aimed at accomplishing what the gulf war cease-fire agreement was \nsupposed to accomplish, which is the diminution and ultimately the \nelimination of Iraq's capacity to wage chemical, biological or nuclear \nwar against its neighbors or ultimately anyone in the world. That \nlimited goal may not satisfy some people, but it is a reasonable goal \nat this time, and it is a goal that I think ultimately and effectively \nwill enjoy the broadest support in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, there are those who say, ``Well, what next? What if \nthis doesn't work?'' I am confident it will work. When I say it will \nwork, I mean I have the confidence the United States military has the \ncapacity to strike at Iraq in a way that will, in fact, incapacitate, \ndebilitate, postpone the ability of that country under Saddam Hussein \nto inflict damage on its neighbors with weapons of mass destruction. So \nthat goal will be accomplished.\n  I think the question of what is next is an appropriate topic of \ndiscussion. Some people say we should pull back and wait and see what, \nin that initial time of that military strike, if it occurs, it will \ngain us, to see whether diplomacy can work again, to see if we can \nbuild the fullness of the coalition and again confront Saddam with the \nopportunity to comply with the promises he previously made.\n  Others, and I number myself among this group, are very skeptical of \nthat policy. Diplomacy is always preferable to the use of force, and \nyet, I myself remain profoundly skeptical that an acceptable diplomatic \nresolution to this conflict is possible.\n  It is a painful and sad conclusion, but it is based not on animus \ntoward that country, certainly not animus toward the people of Iraq, \nbut it is based on the record. The record I need not cite in detail, \nbut we know about the violent way in which Saddam Hussein seized power \nin Iraq, eliminating those of his fellow Iraqis who were in his way, \nabout the violent and dictatorial way in which he has ruled. Life \ndoesn't matter when you stand in the way of him; of the means that he \nused to conduct the war against Iran, including weapons of mass \ndestruction; of his invasion of Kuwait; of his flaunting of the very \nagreements he made to end the gulf war; of the taunting of the \ninternational community that he represents today.\n  Mr. President, if this were a domestic situation, a political \nsituation, and we were talking about criminal law in this country, we \nhave something in our law called ``three strikes and you are out,'' \nthree crimes and you get locked up for good because we have given up on \nyou. I think Saddam Hussein has had more than three strikes in the \ninternational, diplomatic, strategic and military community. So I have \ngrave doubts that a diplomatic solution is possible here.\n  What I and some of the Members of the Senate hope for is a longer-\nterm policy based on the probability that an acceptable diplomatic \nsolution is not possible, which acknowledges as the central goal the \nchanging of the regime in Iraq to bring to power a regime with which we \nand the rest of the world can have trustworthy relationships. That is \nnot going to be simple. It is not going to come overnight. It involves \nan effort to work with Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein, to use some \nof the same methods that were used in the cold war, something as simple \nand yet as effective as Radio Free Europe which spoke so powerfully to \nthe hopes and dreams of people who lived so long under the tyranny of \nthe Soviets, the Communists, and do the same for the people who live \nunder the tyranny of Saddam Hussein, to work with our allies to build \nthe kind of alternative that will raise our hopes for peace in that \nregion of the world.\n\n  Those discussions about what may follow an air attack on Iraq are \nimportant. They are not easy. They deserve to be debated.\n  For now I think what is most important is that people of both parties \nhave come together on the floor of the Senate to speak to this \nchallenge to international law, to America's vital interests, and to \nsay, directly or indirectly, ``Mr. President, if you, as Commander in \nChief, act in this circumstance, in this crisis, you and the troops who \nserve under you will have broad bipartisan support in the U.S. \nSenate.''\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n\n           iraq's threat to international peace and security\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to express my support for \nPresident Clinton, in consultation with Congress and consistent with \nthe United States Constitution and laws, taking necessary and \nappropriate actions to respond effectively to the threat posed by \nIraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs.\n  I am presently in Moscow accompanying Secretary of Defense William \nCohen on a trip that has taken us to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the \nUnited Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.\n  I believe that it would be useful to briefly review some of the \nhistorical record relating to Iraq's compliance with United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions leading up to the present crisis.\n  United Nations Security Council Resolution 660 of August 2, 1990, \ncondemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanded that it withdraw \nits forces from Kuwait. The Security Council's Resolution 678 of \nNovember 29, 1990, affirmed by Resolution 687 of April 3, 1991, \nauthorized the use of all necessary means to restore international \npeace and security. During this period and up to the actual use of \nforce by the United States-led coalition, there were a series of \ndiplomatic efforts to convince the government of Saddam Hussein to \nwithdraw from Kuwait. But Saddam Hussein didn't get it.\n  Following the Gulf War, the Security Council continued the economic \nand weapons sanctions on Iraq that were imposed after it invaded \nKuwait. The Security Council conditioned the lifting of the sanctions \non Iraq's accepting the destruction, removal or rendering harmless, \nunder international supervision, of its nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons programs and all ballistic missiles with a range \ngreater than 150 kilometers. Despite the crippling international \neconomic sanctions that have been imposed on his country by the \ninternational community, Saddam Hussein still didn't get it.\n  In recognition of the need to reduce the harm to the Iraqi people \nthat were caused by Saddam Hussein's misadventures, the Security \nCouncil on August 15, 1991, in Resolution 706, authorized the sale of \nIraqi oil for the dual purpose of the payment of claims against Iraq \nand for the purchase of foodstuffs, medicines, materials and supplies \nfor essential civilian humanitarian needs. That authorization was made \nsubject to the Security Council's approval of a plan for such sales and \nfor international monitoring and supervision to assure their equitable \ndistribution in all regions of Iraq and to all categories of the Iraqi \ncivilian population. But Saddam Hussein rejected the plan. It wasn't \nuntil a Memorandum of Understanding on the plan was signed by Iraq and \nthe United Nations on May 20, 1996, and after several additional months \nof contentious negotiations on implementation details, that Iraq \nfinally began pumping oil on December 10, 1996. That was more than 5 \nyears after the Security Council authorized such action. Saddam Hussein \nstill didn't get it.\n  There were several major confrontations between Iraq and the \ninternational community over access for United Nations Special \nCommission on Iraq or UNSCOM inspectors between May 1991 and June 1993. \nThat pattern of confrontation was repeated on numerous occasions from \nMarch 1996 to October 1997. Since that time, the situation worsened \nuntil Iraq agreed that\n\n[[Page S715]]\n\nUNSCOM could return to Iraq unconditionally. Although UNSCOM \ninspections resumed on November 21, 1997, access was denied to \npresidential palaces and many other sites, and in mid-January 1998, an \ninspection team headed by an American was blocked. By the way, there \nare many dozens of these palaces. Some have grounds as large as \nWashington D.C. They are suspect weapons of mass destruction sites as \nlong as access is denied.\n  And so we have reached the present moment in time in which Iraq is \nblocking the UNSCOM inspectors from performing their mission on behalf \nof the international community. Saddam Hussein still doesn't get it.\n  Mr. President, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan stated it \nwell at a press conference on February 2 when he said:\n\n       I think no one in the Council is pushing for the use of \n     force in the first instance. All those who are talking about \n     it are looking at it as a last resort. We hope that President \n     Saddam Hussein, for the sake of the Iraqi people, who have \n     suffered so much, will listen to the messages that are being \n     taken to him by these senior envoys from Russia, from France, \n     from people in the region, leaders in the region and \n     elsewhere, and really avoid taking his people through another \n     confrontation. They don't need it; the region doesn't need \n     it; and the world certainly can do without it. And so, \n     hopefully, the leadership will have the courage, the wisdom \n     and the concern for its own people to take us back from the \n     brink.\n\n  Mr. President, this crisis is due entirely to the actions of Saddam \nHussein. He alone is responsible. We all wish that diplomacy will cause \nhim to back down but history does not give me cause for optimism that \nSaddam Hussein will finally get it.\n  Mr. President, Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction programs \nand the means to deliver them are a menace to international peace and \nsecurity. They pose a threat to Iraq's neighbors, to U.S. forces in the \nGulf region, to the world's energy supplies, and to the integrity and \ncredibility of the United Nations Security Council.\n  Mr. President, as I noted earlier, I have visited a number of \ncountries in the Middle East with Secretary Cohen. In each country, we \nhave met with the head of state. We've had a series of very positive \nmeetings in every country. We're very confident that the support that \nis needed and has been requested from these countries would be \nforthcoming if diplomatic efforts fail to get Saddam Hussein to comply \nand if there is a military strike. They all say, in various ways, \nbasically the same thing--he must comply with U.N. Security Council \nresolutions and, if he fails to comply and if there is military action, \nthe responsibility is his and his alone since he has the key to a \npeaceful solution, which is compliance with the U.N. resolutions. And \nwe are assured privately that we will have their support if diplomatic \nefforts fail and if military action is necessary.\n  Mr. President, yesterday the Gulf Cooperation Council at the \nMinisterial level issued a statement concerning the Iraqi crisis. I ask \nthat the text of the statement by printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. That statement included the following and I \nquote:\n\n       The Ministerial Council has stressed that the current \n     crisis is created by the Iraqi regime alone as a result of \n     its non-cooperation with the international inspectors and its \n     challenge to the will of the international community. This \n     non-cooperation threatens Iraq with severe dangers. The \n     Council expresses its conviction that responsibility for the \n     result of this crisis falls on the Iraqi regime itself.\n\n  Further, General Zinni, the Commander in Chief of the Central Command \n(CINCENT), has personally advised us that, in his professional opinion, \nthe United States has the support from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf \nnations needed to meet the requirements of the CINCCENT plan to execute \na successful military operation, should it be necessary.\n  Mr. President, the use of military force is a measure of last resort. \nThe best choice of avoiding it will be if Saddam Hussein understands he \nhas no choice except to open up to UNSCOM inspections and destroy his \nweapons of mass destruction. The use of military force may not result \nin that desired result but it will serve to degrade Saddam Hussein's \nability to develop weapons of mass destruction and to threaten \ninternational peace and security. Although not as useful as inspection \nand destruction, it is still a worthy goal.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                        Gulf Cooperation Council\n\n       The dangerous circumstances and the critical situation the \n     region is witnessing, which has resulted from the crisis \n     which the Iraqi regime has created with the international \n     inspectors belonging to the special committee assigned the \n     task of destroying Iraqi WMD, and by refusing to cooperate \n     with the international inspectors while not allowing them to \n     carry out their duties by imposing conditions and creating \n     obstacles represents a clear violation of the Security \n     Council resolutions related to Iraq's aggression on the state \n     of Kuwait.\n       The Ministerial Council has discussed these developments \n     and what they involve in terms of actual dangers which \n     threaten the security and stability of the region.\n       The Ministerial Council notes the international community's \n     consensus and its insistence on Iraq implementing the \n     Security Council resolutions in full; it places the \n     responsibility for the delays in implementing those \n     resolutions on Iraq. These delays will lead to continuation \n     of the sanctions imposed on Iraq under which the Iraqi people \n     suffer. The GCC people are concerned by this suffering and \n     place the responsibility for it on the Iraqi regime alone.\n       The Ministerial Council has stressed that the current \n     crisis is created by the Iraqi regime alone as a result of \n     its non-cooperation with the international inspectors and its \n     challenge to the will of the international community. This \n     non-cooperation threatens Iraq with sever dangers. The \n     council expresses its conviction that responsibility for the \n     result of this crisis falls on the Iraqi regime itself. The \n     council also stresses that it is not reasonable or acceptable \n     anymore that the Iraqi regime takes unilateral measures to \n     complicate conditions which threaten it with more severe and \n     dangerous consequences while at the same time placing the \n     responsibility for such measures on the Arab nation and the \n     international community.\n       Bearing in mind that the council has not abandoned and \n     continues to support any peaceful approach, the severe \n     results from what might happen are to be borne by the Iraqi \n     regime alone. In spite of the numerous efforts which a number \n     of Arab and international parties have exerted to convince \n     Iraq to retreat from its position by allowing the \n     international inspectors to carry out their duties without \n     any hindrance or condition, the Iraqi regime has continued \n     with its intransigence. Not caring about the dangerous \n     consequences which could result from this stance.\n       And in this tense environment, which presages dangers, the \n     council expresses its belief that the only way to save the \n     Iraqi people from the dangers and suffering to which they \n     have been subjected is by the Iraqi regime implementing the \n     resolutions which the international community has reached by \n     consensus and which Iraq has accepted, in accordance with the \n     program of this special commission the implementation of \n     which no one has disputed.\n       In order to avoid the Iraqi brotherly people being \n     subjected to the dangerous consequences of this crisis, the \n     council asks the Iraqi regime to yield to the efforts made to \n     implement all the commitments asked of it by removing the \n     barriers/obstacles which it has imposed on the tasks of the \n     international inspectors in preparation for reducing the \n     sanctions and lifting the suffering of the Iraqi brotherly \n     people.\n       The council stresses again its firm stance on the need to \n     preserve the independence and sovereignty of Iraq, its \n     territorial integrity and its regional security. The council \n     has decided to continue communications between the member \n     countries to follow the developments and this session will \n     remain open.\n\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia, under the \nprevious order, has 30 minutes. The Senator from Maine was here before \nhe was. Will he let her----\n  Mr. BYRD. I am seeking recognition first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Now, if the distinguished Senator from Maine would prefer \nto go ahead, I would be happy to await her.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Does the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I just wanted to establish my right under the rules--which \nI sought recognition. The fact that another Senator has been here does \nnot mean anything under the rules, but I am happy to yield and have the \nSenator proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the Congress grapples with the problem \nof maintaining the solvency of the Medicare program and with proposals \nto expand Medicare coverage, we must not overlook a critical problem \nthat threatens the financial integrity of this vital social program, \nwhich provides health care services to 38 million older and disabled \nAmericans. I am talking, Mr. President, about the problem of waste, \nfraud and abuse in this program.\n  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has \nundertaken an extensive investigation into Medicare fraud.\n  At our first hearing last summer, we learned from the inspector \ngeneral of the Department of Health and Human Services that an \nastounding $23 billion a year is lost to waste, fraud, abuse and other \nimproper payments.\n  In more recent hearings, Mr. President, we discovered that career \ncriminals, with absolutely no background in health care, were able to \nbe certified as Medicare providers and enter the system for the sole \npurpose of ripping it off.\n  For example, one case that the subcommittee investigated involved a \ntotally fictitious durable medical equipment company that was located \nin the middle of the runway of the Miami International Airport, if it \nhad in fact existed.\n  I am not talking here, Mr. President, about legitimate providers or \ninnocent mistakes or honest billing errors. I am talking about outright \nfraud. We need to do a better job of screening providers and \ncontrolling their entry into the Medicare system.\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of health care professionals are \ndedicated and caring individuals who deliver vital services to millions \nof Americans across the country. They are as appalled by this kind of \nfraud as any of us.\n  Recently, I met with the members of the Home Care Alliance of Maine \nconcerning the issue of fraud in the health care industry. The Home \nCare Alliance of Maine has a longstanding commitment to ensuring the \nhighest quality home health care in the State of Maine. It has adopted \na policy of zero tolerance on fraud and abuse in the home health \nindustry. Its members recognize that unscrupulous home health providers \nnot only tarnish the reputation of legitimate health care \nprofessionals, but that these unscrupulous individuals jeopardize the \nvery availability of Medicare.\n  I ask unanimous consent the position statement of the Home Care \nAlliance of Maine be printed in the Record so my colleagues and \norganizations representing home health care agencies across the United \nStates can have the benefit of the very fine work this organization has \ndone.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Medicare Fraud and Abuse\n\n\n                           position statement\n\n       The Home Care Alliance of Maine membership has a long-\n     standing commitment to provide the highest quality of care to \n     the elderly and infirm of our state. Even one unscrupulous \n     home health provider that fails to maintain the values and \n     ethics that are at the core of home care jeopardizes the \n     viability of ongoing access to appropriate home health \n     services.\n       We recognize that the responsibility for resolving concerns \n     of fraud and abuse lies with the government, the home health \n     industry, and individual providers. We further believe that \n     different strategies are needed to clearly distinguish \n     deliberately fraudulent practice from unintentional errors \n     that can occur in the interpretation of the complex and often \n     vague rules and regulations in the Medicare home health care \n     benefit.\n       The Home Care Alliance of Maine firmly believes that fraud \n     and abuse can be eliminated and errors corrected when \n     addressed by comprehensive and concerted efforts among the \n     industry, government, individual providers, and consumers. \n     This partnership is critical to achieve the mutually \n     beneficial goal of assuring integrity in administration of \n     the Medicare home health care benefit.\n       We further believe that education of consumers and advocacy \n     groups is central to ensuring trust in legitimate providers \n     of home health services. It is only through open and public \n     discussion about the basic structure of changes in the \n     Medicare home health care benefit that consumers and others \n     can confidently distinguish blatant fraud and abuse from \n     innocent errors in interpretation and provision of services. \n     Informed consumers and their advocates can then be reassured \n     by their choice of licensed and certified home health \n     agencies.\n       The Home Care Alliance of Maine supports:\n       1. Zero tolerance for fraud and abuse of the Medicare home \n     health care benefit.\n       2. Total cooperation with prompt and responsible \n     investigation and resolution of any errors in interpretation \n     and application of the Medicare home health care benefit.\n       3. Medicare coverage and reimbursement standards in \n     language that is understandable and readily accessible to \n     providers and consumers through various means, e.g. federal \n     depository libraries, state regulatory agencies, trade \n     associations, fiscal intermediaries, and the Internet.\n       4. Enhancement of education and training of home health \n     agencies through joint efforts with regulators.\n       5. Credentialing and competency testing standards for \n     government contractors and federal regulators responsible for \n     issuing Medicare determinations.\n       6. Mandatory screening and background checks on all \n     applicants for Medicare certification as a home health \n     agency.\n       7. Development and provision of a summary of program \n     coverage requirements for consumers and prospective consumers \n     of Medicare home health care benefits.\n       8. Enhancement and increased accessibility of the consumer \n     reporting hotline for suspected fraud and abuse.\n       The Home Care Alliance of Maine is committed to working \n     with its membership, state and federal regulatory bodies, and \n     consumer advocacy groups to ensure the integrity of the \n     Medicare home health care benefit in Maine.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I appreciate the opportunity to comment on this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, colleagues, I rise on this 25th \nanniversary of the return of the first American POWs from Vietnam to \nrecognize the National League of Families of American Prisoners and \nMissing in Southeast Asia and the many years and tireless hours Ann \nMills Griffiths, the National League of Families' Executive Director, \nand JoAnne Shirley, Chairwoman of the League's Board and a fellow \nGeorgian, have spent fighting for the return of American POW's and \nMIA's.\n  The National League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in \nSoutheast Asia was incorporated in the District of Columbia on May 28, \n1970.\n\n[[Page S717]]\n\n Voting membership is comprised solely of the wives, children, parents \nand other close relatives of Americans who were or are listed as \nprisoners of war, missing in action, killed in action/body not \nrecovered and returned Vietnam War U.S. POWs. Associate membership is \ncomprised of extended relation of POW/MIAs who do not meet voting \nmembership requirements and concerned citizens. The League is a non-\nprofit, non-partisan organization financed by contributions from the \nfamilies, veterans and concerned citizens. The League's sole purpose is \nto obtain the release of all prisoners, the fullest possible accounting \nfor the missing and repatriation of all recoverable remains of those \nwho died serving our nation during the Vietnam War.\n  The League originated on the west coast in the late 1960's. The wife \nof a ranking POW who believed that the U.S. Government's policy of \nkeeping a low profile on the POW/MIA issue and encouraging the families \nto refrain from publicly discussing the problem was unjustified, \ninitiated a loosely organized movement which evolved into the National \nLeague of Families.\n  In October 1968, the first POW/MIA story was published. As a result \nof that publicity, the families began communicating with each other, \nand the group grew in strength from 50 to 100 to 300 and upward. Small \nPOW/MIA family groups flooded the North Vietnamese delegation in Paris \nwith inquiries regarding the prisoners and missing; the first major \nactivity in which hundreds of families participated.\n  Eventually, the necessity for formal incorporation was recognized. In \nMay 1970, a special AD HOC meeting of the families met at Constitution \nHall in Washington, D.C. During this meeting the League's charter and \nby-laws were adopted.\n  A seven-member board of directors meets regularly to determine League \npolicy and direction. The board is elected by the voting membership \nwhich now stands at approximately 1,000. Regional coordinators, \nresponsible for activities in multi-state areas, and state coordinators \nalso represent the League in most of the fifty states.\n  The League's national office is now staffed by only one full-time \nemployee, augmented by concerned citizen and family member volunteers. \nThe executive director, the sister of a soldier MIA and the \norganization's chief executive officer, is responsible for management \nof the League and Implementation of policies established by the \nmembership and board of directors.\n  In 1971, Mrs. Michael Hoff, an MIA wife and member of the National \nLeague, recognized the need for a symbol representing our POW/MIAs. \nPrompted by an article in the Jacksonville, FL Times-Union, Mrs. Hoff \ncontacted Norman Rivkees, VP of Annin & Company, which had made a \nbanner for the newest member of the UN, the People's Republic of China, \nas a part of their policy to provide flags to all UN member states. \nMrs. Hoff found Mr. Rivkees very sympathetic to the POW/MIA issue, and \nhe along with Annin's advertising agency, designed a flag to represent \nour missing men. Following the National League's approval, the flags \nwere manufactured for distribution. On March 9, 1989, a flag which flew \nover the White House on the 1988 National POW/MIA Recognition Day, was \ninstalled in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, as a result of legislation \npassed overwhelmingly during the 100th Congress. On August 10, 1990, \nthe 101st Congress passed U.S. Public Law 101-355, which recognized the \nNational League's POW/MIA flag and designated it ``as the symbol of our \nNation's concern and commitment to resolving as fully as possible the \nfates of Americans still prisoner, missing and unaccounted for in \nSoutheast Asia, thus ending the uncertainty for their families and the \nNation.'' This POW/MIA flag is now recognized world wide, by all \nconcerned, as the universal symbol of the ``UNACCOUNTED FOR''.\n  Mrs. Ann Mills Griffiths serves as Executive Director of the National \nLeague of POW/MIA Families, a position held since August, 1978. Mrs. \nGriffiths' brother, Lt. Commander James B. Mills, USNR, has been \nmissing since September 21, 1966, when the Navy F4C on which he served \nas a Radar Intercept Officer was lost on a night mission over North \nVietnam.\n  Prior to assuming her position as executive director, Mrs. Griffiths \nwas an elected member of the League's board of directors for four \nyears, serving as legislative chairman. During its existence from 1980 \nthrough 1992, she played an active role in the U.S. Government's POW/\nMIA Interagency Group, representing the families' views in development \nof official policy to resolve this humanitarian issue.\n  Mrs. Griffiths has traveled extensively for discussion with senior \nofficials of Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, as well as the countries of \nASEAN. She was instrumental in facilitating high level negotiations \nbetween Vietnam and the United States in 1983 and participated in \nfourteen U.S. Government policy-level POW/MIA delegations to Hanoi \nsince 1982, plus two League delegations in 1982 and 1994.\n  Acknowledged as an expert on the POW/MIA issue, Mrs. Griffiths \nregularly meets with senior administration officials and members of \ncongress, appears before congressional committees, addresses national \nand international audiences, participates in appropriate policy \nseminars, publishes articles and newsletters, and is a frequent \nspokeswoman on network and cable television programs.\n  Within policy established by the membership and elected board of \ndirectors, Mrs. Griffiths has been instrumental in building the League \nfrom a small POW/MIA family group into a nationally recognized, non-\nprofit organization that influences U.S. policy to resolve the \nhumanitarian POW/MIA issue. In administering the Leagues' affairs, Mrs. \nGriffiths supervises League operations, manages a successful direct-\nmail program and plans the League's yearly convention that includes the \nhighest levels of the U.S. Government. With the assistance of their \nstaff and volunteer state and regional officials, Mrs. Griffiths also \ncoordinates a nation-wide awareness program on the issue.\n\n  Mrs. JoAnne Shirley has been serving as Chairman of the Board of \nDirectors since June 1995. Her brother, Maj. Bobby Marvin Jones, M.D., \nUSAF Flight Surgeon, was shot down November 28, 1972, near DaNang, \nSouth Vietnam.\n  Mrs. Shirley is married to Dr. Rudy Shirley, MS., and ENT doctor, and \nthey reside in Dalton, Georgia, with their three children Bobby, Rhett \nand Chrissie. She served on the School Board for 10 years, and has been \na volunteer in many community, county and state sponsored projects.\n  Mrs. Shirley co-founded the Georgia Committee for POW/MIA, Inc in the \n1980s and served as Georgia State Coordinator for the National League \nof Families from 1983-1993. She served as Secretary of the National \nLeague of 1993-94, and then as Vice-Chairman from 1994-95. In 1997, \nMrs. Shirley, by herself, raised $15,000 to fund her and Mrs. \nGriffiths' trip to Southeast Asia.\n  Mr. President, these two women who are wives, mothers, and involved \ncitizens have spent countless hours, money and resources keeping \naccountability alive. Nothing strikes a louder chord with Americans \nthan the thought of our soldiers in the hands of our country's enemies. \nIt is important that we recognize the work of organizations such as the \nNational League of Families and of people such as Ann Mills Griffiths \nand JoAnne Shirley who have worked hard to ensure we do not forget \nthose soldiers who were left behind.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of the Senate Resolution which recognizes the 25th \nanniversary of the return of 591 American POWs from communist Vietnam \nin February and March, 1973, and reaffirms our national commitment to \nseek answers about missing Americans from the Vietnam War.\n  I have been privileged through the years to come to know many of the \nAmericans POWs held for so many years by the Communist side and finally \nreleased in 1973. This includes heroes in the Congress like \nRepresentative Sam Johnson of Texas, and Senator John McCain of \nArizona, and other heroes like Admiral James Stockdale, Ambassador Pete \nPeterson, Red McDaniel, Orson Swindle, Ted Guy, Giles Norrington, and \nMike Benge, to name a few.\n  Today marks the 25th anniversary of the return of the first group of \nAmerican POWs from Hanoi during what was known as Operation Homecoming. \nThis first group included Congressman Sam\n\n[[Page S718]]\n\nJohnson, someone who I have been honored to work closely with through \nthe years to obtain answers about those still missing from the war. \nSeveral other groups of POWs were released later in February, 1973, and \nthroughout March, 1973, with the last American acknowledged by Hanoi to \nbe a POW being returned on April 1st.\n  A few years ago, one of these returned POWs I mentioned earlier, \nCaptain McDaniel, wrote a book about his experience as a POW entitled \n``Scars and Stripes.''\n  I want to quote just a small passage from that book which describes \nthe feelings of the POWs as they were being led from their prisons to \nthe airport in Hanoi for repatriation.\n  ``I saw a familiar C-141 aircraft waiting for us on the field. At \nthat moment, something broke inside me and the tears came easily. \nSomehow I had managed to restrict my tears to those rare times, in the \nnights under my mosquito net, when Hanoi Radio had gotten to me and I \nwas down. But here, seeing that airplane waiting, I just let go, \nbecause I suddenly realized that my country had not let me down. And \nthat great Scripture came to me, the Lord's words: I will never leave \nthee, nor forsake thee.\n\n       Even as God had stayed at my side through all that time and \n     taught me the things that were to change my life completely \n     about His reality and His presence in suffering, somehow that \n     American plane socked home some of the things that made \n     America and God great.\n       Then I was on that airplane, and pandemonium broke lose. As \n     those wheels lifted off, the cheers shook the plane. And when \n     the plane crossed over water on the way south, we all \n     shouted, ``Feet wet!''--we were no longer over North Vietnam. \n     Those mouths opened in a wild cheer--some with teeth missing, \n     some with faces showing physical and emotional scars, some \n     who cried while they cheered. No matter what anyone would say \n     in the future about Vietnam, somehow we had won a little \n     piece of something that no man would take away from us.\n\n  Mr. President, what true patriots these men were. How fitting that we \nhonor them today with this Senate resolution commemorating the 25th \nanniversary of their release.\n  With this resolution, we also call attention to the important last \nmission of the war which is still unresolved--the mission to obtain the \nfullest possible accounting for those whose whereabouts and fate are \nstill unknown. Our thoughts go out to the families of those missing \nmen, and we reaffirm our national commitment to learning the truth so \nwe can remove the uncertainty these families face.\n  I have been personally involved with searching for answers on the \nPOW/MIA issue, as my colleagues know, for several years now. I want to \ntake this opportunity today to again call on the Governments in \nSoutheast Asia, North Korea, China, Russia, and the former Eastern bloc \nto do more to open up their archives and make key witnesses available \nso we may advance the accounting effort. There is much work still to \ndo, and I appreciate that this resolution before us today recognizes \nthat fact.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to take a special moment here to \nthank my colleague from Georgia, a cosponsor of this resolution and \nhimself a veteran of the Vietnam war; Senator Smith of New Hampshire; \nSenator Lott, the majority leader; and Senator Hagel, a Vietnam veteran \nfrom Nebraska. I am especially delighted to be joined by Senator \nCleland who, as I said, is himself a testament to the courage and \nsacrifice made by so many men and women in American uniform during the \nVietnam conflict.\n  The resolution also directs itself to two of our colleagues who were \nthemselves long-held prisoners of war, Congressman Sam Johnson, who is \nspecifically noted in the resolution, and our own Senator John McCain \nof Arizona.\n  Senator McCain and I have known each other for some extended period \nof time and I have always marveled at what he endured and, I might add, \nthat it was almost a double endurance. What I mean is that the North \nVietnamese, recognizing that he was the son of a U.S. Navy admiral, \ntried to break him away from his colleagues and send him home. He made \nthe choice not to accept, not to accept this unique tension in \ndeference to his colleagues, his father and the Navy.\n  I was reminded earlier today that when these veterans were returned \nand disembarked from the aircraft--of course we all remember the scenes \nof them kneeling down and kissing the ground--but then to stand up and \nthank America for the privilege to have served her. It was an \nincredible act of courage, an act of care and love, of the country \nwhose uniforms they had worn.\n  Interestingly enough, unbeknownst to me just earlier, I was with a \nyoung man who said but for the brief chance of fate he would have been \na pilot in Vietnam. This was just moments ago and he was here when \nthese POW's returned, and he had a chance to be among them. At that \ntime he was about 33, which was the age of many of these POW's, the \ndifference being, of course, that he still looked 33 and they looked 50 \nor older because of what they had endured. He was reminded about how \nmoving the moment was to see these Americans who had returned, who had \nendured so much, who had become the epitome of courage and \nperseverance. He says whenever he is reminded of it, it still sends \nchills down his back. How much we owe these men and women. It is \nimportant that we remember.\n  Whenever a nation embarks on something like this--and perhaps it is \nuniquely important that we are remembering, considering the discussions \nthat are underway here this very week, discussing the eve of a major \nconflict--we remember what these men and women did for America.\n  Of course, today marks the 25th anniversary of the return of the \nfirst POWs from North Vietnam. Following the signing of the peace \naccords, 591 United States prisoners of war were released. The \noperation was dubbed ``Operation Homecoming.'' Today, as was noted in \nthe resolution, there are still 2,000 members of our Armed Forces who \nremain unaccounted for from the Vietnam conflict.\n  This resolution recognizes that despite the brutal mistreatment these \nprisoners received, they nevertheless devised a means to communicate \nwith one another, to support one another by a code transmitted by \ntapping on the wall. The resolution refers to Commander James B. \nStockdale, U.S. Navy, who upon his capture on September 9, 1965, became \nthe senior prisoner of war officer in what became dubbed the ``Hanoi \nHilton.'' He delivered the following message to his men to sustain \ntheir morale: ``Remember, you are Americans. With faith in God, trust \nin one another, and devotion to your country, you will overcome, you \nwill triumph.''\n  This resolution resolves that the Senate expresses its gratitude for \nand calls upon all Americans to reflect upon and show their gratitude \nfor the courage and sacrifice of the brave men who were held prisoners \nof war during the Vietnam conflict, particularly on the occasion of \nthis, the 25th anniversary of Operation Homecoming, their return from \ncaptivity. It also resolves that the Senate, indeed America, will not, \nmust not, forget the more than 2,000 members of the United States Armed \nForces that remain unaccounted for in the Vietnam conflict, and that \nthe Senate will continue to press for the fullest possible accounting \nfor such members.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator \nCleland, for his cosponsorship, more importantly for his service, his \nlong service, Senator Smith, Senator Lott and Senator Hagel of \nNebraska.\n  In closing I simply say on behalf of all Americans, this American \nsays to all who served under such difficult circumstances, a grateful \nNation says thank you.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 177) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 177\n\n       Whereas participation by the United States Armed Forces in \n     combat operations in Southeast Asia during the period from \n     1964 through 1972 resulted in several hundreds of members of \n     the United States\n\n[[Page S719]]\n\n     Armed Forces being taken prisoner by North Vietnamese, Pathet \n     Lao, and Viet Cong enemy forces;\n       Whereas the first such United States serviceman taken as a \n     prisoner of war, Navy Lt.

Mr. President, I want to call attention to a Federal permit \nprogram that is causing problems in Mississippi, in the Southeastern \nUnited States and, indeed, in the entire United States: the Federal \nSection 404 ``wetlands'' permit program. This program has its roots in \nSection 404 of the Clean Water Act, but has been designed primarily by \nthe Federal courts and the Federal agencies, the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and not by the \nelected officials of this Nation.\n  Twenty years have passed since the Congress of the United States has \naddressed this program legislatively. Currently, a Federal appellate \ncourt decision, two pending appellate court cases and a new proposed \nrulemaking by the Corps of Engineers are stirring up controversy about \nthis program. No one should be surprised. This program is held together \nby baling wire and string and pieces are beginning to fall off all over \nthe place.\n  I encourage the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to \nbring to the full Senate legislation that makes meaningful, common \nsense changes to the Section 404 permit program. Review of this program \nis long overdue. Mr. President, I hope that this Congress can take \nmeaningful action on the Section 404 program in 1998.\n  One basic controversy about this program is the issue of the areas \nthat are regulated as wetlands. The Federal agencies have interpreted \ntheir jurisdiction to extend to the farthest reaches of the Commerce \nClause, and, I think, even beyond, including those isolated areas that \nmerely ``could affect'' interstate commerce. Specifically, to some \nagencies this means those areas where a migratory bird ``could'' land. \nTo make this grab for jurisdiction worse, according to the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service, 75 percent of all Section 404 regulated areas are \non privately owned property!\n  On December 23, in Wilson v. United States Corps of Engineers, the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit overturned the \ncriminal convictions of an individual, a corporation and a partnership \nfor violating the Section 404 program in Charles County, Maryland. The \nindividual had been sentenced to 21 months in jail and the three \ndefendants had been fined a total of $4 million. The Fourth Circuit \noverturned the convictions and remanded the case to the district court, \nfinding that only those areas that are either connected on the surface \nto navigable waters or are proven to be in interstate commerce could be \nregulated under the Section 404 program. Specifically, the court held \nthat:\n\n       Absent a clear indication to the contrary, we should not \n     lightly presume that merely by defining `navigable waters' as \n     `the waters of the United States', Congress authorized the \n     Army Corps of Engineers to assert its jurisdiction in such a \n     sweeping and constitutionally troubling manner. Even as a \n     matter of statutory construction, one would expect that the \n     phrase `waters of the United States', when used to define the \n     phrase `navigable waters' refers to waters which, if not \n     navigable in fact, are at least interstate or closely related \n     to navigable or interstate waters. When viewed in light of \n     its statutory authority, (the regulation), which defines \n     `waters of the United States' to include intrastate waters \n     that need have nothing to do with navigable or interstate \n     waters, expands the statutory phrase `waters of the United \n     States' beyond its definable limit.\n       Accordingly, we believe that in promulgating (the \n     regulation), the Army Corps of Engineers exceeded its \n     congressional authorization under the Clean Water Act, and \n     that, for this reason, (the regulation) is invalid.\n\n  At long last, this case begins to limit the reach of the bureaucracy \nonto privately owned property under this program.\n  A second area of controversy is a regulation issued by the Clinton \nAdministration in September, 1993, that broadly expanded the definition \nof activities that are regulated under the Section 404 program. As many \nof you know, this permit problem was never designed to be a wetlands \npermit program, but rather evolved in that direction through judicial \nrulings and agency interpretations. The activities in ``wetlands'' that \nare regulated under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act are the \n``discharge of dredged and fill material'' into the ``navigable \nwaters''. On the face of it, the statute does not cover other \nactivities that could degrade wetlands, such as ``draining'' or \n``excavating'' wetlands. Obviously, if we are going to have a wetlands \nregulatory program and protect valuable wetlands, the program needs to \ncover ``drainage'' and ``excavation.''\n  In September 1993, the Clinton Administration issued a rulemaking \nthat expanded coverage of the Section 404 program to include activities \nlike drainage and excavation. Many of us noted that this might be good \npublic policy, but this expansion exceeded the statute, and legislation \nwould be necessary to expand the program to cover these activities.\n  On January 23, 1997, a Federal district court in the District of \nColumbia struck down this regulation, called the Tulloch rule, as \nexceeding the statutory authority of the Clean Water Act. On January 9, \n1998, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \nCircuit heard oral arguments in this case. The Federal government had a \nrough day in court. I am told that the judges suggested that the agency \ninterpretation of the jurisdictional reach of the Section 404 program \nwent as far as ``land that might be wet someday''. One of the appellate \njudges asked the government attorney whether riding a bike through a \nwetland, where dirt accumulated on the tires and then fell off into the \nwetland during riding, would be an activity regulated under the Section \n404 program. The government attorney answered yes, but the regulation \nwas not aimed at this activity. The judge answered correctly, ``Not \nyet!''\n  This brings me to a recent Corps judgment on Nationwide Permit 26 \nthat was attacked on the front page of the Washington Post on Saturday, \nJanuary 31st.\n\n[[Page S720]]\n\n  With the Corps and the EPA interpreting almost every activity as one \ncovered by the Section 404 program, the Corps has adopted a series of \nNationwide Permits that cover routine activities and prevent the \nnecessity of proceeding through the costly and time-consuming normal \npermitting process. One of these permits, Nationwide Permit 26, which \ncovers certain areas up to 3 acres in size, is scheduled to expire in \nDecember 1998. The Corps is developing a series of ``replacement \npermits''. These ``carve outs'' are essential if the Corps is to be \nable to manage this program without enormous delays in permit \nprocessing times. This is particularly true as the bureaucracy \ncontinually expands the types of activities that are regulated under \nthe Section 404 program. Yet, some interest groups are attempting to \npressure the Administration to reject these replacement permits. If \nthey are successful, I am convinced that the program will fall into \ndisarray, prompting calls not only for the reform of the current \nprogram, but the repeal of the whole thing. We will all have to keep an \neye on this development.\n\n  Finally, a case is pending in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit styled Resource Investments, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps \nof Engineers. In this case, the Corps used its Section 404 regulations \nto overturn the judgment of a county government in a public bid process \nregarding the location of a new solid waste disposal facility. I can \nassure you that it is not this Senator's view that the mission of the \nArmy Corps of Engineers is to make judgments that historically have \nbeen within the purview of local elected officials.\n  Mr. President, this is just a quick survey of some of the judgments \nthat are being made by Federal agencies and Federal courts regarding \nthe Section 404 program. These judgments sometimes expand and sometimes \nnarrow this program. What is missing--and has been missing for 20 \nyears--is the judgment of elected officials about fundamental aspects \nof this regulatory program that defy common sense and so often intrude \non privately owned property, local economic activities and governmental \ninfrastructure decisions. It is long-past time for the committee of \njurisdiction over this program to bring forth legislation that proposes \nmeaningful and responsible adjustments to this awful program.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I should add one more thing. The current \nPresident of the United States, when he was the Governor of Arkansas, \nchaired the Lower Mississippi River Delta Development Commission. The \nstatutory charge of this Commission was to study the seven-state Lower \nMississippi River Delta region and to develop a ten-year regional \neconomic development plan. This is a particularly troubled region \neconomically. Both my state of Mississippi and the President's state of \nArkansas contain portions of the Lower Mississippi River Delta.\n  In May, 1990, the Commission filed its report, which was submitted to \nCongress over the signature of the current President. That report \nspecifically addressed the problems of Federal wetlands regulation, \nstating:\n\n       The national wetlands policy has caused significant \n     problems for agriculture, aquaculture and commercial and \n     industrial development.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Current definitions do not adequately differentiate the \n     quality of wetlands.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Current interpretations of the national wetlands policy \n     have placed major limitations on the Delta's economy because \n     commercial and industrial development is being impaired. (all \n     quotes from page 80 of the report)\n\n  The report then made a number of recommendations, including these two \nfrom page 81 of the report:\n\n       Congress should direct appropriate federal agencies to \n     establish minimum-sized wetlands for regulation.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Congress should assign the responsibility for \n     identification and maintenance of a wetlands inventory to one \n     agency, and require consultation with other affected \n     agencies.\n\n  Mr. President, the President of the United States seems to have \nforgotten what he learned as chair of the Lower Mississippi River Delta \nDevelopment Commission. The current Federal Section 404 permitting \nprogram regulates all wetlands regardless of size and is administered \nby two Federal agencies: the Corps of Engineers and the EPA. The \nPresident was correct with respect to these recommendations in 1990, \nbut now that he is in a position to act, nothing has happened. I would \nhope that the President of the United States would submit at least \nthese meaningful changes to Congress for our consideration in 1998.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I share the concerns of the Majority Leader \nregarding the shortcomings of the Section 404 program. In light of the \nrecent and pending court cases, as well as the ongoing controversy over \nthe scheduled demise in December of Nation Wide Permit 26, I agree \nstrongly that Congress must address the Section 404 program \nlegislatively. We should not continue to let the program bob and weave \nand stray in response to interpretations or policy preferences of each \nsuccessive court decision or agency action. The law is unpredictable \nand it is not fair to the agencies administering the law or the \nlandowners impacted by the law.\n  Based on accounts of the oral arguments in the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and subsequent \nconversations my staff has had with various officials, it appears very \npossible that the lower court decision on the ``Tulloch'' rule will be \nupheld. The ``Tulloch'' rule extends regulation under the Section 404 \nprogram to activities like ``drainage'' and ``excavation'' that harm \nwetlands. The lower court held that expanding the Section 404 program \nto cover these activities might be very good public policy, but the \ncurrent statute does not cover these activities. Legislation expanding \nthe program will be needed. In its successful attempt to obtain a stay \nof the lower court decision, the Federal government filed documents \nsuggesting that the failure to regulate ``drainage'' and ``excavation'' \nwould be an environmental catastrophe. Thus, if the Court of Appeals \nupholds the lower court decision, legislation will be necessary to \ncover these activities.\n  My colleague from Louisiana and I have released a series of proposals \nin a ``discussion draft'' to encourage discussion of these difficult \nissues. One proposal in the draft would expand the activity regulated \nunder Section 404 to include ``drainage'' and ``execution.'' This draft \nsignals our commitment to engage in a constructive process with all \nparties to develop legislation that will stabilize the Section 404 \nprogram, expand the program to cover activities that are destructive to \nwetlands and make a number of common sense changes to the program that \nwill make it more acceptable to private landowners on whose property \n75% of these regulated areas are located.\n  Senator Breaux and I released our discussion draft last summer. Time \nis growing short in this session of Congress, yet there is still time \nto act if there is a willingness of the various stakeholders to \nnegotiate constructively and the will for us to legislate. I believe \nthat I speak for my colleague from Louisiana when I pledge our \ncooperation in any reasonable process to develop Section 404 \nimprovement legislation that will earn the support of a majority of our \ncolleagues and will be good both for the environment and the regulated \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, I agree with the Majority Leader. Twenty years without \nlegislative attention is long enough for the Section 404 program. The \ntime has arrived to tackle this difficult issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S719-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S720-S722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Oct. 1, \n     1997), has amended the Procedural Rules of the Office of \n     Compliance to cover the General Accounting Office (``GAO'') \n     and the Library of Congress (``Library'') and their employees \n     under the rules governing: (1) proceedings involving \n     Occupational Safety and Health inspections, citations, and \n     variances under section 215 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), and (2) ex parte \n     communications.\n       The NPRM also proposed to extend the Procedural Rules to \n     cover GAO and the Library and their employees for purposes of \n     processing allegations of violation of sections 204-206 of \n     the CAA, which apply rights and protections of the Employee \n     Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (``EPPA''), the Worker \n     Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (``WARN Act''), \n     and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights \n     Act of 1994 (``USERRA''), and of section 207 of the CAA, \n     which prohibits employing offices from intimidating or taking \n     reprisal against covered employees for exercising rights \n     under the CAA. However, by a recently published Supplementary \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 143 Cong. Rec. S86 (daily ed. \n     Jan. 28, 1998), the Office is requesting further comment on \n     whether the Procedural Rules should be extended to cover GAO \n     and the Library with respect to alleged violations of \n     sections 204-207, and no final action will be taken on this \n     question until the comments have been received and \n     considered.\n       Availability of comments for public review: Copies of \n     comments received by the Office in response to the NPRM are \n     available for public review at the Law Library Reading Room, \n     Room LM-201, Law Library of Congress, James Madison Memorial \n     Building, Washington, D.C., Monday through Friday, between \n     the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.\n       For further information contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, at (202) 724-9250 (voice), (202) 426-1912 \n     (TTY). This notice will also be made available in large print \n     or braille or on computer disk upon request to the Office of \n     Compliance.\n\n\n                       supplementary information\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     the ``Act''), Pub. L. 104-1, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438, \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven labor, \n     employment, and public access laws to certain defined \n     ``covered employees'' and ``employing offices'' in the \n     Legislative Branch. The CAA expressly includes GAO and the \n     Library and their employees within the definitions of \n     ``covered employees'' and ``employing offices'' for \n     purposes of four sections of the Act: (a) section 204, \n     making applicable the rights and protections of the \n     Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988 (``EPPA''); (b) \n     section 205, making applicable the rights and protections \n     of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act \n     (``WARN Act''); (c) section 206, making applicable the \n     rights and protections of section 2 of the Uniformed \n     Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 \n     (``USERRA''); and (d) section 215, making applicable the \n     rights and protections of the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''). These four sections go \n     into effect by their own terms with respect to GAO and the \n     Library one year after transmission to Congress of the \n     study under section 230 of the CAA. The study was \n     transmitted to Congress on December 30, 1996, and sections \n     204-206 and 215 therefore went into effect at GAO and the \n     Library on December 30, 1997.\n       The purpose of the NPRM was to extend the Procedural Rules \n     of the Office to cover GAO and the Library and their \n     employees for purposes of any proceedings in which GAO or the \n     Library or their employees may be involved. To accomplish \n     this, the NPRM proposed to cover GAO and the Library and \n     their employees in four respects: (1) Sections 401-408 of the \n     CAA establish administrative and judicial procedures for \n     considering alleged violations of part A of Title II of the \n     CAA, which includes sections 204-206, and the NPRM proposed \n     to extend the Procedural Rules to include GAO and the Library \n     and their employees for the purpose of resolving any \n     allegation of a violation of sections 204-206. (2) Section \n     207 prohibits employing offices from intimidating or taking \n     reprisal against any covered employee for exercising rights \n     under the CAA, and the NPRM proposed to extend the Procedural \n     Rules to include GAO and the Library and their employees for \n     the purpose of resolving any allegation of intimidation or \n     reprisal prohibited under section 207. (3) Section 215 \n     specifies the procedures by which the Office conducts \n     inspections, issues citations, grants variances, and \n     otherwise enforces section 215, and the NPRM proposed to \n     extend the Procedural Rules to cover GAO and the Library and \n     their employees for purposes of proceedings involving section \n     215. (4) Section 9.04 of the Procedural Rules governs ex \n     parte communications, and the NPRM proposed to extend the \n     Procedural Rules to cover these instrumentalities and \n     employees for purposes of section 9.04.\n       In the only comment received in response to the NPRM, the \n     Library argued that ``Congress expressly excluded the Library \n     and other instrumentalities of Congress from the application \n     of Titles I, III, IV and V of the CAA,'' which include the \n     administrative and judicial procedures established in \n     sections 401-408. (The Office of Compliance has made the \n     Library's entire submission available for public review in \n     the Law Library Reading Room of the Law Library of Congress, \n     at the address and times stated at the beginning of this \n     Notice.) As to whether GAO and the Library and their \n     employees are covered by the procedures mandated by sections \n     401-408 when a violation of sections 204-207 is alleged, the \n     Library's comments raise issues of statutory construction \n     upon which the Office seeks further comment. To solicit such \n     comments, the Office recently published a Supplementary \n     Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 143 Cong. Rec. S86 (daily ed. \n     Jan. 28, 1998), and will make no decision as to whether the \n     Procedural Rules will be amended to cover GAO and the Library \n     and their employees for purposes of resolving allegations of \n     violations of sections 204-207 until after the comments are \n     received and considered.\n       The issues of statutory construction raised by the \n     Library's comments are not pertinent, however, to proceedings \n     under section 215 and to rules regarding ex parte \n     communications. The procedures under section 215 expressly \n     cover GAO and the Library and their employees because section \n     215(a)(2)(C)-(D) explicitly includes these instrumentalities \n     and employees within the definitions of ``employing office'' \n     and ``covered employee'' for purposes of applying the OSHAct \n     ``under this section [215].'' As to ex parte communications, \n     section 9.04 of the Procedural Rules includes within its \n     coverage any covered employee and employing office ``who is \n     or may reasonably be expected to be involved in a proceeding \n     or rulemaking.'' The CAA explicitly authorizes GAO and the \n     Library and their employees to be involved in proceedings \n     under section 215(c), as described above, and the Library \n     itself has exercised its right to be involved in the Office's \n     rulemaking proceedings.\n       The Library further notes that the substantive regulations \n     adopted by the Board to implement section 215 have not yet \n     been approved by the House and Senate pursuant to section 304 \n     of the CAA and argues: ``Since all OSHA regulations must \n     follow the procedures for adopting substantive rules under \n     section 304 of the Act, including approval by Congress, it \n     would seem more appropriate to delete the reference to the \n     coverage of the Library for purposes of section 215 of the \n     CAA, in order to avoid confusion over the effect of possible \n     Congressional approval of these proposed rules but not the \n     underlying provisions applying to OSHA procedures.'' However, \n     the Library's assumption that ``all OSHA regulations,'' \n     including provisions of the Procedural Rules describing the \n     Office's procedures under section 215, are subject to \n     Congressional approval is incorrect. Congressional approval \n     under section 304 is required only for the regulations \n     adopted by the Board under section 215(d) of the CAA, which \n     must generally be the same as the substantive regulations \n     promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to implement section 5 \n     of the OSHAct. The Board adopted such regulations for \n     employing offices other than GAO and the Library and \n     submitted the regulations to Congress for approval under \n     section 304, see 143 Cong. Rec. S61 (daily ed. Jan. 7, 1997), \n     and recently amended those regulations to cover GAO and the \n     Library and submitted the amendments to Congress for \n     approval, see 143 Cong. Rec. S11663 (daily ed. Nov. 4, 1997). \n     However, the Procedural Rules, including provisions \n     describing the Office's procedures under section 215 of the \n     CAA, were adopted under section 303 of the CAA, which \n     authorizes the Executive Director, subject to the approval of \n     the Board, to adopt rules governing the procedures of the \n     Office. See 143 Cong. Rec. H1879, H1879-80 (daily ed. Apr. \n     24, 1997). The amendments in this Notice are likewise adopted \n     under section 303, so the Library's expressed concern is \n     unfounded.\n       Finally, although no comments were received regarding the \n     specific language of the proposed amendments to the rules, \n     the final adopted rules differ slightly from the text of the \n     proposed amendments. The preamble to the NPRM explained that \n     the purpose of the rulemaking was to cover GAO and the \n     Library and their employees ``for purposes of any proceedings \n     in which GAO and the Library or their employees may be \n     involved as employing offices or covered employees,'' and, \n     with respect to section 215, the preamble stated that GAO and \n     the Library would be covered ``for the purposes of \n     proceedings involving section[] . . . 215 of the CAA . . . \n     .'' 143 Cong. Rec. S10291, S10292 col. 1 (daily ed. Oct. 1, \n     1997). However, the proposed rules in the NPRM described \n     specific kinds of proceedings under section 215, i.e., \n     enforcement of inspection and citation provisions of the \n     CAA and the granting of variances, and stated that GAO and \n     the Library would be covered for purposes of those \n     specific proceedings. Id. at S10292 col. 2. To avoid any \n     confusion, the final rules have been simplified and \n     revised to make clear that they cover GAO and the Library \n     for purposes of ``[a]ny proceeding under section 215.'' \n     Section 1.02(q)(1) of the Procedural Rules, as amended by \n     this Notice.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 9th day of February, \n     1998.\n                                                  Ricky Silberman,\n                         Executive Director, Office of Compliance.\n\n       The Executive Director of the Office of Compliance hereby \n     amends section 1.02 of the Procedural Rules of the Office of \n     Compliance by revising paragraphs (b) and (h) and\n\n[[Page S722]]\n\n     by adding at the end of the section a new paragraph (q) to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 1.02 Definitions.\n\n       ``Except as otherwise specifically provided in these rules, \n     for purposes of this Part:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       ``(b) Covered employee.

Mr. President, one of the most important foreign policy \nissues with which the Congress must deal in the coming months is \ncontinued American involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  Last December, President Clinton announced his decision that the \nUnited States should maintain ground troops in an international force \nthat will replace SFOR, whose mandate expires in June. Soon, he will \nask the Congress for the funding to support this operation.\n  I support the President's decision as being squarely in the national \nself-interest of the United States. As I have said on many other \noccasions, the stability of southeastern Europe depends on the ability \nof the Bosnians, working with the international community, to create a \nself-sustaining, peaceful, democratic system in their country.\n  Failure to achieve this goal would inevitably restart the violence \nthat produced the worst bloodletting in Europe since World War II, and \nwould almost certainly ignite the ethnic tinderbox that is smoldering \nin neighboring countries. Other potential Radovan Karadzics cannot be \nencouraged to believe that they can get away with similar crimes. The \ndevil's work of the mass murderers, ethnic cleansers, and rapists in \nBosnia must not be allowed to stand in that country or, worse still, to \nbe repeated there and elsewhere.\n  Moreover, as President Clinton said in his State of the Union \naddress, staying the course in Bosnia is a test of American leadership \nin Europe in general, and in NATO in particular. It was American \nmilitary involvement in the fall of 1995 and our diplomatic leadership \nin crafting the Dayton Accords that ended the carnage in Bosnia.\n  Make no mistake about it: we are the indispensable country in the \nEuropean security equation, as Bosnia demonstrates. Although our \nalliance partners are shouldering the lion's share of the economic and \nmilitary burden in Bosnia, without our participation on the ground and \nin the air, SFOR and any post-SFOR force would be impossible.\n  The task in Bosnia is complex and will take several more years to \ncomplete. President Clinton himself admitted his error in thinking that \nnearly four years of horrific violence could be remedied in one year, \nor even two-and-a-half years.\n  But our commitment to assisting the Bosnians, of course, is not open-\nended. Rather than tieing our exit to an artificial date, we should--\nand will--link it to the completion of clearly defined criteria, such \nas the establishment of a functioning national government and other \nnational institutions, seated elected local governments, free media, \nand a free-market economy. I have every confidence that the \nAdministration will spell out these benchmark criteria in detail in its \nrequest for U.S. participation in the international force after this \nJune.\n  I had the opportunity to accompany the President to Bosnia before \nChristmas--my fourth journey in recent years to that troubled land. The \ntrip confirmed the impressions that I gained in a longer trip last \nsummer: we have made significant progress in implementing the military \nand civilian provisions of the Dayton Accords.\n  I scarcely need to add the caveat that much still remains to be done \nto put Bosnia back on firm footing. Today I have several concrete \npolicy proposals to further that end.\n  To put them into context, I would like to review in some detail the \nsignificant progress that has been made in the last nine months in \nimplementing both the military and civilian provisions of the Dayton \nAccords.\n  Mr. President, I believe that even the most skeptical observer has to \nadmit that the situation in Bosnia has improved greatly since Dayton, \nand with an increased tempo in the last nine months.\n  Thanks to our magnificent troops in IFOR and SFOR and those of allied \nand partner countries, a stable military environment has been created \nand the warring parties separated. No fewer than three hundred thousand \ntroops from all sides have returned to civilian life.\n  Nearly seven thousand heavy weapons have been destroyed, and an \nadditional two thousand six hundred put into supervised cantonments.\n  A joint Muslim-Croat Federation Defense Force has been created, \nalthough below the top command much more integration remains to be \naccomplished. The American Train and Equip Program to create a \ndefensive Federation capability is in full swing. I visited its \nheadquarters last summer, and was impressed with its trainers and its \nMuslim and Croat students.\n  Progress has also been made in creating non-political local police \nforces, both in the Federation and in the Republika Srpska. Integrated \npolice forces are operating in eight major locations around the \ncountry, including the pivotal northern town of Brcko, whose future \nwill be determined in March by an international arbitrator.\n  The International Police Task Force or IPTF has had its share of \nproblems, perhaps unavoidable given the fact that no fewer than forty \ncountries are contributing officers to it. Recent reforms, however, in \nwhich Americans have played a prominent role, have strengthened its \nprofessionalism. A new Federation Police Academy has been opened near \nSarajevo to train new recruits from all religious groups.\n  Last fall, I called for our European allies to contribute forces from \ntheir paramilitary formations to create a gendarmerie in Bosnia as a \nvital middle layer--under SFOR control--between the local police and \nSFOR. Although there was an initial, predictable negative public \nreaction from Europe, I am told that several of our partners are now \nactively considering the idea. These European gendarmes could provide \nthe security for newly elected municipal governments, guarantee safety \nfor minority refugee returns, and take over the lead-role in capturing \nindicted war criminals.\n\n  In fact, slowly but surely the indicted war criminals are already \nbeing rounded up. Nearly one-third of the seventy-nine individuals \nunder open indictment have been taken into custody in the War Crimes \nTribunal in the Hague.\n  Last month, for the first time American SFOR troops carried out a \ncapture operation, seizing a notorious Bosnian Serb who as the sadistic \ncommander of a prison camp called himself the ``Serb Adolf'' and \nreveled in his grisly murder of Muslims. He is one of only a handful\n\n[[Page S723]]\n\nof individuals in Bosnia indicted for genocide.\n  NATO Secretary-General Solana has publicly pledged to arrest such war \ncriminals when NATO troops find them, but proceeding with careful \npreparation so as to avoid undue risk. I welcome his statement and urge \nan acceleration of the process, to be taken over as soon as possible--\nas I just mentioned--by a European gendarmerie.\n  Contrary to popular belief, Mr. President, many refugees and \ndisplaced persons have returned home--more than 400,000 in fact. The \nnumber of minority returnees represents only a small fraction of the \ntotal, but even here there has been notable progress in several cities \nin the past few months.\n  Mr. President, there are other positive signs emanating from Bosnia. \nThanks to pressure from SFOR, the Bosnian media have been restructured. \nThe hate-filled television broadcasts of the Karadzic forces have been \nput under the oversight of the High Representative, and the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Equally \nimportant, the internationally funded Open Broadcast Network now \nreaches eighty percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  The economic life of the Federation is rapidly improving, although a \nhuge amount remains to be rebuilt. GDP grew by 53% in 1996 and 35% last \nyear, and unemployment has been cut in half, from 90% to 44%.\n  A central factor in the economic resuscitation of the Federation has \nbeen international assistance, and our USAID is generally acknowledged \nto have been the most efficient national agency in delivering emergency \nassistance in a variety of ways. I have personally seen the targeted \nprograms of USAID contractors helping minority refugees to return and \nrebuild their own houses. Moreover, USAID assistance has created over \n11,000 jobs and provided sixty-eight million dollars in loans to one \nhundred forty medium-sized Bosnian enterprises.\n  From all international sources more than 230 miles of roads have been \nrebuilt throughout Bosnia and twenty-one key bridges repaired and made \nfunctional again.\n  Economic progress in the Republika Srpska has lagged far behind that \nof the Federation, primarily because the Karadzic-dominated government \nin Pale obstructed implementation of the civilian parts of the Dayton \nAccords. I will return shortly to the issue of how best to assist the \nRepublika Srpska to get back onto its feet.\n  Progress has been uneven in fleshing out the institutions of \ngovernment mandated by Dayton. While all national and entity-level \ninstitutions have been created, the joint presidency is a fractious and \nhamstrung organization, and tax, customs, and banking bodies are still \nnot fully functioning.\n  We clearly must put more pressure on the various parties to make the \nsystem work, and recent events give me some confidence that this is \nbeginning to happen. The High Representative for Bosnia, the impressive \nSpanish diplomat Carlos Westendorp, has been given additional powers by \nthe international community, and he is using them. Last month, fed up \nwith stalemate among the representatives of the three major religious \ngroups, Mr. Westendorp imposed a common currency on the country. When \nthe three groups seemed deadlocked on a common national license plate, \nhe forced the issue, and an agreement was reached. Most recently, when \nthey failed to agree on the design of a national flag, Mr. Westendorp \nmade the choice and imposed it on them.\n  In contrast to the grudging pace of reform at the national level, \nthere has been quite remarkable progress at the entity and local levels \nof government.\n  Democratic elections have been held with turn-outs averaging more \nthan seventy percent. The trend has been toward marginalizing the \nethnic extremists, who have either been voted out of office or removed \nby the High Representative from positions in towns in both the \nFederation and the Republika Srpska.\n  Then last month, Mr. President, a stunning and heartening development \ntook place in Bosnia. A non-nationalist Bosnian Serb named Milorad \nDodik was elected Prime Minister of the Republika Srpska.\n  I met Mr. Dodik last August in Banja Luka. He seems genuinely to \nbelieve in a unified, multi-ethnic Bosnia, and his behavior during the \nfour years of violence was exemplary. In fact, his razor-thin victory \nin the Republika Srpska parliament was made possible by the support of \nsixteen Muslim and several Croat deputies.\n  Nominated for his position by Republika Srpska President Plavsic, \nPrime Minister Dodik has crafted a program that goes beyond that of his \npatron:\n  He has pledged to implement Dayton fully, including completing the \nunification of the police forces of the Republika Srpska and of the \nFederation.\n  He has said he will seek an equitable solution to the refugee \nproblem.\n  He has said that when he is firmly in power he will turn over all \nSerbs suspected of war crimes to the international tribunal in the \nHague. In fact, the tribunal may soon open an office in Banja Luka.\n  He has guaranteed equal rights for all citizens.\n  He has called for the separation of religion and politics.\n  He has come out for independent media, pledging publicly to \nreorganize Bosnian Serb Radio and Television ``in accordance with the \nrequirements of the Office of the High Representative . . . to develop \ninto a professional, independent, and responsible network, open to \neverybody.''\n  Moreover, Prime Minister Dodik--himself a successful businessman--has \nset as a top priority the privatization and restructuring of the \neconomy of the Republika Srpska. Central to this is his determination \nto eliminate the widespread corruption that has kept the Karadzic gang \nin power by eliminating their ability to tax, to impose customs \nduties--and then to siphon off the money for their personal use. He has \nalready replaced the corrupt Karadzic appointees who ran the state-\nowned industries.\n  In an immediate measure to exert his control, Dodik is moving the \nRepublika Srpska capital from Pale to Banja Luka, a measure that was \nofficially approved by the Republika Srpska Parliament on January 31st \nby a wide margin.\n  Moreover, the Republika Sprska Parliament has voted to annul thirty-\nthree laws passed by the Karadzic-dominated parliament after President \nPlavsic dissolved that body last summer.\n  My colleagues should understand that we must keep a sharp eye on \nDodik--if for no other reason the fact that he is also being supported \nby Yugoslav President Milosevic--but there is no doubt whatsoever that \nDodik is a vast improvement over the Pale gang that is actively \nresisting him.\n  The jury is still out as to who will emerge victorious, but, Mr. \nPresident, the very facts of Dodik's record, his parliamentary victory, \nand his reform program are an eloquent rebuttal to the many superficial \nand utterly erroneous statements about Bosnian history that we have \noften heard in this country, even on the floor of this chamber.\n  We have repeatedly heard the refrain of how ``those people in Bosnia \nhave never gotten along,'' how ``they have fought each other for five \nhundred years,'' and how ``they are incapable of living together.''\n  I hope that as we go forward in Bosnia, we can finally dispense with \nthese tired cliches, which, in essence, have been an excuse not to deal \nwith the real world.\n  Mr. President, in my twenty-five years in the Senate my colleagues \nhave called me many things, but ``starry-eyed'' is not one of them. In \ntaking note of the progress that has been achieved in Bosnia, I do not \nfor one minute believe that we are on the edge of victory, or even that \nthe final goal of a multi-ethnic, democratic, free-market Bosnia is \ncertain to be achieved.\n  But I do think that a sober, objective reading of the current \nsituation gives cause for some optimism that we have turned the corner.\n  In conclusion, I would like to offer a six-point plan to correct some \nmissteps-steps and to keep up the positive momentum in Bosnia.\n  First, in the very near future we must secure the commitment of \nseveral of our allies to contribute troops to create the European \nparamilitary\n\n[[Page S724]]\n\ngendarme force for Bosnia, which I described earlier, to handle a \nvariety of civilian security tasks. This is eminently do-able and would \nprovide a tremendous boost to Dayton implementation.\n  Second, although we will almost certainly reduce the size of the \nAmerican troop commitment in the post-SFOR force from the current eight \nthousand five hundred, the President must make clear to the American \npublic that he is prepared to raise that number again if our commander \non the ground in Bosnia certifies that the security situation warrants \nit.\n  Third--and this may not sit well with some of my colleagues--I \nbelieve that if a continued American troop presence in Bosnia is an \nimportant national interest, as it manifestly is--then I think this \npriority should be reflected in a supplemental appropriation that does \nnot reprogram other military funding. In other words, we should not \nsacrifice readiness elsewhere to pay for Bosnia. Both are essential, \nand we can afford both.\n  Fourth, we should support Republika Srpska Prime Minister Dodik by \nspeedily providing assistance to his central government and to \nlocalities that implement Dayton, but not provide it in an \nindiscriminate way. What do I mean by that?\n  I mean that henceforth in order to receive American USAID assistance, \nall Bosnian municipalities, both in the Republika Srpska and in the \nFederation, by a reasonable date-certain would have to join the Open \nCities Program to welcome returning minority refugees, seat their \nmunicipal councils that were legally elected last September, and deny \nsanctuary to indicted war criminals.\n  I would also design USAID reconstruction projects that designate for \nreturning minority refugees housing units or jobs in rebuilt factories.\n  Let me underscore, Mr. President--and this is key--my plan means not \nproviding assistance to localities until they comply. The date-certain \nmust be reasonable, but firm.\n  The restrictions I propose are not intended to undercut Prime \nMinister Dodik, whom I support. But we must be clear: the American \npolicy goal is not just to have a rhetorically friendlier Republika \nSrpska government, but is rather to help build a multi-ethnic, \ndemocratic Bosnia.\n  Fifth, as a specific corollary of this last point, we should force \nthe Bosnian Muslim SDA Party, the senior partner in the Federation \ngovernment, to welcome returning Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat \nrefugees back to Sarajevo and to enact legislation to enable non-\nMuslims to reclaim their former apartments in ``socially owned,'' that \nis, public housing.\n  I have advocated these steps for months. Last week, under pressure \nfrom our talented Special Envoy Ambassador Bob Gelbard, Bosnian \nPresident Izetbegovic finally agreed to admit twenty thousand Serbs and \nCroats and to introduce the property legislation. We must now hold him \nto his word, using assistance as a lever.\n\n  The Bosnian Muslims, the principal victims of the carnage of the last \nfour years, know that they have no stronger defender in Congress than \nme. But they must also realize that all groups in Bosnia--Muslims, \nCroats, Serbs, and others--deserve equal treatment as the country is \nrebuilt and made healthy again. I cannot stress this point enough.\n  Sixth, in the preparations for the pivotal Bosnian national elections \nnext September we should greatly increase our support for the non-\nnationalist, multi-ethnic parties in the Federation and the Republika \nSrpska.\n  Until now, this task in the field has been handled principally by the \nU.S. National Democratic Institute, which has done superb work.\n  We should now pressure the OSCE to involve the multi-ethnic parties \nin the work of the Provisional Election Commission, which sets the \nground rules.\n  For example, until now, incredible as it may sound, only the \nnationalist parties have had access to voters' lists!\n  Mr. President, Bosnia has come a long way since the horrifying days \nonly two-and-a-half years ago when daily mortar attacks and snipers \nterrorized Sarajevo and Mostar, when thousands were brutally murdered \nin Srebrenica and elsewhere, and when women were degraded in bestial \nrape camps.\n  Much work remains to be done, but there is light at the end of the \ntunnel. A peaceful, democratic Bosnia is central to the peace of \nEurope, and therefore to America's national interest. And American \nleadership is absolutely essential to the rebuilding of the country.\n  For all these reasons, I am confident that in the coming weeks when \nthe Congress is called upon to support an extension of the American \ncommitment to Bosnia, it will respond affirmatively.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S722-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COPYRIGHT COMPULSORY LICENSE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my good friend and colleague Mr. Coble, the \nChairman of the House Judiciary Intellectual Property Subcommittee \nintroduced in the House today the Copyright Compulsory License \nImprovement Act. I had intended to introduce similar legislation in the \nSenate today, but have decided to allow some of my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee time to review this important legislation and join \nme in presenting legislation to the Senate.\n  Let me first thank Mr. Coble for his leadership in this area. He and \nhis staff have worked tirelessly to develop the bill he introduced \ntoday. It is legislation that will set the stage for increased \ncompetition in the multi-channel video delivery market, and that means \ngreater viewer choice in getting television. It is always a pleasure to \nwork with Chairman Coble, and I look forward to working with him as we \nperfect this legislation and move it to enactment. I have also worked \nwith the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nLeahy, who has provided valuable input into the Senate legislation.\n  I must also acknowledge the input of the Register of Copyrights and \nCopyright Office staff. They worked along with congressional staff in \ncreating this legislation.\n  Let me say that I believe the legislation that Chairman Coble and I \nhave worked on effectively balances the various interests affected by \nthe legislation. While I look forward to perfecting the legislation, I \nexpect it to undergo revision as it moves through the process, I \nbelieve that the essential balance must be maintained for this \nlegislation to move this year. And it is important that we enact \nlegislation this year allowing satellite carriers to provide local \ncarriage of broadcast signals within a broadcaster's local market. No \nreform is more important to making satellite competitive with cable for \nthe long term. I believe the other reforms also set the stage for \nvigorous competition between satellite and cable, with adequate \nprotections for the other interested parties whose works are delivered \nby them to viewers, which should result in lower prices and increased \nchoices for viewers. This is important legislation for all of our \nconstituents, but particularly for those in states with rural or \nmountainous areas such as my home state of Utah. I hope my colleagues \nwill help work to enact these reforms this year so that the next \ngeneration of satellite television delivery can become a reality in the \nvery near future.\n  I welcome input from all interested parties and my colleagues. And I \nlook forward to introducing a companion to Mr. Coble's bill when we \nreturn from our President's Day recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S724-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S724-S725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INNOCENT SPOUSES NEED RELIEF\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Bill Roth, for the very thoughtful and \ndetermined way that he has handled the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nreform effort.\n  Had he simply bowed to calls from some on the other side of the aisle \nto sweep problems with the IRS under the rug and rush the IRS reform \nbill to a vote, we probably would not have had the chance to shed light \non the serious abuses that innocent spouses have experienced at the \nhands of the IRS. And we certainly would not have the chance to ensure \nthat an effective fix for innocent spouses is included in the IRS \nreform legislation.\n  I think it is important to say at the outset that most IRS employees \nare law-abiding and professional, and most\n\n[[Page S725]]\n\nof them deal fairly with taxpayers. It is important to remember, too, \nthat the IRS has been given the difficult and thankless task of \nadministering a Tax Code that is exceedingly complex, filled with \ncontradictory provisions, and open to differing interpretations. But \nsince the IRS has been given such tremendous power--power that can \nbankrupt families, put people out of their homes, and ruin lives--any \nabuse of that power cannot be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, last December, I hosted a Town Hall meeting and a \nseries of other events in Arizona to solicit public comment about how \nbest to reform the IRS. One of the people I heard from was a woman who \ndivorced in late 1995. While she paid her taxes in full and on time \nduring the last two years of her marriage, her husband did not. The IRS \nultimately came after her for the taxes that her former spouse did not \npay.\n  About two weeks after hearing from her--on December 19--I sent \nChairman Roth a letter identifying ways of improving the IRS reform \nbill, and on that short list was a recommendation to make innocent-\nspouse relief easier to obtain, and to make it available retroactively, \nor at least to all cases pending on the date of enactment of the bill.\n  So obviously, I am delighted that the Finance Committee has focused \non the issue of innocent-spouse protection. The hearing held by the \nCommittee just yesterday revealed just how seriously people can be \nabused. The Committee heard from several separated or divorced women \nwho, like my constituent, had been pursued by the IRS for tax debts run \nup by their former husbands.\n  Mr. President, husband and wife are equal partners in a marriage. \nFinancial obligations are a shared responsibility, and appropriately \nso. We need to be careful not to undermine the commitment that people \nhave made to each other, or we may unintentionally create new \nincentives for couples to divorce merely to limit their tax \nobligations. That is how the marriage penalty was born--something we \nwill need to fix later this year.\n  But there are unique circumstances that arise from time to time that \nmake it inappropriate to hold one spouse liable for taxes that are \nprimarily attributable to the other spouse. Those circumstances seem to \narise far more frequently than one might think. One estimate by the \nGeneral Accounting Office suggests that the IRS tries to collect taxes \nfrom the wrong spouse after a separation or divorce in at least 50,000 \ncases a year.\n  One of the women who testified before the Finance Committee yesterday \nwas a fourth-grade teacher from Florida who divorced back in 1995. Her \nhusband--himself a former field auditor for the IRS--has reportedly \nfailed to file the couple's tax returns for 1993 and 1994. When he did \nlater file joint returns, he allegedly forged her signature. The IRS \nhas now put a lien on her home, while he is apparently paying just $200 \nto $300 per month toward the debt.\n  A widowed mother of five who has been on and off food stamps \ntestified before the Committee. The IRS said she owes more than \n$527,000.\n  A disabled nurse has a lien put on her home for taxes dating back to \nthe 1960s, even though her divorce decree explicitly stated that she \nwas not responsible for her former husband's debts.\n  The problem is that, while the IRS is targeting these women, it is \napparently failing to pursue their former husbands with equal vigor. \nThere are cases where men, too, are the primary focus of the IRS's \ncollection efforts, but this is predominately a problem that affects \nwomen. Nine out of 10 innocent spouses are women. Maybe that is because \nthey are more likely to pay up when confronted by the IRS. Maybe it is \nbecause women sometimes have fewer resources available to defend \nthemselves. In either case, singling out women for abusive collection \nefforts is just plain wrong.\n  One solution might be simply to repeal the joint liability rules. \nMaybe liability ought to be proportionate to each spouse's earnings \nduring the marriage. I understand the Committee is looking at a range \nof options. One way or the other, though, we have got to solve this \nproblem and get the IRS off the backs of women whose only offense is \nthat they took their husband's word that their finances were in order. \nAnd we ought to be sure that whatever we do extends back retroactively.\n  Mr. President, I am obviously very appreciative of the fact that \nChairman Roth and the Finance Committee have focused on this very \nimportant issue. And again, I want to thank Chairman Roth for resisting \ncalls from the other side to merely rush ahead with an IRS reform \nmeasure before the Committee could deal with the innocent-spouse issue. \nI look forward to working with the Committee to ensure that an \neffective solution to this problem is included in the IRS reform bill \nbefore final passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S724-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, this bill should have been the easiest \nthing we did this Congress. The Senate passed legislation on this issue \nby unanimous consent twice last year. This bill contains nothing less \nthan our Nation's energy security insurance policy. This bill \nauthorizes two vital energy security measures: the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve and U.S. participation in the International Energy Agency.\n  Both of these authorities have expired. At this moment, sabers are \nrattling in the Gulf. Very soon, there may be more than sabers \nrattling. As I speak, more American troops are headed to the Middle \nEast. We owe it to our soldiers, and the Nation's civilian consumers, \nto do everything we can to ensure that our energy insurance policy is \nin effect.\n  The House bill before us, H.R. 2472, would provide a simple extension \nof these authorities through September of this year. However, this is \nnot enough to ensure our Nation's energy security. We must change the \nantitrust exemption in EPCA to comply with current IEA policy. The IEA \nchanged its emergency response policy at our request, switching from \ncommand-and-control measures to more market-oriented coordinated \nstockdraw procedures. However, our laws haven't kept up.\n  Right now, our U.S. oil companies don't have any assurance that their \nattempts to cooperate with the IEA and our government in a crises won't \nbe a violation of antitrust laws. The IEA's efforts to respond to a \ncrisis will be critically impaired if it can't coordinate with U.S. oil \ncompanies. Our oil companies want to cooperate with our government and \nthe IEA and strongly support this amendment.\n  We also need to amend H.R. 2472 to extend the authorization beyond \nSeptember. For every year in recent memory, we have authorized this Act \non a year-to-year basis. Every year, we face a potential crises when \nthese authorities go unrenewed until the very end of the Congress. The \nprovisions of this bill are not controversial. However, there are those \nwho see any important bill as leverage.\n  This year, we are on the edge of a real crises. We have ongoing \nmilitary action in the Gulf, and no clear authority to respond to oil \nsupply shortages. Playing political games with this bill has always \nbeen irresponsible; now it is downright dangerous. In the future, the \nonly way to avoid the annual crisis is to renew EPCA for more than one \nyear. I am disappointed that we can't do that now. But for now, we must \navert the immediate crisis.\n  I have tried to address concerns about the future of the SPR. Like \nmany of you, I am dismayed by the recent use of the SPR as a ``piggy \nbank''. In 1995, DOE proposed the sale of oil to pay for repairs and \nupkeep, opening the floodgates to continued sales of oil for budget-\nbalancing purposes. So far, we've lost the American taxpayer over half \na billion dollars. Buying high and selling low never makes sense. We're \nlike the man in the old joke who was buying high and selling low who \nclaimed that ``he would make it up on volume.'' I am pleased that \nPresident's budget does not propose oil sales. I hope we have broken \nthe habit of selling SPR oil forever.\n  We have already invested a great deal of taxpayer dollars in the SPR. \nWe proved during the Persian Gulf War that the stabilizing effect of an \nSPR drawdown far outstrips the volume of oil sold. The simple fact that \nthe SPR is available can have a calming influence on oil markets. The \noil is there, waiting to dampen the effects of an energy emergency on \nour economy. However, if we don't ensure that there is\n\n[[Page S729]]\n\nauthority to use the oil when we need it, we will have thrown those tax \ndollars away. So, the first step is to ensure that our emergency oil \nreserves are fully authorized and available.\n  We are talking about people's lives and jobs. The least we can do is \nstop holding this measure hostage to political ambition. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the adoption of this amendment and immediate \npassage of H.R. 2472. I also urge our colleagues in the other body to \nadopt this measure before we go home for recess during this dangerous \nand uncertain time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1645) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before we engage in a significant \nmilitary confrontation in the Persian Gulf, the Senate should \nthoroughly examine the reasons for, and the likely outcomes of, such \naction. Many of our colleagues have begun to do so in speeches on this \nfloor over the past several days. I look forward to a continuation of \nthis vigorous debate when the Majority Leader brings forward his \nresolution on this topic.\n  I believe that we must also take concrete action today, by amending \nand passing the bill that is now before us, to ensure that our nation \nand our economy are fully prepared to deal with any adverse effect that \nmilitary action in the Gulf might have on the world's supply of oil \nfrom that region.\n  About 65 percent of the world's known oil reserves lie in the Persian \nGulf region. That region supplies one-quarter of the oil that the world \nnow consumes. Although Persian Gulf oil is responsible for a smaller \nfraction of U.S. oil consumption, world oil markets are highly \ninterconnected. Any threat to the continued supply of Persian Gulf oil \nat current rates of production will quickly translate into volatile, \nhigher prices here in the United States.\n  One can see this in the historical record. After the Iraqi invasion \nof Kuwait, world oil prices rose sharply, and American consumers paid \naccordingly. Between August 1, 1990 and December 1, 1990, U.S. \nconsumers spent $21 billion more for crude oil and petroleum products \nthan would have been spent absent that Middle East crisis. Events in \nIraq continue to drive world oil markets. On November 13, 1997, the day \nthat Saddam Hussein intensified the current crisis by ejecting U.S. \ninspectors from Iraq, the world price of oil rose by 20 cents per \nbarrel. The last time we waged war on Saddam Hussein, our strategy \nincluded not only amassing multilateral military might in the Persian \nGulf, but also minimizing the conflict's economic impact at home. We \nappear headed for another major military confrontation in the Gulf, but \nthanks to inaction by the other body, the second part of our 1991 \nstrategy is currently not even an option.\n\n  President Bush had two tools at his disposal to reduce the economic \neffects of a military conflict in the Persian Gulf. The first was an \neconomic alliance among the world's major oil-consuming countries, the \nindependent International Energy Agency (or IEA). The United States \nformed the IEA after the Arab oil embargo of 1973, so that we would \nnever again experience the market chaos, including gas station lines, \nthat occurred back then. The initial IEA approach for dealing with oil \nsupply disruptions was through mandatory allocations--having an \ninternational committee decide which nation would get how much oil.\n  The world has changed since then. 1970s-style command-and-control \nsupply allocations won't work today. Instead, the United States has \ntaken the lead in designing a flexible, market-friendly response to oil \nsupply disruptions. The new approach relies on a coordinated drawdown \nof worldwide oil supplies. President Bush pioneered such a system \nduring the 1991 Gulf War, although the oil companies that cooperated at \nthat time placed themselves in legal jeopardy for having done so. The \nUnited States, with the full backing of our domestic oil industry, has \nrefined this concept and convinced all of the other countries in the \nIEA to adopt it. But without passage of a law to facilitate the sharing \nof information about oil supplies in an emergency, the mechanism cannot \nbe used.\n  If the world encounters oil market instability, the IEA will need to \nknow about the location and movement of oil supplies in order to \ncoordinate a response. Most of these oil supplies are privately held, \nso only oil companies have the needed information. Sharing such \ninformation is normally forbidden under U.S. antitrust laws, which \napply to the world's major oil companies by virtue of their operation \nin this country. But in a genuine emergency, the national interest in \nthe free flow of oil is far greater than the interest in keeping oil \ncompanies from sharing inventory information. Accordingly, there is \nalready an emergency antitrust exemption in law that allows oil \ncompanies to share information with the IEA, but only to implement the \noutdated command-and-control response to an oil crisis, and only if the \noil supply disruption is of mammoth proportions. Both the Bush and \nClinton Administrations have sought to make this antitrust exemption \napply to the types of oil crises we are actually likely to see, and to \ncoordinated emergency responses other than mandatory worldwide oil \nsupply allocations. This revised antitrust exemption would apply only \nwhen information sharing was expressly requested by the U.S. \ngovernment. This is what we need to enact into law, now. Without these \nchanges, the United States could find itself in the absurd position of \nbeing unable to use the international oil emergency response system \nthat we ourselves designed.\n  The second tool that President Bush had at his disposal in 1991 was \nthe nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)--586 million barrels of \ncrude oil, stored in underground salt caverns at five sites along the \ncoast of Texas and Louisiana. At the beginning of Operation Desert \nStorm, President Bush ordered the drawdown and sale of oil from the \nSPR. This had a powerful calming influence on world oil markets. \nIncredible as it may seem, such a use of the SPR by President Clinton \nwould be illegal today. The United States still owns 563 million \nbarrels of crude oil in underground salt caverns, but the President's \nauthority to sell it in response to an emergency has lapsed.\n  How could we be so vulnerable to such clear and present dangers? I \nregret that once again, in the immortal words of Pogo, we have met the \nenemy, and he is us. The Administration has beseeched the Congress, for \nyears now, to update the legal framework governing the IEA and to renew \nits authority to operate the SPR. The Senate has repeatedly and \nunanimously passed such legislation. The other body has refused to act, \nfor reasons that are very difficult to understand.\n  With a major military confrontation in the Persian Gulf imminent, \nfurther delay is inexcuseable. We cannot allow our economy to be \nneedlessly vulnerable to, say, a terrorist attack on Middle East oil \ninfrastructure. I applaud the Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources for his persistence in trying to resolve \nthis problem. I fully support his amendment to H.R. 2472, which \nprovides the President with all the tools he needs to respond to an oil \nsupply disruption. In the current situation, to do any less would be \nirresponsible. I hope that the other body now acts quickly on this \nmatter. If the House has concerns, let us quickly convene a joint \nHouse-Senate conference to resolve them. If not, then let this bill \nbecome law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER, Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist \non its amendment to the House, the Senate request a conference with the \nHouse, and finally, that any statements relating to the measure appear \nat this point in the Record.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S728-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S729-S730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \nwithdrawals and sundry nominations which were referred to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S729-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S729-S730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting two \nwithdrawals and sundry nominations which were referred to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S730]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S729-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:15 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, with an amendment, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       S. 927.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reduce \nthe maximum capital gains rates, to index capital assets for inflation, \nand to repeal the Federal estate and gift taxes and the tax on \ngeneration-skipping transfers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            CAPITAL GAINS AND ESTATE TAX REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I spent the month of January attending \ntown meetings throughout the State of Colorado. That is one of the \nthings, when I go back to my State, that I spend a lot of time doing--\nvisiting the counties and visiting with the people of Colorado. Over \nthe years, we continue to have the issue of taxes brought up in the \ntown meetings--probably more so now than at any time that I can recall \nsince having town meetings.\n  The American people simply want to have their tax system reformed, \nparticularly those in Colorado. They want lower taxes, they want a \nsimpler tax system, and they want less intrusive means of collecting \nthose taxes.\n  Last year, Congress enacted modest tax relief, but it was only a \nfirst step. It's time to move forward with more aggressive tax reform.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will do four things:\n  It will continue to reduce the capital gains tax to a top rate of 14 \npercent.\n  It will restore the one-year holding period for capital gains \ntreatment.\n  It will index capital gains and, thereby, eliminate the taxation of \ngains that are due solely to inflation.\n  And then, finally, it will eliminate the estate tax.\n  These changes will provide important tax relief for families and \nbusinesses, and continue to ensure that our economy remains the most \ncompetitive in the world.\n  Mr. President, the new year has certainly brought good news \nconcerning the Federal budget. But let's be honest. The budget is \nbalancing because of the hard work of the American people, not because \nof any bold action by the Federal Government. Economic performance in \nrecent years has exceeded all expectations. The result is that the \nAmerican people have been sending greater and greater amounts of their \nearnings to Washington. The budget is balancing because of an explosion \nin tax receipts, not because of any restraint in spending. In fact, the \nbudget continues to grow at a healthy pace. Federal spending in 1998 is \nestimated to be 4.3 percent above the 1997 level--well in excess of \ninflation. Many would like this to continue.\n  The President assured us in a previous State of the Union Address \nthat, ``the era of big Government is over.'' But it is clear that he is \nnow proposing a new era of big Government.\n  I favor a different course. We should not squander the people's \nsurplus on more Government. Instead, we should begin to pay down the \ndebt and reform the tax system. We should put American families ahead \nof the insatiable appetite of Washington, DC, for more Government \nspending.\n  Despite last year's budget bill, taxes remain higher than they have \never been. Tax freedom day--the day to which the average American works \nto pay the combined Federal, State, and local tax burden--is May 9, \nwhich is the latest it has ever been. A reduction in the Federal debt \nand a reasonable level of taxation should be the twin objectives of \nCongress as we enter the next century. Our job is to ensure that the \nbridge to the 21st century does not become a toll bridge.\n  Mr. President, let me begin with a discussion of capital gains taxes. \nI call the capital gains tax the ``growth tax.'' Nearly all Americans \nown capital, and they experience a tax on that capital when they sell \nthe stocks, or a small business, or a farm.\n  Mr. President, let's look at how this capital gains, or growth tax, \nhits ordinary working Americans. Stock ownership has doubled in the \nlast 7 years, to the point where 43 percent of all adult Americans own \nstock. Obviously, with those numbers, stock ownership is not just \nconfined to the wealthy; it is spread throughout society. Today, half \nof the investors are women, and half are noncollege graduates. Stocks \nare typically held for retirement, education expenses, and other long-\nterm goals. This is precisely the type of saving and investing that we \nneed in our economy.\n  Mr. President, I can't leave this topic without talking about small \nbusiness owners and farmers. There is no clearer area where the \n``growth tax'' makes no\n\n[[Page S732]]\n\nsense. Millions of American families put their lives into building \nsmall businesses and farms. Often, those businesses or farms are sold \nto finance a decent retirement. But this can only occur after Uncle Sam \ngets his cut of one-third or more of all the gains.\n  Simply put, low taxation makes it less costly to take the risks that \nare critical in a capitalist economy. I am proposing that we enact a \nmaximum capital gains tax of 14 percent, with those in the lowest tax \nbracket paying only 7 percent. Last year's reduction of the capital \ngains rate was a big plus, but it came with a price--the holding period \nrequired to qualify for the lower tax was extended from 12 months to 18 \nmonths.\n  The holding period change is a poor attempt by the Government to \nmicromanage the economy. This is the type of Government management that \nhas so clearly failed in Asia. A market economy functions best when \ncapital flows freely, unencumbered by Government distortions. The \nholding period for long-term capital gains treatment has been 12 months \nfor years, and it should stay that way.\n  Mr. President, an additional mistake that Congress made in last \nyear's bill was a failure to include indexing. The real ``growth tax'' \nis often much higher than 20 percent. This is because our Tax Code does \nnot protect Americans from taxation on capital gains that result from \ninflation. This is one of the most unfair aspects of the growth tax. \nGovernment policies contribute to inflation, and Government turns \naround and taxes its citizens on that inflation.\n  For this reason, I fought hard to see that indexing was included last \nyear. I offered an amendment to the tax bill that would have added \nindexing. The amendment was carefully structured to avoid any revenue \nloss. Obviously, I was disappointed with the defeat of this amendment. \nI presume that this was due largely to the President's opposition to \nindexing and his veto threat. Despite this, we got a strong vote, and I \npromised that I would be back.\n  I have included indexing in this bill, and I fully intend to offer \nthis at each opportunity. Some have dismissed indexing as ``too \ncostly,'' but for me this is an issue of fundamental fairness. It is \nwrong for the Federal Government to tax citizens on inflation.\n  Since I mentioned the issue of cost, let me make a few points on \nthis. I have long maintained that a capital gains tax cut will increase \nrevenue. In the short run, it encourages the sale of assets that would \nnot otherwise occur. This obviously increases revenue.\n\n  In the long run, a rate cut facilitates a higher level of economic \ngrowth. This also results in greater tax revenue.\n  Unfortunately, during last year's tax debate, we continued to operate \nunder revenue models that forecast a loss to the government from the \ncapital gains rate cut.\n  I hope we can soon put this notion to rest for good.\n  It is already apparent that capital gains revenues will be coming \ninto the Treasury at a considerably higher level than forecast last \nyear when we were talking about capital gains. 1998 capital gains \nrevenues could be as much as 50% higher than previously forecast.\n  Even state governments will benefit from the rate cut. Earlier this \nmonth, analysts for the Colorado Legislature forecast that the capital \ngains tax changes would result in an additional $38 million this year \nfor the Colorado state budget.\n  Obviously, the impact at the federal level will be many times \ngreater.\n\n\n                         estate tax elimination\n\n  The final provision in this tax bill is the elimination of the estate \ntax.\n  Frankly, the estate tax makes no sense.\n  While the tax raises only 1 percent of federal revenues, it destroys \nfamily businesses and farms.\n  The estate tax is double taxation.\n  At the time of a person's death, much of their farm, business, and \nlife savings has already been subjected to federal, state, and local \ntax. These same assets are taxed again under the estate tax.\n  The estate tax fails to distinguish between cash and non-liquid \nassets.\n  Family businesses are often asset-rich, and cash poor. But the value \nof all assets must be included in the taxable estate.\n  This can force liquidations, and family businesses can see their \nlivelihood eliminated in order to pay a tax of up to 55 percent. Yes. \nThat is right--up to 55 percent.\n  This practice threatens the stability of our families and communities \nwhile inhibiting growth and economic development.\n  The National Center for Policy Analysis reports that a 1995 survey by \nTravis Research Associates found that 51 percent of family businesses \nwould have difficulty surviving the estate tax, 14 percent of business \nowners said it would be impossible to survive, 30 percent said they \nwould have to sell part or all of their business.\n  This is supported by a 1995 Family Business Survey conducted by \nMatthew Greenwald and Associates which found that 33% of family \nbusinesses anticipate having to liquidate or sell part of their \nbusiness to pay the estate tax.\n  Recently, the accounting firm Price Waterhouse calculated the taxable \ncomponents of 1995 estates. While 21% of assets were corporate stock \nand bonds, and another 21% were mutual fund assets, fully 32% of gross \nestates consisted of ``business assets'' such as stock in closely held \nbusinesses, interests in non-corporate businesses and farms, and \ninterests in limited partnerships. In larger estates this portion rose \nto 55%.\n  Clearly, a substantial portion of taxable estates consists of family \nbusinesses.\n  The recent tax bill increased the estate tax exemption from $600,000 \nto $1 million. However, this is done very gradually and does not reach \nthe $1 million level until 2006. The bill also increased the exemption \namount for a qualified family owned business to $1.3 million. While \nboth actions are a good first step, they barely compensate for the \neffects of inflation. The $600,000 exemption level was last set in \n1987, just to keep pace with inflation the exemption should have risen \nto $850,000 by 1997.\n  Incremental improvements help, but we need more substantial reform. \nIt is time to eliminate this tax entirely. This action has been taken \nin countries such as Australia and Canada. Unfortunately, the United \nStates retains what are arguably the highest estate taxes in the world.\n  Among industrial nations, only Japan has a higher rate than the U.S. \nBut Japan's 70% top rate applies only to inheritance of $16 million or \nmore. The U.S. top rate of 55% kicks in on estates of $3 million or \nmore. France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland all have top rates of \n40%, and the average top rate of OECD countries is only 29%.\n  Repeal of the estate tax would benefit the economy. George Mason \nUniversity Professor Richard Wagner estimates that within seven years \nof elimination of the estate tax the output of the country would be \nincreased by $79 billion per year, resulting in up to 228,000 new jobs. \nUnder the current system, the energy that could go into greater \nproductivity is expended by selling off businesses, dividing resources \nand preparing for the absorption of an estate by the government. Those \nbusinesses that survive the estate tax often do so by purchasing \nexpensive insurance. A 1995 Gallup survey of family firms found that \n23% of the owners of companies valued at over $10 million pay $50,000 \nor more per year in insurance premiums on policies designed to help \nthem pay the eventual tax bill.\n  The same survey found that family firms estimated they had spent on \naverage over $33,000 on lawyers, accountants and financial planners in \norder to prepare for the estate tax.\n  Ironically, the estate tax is often justified on the grounds that it \nhelps to equalize wealth. But this effect is greatly exaggerated. A \n1995 study published by the Rand Corporation found that for the very \nwealthiest Americans, only 7.5% of their wealth is attributable to \ninheritance--the other 92.5% is from earnings.\n  Mr. President, it is time to repeal this outdated tax. We must insist \nthat no more American families lose their business because of the \nestate tax. We must ensure that when a family is coping with all the \ninevitable costs of passing a business from one generation to the next, \nthe Federal Government is not there as an added burden.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that by introducing this tax legislation \nand placing these proposals on the table we can begin to debate \nsignificant tax relief for 1998.\n\n[[Page S733]]\n\n  Each of these changes: a lower capital gains rate, indexing, and \nrepeal of the estate tax, are consistent with long-term tax reform. And \neach of them can be enacted this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 1636. A bill to provide benefits to domestic partners of Federal \nemployees; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     the domestic partnership benefits and obligations act of 1998\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, last October, Congressman Barney Frank \nbroke new ground when he introduced HR2761, the Domestic Partnership \nBenefits and Obligations Act of 1997. I am here today to break ground \nin the Senate by introducing the Domestic Partnership Benefits and \nObligations Act of 1998. This bill does not introduce new benefits; it \nsimply extends existing benefits to a previously uncovered group of \nemployees for very little cost.\n\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to outline my bill. This bill \nprovides benefits for same-sex domestic partners of civilian, federal \nemployees. Partners must be living together, in a committed, intimate \nrelationship, and responsible for each other's welfare and financial \nobligations. It provides access to five categories of benefits in the \nsame way that married spouses have access: participation in retirement \nprograms, life insurance, health insurance, compensation for work \ninjuries, and upon the death of a government employee, the domestic \npartner would be deemed a spouse for the purpose of receiving benefits.\n  This is a bill about justice, about fairness, about equity in the \nworkplace. This bill is about saying to our gay and lesbian employees, \n``We value your contribution to the workplace, and to show you we value \nyou, we're going to protect your families, like we protect the families \nof married employees, by providing them with benefits.'' It is about \nproviding the opportunity for same-sex domestic partners to provide \ntheir partners--who previously have been denied--access to such \nbenefits as health insurance.\n  For many people in this country, insurance benefits for their loved \nones are automatic, they are expected, they are the norm. But benefits \ndidn't start out that way. In fact, they are a relatively modern \ninvention. Benefits in the form of compensation were created in the \n1940's, essentially to increase compensation for some employees who \nwere prohibited by law from getting pay increases. So instead of more \npay, employers paid for certain products and services such as health \ninsurance to take care of their employees and to make their businesses \nmore attractive to potential employees. For gay men and lesbians, most \nof these benefits are completely inaccessible.\n  But where is it written in stone that only married spouses and their \nchildren deserve benefits? Yes, many employers have chosen to limit \nbenefits to married spouses and their children, but more and more, \ngovernments, universities, and private businesses have been making a \ndifferent choice. Business and organizations like the San Francisco \n49ers, Reader's Digest, Starbucks, Coors, Ben and Jerry's, Kodak, \nDisney, the Union Theological Seminary, the Episcopal Diocese of \nNewark, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers #18, \nMattel, the Vermont Girl Scout Council, and more than 50 Fortune 500 \ncompanies have made the right choice to offer domestic partnership \nbenefits. A more fair and equitable choice. A more humane choice.\n  I am disappointed that domestic partnership benefits have already \nbeen offered in some cities and by some businesses since 1982 but here \nwe are in 1998 and we're just now talking about them here in the \nSenate. Today there are at least 42 cities and municipalities, 12 \ncounties, 1 state, and 342 private sector for-profit and not-for profit \nbusinesses and unions which offer domestic partner benefits. The good \nnews, though, is that we have more than 15 years worth of employers' \nexperiences with providing these benefits.\n  By virtue of our vote on DOMA, we have said that same-sex couples \ncannot marry. But that doesn't mean that people in long-term, loving, \nand committed relationships don't deserve to have the opportunity to \nprovide their loved ones with health insurance, survivor benefits, and \nother benefits. Domestic partnership legislation levels the playing \nfield for same-sex partners who are not allowed to marry. This bill is \naimed at correcting that inequity. Here is the story of how not having \ndomestic partnership benefits effected one couple's lives:\n\n       Anonymous: My partner and I have been together for almost \n     six. About a year ago, he had to leave work due to a serious \n     heart condition. Since my employer doesn't include domestic \n     partnership benefits, we had to pay all of his expenses out \n     of pocket. For quite some time I had to support him from my \n     salary, or else he would have ended up on welfare. We are \n     still scrimping and saving to try and pay off the health care \n     expenses that should have been covered by my insurance (if we \n     had dp benefits). Almost all of my heterosexual friends have \n     been ``married'' less time than my partner and I and received \n     benefits immediately after the marriage. Their relationships \n     seem no more permanent than my own. When my partner and I \n     have been together for fifty years, we will still not have \n     insurance for him through my employer.\n\n  Not only are domestic partnership benefits fair and just, they cost \nvery little. Employers have found that upon implementing domestic \npartnership benefits, one percent of all employees--at most--actually \nsign up their same-sex partners for benefits. And more often, it is \nless than one percent. Even taking the most liberal figures, there is \nno legitimate reason to argue that more than 1% of our almost 300,000 \nfederal civilian employees will enroll. And even though this is a \nrelatively small number of employees--at most 30,000--let me tell you, \nthese benefits are of critical importance to those who do.\n\n  For example, Marieta Louise Luna is a graduate student studying in \nthe Divinity School at Duke University. She says,\n\n       I just returned home from the hospital on Thursday night \n     from having a knee replacement made possible largely because \n     of the fact that Kathryn is a Duke employee and I have \n     domestic partner benefits.\n       Guaranteed, I could not have had the surgery if I had not \n     had domestic partner benefits. For me, it was the literal \n     difference between walking and being handicapped for the next \n     several years.\n\n  And at a cost of less than 1% of the total benefits budget--or less--\nit is truly worth making this investment.\n  Some might be afraid that domestic partnership policies could open \nthe door to fraud with people signing up their friends in order to get \nhealth insurance.\n  Most employers never ask for verification of a heterosexual marriage. \nI have never been asked to provide a marriage certificate to prove I'm \nmarried, and I doubt that many of you have either.\n  But my bill has stringent requirements for qualifying as domestic \npartners. Among other requirements, partners must sign an affidavit \ncertifying that they share responsibility for a significant measure of \neach other's common welfare and financial obligations. And they must \nshow documentation to prove it--such as copies of a mortgage or lease \nwith both names on it, copies of bank statements showing joint checking \nor savings accounts, copies of durable powers of attorney for property \nand health, or copies of wills specifying each other as the major \nrecipients of each other's financial assets.\n  In addition, my bill specifies serious consequences for fraud, \nincluding the possibility of disciplinary action, termination of \nemployment, and repayment of any insurance benefits received.\n  Finally, there are criminal statutes that provide that making false \nstatements and defrauding the government are crimes which can result in \na fine and/or imprisonment up to 5 years.\n  The bottom line is that this bill creates serious consequences for \nfraud, establishes that every effort will be made to minimize fraud by \nthose falsely claiming to be domestic and specifies that those caught \nwill be seriously punished.\n  Let me tell you one more story:\n\n       Anonymous from Minnesota: I have had the same health care \n     benefits package for nearly 16 years. I began family coverage \n     when I married in 1978. Our two children were added when they \n     were born. My ex-husband remained on my insurance policy \n     after we divorced--at no additional cost--even though we were \n     not legally married.\n       I am now in a committed lesbian relationship. My partner \n     had been teaching part-time in a private school for two years \n     before she became eligible for health insurance through her \n     employer. Two weeks before her insurance was to take effect \n     she was stricken with severe abdominal pain. Though we \n     considered ``toughing it out'' until her insurance kicked in, \n     it became increasingly clear that\n\n[[Page S734]]\n\n     she needed to be treated immediately. She had a large, \n     twisted ovarian tumor removed. By the time of the surgery, \n     her insurance was in place. We breathed a sigh of relief.\n       Months later we learned that because her pain started (and \n     was briefly treated) before her insurance began, the claim \n     for coverage for the surgery and hospital stay were \n     disallowed because there was a pre-existing condition \n     exclusion in her insurance policy. We are now faced with over \n     $5,500 (plus 12% interest per year) in medical bills. This \n     may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but it \n     certainly is to us. And it's money that wouldn't have had to \n     be spent at all if she had been on my family coverage all \n     along.\n       So why is it that my ex-husband (no legal relation) was \n     entitled to continue receiving benefits until he married, but \n     my life partner has had to go without medical insurance? The \n     answer is simple--discrimination.\n\n  This is a bill about fairness. This is about equity in the workplace. \nThis is about protecting employees' loved ones. It's the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Additional Stories Regarding Domestic Partnership Benefits\n\n       Wendy I. Horowitz: My partner was ill for almost a year. I \n     worked for a large conservative company that never considered \n     implementing domestic partner benefits. After seeing one of \n     my co-workers get married and have instant coverage for her \n     husband (after they had been married for a day), I decided to \n     apply for benefits for my partner. They were denied. Her \n     illnesses were related to her tonsils, and the doctors \n     suggested that she have them removed. I had to come up with \n     the money to pay for this surgery (over $4,000 by the end of \n     it all), which put a great financial burden on us and on our \n     relationship.\n       Jim and Hal: As an employee of the State of Maryland \n     (through my graduate assistantship), I receive comprehensive \n     health benefits. Although I could share my benefits with a \n     married spouse, I am not able to do a thing for my partner \n     Hal. Hal is another ``starving student''; he is in a doctoral \n     program at American University. Unfortunately, American does \n     not offer full health coverage to its graduate assistants, so \n     Hal is having to make do with emergency health coverage. This \n     has adversely affected us in two ways. First, we have to \n     cover Hals' regular health maintenance (e.g., dental \n     checkups) which is a strain on our already stretched budget. \n     Second and more importantly, Hal has a heart problem for \n     which regular appointments with a cardiologist are \n     recommended. We are not in a position to pay specialist fees \n     out-of-pocket; thus, we are unhappily have to settle for \n     doctors at American University's health center.\n       U Minnesota: R and S are their late 30's, and they have \n     been in a committed relationship for 20 years. S is self-\n     employed as a psychotherapist and is registered with the \n     University as R's domestic partner.\n       Four years ago, R gave birth to the couple's first child L. \n     R was able to put L on her health insurance policy as a \n     dependent. The couple incurred no additional cost or \n     additional deductibles for L's birth or subsequent medical \n     treatment.\n       Three years later, S gave birth to the couple's second \n     child M. Because the University only recognizes formal \n     adoption (not guardianship) for direct dependent coverage, M \n     is only listed as S's child and not R's child. Since the \n     University's domestic partnership plan only provides medical \n     premium reimbursement for partners and their dependents, R \n     and S incurred significantly higher costs for M's birth than \n     for L's birth.\n       Specifically, the couple pays out $526 every 3 months for S \n     and M's insurance policies which each have a $500 deductible \n     (the University plan has no deductible and low copays for \n     dependent care). Reimbursement from the University for this \n     cost takes additional 3 months after the couple pays. Due to \n     IRS regulations, which do not recognize the partners as a \n     couple, the University's reimbursement to the employee is \n     taxed. The end result of all the complications of this system \n     for the couple is that they have $1,500 in outstanding debt \n     for unreimbursed health premiums. In addition, they were \n     charged $1,000 in deductibles plus higher copays for M's \n     birth. They have had to take out a loan to cover these \n     health care related expenses.\n       Becky Liddle: I am a tenured associate professor. My \n     domestic partner quit her job and moved here to Alabama in \n     June of '97, as the ``trailing spouse'' in a dual career \n     couple. We thought she would find work very quickly. But due \n     in part to sexual orientation discrimination in hiring, she \n     has been unable to find professional work and health \n     benefits. She is working full-time for Kelly Services, which \n     does not include health benefits. We brought her a 4-month \n     hospitalization policy before she quit her job, assuming that \n     would be more than enough time--it wasn't. She has no health \n     insurance. We have looked at policies she could buy herself, \n     but they are extremely expensive, and cover very little. My \n     university will not allow me to put my domestic partner on \n     our insurance (in fact, Blue Cross of Alabama explicitly \n     states in its policy that ``spouse'' is limited to someone of \n     the opposite sex). Consequently, every time she gets sick it \n     is a crisis, and we make potentially life-threatening choices \n     about whether she should go to the doctor. For example, she \n     got pneumonia a few weeks ago. This is, she had all the \n     symptoms of pneumonia, according to our Time/Life ``medical \n     advisor--complete guide to alternative & conventional \n     treatments'' book, which has become her primary care \n     ``physician''. The book said if it was viral she should just \n     go to bed, but if it was bacterial it could be life \n     threatening. It appeared from her symptoms to be viral, so we \n     did not spend the money to go to a doctor. This time we were \n     right. She recovered fine in about a week. Of course, if we'd \n     been wrong, she could be dead. I think we make good decisions \n     about how to spend our limited health-care dollars. But I \n     ought to be able to put her on my insurance.\n       Eva Young: I live with my partner of 10 years in \n     Minneapolis. I have benefits through my work place. Even \n     though the University of Minnesota offers ``domestic \n     partnership'' benefits, these don't work for us. To be able \n     to get pretax benefits (analogous to what a married couple \n     get), we would have to declare my partner a dependant. This \n     is degrading to my partner. Although I currently have a \n     better job than she does (it pays better and is permanent), \n     it doesn't mean we should have to declare her a dependant \n     (with all the negative connotations that has) in order to get \n     the benefits we are both entitled to. To add insult to \n     injury, I am taxed at the single rate, even though I am \n     primary breadwinner for a family of 4. I consider this an \n     equal pay for equal work issue. Why should I get paid less \n     than my married coworker, just because I am not legally \n     married?\n       Not having the same benefits that a heterosexual married \n     couple keeps my family in poverty. My family would not be in \n     poverty if we had the same rights as married couples do. It's \n     that simple. This isn't something that is just for the gay \n     couple--it also will affect a lot of children. Actually, \n     domestic partnership will do little for the dual career gay \n     couple, where both individual are in good jobs--it's going to \n     make a difference for gay couples who have families, or have \n     one partner who is uninsured. Allowing gay couples to insure \n     their partner and partner's children through their workplace \n     insurance could also help some individuals get off \n     government assistance.\n       Kirk A. Nass: My domestic partner and I have been together \n     nearly 14 years. My partner, Michael E. Gillespie, was an \n     attorney in Seattle when we met, now he is self-employed and \n     runs a business in Oakland which provides physicians as \n     expert witnesses to lawyers and insurance companies for \n     plaintiff work. Michael's past employers never provided good \n     medical coverage, if they provided it at all. In 1989 I \n     finished graduate school and started a job with Chevron. \n     Michael quit his job to move with me to the San Francisco Bay \n     Area. Chevron provides excellent health coverage to its \n     employees, but I was unable to cover him because domestic \n     partners were not eligible for coverage at the time. The \n     prospect of him having a major medical event and us not being \n     able to pay for it bothered me for years.\n       After starting his own business five years ago, he joined \n     an HMO (Kaiser Permanente, No. Calif.) under an individual \n     plan. In 1995 he was diagnosed with Type II diabetes; in 1996 \n     he suffered a heart attack and underwent an angioplasty to \n     open the blocked artery. Because of his HMO coverage, all of \n     his diabetes care, his stay in intensive care, and the \n     angioplasty were covered. He's now in excellent health. If \n     his business failed--even if he still worked for some of his \n     past employers--we would not have had the financial resources \n     to pay for his cardiac care.\n       On Jan. 1, 1998, Chevron began extending medical and dental \n     coverage (and some other benefits) to the same and opposite \n     sex domestic partners of employees and the partners' eligible \n     children. The coverage Chevron provides for Michael through \n     Kaiser is even better than what he was paying for himself at \n     Kaiser. It's the first time since we've been together he's \n     had full coverage and the first time I haven't had to worry.\n       Having domestic partners benefits such as medical coverage \n     is important to us because it makes me sure that the most \n     important person in my life can be taken care of when he \n     needs to be. The experiences we've gone through together, \n     although they've led to successful conclusions, have shown \n     too often that ``what-if'' scenarios can be all too real.\n       Dan Ross: My partner of 5 years has cerebral palsy (a \n     congenital condition; in his case, it creates overly-tight \n     muscle tone). After orthopedic surgery to correct some \n     aspects of his gait, he had to make significant changes to \n     his walk, and work on daily stretches, most of which require \n     assistance. He is (and was) able to walk on his own, although \n     now does so with a cane. He travels quite a bit for his job \n     and works long hours, so it is difficult for us to work on \n     this on a regular schedule. He can't take a leave of absence \n     form his job, or even temporarily resign, to work on physical \n     therapy full-time, because he absolutely needs his health \n     insurance and he is afraid of jeopardizing that. (Some \n     insurance plans even make cerebral palsy a ``pre-existing \n     condition''.) My health insurance won't cover him, of course, \n     and until recently, I wouldn't have been able to take sick \n     leave to stay with him in the hospital and at home. He was \n     bedridden for a total of two weeks after the surgery. As it \n     was, I hurried back and forth between work and home, because \n     I had just begun a new job, and didn't want to make a bad \n     impression there; but he had scheduled the surgery for around \n     Christmas, so there were many\n\n[[Page S735]]\n\n     people off on vacation time during that period. The issue \n     of domestic partnership benefits--whether equity in \n     providing health insurance, or even just uniform treatment \n     in granting sick/caregiving and bereavement leave--is \n     important to us as a result.\n       Pam Herman-Milmoe: I am a federal employee and Sara has \n     just finished her Masters Degree in Clinical Psychology. \n     While she was in school she had access to limited benefits, \n     but now that she is job hunting she is completely uninsured. \n     She is working in a paid internship position that is \n     providing great experience and a real service to the \n     community, but no benefits. As she moves on in her career she \n     would like to establish her own practice, but if she does \n     she'll have to pay for her own benefits without any support. \n     The practice of denying benefits to domestic partners puts us \n     at a severe economic disadvantage compared with my coworkers. \n     They can use the money their spouses save on benefits for \n     investments and other purposes. Sara and I plan on having \n     children, who will be covered by my benefits, but money that \n     would support their education and upbringing will have to go \n     to pay for benefits for Sara.\n       Steve Crutchfield: A year ago, my partner of 22 years was \n     fired from his job. When he lost his job, he lost his health \n     insurance benefits. He was able to maintain benefit through a \n     COBRA plan, but it cost us an additional $150 per month to \n     maintain his health benefits. Now that his COBRA benefits are \n     expiring, he has to buy individual medical insurance at a \n     cost of over $300 month.\n       If we had a domestic partner benefits law in place, I could \n     have put him under my insurance benefits as the spouse of a \n     Federal Government Worker. However, since our relationship is \n     not recognized as a marriage, I am unable to enjoy the \n     medical insurance benefits accorded to my colleagues who are \n     in traditional marriages.\n       David Perkins: My partner of fifteen years came with me to \n     Champaign-Urbana, Illinois in order that I might take a job. \n     We have been here over three years and he has not been able \n     to find anything other than part-time work that offers no \n     benefits. Because the state or the University does not extend \n     benefits to same-sex partners, he is without any health \n     benefits whatsoever--and as he will soon turn forty-five \n     years old, health insurance is too expensive for us to pay \n     out-of-pocket. If anything, should happen to him--it will \n     either completely wipe me out financially, or he will be \n     thrown on the mercy of the taxpayers as an indigent case. Not \n     a dramatic story, true--but a fear we live with daily.\n       Anonymous: My partner and I have 3 children ages 15, 13 and \n     3. I gave birth to the first 2 before getting together with \n     her. The youngest one we had together. Shortly after the \n     arrival of our youngest, the opportunity arrived that I could \n     stay home and care for her instead of putting her in day \n     care. But in quitting my job I also had to give up my health \n     care benefits. My partner's company does not offer domestic \n     benefits so I am not covered for my asthma medication that \n     I need to breath. I also am a high risk for breast cancer \n     due to family history (mother, grandmother and 3 sisters) \n     but I agreed to stay home for the benefit of all our \n     children.\n       Anon: My (same-sex) partner moved in with me in \n     Pennsylvania two years ago. She had been self-employed (a \n     clinical psychologist with a private practice) in CO. We are/\n     have been in a long-term committed relationship for three \n     years. She had been paying her own health insurance, but \n     since she gave up her income to move here, she had no way of \n     continuing to pay it. My employer (a college) has a \n     subsidized health insurance benefit for married couples only; \n     if we had been married, the additional coverage would have \n     cost $60. Instead, I had to pay $175 monthly so that she \n     would have less adequate health insurance than I have. Since \n     she needed surgery within months of moving here, with a long \n     recovery period, she also could not earn money to help with \n     expenses. We had to spend money on a lawyer to get documents \n     assuring the hospital that I (an ``unrelated'' person) could \n     make decisions for her were she to be incapacitated, etc. \n     Furthermore, she could not avail herself of the physical \n     recreational facilities at the college since she was not a \n     bona fide spouse. I had to pay a membership fee for her to \n     join a ``Y'' so she could use the physical exercise equipment \n     she needed to recover from her surgery. All in all, not \n     having our partnership recognized has cost me a bundle.\n       Mindy Kurzer: My partner Linda and I have been in a \n     committed relationship for 7 years and have a 2 year old \n     daughter named Della. I was very pleased when the University \n     of Minnesota instituted a domestic partner policy about 3 \n     years ago. This policy has helped our family, because Linda \n     is self-employed and previously carried only catastrophic \n     coverage with lots of exclusions for pre-existing conditions. \n     Since the U of M started this policy, we have been able to \n     purchase a very comprehensive medical policy for her. This \n     has turned out to be extremely important, because she was in \n     a car accident 2 years ago, and sustained serious injuries \n     for which she underwent two surgeries and still requires \n     medical treatment. With her current health insurance, we have \n     been able to get her excellent care--without it, I doubt we \n     would have been able to do so.\n       Domestic partner benefits are important to our community, \n     but I think they are also important to the broader society. I \n     have had numerous opportunities to leave the University of \n     Minnesota and have chosen to stay here in part because the \n     University has shown a commitment to reducing discrimination. \n     As more and more businesses and Universities institute \n     domestic partner benefits, institutions that do not \n     (including the government) may be disadvantaged when it comes \n     to getting and retaining top-notch employees.\n       Sibley Bacon: I work for Peoplesoft, Inc. who provides \n     domestic partner benefits to same sex couples. My partner, \n     and I have been together for 4 years * * * she is self-\n     employed, so we opted to have her covered through Peoplesoft. \n     This year she developed a 5.5 cm dermoid tumor on one of her \n     ovaries which was causing her a great deal of pain on a \n     daily basis. Our health insurance paid for the surgery and \n     follow up visits. This would have cost us thousands of \n     dollars had we not had the coverage through Peoplesoft. \n     Additionally she's been able to see a physical therapist \n     to address some old gymnastics injuries. Needless to say, \n     I am eternally grateful that my company provides these \n     benefits to its gay and lesbian employees. Domestic \n     partner coverage will certainly be a deciding factor in \n     the future if I ever end up looking for a job outside of \n     Peoplesoft.\n       Toni A.H. McNaron: My partner, and I have been in a \n     committed relationship for almost 20 years (our anniversary \n     is in June). We own a large home in south Mpls., pay lots of \n     property taxes, earn well over $100,000 a year, and are the \n     first people in our neighborhood to shovel our walks in \n     winter.\n       One of our very nice heterosexual neighbors just married \n     his girlfriend and sometimes doesn't shovel until the next \n     day.\n       The moment he and she signed the marriage license, she had \n     his full health coverage and retirement plan benefits from \n     his quite successful legal coverage and retirement plan \n     benefits from his quite successful legal practice. My partner \n     has never had a PENNY of coverage during the 34 years I've \n     worked as a professor at the University of Minnesota. And, \n     even more unfair, if I were killed by a drunk on the freeway \n     on the way home tonight, she would not even get a condolence \n     letter from the University. Instead she would get a check for \n     the ENTIRE amount of my retirement--considerable after 34 \n     years. Furthermore, she would have to pay the federal \n     government approximately $90,000 at tax time because of her \n     ``windfall.'' (How amazing to consider it a windfall to have \n     your beloved partner of 20 years killed.)\n       My neighbor's wife would get a condolence letter from his \n     firm explaining to her her options for collecting his \n     retirement funds. She is smart and would choose to have them \n     delayed until she is older and then to have them parceled out \n     over time so that she would pay next to no taxes on them.\n       Nancy: I am in Texas on internship. Rose, my partner, is \n     back home in Minnesota. Rose has fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue \n     syndrome and a number of other health problems. She is in the \n     process of leaving her job and applying for disability. \n     Partly because of her health problems, we would like to \n     relocate permanently to Texas. However, it will take several \n     months for her disability claim to be processed so she can \n     get on Medicare. She can continue her insurance coverage \n     under COBRA, but that would only be good in Minnesota, since \n     her coverage is with a local HMO. I can't put her on my \n     insurance due to lack of domestic partner benefits. So we're \n     faced with a number of unattractive options: (1) I could look \n     for a job in Minnesota, even though both of us would rather \n     move south and that move would be good for Rose's health. (2) \n     She could move here and be without insurance coverage for her \n     multiple health problems until she is approved for \n     disability. (3) We could prolong our geographic separation \n     and have the expense of maintaining separate households \n     until she gets on disability, which can be a very long \n     process. I think this is typical of the difficult choices \n     gay and lesbian couples are forced to make without \n     domestic partner benefits.\n       Julie Ford: My name is Julie Ford, I am the Director of \n     News and Public Affairs for a television station in Sarasota, \n     Florida. My partner is Vicky Oslance, who is a surgical \n     technician by trade but who has chosen to work per diem \n     instead of full time in order to maintain our household since \n     my full time job is very demanding and time consuming. \n     Working per diem, she of course has given up health benefits. \n     This is an added expense for us, one that the other married \n     department heads at my workplace do not have to deal with. I \n     an my partner have been together nearly 9 years . . . longer \n     than most of the married people I work with. We maintain a \n     joint checking account, stock portfolio, and own property \n     together. It is totally unfair for me to have to pay an \n     outrageous amount to insure Vicky's health when other married \n     people at my workplace can get inexpensive company health \n     insurance for their spouses.\n       Susan Hagstrom. When I was hired by UC Berkeley five year \n     ago, I was struck by the lack of equal compensation for equal \n     work. What I did not know then was how close to home this \n     inequality would hit.\n       I recall vividly the day Debra, my partner of seven years, \n     suffered an excruciating ruptured disk. I cried as I watched \n     her in so much pain that she could not stand, sit, or work \n     and had to literally crawl to the bathroom. I cried when she \n     refused to get an MRI because we couldn't afford the $1000 \n     procedure or the expensive doctor visits. I cannot fully \n     describe to you how difficult this lack of benefits has been \n     for me and for Debra.\n\n[[Page S736]]\n\n       Lori Stone: Until recently, my partner had a job that \n     provided a much inferior benefit plan to my own. Because the \n     deductible on her plan was so high, she would often elect not \n     to get treated for illness, preferring just to ``ride it \n     out.'' Of course this was a risky way to go, and it back-\n     fired on us, when she came down with kidney stones, and was \n     eventually hospitalized. The physical trauma plus the debts \n     we have incurred, because I was unable to cover my partner's \n     expenses, have been difficult to surmount.\n       I currently work for an organization that has excellent \n     medical benefits but no provision for me to be able to cover \n     my partner's medical expenses. If I had been able to cover my \n     partner under my plan, I believe we wouldn't be in the \n     unfortunate financial situation that we are today.\n       Thanks so much for taking this bold move. I pray for the \n     day when I won't feel so disenfranchised in my own country.\n\n\n            DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS--VIGNETTES--CLV/GLCAC\n\n                              [First case]\n\n       Bill and his partner Joseph have been living together in a \n     committed relationship for 8 years. Bill worked as an \n     attorney for a large Minneapolis firm for 12 years before he \n     was diagnosed with MS and had to leave his job within a year \n     from diagnosis. Joseph works as a maintenance engineer for \n     the State of Minnesota. Bill's income was two times Joseph's \n     current income when he was able to work. The benefits Bill \n     received on the firm's short term disability plan have \n     expired, and no long term disability plan was in place. Bill \n     requires 24 hour care, but is not yet eligible for inpatient \n     nursing care.\n       Bill's doctor visits and medications are covered by Medical \n     Assistance. Medical Assistance will not, however, pay for the \n     cost of Bill's in-home care attendants. Bill's doctors have \n     recommended 24 hour care. Joseph must continue to work to pay \n     household expenses. The loss of Bill's income and medical and \n     care expenses have forced the men to sell their home and trim \n     many other expenses. The insurance plan offered by Joseph's \n     employer would cover the cost of in-home care for the spouse \n     or dependent of the employee. The State of Minnesota does \n     not, however, offer health care benefits for unmarried \n     partners of its employees. At the rate Joseph is spending \n     money to pay for Bill's care, it is likely that he will have \n     to leave his job at the State, collect public assistance and \n     care for Bill himself.\n\n                             [Second case]\n\n       Debra and Sara have been living together in a committed \n     relationship for five years. They own a home together and \n     have made other major purchases together. Debra and Sara had \n     a child (Michael) 2 years ago. Sara gave birth to the child. \n     Debra's employer offers health and life insurance benefits to \n     domestic partners, and children of domestic partners are \n     considered dependents of the employee for purposes of \n     insurance coverage. Sara is self employed. Michael, Sara and \n     Debra are all covered by insurance as a family through \n     Debra's employer's plan. Six months ago Debra was recruited \n     by a competing business because of her unique skill and \n     experience, and was offered a job. The job would be a step up \n     for Debra in the advancement of her career. The pay is about \n     the same, but the prospective employer does not offer health \n     and life benefits to unmarried partners and would not cover \n     Michael as a dependent of Debra's. For these reasons, Debra \n     decides to decline the offer of employment and delays career \n     advancement as a result. The competing business misses out on \n     Debra's unique skill and experience.\n\n                              [Third case]\n\n       Joe is a student at a private college. His partner Jim \n     works for a mid-size accounting firm. Jim's employer does not \n     offer benefits to unmarried partners/dependents of its \n     employees. Jim and Joe can't afford to pay the $160.00 per \n     month for Joe's health insurance, and since Joe is only 38 \n     years old, they hope the risk of health problems is low, and \n     decide that he will have to go without coverage. Within a \n     year, Joe is diagnosed with Crohn's disease and requires \n     surgery, treatment and ongoing medications that are very \n     expensive. Joe quits school under the financial pressure to \n     look for a job that offers health benefits. Joe gets a job \n     quickly and applies for health coverage, but the insurer will \n     not cover any costs associated with Joe's pre-existing \n     condition of Crohn's disease.\n\n\n              personal statements--university of minnesota\n\n       Selected personal statements of gay and lesbian University \n     employees on the impact of not having equal benefits.\n       1. The University should honor its nondiscrimination policy \n     statement by eliminating all polices that discriminate on the \n     basis of sexual orientation. The University should recognize \n     domestic partnership couples as they do married couples. I \n     simply want for my family what a married employee can count \n     on for his/her family. If, as an employee they receive a \n     benefit, so should I. The solution is to provide similar \n     benefits to domestic partnership couples or remove the \n     benefits from married couples. As employees of the University \n     we should have the same treatment. Gays and lesbians employed \n     by the University have been systematically excluded from \n     benefits that have been provided to their heterosexual \n     colleagues with whom they work side by side, sometimes \n     performing exactly the same work. That is very wrong and \n     needs to be corrected!\n       On a personal level, for the 25 years I have been employed \n     at the University I have been denied the full employment \n     status and benefits provided to my heterosexual colleagues. \n     This has cost me dearly financially, and has sent me the \n     message that who I love is not valued. This treatment tells \n     me that my family concerns are not important to the \n     University. Although I am also an employee of the University \n     I am not provided with the same health care security for my \n     family as are my married colleagues.\n       Finally, as I approach retirement, I am outraged to find \n     out that my partner can not defer taxes upon receiving my \n     retirement money in the case of my death as a married spouse \n     is able to do. This amounts to a huge financial loss for my \n     partner and other gay and lesbian employees and their \n     partners. Imagine your spouse having to pay 28% of $250,000 \n     ($70,000) or 31% of $300,000 ($93,000) right off the top, \n     thus diminishing the amount received by our partners to \n     $180,000 and $207,000 respectfully. This is a concrete \n     example for two of us currently long time employees of the \n     University and who are also in long term domestic partnership \n     relationships. In addition, both couples have registered \n     under the city of Minneapolis domestic partner ordinance.\n       I am angry, disappointed and frustrated that the Board of \n     Regents, President Hasselmo and the administrative leadership \n     of the University have not taken action to enforce the \n     University's nondiscrimination policy. The University should \n     be playing a leadership role in righting this wrong, first, \n     for its employees and then in initiating changes for the \n     state of Minnesota and in urging Federal tax law changes.\n       2. When my partner's mother unexpectedly committed suicide \n     five years ago, I was scheduled to leave that morning for an \n     out-of-state business trip. I'll never forget my struggle \n     over how I would approach my supervisor to request permission \n     to either cancel the trip or to send someone in my place. I \n     was up for a promotion and I was afraid that to acknowledge \n     my sexual preference to this person, who I knew held \n     fundamental religious values, would compromise my work and my \n     livelihood.\n       I ultimately equivocated and asked if I could send someone \n     else on the trip, because my ``housemate--slash(/)--best \n     friend needed my support. As you might guess, this didn't \n     sound sufficiently persuasive and I left on the trip \n     (shortened by two days) with the ``blessing'' of my partner, \n     who, of course, was in shock. I succumbed to fear and in \n     doing so compromised my own humanity and my bond with my \n     partner. It is still deeply painful for me to remember the \n     coerciveness of the situation, the fear and intimidation that \n     I experienced, and my own personal failing.\n       It was one of the most demeaning and dehumanizing \n     experiences of my life. I ask those of you who are married to \n     imagine having to make such a choice: imagine having to ask \n     permission to be with your grieving partner. There are no \n     reparations the University can offer me to recast the past. I \n     would, however, like to think that the Board of Regents and \n     central administrators have the compassion and courage to act \n     now so that others will not be confronted with such a choice.\n       3. The University is discriminating on the basis of sexual \n     orientation. My family doesn't receive the same benefits as \n     families of heterosexuals.\n       I have had the Group Health Plan benefits package for \n     nearly sixteen years. I began family coverage when I married \n     (1978), adding my spouse at a nominal monthly fee to the \n     single coverage I already carried (which was paid in full by \n     the University). When my children were born (1983, 1986) the \n     cost of family coverage didn't change. In fact, the cost of \n     family coverage is constant no matter how many dependents you \n     have on the policy. I was amazed to learn that the cost of \n     family coverage (including coverage for my ex-husband) \n     remained the same even after getting a divorce. My ex-husband \n     remained on my insurance policy--at no additional cost--even \n     though we were not legally married.\n       I am now in a committed lesbian relationship. My partner \n     and I have a relationship every bit as stable and committed \n     as a marriage, but we are not entitled to the same benefits I \n     enjoyed when I was married.\n       My partner had been teaching part-time in a private school \n     for two years before she became eligible for health insurance \n     through her employer. Two weeks before her insurance was to \n     take effect she was stricken with severe abdominal pain. \n     Though we considered ``toughing it out until her insurance \n     kicked in, it became increasingly clear that she needed to be \n     treated immediately. She had a large, twisted ovarian tumor \n     removed in October, 1990. By the time of the surgery, her \n     insurance was in place. We breathed a sigh of relief.\n       Months later we learned that because her pain started (and \n     was briefly treated) before her insurance began, the claim \n     for coverage for the surgery and hospital stay were \n     disallowed because there was a pre-existing condition \n     exclusion in her insurance policy. We are now faced with over \n     $5,000 (plus 12% interest per year) in medical bills. That \n     may not seem like a lot of money to some people, but it \n     certainly is to us. And it's money that wouldn't have had to \n     be spent at all if she had been on my family coverage all \n     along.\n       So why is it that my ex-husband (no legal relation) was \n     entitled to continue receiving benefits until he married, but \n     my life partner has had to go without medical insurance? The \n     answer is simple--discrimination.\n       4. One of my colleagues, a male who is heterosexual, \n     received his Ph.D. the same year I\n\n[[Page S737]]\n\n     did. We have taught the same number of years and were tenured \n     here the same year. However, he has received health benefits \n     for his wife and two children during this time. I believe \n     that would add up to several thousand dollars more that he \n     has received from this University than I have. My partner is \n     self employed part time and works at the University only to \n     receive benefits. I feel that I am discriminated against \n     based on my sexual preference and have suffered significant \n     financial loss by having to pay for health benefits for my \n     partner and our child.\n       5. I feel discredited in all but the most professional \n     senses since my University will not acknowledge the \n     centrality of my relationship with my partner of 14 plus \n     years. This level of constant and costly discrimination makes \n     any positive responses to me from the institution bittersweet \n     at best and hypocritical at worst. My family life is erased \n     and made invisible by an institution of learning which tauts \n     acceptance of diversity and pursuit of truth. When I'm not \n     furious, I'm terribly sad.\n       6. It is very demoralizing to see the incredible benefits \n     that my married colleagues (heterosexual) get and know that \n     it will be a fight to get the same. My partner is self-\n     employed and health coverage is astronomical for self-\n     employed people. In order to buy a plan similar to that at \n     the U, it would cost us $5-$7000 a year. Since it's so \n     costly, my partner does not have very good health coverage \n     and as a result I am very concerned about what would happen \n     if a serious health crisis occurs.\n       So I am not just losing the $1500 or so the U would pay out \n     to cover her because of the lack of recognition, I will have \n     to pay $5-$7000 per year more than most of my colleagues. I \n     view this as if I received that much less salary per year. \n     How can the U have sexual orientation, gender and marital \n     status in the equal opportunity statement and not consider \n     this discrimination?\n       I wrote a letter to Gus Donhower when I heard of the \n     proposed changes in health coverage. One option proposed was \n     that those people covered by their spouses' employment could \n     get the cash equivalent of coverage instead of being covered \n     by the U. I suggested that if that were done, then those of \n     us without spouses or dependents should certainly get the \n     cash equivalent of spousal/dependent coverage. It seems an \n     obvious parallel to me. He responded by saying it was an \n     interesting idea but there's no money for this added benefit. \n     Well, I think that's like saying it would be nice to pay \n     blacks or women what we pay men, but we just don't have the \n     money. One has no choice but to find the money. If there \n     really isn't enough then some benefits may need to be removed \n     from those who have them, in order to provide for those who \n     don't. Maybe people with more than two children need to pay \n     for their health insurance, or perhaps the cost for an \n     employee for spousal coverage needs to increase. The current \n     discrimination is so clear to me (of course I'm not a lawyer) \n     that I wonder if a lawsuit could successfully challenge the \n     University's non-compliance with its equal opportunity \n     statement.\n       At this point, my commitment, dedication, willingness to \n     work hard under increasingly difficult pressure, is affected \n     by my feeling of not being seen, recognized, and treated \n     equally to my heterosexual colleagues. Right now, it's hard \n     not to feel taken advantage\n     of . . . .\n       7. My partner returned to school to pursue a second \n     advanced degree. She attends the University of Minnesota. At \n     the same time, one of my married colleagues' spouse returned \n     to school. Their health insurance profile did not change at \n     all. Ours changed dramatically. Because I cannot get health \n     insurance for my partner of 10 years (longer than my married \n     colleague), we have paid 2,500 per year in health insurance \n     and routine health care out of pocket. Over three years, the \n     tax on being a lesbian has been $7,500. I realize of course, \n     that the cost of my health insurance would have increased \n     during this period, so the net cost to us would have been \n     above my current health insurance but below $7,500. This \n     economic burden is a clear example of otherwise similarly \n     situated people being treated differently solely on the basis \n     of sexual orientation.\n       Let me add that I do not think that the University should \n     require public registration of partnerships to receive \n     partnership benefits unless the state revokes the so-called \n     ``sodomy'' law. To ask for such registration imposes the \n     acknowledgement of legal risk as a cost for benefits. In \n     addition, if reduced tuition is available for other family \n     members, this benefit should be extended to gay and lesbian \n     families as well.\n       8. The University considers me ``single''. As a ``single'' \n     person, I subsidize both married couples and individuals with \n     children. But as a domestic partner I should be able to enjoy \n     the same benefits as other ``married'' couples.\n       Last summer my partner required minor surgery for skin \n     cancer. Because she was a substitute teacher, she had no \n     coverage. As a result we became responsible for the bills. \n     This created more financial and emotional distress for us \n     which I am certain impacted my own productivity.\n       Another issue I have is that it seems the administration \n     wants us to provide documentation (e.g. registration, \n     affidavits, etc.) to prove we are indeed a couple. Does the \n     University require married couples to provide an affidavit or \n     their marriage license when applying for benefits?\n       Furthermore, the domestic partnership applications become \n     public records. Given the history of the discriminatory \n     treatment meted out on gays and lesbians in ours and other \n     cultures, I would not want to be that public in my sexual \n     orientation, especially in a state without a human rights \n     amendment protecting us.\n       9. How do I feel about the University's treatment of \n     domestic partners? Not positive! My partner and I each have \n     one dependent. We must each pay for family benefits which is \n     a huge commitment, especially since my partner is self-\n     employed and self-insured. Many of us are on federal \n     benefits. If the University changes its policy we'll need \n     help so that we can move to University benefits.\n       10. I feel that if the University is unable to provide \n     health benefits to unmarried partners they should also refuse \n     benefits to married partners and only cover under age \n     dependents. I consider the lack of these benefits to be an \n     unequal and discriminatory pay scale, with married employees \n     receiving higher compensation levels just because they are \n     married.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1637. A bill to expedite State review of criminal records of \napplicants for bail enforcement officer employment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   the bounty hunter accountability and quality assurance act of 1998\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I am joined by my distinguished \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, in introducing the ``Bounty \nHunter Accountability and Quality Assurance Act of 1998.'' Our bill \nwill begin the process of reforming the revered but antiquated system \nof bail enforcement in this country.\n\n  Throughout our nation's proud history, bounty hunters have proved a \nvaluable addition to our law enforcement and recovery efforts. About 40 \npercent of all criminal defendants are released on bail each year, and \nin 1996 alone more than 33,000 skipped town. Police departments, no \nmatter how efficient or determined, cannot be expected to deal with so \nmany bail jumpers in addition to their other duties. But while public \nlaw enforcement officers recover only about 10 percent of defendants \nwho skip town, bounty hunters catch an incredible 88 percent of bail \njumpers.\n  Because of the special, contractual nature of the relationship \nbetween bail bondsmen and those who use them to get out of jail, bounty \nhunters have traditionally enjoyed special rights--a nineteenth century \nSupreme Court case affirmed that while bounty hunters may exercise many \nof the powers granted to police, they are not subject to many of the \nconstitutional checks we place on those law enforcement officials. As a \nresult, bounty hunters need not worry about Miranda rights, extradition \nproceedings, or search warrants.\n  The ability to more efficiently track and recover criminal defendants \nserves a valuable purpose in our society. But the lack of \nconstitutional checks on bounty hunters also opens the system up to the \nrisk of abuse. Each of us has read or heard about cases in which \nlegitimate bounty hunters or those simply posing as recovery agents \nhave wrongfully entered a dwelling or captured the wrong person.\n  In one recent Arizona case, several men claiming to be bounty hunters \nbroke into a house, terrorized a family and ended up killing a young \ncouple who tried to defend against the attack. It now appears that \nthese men were simply ``posing'' as bounty hunters, but there are other \nreported incidents in which ``legitimate'' bounty hunters have broken \ndown the wrong door, kidnaped the wrong person, or physically abused \nthe targets of their searches. And there is little recourse for the \ninnocent victims of wrongful acts.\n  Our legislation would begin the process of making bounty hunters more \naccountable to the public they serve, and would help to restore \nconfidence in the bail enforcement system. The bill would not unduly \nimpose the will of the federal government on states, which have \ntraditionally regulated bounty hunters. Our legislation contains only \nthree simple provisions, each of which will make it easier to better \nregulate bounty hunters, but none of which will overburden states.\n  The first provision of the ``Bounty Hunter Accountability and Quality \nAssurance Act'' would simply allow a national bail enforcement \norganization to run background checks through the\n\n[[Page S738]]\n\nFBI, ensuring that there will be a relatively easy way to keep \nconvicted felons out of the bail enforcement business. A nearly \nidentical provision related to private security guards recently passed \nthe House by a nearly unanimous vote.\n  The second provision of the bill directs the Attorney General of the \nUnited States to establish model guidelines for states to follow when \ncreating their own bail enforcement regulations. In the course of her \nwork, the Attorney General will be specifically directed to look into \nthree areas identified by the bill--whether bounty hunters should be \nrequired to ``knock and announce'' before entering a dwelling, whether \nthey should be required to carry liability insurance (most already do), \nand whether convicted felons should be allowed to obtain employment as \nbounty hunters. While states are not required to follow the model \nguidelines, those states who choose to adopt the guidelines within two \nyears will receive priority for Byrne grant funding.\n  Finally, this bill makes bail bond companies liable for the acts of \nthe bounty hunters they hire. The clarification of liability in our \nbill will encourage these companies to carefully select and perhaps \neven train the bounty hunters in their employ. Perhaps we can cut down \non the worst abuses if we force employers to take a closer look at who \nthey hire.\n  Mr. President, it is time to start the process of making rogue bounty \nhunters more accountable, while at the same time restoring America's \nconfidence in the long tradition of bail enforcement that dates from \nthe earliest days of this nation. I urge my colleagues to join us in \ntaking this first step towards this process, and I thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, for joining me in \nintroducing this bill today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be published \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1637\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bounty Hunter Accountability \n     and Quality Assistance Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) bail enforcement officers, also known as bounty hunters \n     or recovery agents, provide law enforcement officers with \n     valuable assistance in recovering fugitives from justice;\n       (2) regardless of the differences in their duties, skills, \n     and responsibilities, the public has had difficulty in \n     discerning the difference between law enforcement officers \n     and bail enforcement officers;\n       (3) the American public demands the employment of \n     qualified, well-trained bail enforcement officers as an \n     adjunct, but not a replacement for, law enforcement officers; \n     and\n       (4) in the course of their duties, bail enforcement \n     officers often move in and affect interstate commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``bail enforcement employer'' means any person \n     that--\n       (A) employs 1 or more bail enforcement officers; or\n       (B) provides, as an independent contractor, for \n     consideration, the services of 1 or more bail enforcement \n     officers (which may include the services of that person);\n       (2) the term ``bail enforcement officer''--\n       (A) means any person employed to obtain the recovery of any \n     fugitive from justice who has been released on bail; and\n       (B) does not include any--\n       (i) law enforcement officer;\n       (ii) attorney, accountant, or other professional licensed \n     under applicable State law;\n       (iii) employee whose duties are primarily internal audit or \n     credit functions; or\n       (iv) member of the Armed Forces on active duty; and\n       (3) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means a public \n     servant authorized under applicable State law to conduct or \n     engage in the prevention, investigation, prosecution, or \n     adjudication of criminal offenses, including any public \n     servant engaged in corrections, parole, or probation \n     functions.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to help parents keep their children from starting to \nuse tobacco products, to expose the tobacco industry's past misconduct \nand to stop the tobacco industry from targeting children, to eliminate \nor greatly reduce the illegal use of tobacco products by children, to \nimprove the public health by reducing the overall use of tobacco, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          the healthy kids act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwe call the HEALTHY Kids Act. It addresses the question of how we form \na national policy on tobacco.\n\n  I am joined in cosponsorship by Senators Akaka, Baucus, Bingaman,\n\n[[Page S739]]\n\nBoxer, Breaux, Bryan, Bumpers, Daschle, Dodd, Dorgan, Durbin, Johnson, \nKennedy, Bob Kerrey, John Kerry, Kohl, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Leahy, \nMoseley-Braun, Moynihan, Reed, Rockefeller, Torricelli, Wellstone, and \nWyden. And we have additional Senators who are considering \ncosponsorship of this legislation as we speak.\n  First of all, I thank the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for his \nstrong leadership and support of the work of the task force. Months ago \nhe called me and asked me to head up an effort within the Democratic \nCaucus to draft tobacco legislation. We have engaged 21 members of this \ntask force in a lengthy effort to listen to those affected and to try \nto craft a responsible national tobacco policy.\n  We held 18 hearings. We heard over 100 witnesses. We held hearings \nacross the country. We engaged in this level of effort because the \nsubject is so important.\n  Tobacco is the only product that when used legally--and as the \nmanufacturer intended--addicts and kills its customers.\n  For too long tobacco companies have waged war on our kids. It is time \nto counterattack.\n  For too long big tobacco has hooked our kids on a lifelong addiction. \nIt is time to stop it.\n  For too long the tobacco industry has deliberately targeted kids as \n``replacement smokers'' to fill the shoes of over 425,000 Americans \nkilled by tobacco each year.\n  Let me repeat that. Over 400,000 deaths a year in this country are \ncaused by the use of tobacco products. Many more, as we have heard in \nour hearings, have suffered terribly. As we heard Monday at a hearing \nin Newark, NJ, when we heard from Pierce Frauenheim, a coach and \nassistant principal who had a laryngectomy because of throat cancer \ncaused by the use of tobacco products. He told us of the terror and \ntrauma of that illness. And we heard from a young woman named Gina \nSeagrave, a young woman who lost her mother to a massive heart attack \nwhen she was only 45 years of age because of using tobacco products. \nHer tears told the story of her family's pain and suffering.\n  Mr. President, those stories are rewritten day in and day out because \nof the awful effects of tobacco. There is something we can do about it \nif only we have the political will and the courage to act. Witnesses \ntold us repeatedly that we need a comprehensive plan to dramatically \nreduce the use of tobacco products in our country. That is what we \npresent today--the HEALTHY Kids Act.\n  Mr. President, the HEALTHY Kids Act is the work of the Senate \nDemocratic task force on tobacco legislation. The HEALTHY Kids Act \nprovides responsible tobacco policy. It protects children, promotes the \npublic health, helps tobacco farmers, and resolves Federal, State and \nlocal legal claims, without providing immunity to the industry; it \ninvests in children and health care; it provides savings for Social \nSecurity and Medicare; and it reimburses taxpayers for costs that have \nbeen imposed on them by the use of these products.\n  The HEALTHY Kids Act protects children. It does that with a healthy \nprice increase--a $1.50 a pack health fee phased in over 3 years. It \nprotects children by providing the Food and Drug Administration with \nfull authority to regulate these products. It provides strong penalties \nfor those companies that fail to reach the targeted projection for the \nreduction of teen smoking--a 67 percent reduction in teen smoking over \nthe next 10 years. Those penalties are a 10-cent a pack penalty \nindustry wide if the goals are not met and a 40-cent a pack penalty for \nthe individual companies for their failure to reach the objective. We \nalso protect children by providing comprehensive antitobacco programs. \nIncluded in that are counteradvertising, prevention programs, smoking \ncessation programs and research. Finally, in protecting children, we \nprovide for retailer compliance--State licensure of retailers and no \nsales to minors.\n  The HEALTHY Kids Act also promotes the public health. It does so by \naddressing the question of secondhand smoke. Most public facilities in \nthe country would be smoke free under our proposal. We would provide \nexemptions for bars, casinos, bingo parlors, hotel guest rooms--that \nis, hotels could have smoking and nonsmoking rooms as they do now--\nnonfast-food small restaurants, that is, those restaurants with less \nthan 50 seats would be exempt; prisons, tobacco shops, and private \nclubs. At the same time we provide those exemptions, we also provide \nfor no State preemption. If a State or local unit of government wants \nto have more stringent provisions, it is free to do so.\n  We also promote the public health by protecting the public's right to \nknow. We provide for full document disclosure; all relevant documents \ngo to the FDA. The FDA is able to make those documents public; and the \npublic health interest overrides trade secret or attorney-client \nprivileges when the FDA makes a determination that the public health is \nthe overriding interest.\n  We also provide for international tobacco marketing controls: no \npromotion of U.S. tobacco exports. I am proud to say that in this \nadministration we are not doing that, but in previous administrations \nthey have. This would codify the conduct of this administration and \nprovide for no promotion of U.S. tobacco exports. It also provides a \ncode of conduct. No marketing to foreign children. Any activities \ncarried out in this country to market to children in another country \nwould be illegal. It also has modest funding for international tobacco \ncontrol efforts. And we require warning labels, warning labels of the \ncountry that is the recipient of products sent from this country. And \nif they do not have a system of warning labels, then our own warning \nlabels would apply.\n\n  The HEALTHY Kids Act also helps tobacco farmers. They were left out \nof the proposed settlement completely. Their interest was not \naddressed. We do not think that is fair. We provide $10 billion in just \nthe first 5 years for assistance to farmers and their communities. We \nauthorize funding for transition payments to farmers and quota holders. \nWe provide for rural and community economic development retraining for \ntobacco factory workers and tobacco farmers and even college \nscholarships for farm families if the committees of Congress deem that \nappropriate.\n  The HEALTHY Kids Act makes very clear that we will not provide \nimmunity to this industry, no special protection for future misconduct, \nno special protection against individual lawsuits for past misconduct. \nWe do resolve the outstanding Federal, State, and local government \nlegal claims. States, however, can opt out of this national settlement \nif they so choose, and cities and counties are assured of getting a \nfair share of reimbursements that go to States.\n  On the question of attorney's fees, we concluded that no monies from \nthe HEALTHY Kids Act should be used for attorney's fees. With respect \nto the size of the fees, we deliberated long and hard, listened to all \nof the affected interests and concluded that the attorney's fees in \nthese cases ought to be resolved by arbitration panels using ABA \nethical guidelines. Those guidelines are set out with specificity in \nthe legislation that I will introduce today.\n  And so if we are in a circumstance like the controversy in Florida, \nif the parties cannot agree, an arbitration panel would resolve the \nmatter and determine what the attorney's fees were in the case that has \nbeen settled. That is also the case in other States. If the parties at \ninterest reach agreement among themselves, there would not be an \narbitration panel. But where there is disagreement as to what the \nappropriate attorney fees should be, an arbitration panel would be \nempowered to make the determination.\n  I do not think any of us want to see unjust enrichment of anybody \nbased on a resolution of these tobacco issues and tobacco lawsuits \naround the country.\n  Mr. President, the HEALTHY Kids Act invests in children, in health, \nin savings for Social Security and Medicare, and reimburses taxpayers \nwho have had costs imposed on them.\n  The distribution of the funds raised by the act is as follows: \nPayments to States are 41.5 percent of the revenues. The States would \nget 14\\1/2\\ percent of the money unrestricted; 27 percent would go to \nthe States for children's health care, child care and improved \neducation.\n\n[[Page S740]]\n\n  We would also provide 15.5 percent for antitobacco programs. That \nincludes counteradvertising campaigns as well as smoking cessation and \nsmoking prevention programs. NIH health research would be increased. \nThey would receive 21 percent of the funds provided. Medicare would get \n4 percent of the money initially but over time that would grow to 10 \npercent. Similarly, Social Security would get 6 percent of the money \ninitially and that would grow to 12 percent over time.\n  We believe it is appropriate when you receive a windfall not to spend \nit all, and so we are providing that when the program is fully phased \nin, over 20 percent of the money, instead of being spent, will be used \nto strengthen Medicare and Social Security for the future.\n  That is what the American people want to see happen, and we have \nprovided for it in this legislation. Farmers initially get 12 percent \nof the revenues to ease their transition. Obviously, they are going to \ntake an economic hit here, and it seemed fair to us that they be \nincluded in any package to resolve these controversies. Over time their \npart of this package would be phased out and then the Medicare and \nSocial Security parts of the legislation would see their share \nincreased.\n\n  Mr. President, we have provided here a comparison of the tobacco \nrevenue and spending, a comparison between what the President's budget \ncalled for and what The HEALTHY Kids Act calls for. First of all, in \nterms of total revenue, our plan would raise $82 billion over the next \n5 years, some $500 billion over the next 25 years. In the first 5 \nyears, the States would get in an unrestricted way $12 billion. They \nwould get $22 billion for children--$14 billion for child care, $3 \nbillion for health care for children and $5 billion for education. The \nresearch component of the plan would provide $17 billion to the \nNational Institutes of Health for increased health research. Medicare \ninitially would get $3 billion in the first 5 years. The farmers would \nget $10 billion. That is a 5-year figure. The antitobacco efforts would \nreceive $13 billion, and savings for Social Security would be $5 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, The HEALTHY Kids Act is supported by the American \npublic. We did extensive national polling to make certain that what we \nare proposing is in line with what the American people want and the \npolling data shows a high level of support for a significant per pack \nprice increase which we have termed a health fee, significant public \nsupport for strong lookback penalties for failure to meet the goals of \nreducing teen smoking and no special protections for this industry.\n  That is what the American people want. That is what The HEALTHY Kids \nAct provides. With respect to the question of a $1.50 per pack health \nfee for youth smoking deterrence and health programs, the American \npeople support that by more than a 2-to-1 margin--65 percent in favor, \n30 percent opposed. By the way, this is across party lines, across \nregional lines. The American people support a $1.50 a pack health fee. \nThe price increase support for youth smoking deterrence and health \nprograms cuts across party lines. The poll shows if it is termed tax \nsupport it is very strong all across the country, even stronger if it \nis for a health fee. In fact, 69 percent of Democrats support the $1.50 \nhealth fee, 67 percent of Republicans.\n  There is also strong public support for a lookback penalty of 50 \ncents a pack if the industry fails to meet the goals for the reduction \nof teen smoking. By 54 percent to 34 percent the American public \nsupports lookback penalties of 50 cents a pack or more. In fact, a \nsignificant majority of the 54 percent support a dollar a pack lookback \npenalty.\n  Voters are also strongly opposed to providing special protections to \nthe tobacco industry. When we asked the American people: Do you want to \ngive immunity to this industry? Do you want to give them special \nprotection going forward? By 55 percent to 32 percent, they oppose any \nspecial protections being given to this industry. They say no to \nimmunity. The HEALTHY Kids Act says no to immunity.\n  The HEALTHY Kids Act accomplishes the objectives laid out by \nPresident Clinton. He laid out five. He said you have to reduce teen \nsmoking by providing tough penalties and a health fee or price increase \nthat will deter youth smoking. We have full FDA authority. We are \nchanging the industry culture. We meet the additional health goals laid \nout by the President, and protect tobacco farmers and their \ncommunities.\n  As the Vice President said yesterday when we unveiled this proposal \nin a press conference here on Capitol Hill: The administration strongly \nsupports this bill.\n  The Vice President reported that if this bill comes to the \nPresident's desk, he will sign it and sign it without hesitation.\n  I expect that big tobacco will fight these initiatives. Indeed, we \nsaw yesterday they came out swinging against the proposal that I am \noffering here today. We will hear from the tobacco industry, its \nlobbyists and its supporters in Congress, that we cannot have a health \nfee of $1.50 a pack, we can't fund public health programs or hold the \nindustry and tobacco companies accountable if they sell to kids. We \nwill hear from them that we cannot give FDA the same authority it has \nover prescription drugs and our food supply.\n  I submit, if we care about our kids' futures, we must do all of these \nthings. This legislation lays down a marker for good, responsible, \nnational tobacco policy to protect our kids and promote the public \nhealth. It sets a clear, unambiguous test against which other \nlegislation can be measured. And it sets a challenge for those who say \nthey want to protect our kids but have so far not produced effective \ntobacco control legislation. The HEALTHY Kids Act recognizes that \ntobacco is causing addiction, disease and death. It also recognizes \nthat there is something we can do about it. HEALTHY Kids affirms life \nand health and our commitment to our children. It tells you we can make \na difference.\n  I invite my colleagues to join in a bipartisan effort to pass \nlegislation like we are offering here today. We can do it and we can \nmake a difference. We can reduce the addiction, the disease and the \ndeath that is being caused by the use of tobacco products. Now is the \ntime to act. The public supports it. Again, I ask my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to join us in this effort. There is no reason for \nthis to be a partisan issue. There is every reason for us to work \ntogether to resolve the challenges posed to our society by the use of \nthese products.\n  Mr. President, I note a colleague of mine, Senator Reed of Rhode \nIsland, is on the floor. Senator Reed played a critical role in the \ndevelopment of this legislation. He was one of the most active \nparticipants on the task force who has worked for months to fashion \nthese legislative proposals. I commend Senator Reed publicly for his \ncontributions to this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nConrad from North Dakota, in supporting and introducing the HEALTHY \nKids Act and thank him for his kind words. I must say, if there is \nanyone who has been a true leader and true hero in this struggle to \ndate, it has been Kent Conrad, whose leadership helped pull together \nnot only an impressive array of cosponsors but, with over hundreds of \nwitnesses and many, many sessions, he was able to get to the substance \nof a very complicated and difficult issue: How are we going to respond \nto the crisis of teenage smoking in the United States? How are we going \nto protect the public health of America, particularly America's \nchildren?\n  Today we are introducing the HEALTHY Kids Act, which will, I believe, \ndo that. Again, I commend Senator Conrad for his great leadership and \neffort, and I look forward to working with him and all my colleagues to \ndevelop legislation that will once and for all prevent the illegal sale \nof cigarettes to children in this country.\n  We are all aware of the depressing statistics with respect to smoking \nand children in the United States. Today, some 50 million Americans are \naddicted to tobacco smoke. Every year, 1 million children become \nregular users of cigarettes, tobacco. One-third of them will die \nprematurely of lung cancer, emphysema, or other horrible smoking \nrelated illnesses.\n\n[[Page S741]]\n\n  This is an addiction. Fully three-quarters of smokers want to quit \nbut they cannot because they are addicted. The most disturbing aspect \nof this addiction is it begins with young people. Mr. President, 90 \npercent of adult smokers today began to smoke while they were 18 years \nold or less. In fact, this goes down to children who are 10, 11, 12 \nyears old. It is a shocking, disturbing, and all-too-real aspect of \nAmerican life and culture. We have an opportunity, indeed an \nobligation, to do something about it. That is why I am here, along with \nSenator Conrad, to join in the introduction of this HEALTHY Kids Act.\n\n  In my home State of Rhode Island, we have a situation in which adult \nsmoking is beginning to stabilize. Unfortunately, teen smoking \ncontinues to rise, with a more than 25 percent increase among high \nschool students. That is a bad omen for the future, a bad omen for the \ncountry. It is too easy for children to buy cigarettes. It is too easy, \nin a climate in which the tobacco industry spends upward of $5 billion \na year making cigarette smoking appear to be alluring, sophisticated, \nadult-oriented--all those things which are attractive to children.\n  We know from the record that has emerged over the last several months \nin court proceedings that this is not a coincidence, we know that \nchildren have been deliberately targeted by cigarette companies. They \nare the replacement customers for the 400,000 Americans who die each \nyear of smoking-related diseases. We have to stop that insidious \nreplacement, that insidious attack on the youth of America.\n  We begin this legislative process in a situation in which the tobacco \nindustry has worked hard to earn the distrust--let me say it again--the \ndistrust of the American people. Over the years they have not been \ncandid. They have deliberately confused, fought against, and frustrated \nattempts to regulate their product in the marketplace.\n  I recently came across an interesting story about youthful smoking \namong boys. One of the research scientists said, ``The cigarette smoker \nis slowly and surely poisoning himself and is largely unconscious of \nit.'' That report was in Education Magazine in 1909. The tobacco \nindustry has long known that cigarette smoking is harmful to children, \nand harmful to public health.\n  In 1963, Battelle Laboratories in Switzerland did a series of studies \nfor the British American Tobacco Company, that's the parent of Brown & \nWilliamson Tobacco Company. The conclusion, after review of these \nstudies by the general counsel of Brown & Williamson, was shown as \nfollows: ``We are then in the business of selling nicotine, an \naddictive drug, effective in the release of stress mechanisms.'' Since \n1960, the industry has known they were selling an addictive product, \nand has known they were selling a product that killed people.\n  It has all, though, been obscured and dressed up by advertising that \nwould suggest to everyone that smoking is not harmful; indeed, claiming \nit is healthful. That is absolutely wrong. Back in the 1920s, the \ncompanies that were selling cigarettes were advertising themes like, \n``20,679 physicians say Luckies are less irritating.'' Promoting \ncigarettes, in effect, as a healthful practice and not a harmful \npractice. Another theme of those days was, ``For digestion's sake, \nsmoke Camels.'' Again emphasizing an illusory therapeutic value that \nnever existed in cigarettes.\n  In 1953, an advertisement read, ``This is it. L filters are just \nwhat the doctor ordered.'' As if the medical profession was endorsing a \nproduct which they knew was harmful and which they suspected, but \nperhaps did not yet know, was highly addictive.\n  In this Congress, we have tried to rein in the use of tobacco by \nchildren, tried to control the access of young people and tried to warn \nthe American public about the dangers of tobacco. In the 1960s, we \nbrought the industry, we thought, kicking and screaming to accept \nlegislatively mandated warning label. Only after the fact did we learn \nthat the industry privately accepted this label as a good fortune \nbecause it allowed them to defend themselves in court with the notion \nthat smokers assumed the risk because they read these labels. Only \nrecently, with the evidence that is more and more conclusive each day \nof the addictive quality of cigarettes, has the industry begun to \nrespond.\n\n  Today we are here to ensure that the past is not repeated, the past \nof addiction of young people to cigarettes and the past of a very \npliant Congress, not effectively regulating the tobacco industry. That \nis why the HEALTHY Kids Act is so important. It represents a \ncomprehensive effort to ensure that our children are safe and the \npublic health is protected.\n  One of the important elements of this bill is a price increase of \n$1.50 a pack. This is not in any way an attempt of retribution on the \nindustry. Rather, it recognizes the fact that a price increase is \nprobably the strongest deterrent there is to teenage smoking. Unlike \nadult smokers who may already very well addicted, teenagers will \nrespond to price increases. A price increase is one sure way, perhaps \nthe best way, we can ensure that teenagers do not smoke.\n  The second aspect of the act is giving the FDA full authority over \ntobacco products, all tobacco products. This proposal would not \ncondition their authority; it would give the FDA the authority, the \nresponsibility, the obligation to regulate tobacco as it regulates so \nmany other drugs and so many other products in our society.\n  This legislation also includes strong look-back penalties. The \nHEALTHY Kids Act would set a goal of reducing teenage smoking rates by \n67 percent in 10 years and would hold manufacturers accountable for \nthese tough goals by imposing 10-cent-a-pack penalties on the industry \nacross the board and 40-cent penalties on brand-specific products that \ndo not meet the targeted reductions. There would be no rebate. In the \nproposal the industry negotiated with the Attorneys General, there \nwould be the possibility of a company receiving a rebate by just trying \nhard. This legislation would require the goal be met, not simply the \neffort be made. This would also include comprehensive anti-smoking \nprograms, through advertising, prevention programs, and other means \nthat would help ensure that children do not smoke. These program would \nalso give adults, if they wish to change, access to programs to make \nsure they can make that transition from smoking to nonsmoking.\n  Because of the money that is generated, we will be able to commit \nsignificant resources to programs that are extremely important, \nprograms that have been outlined so well by Senator Conrad: education, \nchild care, health resources.\n  Also, this legislation, importantly, does not curtail prospective \nliability for the tobacco industry. It would settle the suits that have \nbeen lodged by the State attorneys general. Also, it would settle \nclaims with respect to governmental entities, but it would allow \nindividual citizens who have been harmed and who will be harmed by \ntobacco smoke to bring their case to court.\n  I believe this is a crucial part of the legislation, because without \nthis, the other mechanisms that we develop may well be undermined by \nsophisticated corporate reorganizations by the industry, by challenges \nto aspects of the law, and by many things which the tobacco companies \nhave done in the past to remake themselves to comply with Federal \nstatutes. Statutes which Congress thought would control their behavior \nbut which in many cases not only did not control their behavior but \ngave the tobacco companies additional ammunition to defend themselves \nagainst civil suits in the courts.\n  I believe that this liability issue is an important one and one that \ndistinguishes this legislation from others that have been introduced in \nthis Congress.\n  We here today have the opportunity to do what all Americans want us \nto do, ensure that children do not have ready access to cigarettes, \nensure that the next generation of Americans is not addicted before \nthey become adults, ensure that the public health in this country is \nprotected, ensure that we are able to create an environment in which a \nparent does not have to confront what must be one of the most harrowing \nmoments, the realization that a young son or a young daughter is \nbeginning to smoke and realizing also, as we do today, that that means \nthat this child will die prematurely.\n  No parent should have to endure that moment. No child should have to \nbe subject to the barrage of advertising,\n\n[[Page S742]]\n\nthe barrage of influences which have forced that child to smoke \ncigarettes. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nbill and to meet these goals. I look forward, as we all do, to the day \nin which cigarette smoking is not something that we associate with the \nyouth of this country.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to just take a few moments this \nafternoon to express my very warm appreciation to Senator Conrad for \nthe leadership that he has provided in bringing together a variety of \ndifferent views and offering on behalf of the families of this country \nan absolutely superb proposal that is focused on how we are going to \nreduce smoking for the young people of this country.\n  This bill isn't the perfect solution, but I daresay that if this \nparticular legislative proposal was enacted into law it would save the \nlives of millions of Americans.\n  This has been a long process, Mr. President, since the first Surgeon \nGeneral pointed out the dangers of smoking. This has been a constant \neffort over many, many years to try and address this issue in a \ncomprehensive and responsible way.\n  All of us take our hats off to the work that was done by the \nattorneys general that resulted in the June 20 settlement. But the \nlegislation Senator Conrad has introduced today is really a very, very \ncomprehensive proposal that, in many respects, may be the most \nimportant legislative undertaking that we will have in this Congress.\n  Senator Conrad and the other members of the task force should be \ncommended in putting this proposal forward so early in the Congress. We \nknow we have maybe 90 days left in this session, but I daresay that our \ntime could not be more beneficially spent than in the debate and the \ndiscussion of this legislation.\n  I join with those in hoping that we can get thoughtful consideration \nof this legislation in the committee on the floor of the Senate. It \nincorporates the principles that have been identified by the public \nhealth community and those who have studied this issue over a long \nperiod of time which are most important in reducing smoking:\n  No. 1, raising the cost of cigarettes in a substantial way over a \nshort period of time. In addition, the counteradvertising measures are \nvery, very important. Those two measures in tandem can make a dramatic \ndifference in the number of young people who will smoke in the future.\n  The strong FDA measures will also make sure the Agency will have the \npower and the authority to regulate nicotine and the other additives in \ncigarettes.\n  I think the attention that was given in the secondhand smoking \nproposals and also in recognizing our responsibilities of promoting \ncigarettes overseas are very thoughtful suggestions in these areas.\n  I want to add that I believe it is so important that the revenues \nthat are raised from this proposal will give a substantial boost to \nprograms that affect the children of this country. A very substantial \npart of the financial resources that are gained when this legislation \nis enacted will be focused on the children who have been the focus of \nthe tobacco industry for over a long, long period of time. I commend \nthe Senator and the task force for that commitment to the nation's \nchildren.\n  Secondly, there is an equally strong commitment towards supporting \nthe biomedical research which offers such extraordinary opportunities \nfor breakthroughs, not only in children's diseases but in other medical \nconditions such as cancer, AIDS, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's \nDisease, and mental illness.\n  This legislation can make a major difference in the public health of \nthe nation by reducing youth smoking. It can also make a major \ndifference to the children of this nation in focusing resources to make \ntheir lives more hopeful in the future. And it can make a major \ndifference in terms of the biomedical research opportunities at NIH \nwhich offer extraordinary hope in finding treatments for some of the \nnation's most severe medical conditions.\n  For all these reasons, this legislation should go forward. As Senator \nConrad has pointed out, he welcomes the chance for others to join in \nstrong support of this legislation, but certainly it is the challenge \nthat is laid out here. Others will have views. We hope they will come \nforward.\n  What we have heard so far is a deafening silence. I don't think the \nAmerican people are going to tolerate a silence in blind opposition to \nwhat has been a very thoughtful, a very comprehensive, and a very \ndetailed response to something that is of central importance to every \nfamily in this country.\n  I commend the Senator from North Dakota for all of his work and \nindicate a great desire to work closely with him and the others to make \nsure this legislation becomes law.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy. He has been an \noutstanding member of this task force team. No member of the task force \ncontributed more to the work of this group than Senator Kennedy. He has \nplayed an absolutely key role in the development of this legislation, \nthrough his own efforts and the efforts of his outstanding staff. He \nhas been a leader for a lifetime on these issues, and I extend my \ndeepest personal appreciation to him for his assistance and support.\n  I would also like to recognize Senator Baucus, who is on the floor. \nSenator Baucus who is an original cosponsor of this bill has been \nenormously helpful as well. He is a member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and has a special understanding of the financial aspects of \nthis legislation. I thank Senator Baucus for his commitment and his \nleadership as well.\n  Let me conclude by thanking my staff who have worked very long hours \nto produce this legislation: Bob Van Heuvelen, my policy director and \nchief counsel; Tom Mahr who is the person on my staff who heads up all \nof the health issues who has worked incredibly hard and with great \nskill to craft this legislation; Monica Boudjouk who has spent many a \nlong evening helping us to put together the many details of the \nproposal before us; and Mark Harsch, a fellow on my staff who has been \nenormously helpful as well.\n  I thank them all for their contributions, as well as the staff of the \nother task force members who put a great deal of time and effort into \nworking to produce this bill. I thank them all.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota is much too \nkind in his compliments of this Senator. The real credit goes to the \nSenator from North Dakota. We have seen many task forces appointed by \nvarious leaders on both sides of the aisle. I think we know that most \ntask forces basically do their work. They meet, they have several \nmeetings, and are earnest in trying to come up with a good solution \nassigned to them by the leader.\n  In this case, the Senator from North Dakota added new meaning to the \ndefinition of task force. First of all, they tasked; they worked very \nhard. I have not seen any effort since the days I have been in the \nSenate where a task force, a group worked so hard at so many meetings, \ncalled in so many outside experts in such a wide variety of fields to \nmake sure they came up with a very solid, comprehensive, near bullet-\nproof proposal in an area that is as complicated as this, whether it is \ntaxation issues, whether it is health issues, whether it is judicial \nissues, whatever they may be.\n  All of us who have any knowledge of the degree to which the Senator \nfrom North Dakota put this group together salute him. I have never seen \nanybody work as hard, as diligently and come up with such a fine \nproduct as the Senator from North Dakota. I hope that future task \nforces use his as a model, because if they do, the people of our \ncountry will be very, very well served, just as the Senator from North \nDakota's task force has served America with his efforts and his work. \nHe has done the best job of any Senator I have ever seen on any kind of \ntask force or group effort trying to come up with a solution to a very \ncomplicated problem. Again, I salute him.\n\n[[Page S743]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following letters of \nsupport for the Healthy Kids Act be submitted into the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Joint Statement of Drs.

Conrad and all other \n     members of the Congress to achieve these important public \n     health goals.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Statement of Hubert H. Humphrey III, Attorney General, State of \n                               Minnesota\n\n     Re: Senator Kent Conrad's Healthy Kids Act, Wednesday, \n         February 11, 1998\n       I commend Senator Conrad for his leadership of the Senate \n     Democratic Tobacco Task Force in its efforts to address the \n     number one public health issue of our day. The Healthy Kids \n     Act, proposed by Senator Conrad today, is a monumental step \n     forward in our efforts to advance public health and protest \n     future generations of kids.\n       Senator Conrad's bill offers the best hope yet for saving \n     our children from tobacco addiction, disease and death. It's \n     a common sense approach that will reduce youth smoking rates \n     dramatically and hold the tobacco industry accountable for \n     results.\n       The bill's strong financial penalties against the industry \n     for continuing to sell to kids creates a powerful economic \n     incentive to reform this industry's conduct. And by giving \n     the FDA full authority and oversight over the health hazards \n     of tobacco, the tobacco industry's manipulation of nicotine \n     to keep smokers addicted will finally come to an end.\n       This bill stands in stark contrast to the sweetheart deal \n     proposed by the tobacco industry last summer. and it's \n     because Senator Conrad and the Task Force asked the right \n     question. Instead of asking ``what will the industry \n     accept,'' Senator Conrad asked ``what is the right policy for \n     the nation.'' And the result is a bill that gets it right for \n     our children without giving this outlaw industry any special \n     immunity that no other business in America enjoys.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The National Association of Counties \n     (NACo) is pleased to support your bill, the Healthy Kids Act. \n     Not only does the legislation recognize the important health \n     responsibilities counties assume in the nation's \n     intergovernmental system, it also acknowledges the \n     responsibilities they have for enforcing tobacco control \n     ordinances. The bill is a very strong step forward for public \n     health.\n       As we understand it, the Healthy Kids Act recognizes the \n     unique and substantial tobacco-related health care costs \n     counties incur separate from the states' costs. As you know, \n     counties provide health care to individuals who have no \n     private or federally subsidized insurance, such as Medicaid. \n     Counties provide uncompensated care under general medical \n     assistance programs; through their health facilities; and/or \n     make payments to other facilities. Many also contribute \n     directly to the non-federal share of Medicaid. A number of \n     local governments filed suit against the tobacco industry \n     prior to the June 1997 proposed settlement using these facts \n     as a basis for part of their arguments.\n       We are also pleased to understand that county tobacco laws \n     and enforcement activities would not be preempted by federal \n     law under the bill. Counties must continue to be able to \n     enact and enforce, with locally-determined remedies, local \n     tobacco ordinances and penalties which are stronger than \n     state or federal law.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this issue. NACo \n     looks forward to working with you to advance and refine the \n     Healthy Kids Act.\n           Very Truly Yours,\n\n                                                Randy Johnson,\n\n                                                  President, NACo,\n     Hennepin County Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           American Public Health Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The American Public Health Association \n     (APHA), consisting of more than 50,000 public health \n     professionals dedicated to advancing the nation's health, \n     commends you for developing a comprehensive tobacco bill that \n     is a significant step forward toward protecting public \n     health, especially our nation's children and adolescents.\n       Your legislation addresses many priority issues for APHA \n     and the public health community and we recognize that in \n     these areas your bill provides stronger than the proposed \n     settlement and many other current tobacco proposals in the \n     Senate. APHA is particularly pleased with the following \n     aspects of your tobacco bill:\n       Reaffirmation of FDA jurisdiction over tobacco products, \n     especially the codification of the tobacco-related \n     regulations promulgated this summer by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services;\n       Preservation of state and local authority to impose \n     stronger requirements, prohibitions, and other measures to \n     control tobacco;\n       Creation of a national tobacco surveillance and evaluation \n     program at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     to monitor patterns of tobacco use and assess the \n     effectiveness of tobacco control efforts.\n       Requirement that tobacco control initiatives and programs \n     funded under this bill utilize proven and effective \n     methodologies;\n       Recognition that certain subpopulations, such as women and \n     minorities, are disproportionately affected by tobacco \n     products and calling for research to be conducted to study \n     different effects of tobacco use on these groups;\n       Assistance to tobacco growers, their families, and \n     communities;\n       Creation of an international code-of-conduct for tobacco \n     companies to help protect children and adults in other \n     countries from the dangers of tobacco products;\n       Support for international tobacco control efforts, \n     including the funding of bilateral and multilateral \n     assistance and the creation of a non-governmental \n     organization to work with other NGOs abroad on tobacco \n     control;\n       Ban on the use of taxpayer money to help promote U.S. \n     tobacco products overseas;\n       Health care assistance to uninsured and underinsured \n     individuals with financial hardship who suffer from tobacco-\n     related illnesses and conditions;\n       Strengthen look-back provisions to ensure that tobacco \n     companies are held accountable if adolescent smoking rates do \n     not decrease;\n       No special legal protections for tobacco companies.\n       As you work with your Senate colleagues on moving tobacco \n     legislation, we urge you to consider strengthening the public \n     health title of the bill. Specifically, APHA advocates \n     stronger involvement of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and state and local health departments in the \n     myriad public health activities funded under this title, \n     increased funding for the public health initiatives under \n     this title, inclusion of additional public health tobacco use \n     prevention and reduction initiatives such as environmental \n     tobacco smoke education programs and research, and other \n     public health and prevention focused efforts.\n       We are committed to working with you and your Senate \n     colleagues from both sides of the aisle to ensure that the \n     final tobacco control legislative vehicle is the strongest \n     possible national tobacco policy. We appreciate your efforts \n     to ensure the protection and promotion of public health and \n     offer our assistance as you continue to work on this issue of \n     critical global public health significance.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                 Richard A.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The American Lung Association is \n     pleased to endorse your tough tobacco legislation--The \n     Healthy Kids Act. This is the legislation the American people \n     have been demanding. It is not a deal for the tobacco \n     industry. It is a promise to our children. We are grateful \n     that you have made your legislative priority public health, \n     not saving the tobacco industry.\n       Americans oppose special deals for Big Tobacco. This \n     legislation reflects that sentiment and does not create \n     unprecedented special protections for the tobacco industry.\n       Americans know that in their own communities they can pass \n     even stronger public health laws than those passed at the \n     federal level. This bill respects the rights of state and \n     local governments to continue to pass strong measures.\n       This bill promises to create a solid national tobacco \n     policy that will improve health. The American Lung \n     Association believes that your approach will succeed.\n       Public opinion polling conducted recently for the American \n     Lung Association and its medical section, the American \n     Thoracic Society, found that voters overwhelmingly support \n     (65% to 30%) the $1.50 per pack fee on cigarettes. Voters \n     also support stiff penalties on tobacco companies if they \n     continue to sell to our children (54% support a per pack \n     penalty of $0.50 or more compared to 28% who want no \n     penalty). The electorate opposes special protections for the \n     tobacco industry (55% to 32%). Nearly seven out of ten voters \n     (69% to 33%) want the tobacco companies to follow the same \n     rules on marketing to children overseas as they do in the \n     U.S. It is clear that your bill is in sync with the will of \n     the American people.\n       The American Lung Association hopes that Congress will \n     follow your lead--keep this\n\n[[Page S744]]\n\n     promise to our children--and enact the Healthy Kids Act into \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 John R. Garrison,\n     CEO and Managing Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Statement of the ENACT Coalition Regarding the Introduction of The \n                            Healthy Kids Act\n\n       (February 11, 1998) The ENACT coalition of major public \n     health organizations applauds today's introduction of the \n     Healthy Kids Act by Senator Conrad and his co-sponsors. We \n     support a strong comprehensive approach and welcome this \n     bill.\n       The Healthy Kids Act encompasses the key policies that \n     ENACT has stated must be included in any effective tobacco \n     control legislation. The bill contains strong and effective \n     provisions regarding FDA authority over tobacco sales, \n     manufacturing and advertising; significant price increases to \n     deter use by kids; effective ``look-back'' penalties if sales \n     to youth don't decrease; a vigorous crackdown on the illegal \n     sale of tobacco to minors; protections from secondhand smoke; \n     disclosure of tobacco industry documents; assistance to \n     tobacco farmers; and support for efforts to reduce tobacco \n     use internationally.\n       ENACT believes that only a comprehensive bill that meets \n     our minimum criteria can adequately address the complex \n     problem of tobacco use and reduce the number of kids who \n     start using tobacco, and the number of adults who die each \n     year.\n       We expect a number of additional proposals to be introduced \n     in the House and Senate in the coming weeks. We will evaluate \n     each of them, and those already introduced, for their \n     adherence to the public health principles we have set forth. \n     ENACT is committed to working with Senator Conrad and with \n     Members of Congress from both parties to enact a \n     comprehensive, bi-partisan, well-funded and sustainable \n     tobacco control policy.\n\n\n              ENACT coalition members (February 11, 1998)\n\n       Allergy and Asthma Network--Mothers of Asthmatics, Inc.\n       American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Academy of Family Physicians.\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       American Association for Respiratory Care.\n       American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin.\n       American Cancer Society.\n       American College of Cardiology.\n       American College of Chest Physicians.\n       American College of Occupational and Environmental \n     Medicine.\n       American College of Physicians.\n       American College of Preventive Medicine.\n       American Heart Association.\n       American Medical Association.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       American Society of Anesthesiologists.\n       American Society of Clinical Oncology.\n       American Society of Internal Medicine.\n       Association of American Medical Colleges.\n       Association of Black Cardiologists, Inc.\n       Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs.\n       Association of Schools of Public Health.\n       Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n       College on Problems of Drug Dependence.\n       Council of State & Territorial Epidemiologists.\n       Family Voices.\n       The HMO Group.\n       Interreligious Coalition on Smoking OR Health.\n       Latino Council on Alcohol & Tobacco.\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals.\n       National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n       National Association of Local Boards of Health.\n       National Hispanic Medical Association.\n       Oncology Nursing Society.\n       Partnership for Prevention.\n       Society for Public Health Education.\n       The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.\n       The Society of Behavioral Medicine.\n       Summit Health Coalition.\n       A number of the nation's major public health organizations \n     have formed ENACT (Effective National Action to Control \n     Tobacco). This growing coalition has pledged to work with the \n     Congress, the Administration, the public health community and \n     the American people to pass comprehensive, sustainable, \n     effective, well-funded national tobacco control legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Statement by the Coalition for Workers' Health Care Funds Supporting \n         the Senate Democratic Task Force ``Healthy Kids'' Bill\n\n       The Coalition for Workers' Health Care Funds represents \n     some 2,500 union sponsored, multiemployer health and welfare \n     funds which have brought class action law suits against the \n     tobacco companies seeking reimbursement for their health care \n     costs of tobacco-related diseases.\n       The Coalition believes that the legislation introduced by \n     Senator Kent Conrad and Senator Tom Daschle on behalf of the \n     Senate Democratic Tobacco Task Force is both sound and \n     reasonable. It represents good public health policy, while at \n     the same time protecting the civil justice rights of the \n     multi-employer health & welfare community and others with \n     claims against the tobacco companies.\n       We are particularly pleased that the legislation includes \n     an adjustment assistance program for those tobacco workers \n     who might be adversely effected by the legislation, and we \n     encourage the sponsors to further develop this important \n     program. Such assistance for workers is essential in light of \n     the fact that for the past 18 years, the tobacco companies \n     have engaged in a systematic corporate policy to downsize the \n     workforce without assistance for its workers.\n       According to the ``Statistical Abstract of the Unite States \n     1997'' the tobacco industry has reduced its total employment \n     by over 40% since 1980; from 69,000 in 1980 to 41,000 in \n     1996. Moreover, the ``Abstract'' projects that by 2005 the \n     industry will have further reduced its U.S. employment to \n     26,000, for an overall reduction since 1980 of 62.4%. \n     Absolutely none of this workforce reduction has been due to a \n     profit decline for the industry since, again according to the \n     ``Abstract'' the annual value of the domestic product has \n     remained constant at about $35 billion. It is also no secret \n     that the U.S. tobacco manufactures have been moving \n     production facilities overseas. All of this occurred long \n     before any ``Tobacco settlement'' was ever negotiated or \n     anticipated. It is the direct result of the same corporate \n     strategy that we have witnessed in industry after industry; \n     from machine tools and electrical equipment to textiles and \n     semi-conductors. In their effort to maximize profits American \n     corporations have closed manufacturing facilities in the U.S. \n     and moved to countries with the lowest wages and least labor \n     protections.\n\n                   Employment in the Tobacco Industry\n\n       In its effort to enact federal legislation to immunize \n     itself from effective legal action, the tobacco industry has \n     engaged in an attempt to economically ``blackmail'' the \n     workers employed in the tobacco industry. The industry has \n     argued that unless the tobacco deal, with immunity, is \n     enacted that it will be forced to shut-down its operations in \n     the United States and move production overseas.\n       The fact of the matter is that over the last 18 years, the \n     industry has dramatically reduced employment by 40% and \n     intends to continue this trend in the future.\n       The tobacco industry employment figures reproduced below \n     are from the ``Statistical Abstract of the United States \n     1997'', the ultimate source of which is the industry itself.\nAll Employees--all products:\n    1980.........................................................69,000\n    1990.........................................................49,000\n    1996.........................................................41,000\n    2005-(proj.).................................................26,000\nProduction Employees--all products:\n    1980.........................................................54,000\n    1990.........................................................36,000\n    1996.........................................................31,000\nAll Employees--cigarettes:\n    1980.........................................................46,000\n    1990.........................................................35,000\n    1996.........................................................28,000\nProduction Employees--cigarettes:\n    1980.........................................................35,000\n    1990.........................................................26,000\n    1996.........................................................21,000\n\nNotes:\n1. These figures were prepared long before the announced ``Tobacco \nSettlement''.\n2. Less than half of all tobacco production workers are represented by \nlabor unions.\n3. The Union sponsored labor-management health & welfare funds which \nhave brought suit against the tobacco companies represent 30 million \nunion workers, retirees and their families.\n\nSource: Statistical Abstract of the United States, 1997, p. 416 & p. \n425.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to speak in strong support of \nthe HEALTHY Kids Act, which was introduced by Senator Conrad. Senator \nConrad chaired our tobacco task force, on which I served as vice \nchairman, and I thought, as did most on our side, that he did an \nincredibly thorough job in researching the issues and hearing from the \nvarious affected parties.\n  Mr. President, this bill today reflects the consensus of our task \nforce. It is the vision of the Senate Democrats and has cosponsors from \nall sectors of the Democratic Party. Although some of us differ on \ncertain specific points, all of us who are cosponsoring this \nlegislation agree that this bill contains the right approach to \ntackling the devastating health problems that come from smoking \ncigarettes.\n  At the heart of this proposal is a per pack price increase of $1.50. \nThis price increase will be phased in over three years and then indexed \nto inflation to maintain a deterrent effect on youth smoking.\n  I am particularly pleased, Mr. President, with this aspect of the \nHEALTHY Kids Act because it was adopted from a bill I introduced last \nyear, the Public Health and Education Resource Act, which is S. 1343.\n  I believe now--as I did then--that if we are serious about reducing \nteen smoking, we have to increase the price swiftly and dramatically. \nIt seems to have the most deterrent effect of all measures on youth \nbecause when the price goes up that far they cannot afford to pick up \nthe habit, for which we are grateful.\n\n[[Page S745]]\n\n  This bill also includes much of the bill that Senator Kennedy \nsponsored, and that I had the opportunity to support as a cosponsor, \nagain representing the views of several of our Members to be included \nin this consensus package.\n  The focus of any tobacco legislation must be on improving the health \nof future generations of Americans, and this bill accomplishes that \nvery clearly. In addition to funding various programs that will reduce \nteen smoking and benefit the well-being of children, it provides \nunfettered FDA jurisdiction. As the President has stated many times, \nfull FDA power over these deadly products is essential.\n  Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Budget Committee I am also \npleased that this bill is consistent with the President's budget \nproposal. Both approaches recognize that comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation requires a strong investment in America's children. Our \napproach keeps children away from this addictive product, improves \ntheir health, provides adequate child care and gives them a learning \nenvironment that fosters health and knowledge and progress.\n  That is a real investment in our children, and that is the focus of \nthe Healthy Kids Act.\n  Mr. President, I often hear that we in Congress cannot pass any \nlegislation that the tobacco industry does not first agree to support. \nThey speak as if Big Tobacco has some sort of veto right over \nlegislation affecting their industry.\n  I must tell you. I fail to find in the Constitution of the United \nStates--or in any of the Senate rules--any provision that gives them \nthe right to veto legislation. The Congress not only has a right--but a \nduty--to rein in on an industry that has been out of control targeting \nour children for addiction and lying about the dangerous nature of \ntheir products.\n  Mr. President, there has also been a great deal of talk about \nproviding special protection against liability to this industry. First \nof all, one must question why in the world this industry, which has \nengaged in more corporate misconduct than any other, deserves \nunprecedented special protection from civil liability.\n  Secondly, this industry continues to this day to hide from the public \ncritical information about tobacco's effect on our health. Congress \nshouldn't even consider limited civil liability protections until we \nhave full and absolute disclosure from the companies. It is time for \nthem to stop hiding behind false claims of privilege and come clean \nwith the American people.\n  Mr. President, this bill, the Healthy Kids Act, presents Congress \nwith a historic opportunity. I welcome, very sincerely, my friends from \nthe other side of the aisle to cosponsor this bill, to work with us, as \nI know that they want to, to question perhaps the methodology or \nprocess. But I hope that won't stand in the way. We both want to save \nchildren's lives. We want to invest in their future. It has to be a \nbipartisan goal. I expect that many of our friends on the Republican \nside will join us at some point.\n  Mr. President, as can be expected in any omnibus legislation, some \nSenators will disagree on specific provisions of the bill. In fact, I \nhave some reservations about certain provisions of this act, such as \nthe secondhand smoke restrictions, which I believe could be tougher. \nBut I ask all of my colleagues to keep their eye on the big picture--\nreducing tobacco's seductive grip on our kids.\n  Their target--it is very clearly understood--is to get 3,000 kids a \nday to start smoking because they know once you start it is hell to try \nand stop. And we don't want to permit them to get a grip on our \nchildren, on their lives, on their health, or on their habits.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that we will be working together in a \nbipartisan way. We will make this happen if we can possibly do so. And \nI invite all of our colleagues to join us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to join Senator Conrad and my other colleagues in introducing the \nHEALTHY Kids Act. I want to commend Senator Conrad, and his staff, for \ntheir excellent work in formulating this legislation. I firmly believe \nthat this legislation represents the opportunity to prevent nicotine \naddiction in children and youth.\n  The Congress has the truly historic opportunity this year to enact \ncomprehensive legislation that will reduce access to and consumption of \ntobacco by our youth. Over the past few months, I have been part of the \ntask force that helped consider the numerous issues involved in \ndeveloping a comprehensive approach to address the public health issues \nthat surround youth and tobacco. The HEALTHY Kids Act gives us a \nblueprint for reducing the terrible destruction that tobacco products \nhave caused.\n  The Senate has a compelling interest to address the various issues \nraised by the tobacco settlement. The Office on Smoking and Health at \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that \ncigarettes kill more Americans that AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, \nmurders, suicides, drugs, and fires combined.\n  Additionally, As the smoke screen erected by the tobacco companies \nbegins to clear through numerous court proceedings, we now know what we \nhave suspected all along: The targeting of our children has been a well \nplanned, well orchestrated, and well financed conspiracy by these \ncompanies.\n  We have all seen the statistics. The Institute of Medicine finds that \ndespite the market decline in adult smoking and the social disapproval \nof smoking, an estimated 3,000 young people become regular smokers \nevery day. In my home state of New Mexico, roughly 33% of our youth in \ngrades 9 through 12, smoke. Indeed, Mr. President, nationally, the \nprevalence of smoking by youth, has remained basically unchanged since \n1980. If current tobacco use patterns in this nation persist, five \nmillion children currently alive today will die prematurely from a \nsmoking related disease.\n  It is worth noting that lung cancer remains the leading cause of \ncancer death in the United States. All cancers caused by cigarette \nsmoking can be prevented. Instead, according to CDC and Robert Wood \nJohnson, 170,000 Americans will lose their lives to tobacco related \ncancer this year. Preventing and reducing cigarette smoking are key to \nreducing illness and death. We must act now.\n  There will be myriad reasons put forth as to why we cannot or should \nnot enact this legislation. There will be some who will say that \nCongress should not act at all. We have the opportunity and the \nobligation to enact legislation that will address the public health \nproblems caused by tobacco products. The HEALTHY Kids Act gives us the \nchance to begin reversing the damage that has been done. It provides \nthe vehicle for leadership that will be necessary to save our children. \nI hope that we will move, and move quickly without any more excuses, to \nenact this legislation.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am proud today to join with several of \nmy colleagues in support of S. 1638, ``The Healthy Kids Act'', the \ntobacco bill crafted by Senator Conrad and the Democratic Tobacco Task \nForce.\n  As you have heard many of our colleagues say, 3000 kids start smoking \nevery day. One third of those will prematurely die from a tobacco-\nrelated disease. In Nebraska alone, 38 out of 100 high school kids \ncurrently smoke cigarettes and over 35,000 kids currently under the age \nof 18 will die prematurely from tobacco-related diseases.\n  This is simply unacceptable. And the job has fallen upon Congress to \ndo something about it. Last summer, my colleagues and I were faced with \nthe daunting task of putting together comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation. Led by my very dedicated colleague Senator Conrad from \nNorth Dakota, the Democratic Tobacco Task Force worked hard for nearly \neight months to draft a bill that put our children's health first. This \nis exactly what The HEALTHY Kids Act does.\n  This bill puts the law on the side of our kids. Sometimes we pass \nlaws and are unsure of their impact. This time we can be certain: If we \npass this law it will save children's lives. Period.\n  Experts say that the way to get kids to quit smoking is to raise \nprices on cigarettes. The HEALTHY Kids Act does this.\n  This bill is projected to collect $78 billion in total revenue over \nthe next five years. Among other things, this money will help improve \nour children's\n\n[[Page S746]]\n\nhealth care, child care, and education; fund important medical \nresearch; take care of the farmers that were left out of the settlement \nnegotiations; and some money will even go towards reducing the deficit \nand saving social security--which could perhaps be the greatest gift we \ncould ever think about giving our children.\n  Mr. President, I close by saying that I look forward to working with \nMr. Conrad and others on passing this important legislation that \ncorrectly puts our children first.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL:\n  S. 1639. A bill to amend the Emergency Planning and Community Right-\nTo-Know Act of 1986 to cover Federal facilities; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n       the federal facilities community right-to-know act of 1998\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation--\nThe Federal Facilities Community Right-To-Know Act of 1998--which \nprovides that the federal government is held to the same reporting \nrequirements under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know \nAct (EPCRA) of 1986 as private entities. In 1986, Congress directed the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a national inventory \nto inform the public about chemicals used and released in their \ncommunities. Since enactment of the Emergency Planning and Community \nRight-To-Know Act, manufacturers have been required to keep extensive \nrecords on how they use and store hazardous chemicals and report \nreleases of hundreds of hazardous chemicals annually. EPA compiles the \nreported information into the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI).\n  The Toxic Release Inventory is a publicly available data base \ncontaining specific chemical release and transfer information from \nmanufacturing facilities throughout the United States. The TRI is \nintended to promote planning for chemical emergencies and to provide \ninformation to the public regarding the presence and release of toxic \nand hazardous chemicals in their communities.\n  In August 1993, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12856, which \nrequired Federal facilities to begin submitting TRI reports beginning \nin calendar year 1994 activities. I commend President Clinton for \ntaking this action. However, this executive order does not have the \nforce of law and could be changed by a future Administration. The \nNational Governors Association's policy on federal facilities states \nthat ``Congress should ensure that federal and state ``right to know'' \nrequirements apply to federal facilities.'' My legislation simply \namends the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act to cover \nfederal facilities. It is important for the Federal government to \nprotect the environment and its citizens from hazardous substances. \nPeople living near federal facilities have the right to know what \nhazardous substances are being released into the environment by these \nfacilities so they can better protect themselves and their children \nfrom these potential threats. It is my strong belief that federal \nfacilities should be treated the same as private entities. My \nlegislation attempts to moves us closer towards that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 1640. A bill to designate the building of the United States Postal \nService located at East Kellogg Boulevard in Saint Paul, Minnesota, as \nthe ``Eugene J. McCarthy Post Office Building''; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n  THE EUGENE J. McCARTHY POST OFFICE BUILDING DESIGNATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams, to introduce legislation which \nwould designate the U.S. Post Office Building in downtown St. Paul, MN, \nas the ``Eugene J. McCarthy Post Office Building.'' In doing so, we \njoin the entire Minnesota delegation in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in honoring a man who is of great importance to our \nstate and our nation.\n  This building, which will bear the name of one of Minnesota's great \nstatesmen, stands in Minnesota's capitol, a city represented by Senator \nMcCarthy in the House and Senate for nearly a quarter of a century. \nWhen the 4th district, and later all of Minnesota, sent Senator \nMcCarthy to Washington they sent a scholar as well as a legislator, and \nhis service to our state and this nation has not been restricted to his \ntenure in Congress. He has touched lives as a teacher and author as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to know Eugene McCarthy and to follow in \nhis footsteps as a Senator from Minnesota, as a progressive, and as a \ngreat believer in grassroots democracy. He is a person who not only \narticulated, but exercised, a politics of inclusion and who knows that \na candidate's success is best built upon a foundation of individuals. \nWhile America has had many important leaders, very few have fought the \nbattles Senator McCarthy has fought, very few have shown the commitment \nhe has shown to effecting positive change for ordinary people, and very \nfew can match his record as a man of peace.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor to extend my state's, and my country's, \ngratitude to Senator McCarthy with this designation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The building of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 180 East Kellogg Boulevard in Saint Paul, \n     Minnesota, shall be known and designated as the ``Eugene J. \n     McCarthy Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     building referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Eugene J. McCarthy Post Office \n     Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1641. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study \nalternatives for establishing a national historic trail to commemorate \nand interpret the history of women's rights in the United States; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL ACT\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, 1848 was one of the busiest years of the \n19th Century in Europe. Everywhere kings were abdicating, ministers \nfleeing, mobs roving. In London, Karl Marx and Frederich Engels \ncomposed a pamphlet entitled Manifesto of the Communist Party. \nRevolution was all the rage. But the real revolution was taking place \nin a small brick chapel in a village in upstate New York where people \nhad begun to think of a revolution unlike anything known--equal rights \nfor women.\n  The American movement for women's rights began in Waterloo, New York \nnearly 150 years ago when five women met at the home of Jane and \nRichard Hunt. There, Elizabeth Cady Stanton of Seneca Falls, Mary Ann \nMcClintock of Waterloo, Marta Coffin Wright of nearby Auburn, Lucretia \nCoffin Mott of Philadelphia and Mrs. Hunt planned the first women's \nrights convention held at the Wesleyan Chapel in Seneca Falls. It was \nalso there that they wrote the ``Declaration of Sentiments,'' a \ndocument which can certainly be regarded as the Magna Carta of the \nwomen's movement. Modeled on our Declaration of Independence, the \n``Declaration of Sentiments'' proclaimed that:\n\n       All men and women are created equal: That they are endowed \n     by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among \n     these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n  This unprecedented declaration called for broad societal changes \naimed at eliminating discriminatory restrictions on women in all their \nspheres of life. A woman's right to a higher education, the right to \nown property and the right to retain her own wages--all these and more \nwere proclaimed in this landmark document endorsed at the Seneca Falls \nConvention on July 19 and 20, 1848.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the convention was the catalyst for the \n19th Amendment. There, Elizabeth Cady\n\n[[Page S747]]\n\nStanton made what was at the time a most radical proposal. She called \nfor extending the franchise to women.\n  Ameila Bloomer, publisher of Lily, the first prominent women's rights \nnewsletter, eloquently defended Stanton's call and articulated the \nimportance of the vote:\n\n       In this country there is one great tribunal by which all \n     theories must be tried, all principles tested, all measures \n     settled: and that tribunal is the ballot box. It is the \n     medium through which public opinion finally makes itself \n     heard. Deny to any class in the community the right to be \n     heard at the ballot-box and that class sinks at once into a \n     state of slavish dependence, of civil insignificance, which \n     nothing can save from becoming subjugation, oppression and \n     wrong.\n\n  It was fully 72 years before the Nation heeded their call for the \nvote for women.\n  It took but 10 months in 1980, however, to establish a Women's Rights \nHistoric Park at Seneca Falls and Waterloo, commemorating this call. \nThen-Senator Javits and I proposed a bill that created an historic park \nwithin Seneca Falls to commemorate the early beginnings of the women's \nmovement and to recognize the important role Seneca Falls has played in \nthe movement. The park consists of five sites: the 1840's Greek Revival \nhome of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, organizer and leader of the women's \nrights movement; the Wesleyan Chapel, where the First Women's Rights \nConvention was held; Declaration Park with a 100 foot waterwall \nengraved with the Declaration of Sentiments and the names of the \nsigners of Declaration; and the M'Clintock house, home of MaryAnn and \nThomas M'Clintock, where the Declaration was drafted.\n  On June 27 last, my friend and colleague, Senator D'Amato and I \nintroduced S. Con. Res. 35, a resolution that urges the United States \nPostal Service to issue a commemorative postage stamp to celebrate the \n150th anniversary of the Women's Rights Convention. It is only fitting \nthat a stamp be issued commemorating this historic anniversary and \nhighlighting the importance of continuing this struggle for equal \nrights and opportunity for women in areas such as health care, \neducation, employment, and pay equity.\n  Today Senator D'Amato and I, in concert with Representative Louise M. \nSlaughter of Rochester, introduce legislation which would direct the \nSecretary of the Interior to study the development of a Women's Rights \nHistoric Trail stretching from Boston, Massachusetts to Buffalo, New \nYork.\n  Mr. President, the contributions made by women in that region are \nmany. This is hallowed ground that needs to be celebrated. It would \ninclude such sites as the Susan B. Anthony House and voting place in \nRochester; the Women's Rights National Historical Park; the National \nWomen's Hall of Fame and the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House in Seneca \nFalls; the Harriet Tubman House and memorial in Auburn; and the Eleanor \nRoosevelt home in Hyde Park.\n  The women of Seneca Falls challenged America to social revolution \nwith a list of demands that touched upon every aspect of life. Testing \ndifferent approaches, the early women's rights leaders came to view the \nballot as the best way to challenge the system, but they did not limit \ntheir efforts to this one issue. Fifty years after the convention, \nwomen could claim property rights, employment and educational \nopportunities, divorce and child custody laws, and increased social \nfreedoms. By the early 20th century, a coalition of suffragists, \ntemperance groups, reform-minded politicians, and women's social \nwelfare organizations mustered a successful push for the vote.\n  Today Congress honors Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, along \nwith Susan B. Anthony, as revolutionary leaders of the women's movement \nby placing a statue of them in the Capitol Rotunda next to statues of \nother leaders in our Nation's history such as George Washington, \nAbraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  An historic trail would be a living monument to women's history, \nbringing to life the numerous pioneers so often left out of our \ntextbooks. In ``The Ladies of Seneca Falls: The Birth of the Women's \nRights Movement'', Miriam Gurko writes:\n\n       Most histories contain, if anything, only the briefest \n     allusion to the woman's rights movement in the nineteenth \n     century--perhaps no more than a sentence to include it in the \n     general upsurge of reform. Here and there the name of a \n     woman's rights leader might be mentioned, generally that of \n     Susan B. Anthony, sometimes Elizabeth Cady Stanton. The rest \n     might never have existed so far as the general run of \n     historical sources is concerned.\n\n  One of the most important social forces of our time is women's \nstruggle to achieve equality, and, as such, it is incumbent upon us to \npay tribute to its many heroes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1641\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve the effectiveness and performance of \nFederal financial assistance programs, simplify Federal financial \nassistance application and reporting requirements, and improve the \ndelivery of services to the public; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n      the federal financial assistance management improvement act\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nFinancial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1998--legislation \ndesigned to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal \nfinancial assistance and grant-in-aid programs.\n  According to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, \nthere are over 600 different Federal grant programs to state and local \ngovernments and other service providers. Not only is that a large \nnumber of programs in the aggregate, we also have an abundance of \nseparate grant programs even in areas where only one general purpose is \nbeing served. For example, in the budget subfunction of social services \nalone, there are over 80 different Federal grant programs. In \nelementary and secondary education, there are a similar number of \nFederal programs.\n  Almost all of these different grant programs serve worthy goals and \npurposes. However, they inevitably carry with them separate redtape, \nregulations, and procedures that frustrate those at the state, local \nand nonprofit level who must coordinate the services and carry out the \nresponsibilities in all these separate programs. Furthermore, in many \nof these grant programs, ``getting out the money'' is the primary \nemphasis. Administrative performance and efficiency are a secondary \nemphasis, or in some cases not emphasized at all, so we have little \nunderstanding at any level of government how well the\n\n[[Page S748]]\n\nprograms are actually working. Part of this problem stems from the fact \nthat the money passes through 3 sometimes 4 different sets of hands \nbefore it reaches its intended beneficiaries. So it's hard to know \nwhere responsibility lies when it comes to making sure that the money \nis spent efficiently, properly and in a way to maximize the goals and \nobjectives of the underlying program.\n  We've been working for several years in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee on ways to cut Federal redtape while improving performance. \nWe tried to reduce Federal burdens with enactment of the Paperwork \nReduction Act and Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, while strengthening the \neffectiveness of Federal programs with the Government Performance \nResults Act.\n  This bill builds on those initiatives. It requires that Federal \nagencies develop plans that, among other things: establish uniform \napplications for related grant programs; develop common rules for \nFederal requirements that cut across multiple grant programs; and, \nemphasize use of electronic reporting via the Internet. Agencies would \nhave 18 months to develop their plans, with OMB overseeing their \ndevelopment. They would work closely with state and local governments \nand the nonprofit community in the setting of performance measures to \nachieve the bill's goals. The bill sunsets in 5 years following a \nreview by the National Academy of Public Administration.\n  Americans want government services to work better. But they also want \ngovernment to live within its means, to balance its books. In other \nwords, they want more cost-effective government, and that's at all \nlevels. I believe this bill helps lead us in that direction. I'm \npleased that Chairman Thompson, along with Senators Levin, Lieberman, \nand Akaka, have joined me cosponsoring the bill and I look forward to \nconsidering it in the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1642\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ndelay for one year implementation of the per beneficiary limits under \nthe interim payment system to home health agencies and to provide for a \nlater base year for the purposes of calculating new payment rates under \nthe system; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               medicare and home health care legislation\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the home health benefit available under \nMedicare plays a significant role in allowing elderly beneficiaries to \nremain in their homes and in their community. Those who use the home \nhealth benefit are among the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries. \nMore than 40 percent have incomes below $10,000. One in three live \nalone, and two-thirds are over age 75.\n\n  In recent years, the cost of the home health benefit has been one of \nthe fastest growing parts of Medicare. While the vast majority of this \ngrowth is attributable to a legitimate increase in home health care as \npatients are moved out of the hospital more quickly, some portion is \nknown to be due to fraud. As a result, Congress enacted provisions on \nthis spending as a part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. \nUnfortunately, it now appears that some of the restrictions will \noperate in a way that penalizes providers unfairly and jeopardizes \ntheir ability to continue to offer these vital services for the \nelderly.\n  In order to address these issues, I am introducing legislation to \ndelay the effective date of one provision, and to change the base year \nthat will be used to calculate future home health payments. Congressman \nMcGovern is introducing similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The problem with the current law is especially serious in New \nEngland. Home health agencies throughout the region generally provide \ncare for less cost than the national average. For example, the average \nMedicare payment per home health visit in Massachusetts in 1995 was 19 \npercent below the national average. These programs are effective. They \nprovide high quality home health care and help people to remain in the \ncommunity and out of hospitals and nursing homes. And they do so in a \ncost-efficient manner. Nevertheless, the Home & Health Care Association \nof Massachusetts estimates that the provisions of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 could result in a loss of 1.5 million home health visits--a \n20 percent reduction--this year. Under the Act, Massachusetts and other \nstates that provide high quality care efficiently and at lower rates \nare at a disadvantage, whereas inefficient providers are permitted to \nlock in higher rates.\n  One of the most questionable effects of the Act requires home health \nagencies to comply with ``per beneficiary caps'' before the federal \ngovernment tells them what the caps are. The bill I am introducing \ndelays the effective date of the caps until October 1, 1998, to allow \ntime for agencies to adjust to forthcoming, essential guidance from the \nHealth Care Financing Administration.\n  In addition, this bill moves up the year--from 1994 to 1995--that \nwill be used to calculate payments for 1998 and beyond. This change \nmeans that payments will more accurately reflect the type of home care \nthat is currently delivered.\n  The problem facing home health patients and agencies is substantial. \nCongress should address this issue now, before home health agencies \nthat provide needed services are unfairly forced out of business, and \nbefore senior citizens are forced to go without necessary care or leave \ntheir homes for more expensive hospital care or nursing home care. The \nprovisions of the Balanced Budget Act should be modified to avoid these \nunfortunate and unnecessary problems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1643\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DELAY OF PER BENEFICIARY LIMITS UNDER INTERIM \n                   PAYMENT SYSTEM AND CHANGE OF BASE YEAR.\n\n       (a) Delay in Per Beneficiary Limits Under Interim Payment \n     System.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1861(v)(1)(L) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)), as amended by \n     section 4602 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, is amended \n     in clauses (v) and (vi) by striking ``October 1, 1997,'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``October 1, 1998,''.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--Section 1861(v)(1)(L)(vii) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)(vii)), as \n     added by section 4602(c) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``April 1, 1998,'' and inserting ``August \n     1, 1998,''; and\n       (B) by striking ``fiscal year 1998'' and inserting ``fiscal \n     year 1999''.\n       (b) Change in Base Year.--Section 1861(v)(1)(L)(v)(I) of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(v)(1)(L)(v)(I)) is \n     amended by striking ``ending during fiscal year 1994'' each \n     place it appears and inserting ``ending during fiscal year \n     1995 or, at the election of the agency, calendar year 1995''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall apply as if included in the enactment of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation with \nmy colleague Senator Kennedy that will improve the implementation of \nthe interim payment system to home health agencies established under \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It is imperative that we protect \naccess\n\n[[Page S750]]\n\nto care for our most vulnerable populations--the elderly and the \ndisabled. While I support the move to a prospective payment system for \nhome care under the Balanced Budget Act, the payment system designed \nfor the interim period is proving to be an intolerable burden for the \nhome health agencies that serve Vermont's Medicare beneficiaries.\n  This bill would do two things to remove the current threat to quality \nhome care. First, the bill delays the implementation of the interim \npayment system for one year. This will minimize its impact on agencies \nas a prospective payment system is put in place. Second, the base year \nfor establishing per patient limits will shift from the current \ndesignation of fiscal year 1994, to either fiscal or calendar year \n1995. Care rendered in 1995 is a better reflection of the current mix \nof patients--and it captures the deterrent effect of Operation Restore \nTrust on fraud and abuse in areas where cost was inflated.\n  My own State of Vermont is a good example of how the health care \nsystem can work to provide for high quality care for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Home health agencies are a critical link in the kind of \nhealth system that extends care over a continuum of options and \nsettings. New technology and advances in medical practice permit \nhospitals to discharge patients earlier. They give persons suffering \nwith acute or chronic illness the opportunity to receive care and live \ntheir lives in familiar surroundings. Time and time again, Vermont's \nhome health agencies have proven their value by providing quality, \ncost-effective services to these patients. Yet time and again, federal \npolicy seems to ensure that their good deeds should go punished.\n  Furthermore, Vermont home health agencies have been able to provide \nquality service while consistently maintaining the lowest per capital \nreimbursement rates for home care in the country. The average Medicare \npayment per patient in Vermont is approximately $3,000 per year, one \nthird lower than the national average, and far less than in high costs \nstates where payments rise as high as $7,900 per patient per year. Now, \nVermont agencies face a interim payment system established under the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 that is based on historical cost. Instead \nof being rewarded for their good work, Vermont agencies will have a \nmuch lower per patient limit under Medicare than agencies in high cost \nareas. According to a January 7 article in the Wall Street Journal, \nVermont's 13 agencies could lose over $2 million next year by \ncontinuing to do what they always have done--providing efficient and \nessential services.\n  Since the impact of the interim payment system became apparent, I \nhave been in continuous contact with the Vermont Assembly of Home \nHealth Agencies; the Vermont Agency of Human Services; and directors, \ntrustees, employees, and patients of nearly every home health agency in \nthe state. I firmly believe we must act to guard the health and welfare \nof a particularly vulnerable segment of the population. This \nlegislation will help ensure that our home health care infrastructure \nis able to continue serving the patients that rely upon them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, \n        Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Hollings):\n  S. 1644. A bill to amend subpart 4 of part A of title IV of the \nHigher Education Act of 1965 regarding Grants to States for State \nStudent Incentives; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         the leveraging educational assistance partnership act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with my \nRepublican colleague on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nSenator Susan Collins, as well as Senators Kennedy, Murray, Dodd, \nMikulski, Conrad, Levin, Akaka, Kerry, Johnson, Torricelli, Kerrey, and \nHollings to reform and reauthorize an important student aid program, \nthe State Student Incentive Grant program or SSIG.\n  Last fall, I was pleased to join forces with Senator Collins to lead \nthe fight to restore funding for SSIG on an 84 to 4 vote.\n  This program provides funding on the basis of a dollar for dollar \nmatch to help states provide need-based financial aid in the form of \ngrants and community service work study awards to 700,000 students \nnationwide, and 13,000 students from my home state of Rhode Island. \nGrants are targeted to the neediest undergraduate and graduate \nstudents.\n  As I noted last fall during the debate on the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations bill, many states would not have \nestablished or maintained their need-based financial aid programs \nwithout this important federal incentive. Moreover, students, searching \nfor sources of need-based grants to make their higher education dreams \na reality, have come to rely on SSIG.\n  Indeed, the importance of SSIG has increased over the years as \nskyrocketing college costs have eroded the purchasing power of the Pell \nGrant, and as the grant-loan imbalance widens. Twenty-three years ago, \n80 percent of student aid came in the form of grants and 20 percent in \nthe form of loans. Today the opposite is true, and students face \nsignificant debt upon graduation.\n  In addition, low-income students are still finding it particularly \nhard to afford higher education. Less than 50% of high school graduates \nwith incomes under $22,000 go to college, while more than 80% of their \nhigher income counterparts pursue education beyond high school.\n  To address these trends and ensure that needy students have \nalternatives to borrowing, SSIG must be strengthened during the \nupcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. The legislation \nwe introduce today, the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership \n(LEAP) Act, does this by reauthorizing and making significant reforms \nto the SSIG program.\n  The LEAP Act provides states greater incentives and flexibility to \nhelp needy students attend college. Our legislation creates a two-tier \ngrant program. Any funds appropriated over a trigger level of funding--\n$35 million-- would require an increased state match of two new dollars \nfor every federal dollar. However, states would gain new flexibility to \nuse these funds for activities such as increasing grant amounts or \ncarrying out academic or merit scholarship programs, community service \nprograms, early intervention, mentorship, and career education \nprograms, secondary to postsecondary education transition programs, or \nscholarship programs for students wishing to enter the teaching \nprofession.\n  These improvements restore the incentive nature of the program by \nattracting more state funds for student aid and providing greater \nflexibility for the use of these funds, while not disenfranchising \nstates that can only match according to the current 1-to-1 requirement.\n  The LEAP Act is supported by students, educators, and student aid \nofficials, including the National Association of State Student Grant \nand Aid Programs (NASSGAP), the National Association of Independent \nColleges and Universities (NAICU), the American Council on Education \n(ACE), the American Association of State Colleges and Universities \n(AASCU), the United States Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG), the \nUnited States Student Association (USSA), and the National Association \nof Graduate-Professional Students.\n  Mr. President, I believe we should help all our citizens achieve the \nAmerican Dream and ensure access to higher education, especially for \nhard working families whose wages have not kept up with inflation.

Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I cosponsor \nthis important piece of legislation to help the very neediest of \nindividuals obtain a college degree.\n  One of the most important goals that we can accomplish as legislators \nis to ensure that every American who is willing to work hard can go to \ncollege and have a shot at the American Dream. Yet we know that the \ncost of a college education is rising rapidly, and that can be an \ninhibitor for potential students.\n  By reauthorizing and reforming State Student Incentive Grants, the \nLEAP Act ensures that this important program continues to assist those \nstudents who otherwise may not be able to pursue higher education. \nTogether with Pell grants they make it possible for low-income students \nto reach their potential and in turn become productive contributors in \nour increasingly knowledge-based economy.\n  This legislation restores to the SSIG program its incentive nature by \ngiving states a reason to increase their investment in it. Any funds \nappropriated over $35 million would require an increased state match of \ntwo new dollars for every federal dollar. In return greater flexibility \nwill be provided for the use of these extra funds. They can be used to \nincrease grant awards or for other worthy activities such as carrying \nout academic or merit scholarship programs or career education \nprograms.\n  Nebraska has been supportive of the SSIG program and has shown that \nsupport in its willingness to overmatch the federal contribution. \nHowever, with the decrease in appropriations from $50 million for \nfiscal year 1997 to $25 million for fiscal year 1998, the state will be \nable to assist approximately 500 fewer students. Seventy-one percent of \nNebraska students who received an SSIG had a family income of $20,000 \nor less.\n  By lending further support to the SSIG program we can ensure that \nthese 500 students and thousands of students across the nation do not \nfall between the cracks.\n  Mr. President, I am cosponsoring this bill today because it \nrepresents a good bipartisan effort to increase educational \nopportunities for those in greatest need of financial assistance. I \nlook forward to moving it through Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Inhofe, \n        Mr. Nickles, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Helms, Mr. Coats, Mr. Sessions, \n        Mr. Enzi, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Santorum, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Bond, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1645. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ntaking minors across State lines to avoid laws requiring the \ninvolvement of parents in abortion decisions; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                the child custody protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM, Mr. President. I rise today to introduce legislation \nprotecting the most important relationship of all: that of parents and \ntheir children. All of us know that the family is the fundamental, \ncrucial and indispensable basis of our civilization. Without strong \nfamilies our children will grow up without role models, without a sound \nknowledge of how they ought to behave and for what they ought to \nstrive. As a consequence, the data shows quite clearly that children \ndeprived of strong family lives are more likely to suffer from \ndepression, substance abuse, crime, violence, poverty and even suicide.\n  Yet, when it comes to one of the most important decisions in life, \nMr. President, children are being kept from the guidance of their \nparents. I am talking, of course, about the decision whether or not to \nhave an abortion. The American people recognize how crucial it is for \nminor children to involve their parents in this life-changing decision. \n74 percent of Americans in a 1996 Gallup poll favored requiring minors \nto get parental consent for an abortion. People quite reasonably \nbelieve that parents should be involved in deciding whether their \ndaughter should undergo an abortion. As the Supreme Court noted in H.L. \nv. Matheson, ``the medical, emotional, and psychological consequences \nof an abortion are serious and can be lasting; this is particularly so \nwhen the patient is immature.''\n  Convinced of the soundness of this reasoning, at least 22 states have \nenacted laws requiring consent of or notification to at least one \nparent, or authorization by a judge, before a minor can obtain an \nabortion. Unfortunately, this wise policy is being undermined.\n  Thousands of children every year are taken across state lines by \npeople other than their parents to secure secret abortions. As we \nspeak, Mr. President, abortion providers are taking out large \nadvertisements in the Yellow Pages in cities like Harrisburg and \nScranton, Pennsylvania, trumpeting the fact that their clinics, across \nthe Pennsylvania state line, do not require parental notification as \nPennsylvania\n\n[[Page S752]]\n\ndoes. In essence, these abortion providers are encouraging people to \ncircumvent Pennsylvania's parental notification law by crossing the \nborder into New Jersey, New York or Maryland for a secret abortion.\n  And thousands of times every year this suggestion is taken up by non-\nrelated adults who want to circumvent the law. One example of this \nconduct made headlines recently. The case involved an 18 year old \nPennsylvania man who got his 12 year old neighbor pregnant. \nPennsylvania law requires parental consent prior to an abortion on a \nminor. To circumvent this law, Rosa Hartford, mother of the 18 year \nold, secretly took the girl to an abortion clinic in New York, a state \nwith no parental notification requirement. Her actions discovered, Mrs. \nHartford, whose son pled guilty to two counts of statutory rape, was \nconvicted of interfering with the custody of a child.\n  The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy (CLRP), a prominent \nproabortion legal defense organization, appealed Mrs. Hartford's \nconviction on the grounds that she merely ``assisted a woman to \nexercise her constitutional rights'' and as such was herself protected \nfrom prosecution by the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, this reasoning cannot stand. To say that, because the \ncourt in Roe v. Wade declared most abortions constitutionally protected \nduring the first trimester, that therefore minors have an absolute \nright to abortion without so much as notifying their parents, and that \nthird parties--whatever their motives--have the right to secretly \ntransport them across state lines for a secret abortion, is to stand \nconstitutional protections on their head. It is to strip children to \nthe natural protection of their parents.\n  For the sake of our children and our families, this must stop. We \nmust uphold the law and uphold the family tie. That is why I am \nintroducing the Child Custody Protection Act. This legislation is \nsimple and straightforward. It will make it a federal offense to \ntransport a minor across state lines with intent to avoid the \napplication of a state law requiring parental involvement in a minor's \nabortion, or judicial waiver of such a requirement.\n  Children must receive parental consent for even minor surgical \nprocedures, Mr. President. The profound, lasting physical and \npsychological effects of abortion demand that we help states guarantee \nparental involvement in the abortion decision. That means, at a \nminimum, seeing to it that outside parties cannot circumvent state \nparental notification and consent laws with impunity.\n  America is in the midst of a profound debate over the nature and \nstatus of abortion. But, even as many of us disagree over a number of \ncrucial issues, we all should be able to agree that duly enacted laws \nmust be upheld. Those who would undermine these laws in the name of \nunfettered abortion on demand damage the rule of law by subverting \nlegitimate statutes. They also undercut our Constitutional liberties by \nstretching them beyond all rational bounds and using them to sap \nparental rights and family ties.\n  We can no more afford to allow state laws to be flouted than we can \nafford to allow family ties to be further undermined. For the sake of \nour families and our rule of law, I urge my colleagues to defend both \nby supporting the Child Custody Protection Act.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise as a cosponsor of the Child \nCustody Protection Act sponsored by my colleague, Senator Spencer \nAbraham, to whom I am grateful for introducing this important \nlegislation. The purpose of this legislation is to make it a crime to \ntransport a child across state lines if this circumvents state law \nrequiring parental involvement or a judicial waiver for a minor to \nobtain an abortion.\n  In a well-publicized case in Pennsylvania, a 12-year-old girl became \npregnant after a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old man. As \nparental consent is required under Pennsylvania law before a minor can \nreceive an abortion, the man's mother took the pregnant girl to New \nYork for an abortion, where there is no such parental involvement law. \nThe baby was aborted. The girl's mother did not consent to her daughter \nhaving an abortion; in fact, she did not even know her daughter was \npregnant. Unfortunately, parents and guardians have no clear recourse \nwhen another adult circumvents the law of the state where the parent \nand child live by transporting a child to another state.\n  Twenty-two states have laws that require either notification or \nconsent of a parent before a minor child receives an abortion. \nCurrently, in my State of Ohio, a parent or guardian must be notified \nbefore a child receives an abortion. However, the State Legislature has \nrecently passed a law requiring both parental consent and a face-to-\nface meeting with the doctor performing the abortion at least twenty-\nfour hours before the procedure. Clearly, the citizens of Ohio have a \ncompelling interest in making sure that parents are involved in a \nminor's decision to have an abortion, and that women have a full \nopportunity to consider the medical implications of their decision to \nabort an unborn child.\n  The right of citizens to pass and enforce laws regarding the rights \nof parents is completely abrogated by the ability of strangers to \nsurreptitiously transport children to another state to obtain a \nsurgical or drug-induced abortion. By introducing this bill, we are \nsending a clear message that Roe v. Wade does not confer a ``right'' on \nstrangers to take one's minor daughter across state lines to obtain an \nabortion when the involvement of a parent or a court is required. In \nH.L. v. Matheson, the Supreme Court correctly stated, ``the medical, \nemotional, and psychological consequences of an abortion are serious \nand can be lasting; this is particularly so when the patient is \nimmature.''\n  In my view that strangers should be barred from circumventing the \nrights of parents to be involved in life and death decisions faced by \ntheir children. I believe the vast majority of Americans will never \nwant to relegate the well-being of our children to a situation where \nlife-altering decisions are made without the guidance and support of \ncaring parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Bumpers):\n  S. 1646. A bill to repeal a provision of law preventing donation by \nthe Secretary of the Navy of the two remaining Iowa-class battleships \nlisted on the Naval Vessel Register and related requirements; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                THE HISTORIC BATTLESHIP PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nrepeal a 1996 law that requires the Navy to maintain two antiquated \nbattleships in its reserves, even though they will never again see even \none more day of battle. This provision requires the Navy to maintain \ntwo Iowa-class battleships as mobilization assets, even though the Navy \nwill never again rely on them to protect American interests.\n  The Iowa-class battleships were commissioned during World War II. \nThey were built at the request of President Franklin Roosevelt to be \nthe American Navy's fastest battleship, and their 16-inch guns were \ndesigned to pummel our adversaries' shores. There is no doubt that \nthese battleships are of significant historical importance to the \nAmerican military heritage. They represent America's pride in its Navy. \nThey symbolize our admiration for those who worked so hard to build and \nserve aboard our battleships.\n  In 1995, the Navy determined that all four of the World War II era \nIowa-class battleships in its arsenal--the USS Iowa, USS New Jersey, \nUSS Missouri, and USS Wisconsin--were no longer essential to our \nnational defense. Subsequently, the Navy struck these four ships from \nthe Naval Vessel Register. The laws governing the disposal of ships \nstricken from the Register allow the Navy to donate these ships to \nstates, local communities, and non-profits for display as memorials and \nmuseums. Thus, in 1995, the Navy was set to begin the process of \ndonating all four ships.\n  But the Senate Armed Services Committee disagreed with the Navy's \ndecision to release these ships, the Committee included a provision in \nthe fiscal year 1996 Defense Authorization Act mandating that the Navy \nmaintain at least two of the Iowa-class battleships on the Naval Vessel \nRegister. The Navy subsequently chose the USS New Jersey and the USS \nWisconsin to comply\n\n[[Page S753]]\n\nwith this provision. The bill I am introducing today would repeal this \nrequirement, enabling the Navy to once again strike these ships from \nthe Register and make them available for donation to interested \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I hope the members of this distinguished body will \napprove my proposal to repeal this law. It makes sense from a national \ndefense perspective. Navy Secretary Dalton has said that the Navy has \nno plans to reactivate these ships. In a recent letter to the \nAppropriations Committee, he wrote, ``the Navy does not intend to \nreturn the ships to service. . .'' They will never again fire their 16-\ninch guns to support an amphibious landing or operation ashore. They \nwill never again serve as a platform for surface fire-support. Instead, \nthey will only continue to sit, mothballed at Naval ports, awaiting a \ncall to duty that they will never hear.\n  This bill also makes sense from a fiscal perspective. According to \nNavy estimates, the cost of maintaining these ships is approximately \n$200,000 per ship per year. To date, the Navy has already spent close \nto $1 million to mothball ships that will never again be reactivated \nfor purposes of national defense. I see no sense in the federal \ngovernment's paying for the Navy to keep ships ready for a war in which \nit will never call them to serve. The American taxpayer deserves a \nbetter deal.\n  Although these ships have been deactivated for good, they can still \ncontinue to be of immense public benefit. On the eve of the twenty-\nfirst century, many of our nation's waterfront cities are struggling to \nresurrect their economies. The federal government spends millions each \nyear on projects to help revitalize blighted waterfront communities. \nSince the laws governing the disposal of former Navy assets allow their \ndonation, we are presented with a unique opportunity to contribute to \nthe economic development of our cities--at no further cost to the \nfederal government. Many of our communities want to compete to berth a \nship on their shores, as a museum and memorial, to anchor a waterfront \ndevelopment project. But the 1996 law is depriving these communities of \na chance to undergo major revitalization efforts.\n  The citizens of New Jersey recognized the economic development \npotential of these battleships many years ago. My constituents have \nbeen preparing for the return of the USS New Jersey as the only Iowa-\nclass battleship which may be berthed as an educational museum and \nmemorial in her namesake state. Tens of thousands of volunteers have \ndevoted countless hours to this long-standing, state-wide project. The \nNew Jersey legislature created the Battleship New Jersey Commission, \nwhich has undertaken an ambitious fundraising effort to obtain the USS \nNew Jersey. To date, the Commission has secured approximately $3 \nmillion for this effort through sales of a ``Battleship New Jersey'' \nlicense plate, a state income tax check-off, and private donations. But \nNew Jersey's efforts are hamstrung by the 1996 law requiring the Navy \nto maintain the Iowa-class battleships on the Naval Vessel Register.\n  Repealing this law will have a three-fold public benefit. First and \nmost obvious, we will no longer need to provide funding in our defense \nbudget for ships that will never be reactivated. This alone warrants \nthe support of my proposal. Second, we will contribute to the economic \ndevelopment of our cities at no further cost to the federal government. \nAnd third, we will enable generations of Americans to honor the history \nof our battleships by facilitating their display as memorials and \nmuseums.\n  Forcing the Navy to keep the Iowa-class battleships ready for war is \nthe equivalent of forcing NASA to keep the Apollo rockets ready to \nblast off into space. As we all know, the Apollo project was undertaken \nto send Americans to the moon. Will we ever want to send an American to \nthe moon again? Probably--but not in an Apollo rocket. Even though \nadvances in technology have rendered the Apollos relics of the American \ndetermination to succeed, their preservation at locations throughout \nthe country allows the public to admire and appreciate their legacy. \nAnd NASA doesn't have to keep paying for them.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with the members of the \nArmed Services Committee to pass this bill. It is good for the American \ntaxpayers and our national defense, and I hope my colleagues will join \nme in this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1646\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Historic Battleship \n     Preservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF REQUIREMENT FOR CONTINUED LISTING OF TWO \n                   IOWA-CLASS BATTLESHIPS ON THE NAVAL VESSEL \n                   REGISTER.\n\n       Section 1011 of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 1996 (Public Law 104-106; 110 Stat. 421) is \n     repealed.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Lautenberg \nin introducing legislation that will make the dream of bringing the \nbattleship U.S.S. New Jersey home to New Jersey a reality. I want to \nthank Senator Lautenberg for his hard work and commitment to this \nissue, and look forward to working with him to ensure that this symbol \nof freedom returns to her namesake-state in the near future.\n  The U.S.S. New Jersey is one of the most notable battleships in the \nNavy's history. She has been protecting and defending democracy since \nWorld War II in almost every region of the world. Launched on December \n7, 1942, one year after the infamous attack on Pearl Harbor, the ship \nproceeded to the Pacific where she was involved in many historic \ncampaigns, including the battles for the Marshalls, Marianas, \nPhilippines, Iwo Jimo and Okinawa. A particular highlight of the New \nJersey's career was service as flagship for Commander Third Fleet, \nAdmiral ``Bull'' Halsey, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October \n1944.\n  Once the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the New Jersey settled into a \npeacetime routine, and was decommissioned in 1948. The ship was \nrecommissioned in 1950 for the Korean war, in 1968 for Vietnam, and \nagain in 1982 when former President Reagan ordered the re-activation of \nall four Iowa-class battleships as part of a massive naval buildup. In \nFebruary 1991, because of end to the Cold War, another victory which \nshe helped to secure, the New Jersey was decommissioned for a final \ntime and is now in Bremerton, Washington.\n  Following the removal of the U.S.S. New Jersey from the Naval Vessel \nRegister, the New Jersey legislature created the Battleship New Jersey \nCommission, which applied for donation of the ship to the State of New \nJersey. The Commission, and tens of thousands of volunteers, have \nundertaken a massive fundraising effort to pay for the costs of \ntransporting the U.S.S. New Jersey home, and have already secured \napproximately $3 million for this effort. Together with the people of \nour state, the Commission has been actively preparing for the return of \nthe U.S.S. New Jersey as the only Iowa-class battleship which may be \nberthed as an educational museum and memorial in her namesake state.\n  None of this hard work and sacrifice will make a difference though, \nwithout the repeal of Section 1011 of the fiscal year 1996 Defense \nAuthorization Act, which requires the Navy to maintain at least two of \nthe Iowa-class battleships that have been stricken from the Naval \nVessel Register. This provision was included to ensure that the Navy \nwould have the necessary firepower to support Marine Corps' amphibious \nassaults and operations ashore. In accordance with this requirement, \nthe Navy is currently maintaining the U.S.S. New Jersey and the U.S.S. \nWisconsin and neither ship is available for distribution to the states.\n  However, the Navy does not want nor do they need these ships. It is \nmy understanding that the Navy can effectively support the Marines \nthrough the use of other platforms, and does not require the U.S.S. New \nJersey for this important task. Secretary Dalton has said that the Navy \nhas no plans to reactivate these proud ships, and is forced to spend \n$200,000 per ship, per year to mothball ships that will never again be \nreactivated for the purposes of national defense.\n  Senator Lautenberg and I have also sent letters to Secretary Dalton \nand\n\n[[Page S754]]\n\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee regarding this matter, but have \ndecided that the most effective way to proceed is with a legislative \nremedy. Our bill would eliminate Section 1011, and remove one of the \nlast obstacles preventing the U.S.S. New Jersey from making the long \njourney home to our state.\n  During New Jersey's final decommissioning ceremony, her last \ncommanding officer, Captain Robert C. Peniston remarked, ``Rest well, \nyet sleep lightly; and hear the call if again sounded, to provide \nfirepower for freedom.'' It is only just that the U.S.S. New Jersey \nrest well in the welcome waters off the coast of her namesake state, \nand enjoy the company of the people that she fought so hard to protect \nthroughout her time in the active duty fleet.\n  America is profoundly thankful for the service of the U.S.S. New \nJersey and the patriotism of the courageous men and women who served \naboard her. For the reasons I stand today to recognize the Battleship \nNew Jersey Commission, and the generations of Americans who went to war \nwith the U.S.S. New Jersey. I am proud to offer this legislation with \nSenator Lautenberg.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Kempthorne, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Ms. Collins, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Kennedy) (by request):\n  S. 1647.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nreauthorize programs within the Economic Development Administration. It \nis with great pleasure that I am joined by my colleagues, Senators \nSnowe, Lieberman, Kempthorne, Daschle, Dodd, Durbin, Lautenberg, \nCollins, Johnson, and Kennedy.\n  Mr. President, programs under the jurisdiction of the Economic \nDevelopment Administration have not been reauthorized for almost two \ndecades. Despite the uncertainty and instability this has created, EDA \nhas become the cornerstone for efforts to strengthen and diversify the \neconomies of our nation's communities.\n  Since its inception in 1965, the EDA has established an impressive \ntrack record of helping communities help themselves. These \n``bootstrap'' efforts have allowed communities to meet economic \nchallenges in a variety of ways--making public works improvements to \nattract new businesses and providing technical assistance and planning \ngrants that allow a community to plan for their future for example.\n  In my home state of Montana, EDA has been a powerful force in \nresponding to the changing economic conditions in communities that have \nrelied on one industry--only to see that industry shut down and move \naway. EDA's planning and public works assistance has allowed these \ncommunities to attract new companies, retain companies already in place \nand diversify their economies.\n  EDA has also been instrumental in responding to and assisting areas \naffected by natural disasters. In Florida and Louisiana, EDA was there \nto help businesses affected by the devastation of Hurricane Andrew. And \nEDA is still working with those areas of the Midwest devastated by the \ndisastrous floods of 1993 and those areas recently impacted by floods \nin the Pacific Northwest.\n  The programs within the EDA have become even more critical to \nCongress' efforts to alleviate and address job losses due to the \nclosure and realignment of military bases around the country.\n  The EDA's programs are effective tools that are used on the local \nlevel--working hand-in-hand with local governments and businesses to \ndevelop future economic investment strategies. By acting as a catalyst, \neconomic development funds are used to attract significant private \ncontributions and support.\n  Despite efforts to dismantle the EDA, the agency has matured in its \napproach to local economic development efforts. But the lack of \nauthorization has not allowed Congress to make necessary changes to the \nstatute and mission of the EDA. As with any program, there are some \nareas that are working well and other areas that need to be refined. \nThe lack of authorization has left some aspects of EDA's programs \noutdated or unnecessary. That is why I am introducing this bill today--\na bill to streamline and advance EDA's successful programs.\n  Mr. President, our country is faced with many challenges. Many of our \ncommunities are in economic transition and need to strengthen the \ndiversity of their economies. We need to reauthorize EDA. It is high \ntime we recognize the important role that EDA plays in the future of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Congressional Record, along with a brief section-by-\nsection.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1647\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Authorization of appropriations\n       Authorizes $343,028,000 for fiscal year 1998 and such sums \n     as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 1999 through \n     2002, such sums to remain available until expended.\n     Sec. 702. Defense conversion activities\n       In addition to the appropriations authorized by section \n     701, authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this Act such \n     sums as may be necessary to provide assistance for defense \n     conversion activities.\n     Sec. 703. Disaster economic recovery activities\n       In addition to the appropriations authorized by section \n     701, authorizes to be appropriated to carry out this Act such \n     sums as may be necessary to provide assistance for disaster \n     economic recovery activities.\n     Section 3. Savings provisions\n       Provides that existing rights, duties and obligations, and \n     pending suits, are not to be affected by this Act, and that \n     revolving fund established under section 203 of PWEDA is to \n     continue to be available as a liquidating account.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my distinguished \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Max Baucus, to introduce the ``Economic \nDevelopment Partnership Act of 1998''--a bill to reauthorize the \nEconomic Development Administration in the Department of Commerce. I \nwould first like to thank the ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works, Senator Baucus, for his ongoing \ncommitment to this vital agency, and would also like to thank the \nbipartisan group of Senators who have joined us in sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I have long been a supporter of the EDA because--\nalthough it is a small agency--its programs contribute significantly to \neconomic growth and job expansion. With only a modest annual \nappropriation and a national staff of 258 dedicated public servants, \nthe EDA successfully assists communities across the nation who have \nexperienced economic distress. Economic distress that is not only \ngenerated by economic downturns, but also by natural disasters--such as \nstorms and earthquakes--and un-natural disasters, such as military base \nclosings.\n  I am also pleased that, at a time when Congress is exercising much \nneeded fiscal discipline and performance-based budgeting is being \ndemanded from all agencies, the EDA has maintained its commitment to \nproviding a good return on the public dollar. Specifically, recent \nstudies of EDA's programs were performed by a consortia of \norganizations including Rutgers University, the New Jersey Institute of \nTechnology, Columbia University, Princeton University, the National \nAssociation of Regional Councils, and the University of Cincinnati. The \nresults of these studies were impressive, and clearly showed the value \nand results of EDA investments in public works and defense conversion \nactivities. Specifically, for every every $1 million that EDA invests \nin public works projects, 327 jobs are created or retained at a cost of \n$3,058 per job; 15 construction jobs are created; $10 million in \nprivate sector dollars are leveraged; and $10.13 million is added to \nthe local tax base. Based on these statistics, I believe it's safe to \nsay that EDA delivers a substantial ``bang for the buck''!\n  Even as these statistics speak to the value of EDA programs \nnationally, I am pleased that the people of Maine don't need to hear \nwhat is happening in other states to be convinced of the value of EDA--\nthey already know what this agency has meant to their towns and \ncommunities. Over the past 32 years, the EDA has invested more than \n$198 million in 606 projects across the state. Through public works, \ntechnical assistance, planning, community investments, and revolving \nloan fund programs, the EDA has established local partnerships in Maine \nthat have provided critical infrastructure development and other \neconomic incentives that have stimulated local growth, created jobs, \nand generated revenue.\n  Not only has the EDA invested in many economic development projects \nin Maine, but I can also personally attest to the value and importance \nof\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\nthese projects because I have seen the results that they deliver. For \nexample, as a result of EDA assistance in 1996, dormitories at the \nMaine School of Science and Mathematics--a magnet school built at \nformer Loring Air Force Base--were built to house the school's \nstudents. And in 1995, EDA assistance in Freeport, Maine prevented a \nmajor health maintenance organization from relocating to another state. \nThat project alone not only saved 99 jobs, but also created an \nadditional 127 in the community.\n  Mr. President, I cite these success stories not only to credit the \nagency for a job well done in my state, but to demonstrate to my \ncolleagues the types of assistance that have likely been provided to \ntheir states as well. If my colleagues would review the cases of \neconomic distress that have occurred in their own states, I believe \nthey will find their own success stories that speak to the value of EDA \nto their constituents.\n  Therefore, I would urge that my colleagues support the bill that \nSenator Baucus and I are introducing today because it would reauthorize \nthe beneficial and critically-needed programs that have led to these \nsuccess stories for an additional five years. Perhaps most importantly, \nit will keep the agency's successful programs intact, while \nincorporating ideas and concepts for improvement that have received \nincreased attention and support in the Congress. For instance, many of \nmy colleagues would agree that to be truly successful, government \nprograms should proceed in partnership with local governments--and this \nlegislation will do just that by preserving the integrity of the \nagency's traditional programs, while expanding and modifying them to \nencompass the partnership concept.\n  The bill also contains new language that reflects some of the \nactivities that the agency has become more involved in over the past \nfew years, such as defense conversion and disaster assistance. From \nMaine's perspective, these programs could not be buttressed soon enough \nfollowing the closing of Loring Air Force base in 1994, and the ice \nstorms that ravaged the state just weeks ago.\n  In addition, there are other provisions in this legislation that will \nbring meaningful, positive changes to EDA's programs by increasing \nprogram flexibility and heightening accountability. Ultimately, it is \nthese types of changes that will not only update an Act that has been \nin need of reauthorization, but will also prepare this agency for the \neconomic needs and demands of our nation as we approach a new century.\n  Mr. President, the Economic Development Administration is a key \nfederal agency that promotes economic growth and development, and the \nlegislation we are offering today will ensure that these improved \nprograms will be available for the next five years. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this critically needed legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join as a sponsor of \nthe Economic Development Partnership Act of 1998, which will \nreauthorize and extend the important work of the Economic Development \nAdministration in the Department of Commerce.\n  The Economic Development Administration was established in 1965 to \nprovide grants to help hard-pressed communities in all parts of the \ncountry to deal more effectively with conditions of persistent \nunemployment in economically distressed areas.\n  Over the past thirty years, EDA has helped generate new jobs, retain \nexisting jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in \neconomically distressed areas across the country. By making assistance \navailable to areas suffering high unemployment, low-income levels, or \nsudden and severe economic emergencies, EDA provides local governments \nwith the resources to revitalize their communities, create jobs, and \nplan for long-term growth.\n  In fulfilling its mission, EDA is guided by the basic principle that \ndistressed communities must be encouraged to plan and implement their \nown economic development and revitalization strategies.\n  I commend Senator Baucus and the Clinton Administration for their \nleadership on this important legislation, and I look forward to its \nenactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1648. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Food, \nDrug and Cosmetic Act to provide for reductions in youth smoking, for \nadvancements in tobacco-related research, and the development of safer \ntobacco products, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n               preventing addiction of smoking teens act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith one principal aim: to put an end to teenage smoking. I am honored \nto be joined by two other distinguished members of the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources, Senator Collins, and Senator Enzi.\n\n  By now, we are all familiar with the grim statistics that tell the \nstory of youth smoking in our country--the thousands of children that \nexperiment with tobacco, the thousands that become addicted, and the \nthousands who will die prematurely as a result.\n  For too long, the federal government has been of little assistance in \ncombating the number one preventable disease in this country. Apart \nfrom the efforts of Surgeons General from Luther Terry to C. Everett \nKoop, and sporadic efforts by Congress, the federal government has \nbarely acknowledged there's a problem.\n  The states, especially my home state of Vermont, have been leaders in \nthe effort to end teenage smoking. And last summer, the proposed \nsettlement by the Attorneys General ignited a whole new debate on this \nissue by providing us with a template for action.\n  Eight months later, it is easy for us to minimize that \naccomplishment, but by any fair appraisal the settlement was a \ntremendously important step.\n  When the tobacco settlement was announced, some people thought it \nmight be only a few months before it would be ratified by Congress. \nToday, people wonder whether it can be revived by Congress.\n  I am confident that we can and will reach agreement on a national \ntobacco policy. But I am just as certain that we'll never do so if we \npursue a partisan approach.\n  Since the settlement, the Committee on Labor and Human Resources has \nheld four hearings on this subject, and across Capitol Hill dozens of \nhearings have been held by other committees of jurisdiction.\n  Today we take the next important step in this process, by introducing \nlegislation that I hope will serve as the basis for a broad, bipartisan \napproach to the three basic public health issues of a national tobacco \npolicy: prevention, safer products, and cessation.\n  If we can achieve a national tobacco policy, it could be the biggest \npublic health breakthrough ever achieved outside a lab.\n  The settlement has been criticized as being too weak by some, too \nambitious by others. I agree the settlement has flaws.\n  But I think we must never lose sight of the ultimate goal--what is \nthe best public health approach that we can enact to reduce teen \nsmoking?\n  I am less concerned about exacting the last measure of revenge for \nthe past actions of the tobacco companies than I am about ensuring the \nfuture of the children who become addicted every day. We need to keep \nour priorities straight.\n  It will take a broad, bipartisan consensus to pass tobacco \nlegislation. Right now, that consensus seems entirely absent and is in \ndanger of slipping into partisan grand standing over who loves kids and \nhates tobacco.\n  That consensus can only come through compromise. There will be many \nopportunities to derail legislation of this magnitude if it is only \nsupported by a slim majority. If we expect enactment, we must forge \nbroad agreement in the Congress.\n  The legislation we introduce today, called the Preventing Addiction \nto Smoking Among Teens, or PAST Act, will enact and improve upon the \npublic health provisions of the tobacco settlement. It is not designed \nto solve every question before us, rather, it addresses the public \nhealth issues that are before the Labor Committee.\n  It is no longer feasible for tobacco to escape the same type of \nregulation we require for foods and medicines. Our bill will give the \nFood and Drug Administration every bit of authority it needs to \nregulate tobacco products and their components. The tobacco industry \nwill have to turn over all of its\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\nhealth documents to the FDA. FDA will be able to reduce or eliminate \nharmful ingredients or require safer technological improvements through \ninformal rulemaking to achieve overall public health benefits.\n  Of course, we will not achieve the public health benefits we seek \nfrom mandating safer products if the resulting products are \nunacceptable to consumers who can't quit smoking. Part of the process \nfor setting these standards will be consideration of just this \nquestion.\n  We encourage the development of safer products subject to the same \ntype of scientific review for other FDA regulated products. And FDA can \npropose, after ten years, the outright prohibition of cigarettes or \nsmokeless tobacco products.\n  But our bill will not permit FDA to ban cigarettes or smokeless \ntobacco for adult usage on its own. That decision, in my opinion, is \none that should be made by Congress, not a single government agency.\n  Our bill adopts a comprehensive approach to preventing teens from \nsmoking, and helping people to quit who are already hooked. And \nfinally, our bill will provide for a coordinated regime to research the \nmany unanswered questions about tobacco, its effects on us, and how to \nmitigate those effects.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of our bill be included at the \nend of my remarks.\n  Next week, Senator Gregg and I will hold a hearing in New Hampshire \nto listen to state and local concerns on tobacco issues within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. And \nin a month, I hope to have found bipartisan support for my bill and to \nhave moved it through the committee.\n  Finally, I want to note that many of my colleagues are also working \non legislation to help move the discussion forward, and there are many \ngood ideas that deserve consideration. In particular, I look forward to \nworking with Senator Enzi on his proposal to establish a fund supported \nby tobacco industry resources. This fund would be a sustainable way to \nprovide compensation for treating tobacco-related diseases, and could \nalso be used to pay for some of the prevention proposals I have \noutlined in my bill\n  Even though we have much work to do before we decide the overall \narchitecture of tobacco policy, it is not at all too soon to begin \npouring the foundation. As in New England, we have a short building \nseason. If we are to clear the committees, combine our approaches, \nclear the floor and conference, we must act now. I urge my colleagues \nto give me their support, and greatly appreciate those who have already \ndone so.\n  We need to make teen smoking a thing of the past.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill summary was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n  The Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens (PAST) Act--Overview\n\n\n                                Problem\n\n       Smoking is the single most preventable cause of death in \n     the United States.\n       Smoking-related diseases kill 400,000 Americans each year.\n       82% of adult smokers began smoking when they were \n     teenager--people generally do not start smoking past the teen \n     years, making it imperative to prevent smoking among teens.\n       But the trend is going in the wrong direction: more kids \n     are smoking; 6,000 kids a day try a cigarette, and 3,000 of \n     those will become addicted; every day, 1,000 kids who start \n     smoking will eventually die prematurely due to smoking.\n\n\n                              The PAST Act\n\n       Across the board, the provisions of the PAST Act are \n     tougher than those approved by the Attorneys General and \n     plaintiffs' attorneys in the June 20, 1997 proposed tobacco \n     settlement. The PAST Act:\n       Is a comprehensive public health approach to reduce youth \n     smoking, help people who want to quit, bring safer products \n     to the market, and provide for the research we need to \n     improve our understanding of addiction and how to prevent it.\n       Requires that tobacco settlement funds be used for tobacco-\n     related initiatives.\n       Provides for: Straightforward and effective authority for \n     FDA to regulate tobacco products; tough and enforceable \n     restrictions on youth access to tobacco products; evidence-\n     based prevention and cessation programs; research that will \n     help us understand why certain people become addicted to \n     tobacco products and provide science-based methods to prevent \n     addiction.\n\n\n                           Summary of the Act\n\n     1. Regulation of Tobacco Products and Tobacco Product \n         Development\n       Purpose: To provide strong and effective Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) regulatory authority over cigarettes, \n     smokeless tobacco products, and safer tobacco products.\n       Summary: No longer will the tobacco companies be exempt \n     from the type of regulation which ensures that our foods and \n     medicines are safe and properly labeled.\n       The PAST Act gives FDA regulatory authority to:\n       Oversee the manufacturing processes of tobacco products;\n       require elimination of tobacco product additives and \n     reductions in nicotine;\n       quickly and easily promulgate performance standards to \n     ensure that new and safer technology reaches consumers with \n     truthful information on health issues related to products;\n       regulate the content of product labels and advertising;\n       require tobacco companies to divulge all health-related \n     research on tobacco products and ingredients;\n       set national rules for product regulation while preserving \n     important state and local authorities to require tougher \n     requirements for youth access rules and point-of-sale \n     advertising;\n       periodically assess and improve the effectiveness of \n     tobacco product warning labels.\n       The PAST Act bans billboard advertising of tobacco \n     products, cartoon figure and human figures (like Joe Camel \n     and the Marlboro Man) and restricts in-store marketing.\n       The PAST Act does not preempt the ability of state or \n     localities to pass stricter laws on sale to minors or point-\n     of-sale advertising.\n       1. FDA Authority to Approve Reduced Risk Tobacco Products \n     and Require Reductions in Nicotine and Elimination of Tobacco \n     Product Hazards.\n       50 million Americans smoke. For those who can't quit as \n     soon as they'd like, we must both provide them with less \n     harmful alternatives to today's tobacco products and take \n     steps immediately to reduce the danger in existing tobacco \n     products. The PAST Act establishes science and public health-\n     based decision making at FDA to achieve these goals.\n       The PAST Act includes a program designed to encourage \n     tobacco companies to develop and market reduced risk tobacco \n     products. FDA authority over reduced risk tobacco products \n     requires that FDA approve specific ``reduced risk'' claims \n     manufacturers make. In addition, manufacturers must notify \n     FDA of any reduced risk technology they develop or acquire.\n       FDA is to require tobacco companies to conduct the same \n     type of high quality scientific studies expected of drug and \n     device companies to demonstrate that a new tobacco product \n     carries a ``reduced risk.'' FDA will take into account the \n     effect of the product on overall public health concerns \n     including whether fewer people will quit smoking as a result \n     of its availability. FDA will require both short-term and \n     long-term studies to ensure that the products have a positive \n     public health effect. FDA can revoke the approval to market \n     the product if the studies do not support the health claims \n     or if the studies are not completed in a timely manner.\n       In addition, if FDA determines that a particular reduced \n     risk technology is less hazardous it may: require disclosure \n     of the safer technology; prohibit the use of technology that \n     is superseded by the new technology, or; require that \n     manufacturers stop selling tobacco products that do not \n     incorporate such technology.\n       In addition to reviewing reduced risk products, FDA has \n     authority to mandate the elimination of hazardous components \n     of tobacco products and reduce nicotine levels to achieve \n     overall public health benefits. Before requiring changes to \n     tobacco products, FDA will employ a notice and comment \n     rulemaking proces--the same as that used for drugs and \n     devices. FDA is not! required to prove that a black market \n     will not result.\n       2. FDA Authority to Regulate Product Labels, Warnings, \n     Advertising, and Marketing.\n       The PAST Act will enact: new warning labels, and the \n     flexibility for the Secretary to change the labels; \n     restrictions on labeling and advertising of tobacco products; \n     restrictions on advertising in non-adult media and \n     glamorization of tobacco; bans on non-tobacco items and event \n     sponsorship.\n       The PAST Act does not prevent states and localities from \n     enacting tougher laws on youth access and point-of-sale \n     cigarette advertising and marketing.\n     II. National Efforts to Reduce Youth Smoking\n       Purpose: To provide all the essential ingredients for \n     comprehensive and effective programs to reduce youth smoking.\n       Summary: The PAST Act sets high but achievable goals to \n     reduce youth smoking. To ensure that the tobacco \n     manufacturers partner with communities to achieve these \n     goals, the PAST Act exacts tough penalties on the industry if \n     goals are not met. Further, unlike the June 20 proposed \n     tobacco settlement, and some other bills that have been \n     introduced, the PAST Act does not permit the penalties to be \n     capped, and it ensures that the penalties are calculated \n     accurately.\n       The PAST Act entrusts the states with the necessary \n     resources from the Tobacco Settlement Trust Fund for local \n     anti-tobacco\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\n     programs that will effectively: restrict the sale of tobacco \n     products to minors; prevent youth smoking; assure that people \n     who want to quit smoking can get proven cessation treatment.\n       The PAST Act gives the Office on Smoking and Health of \n     Centers for Disease Control the resources to provide \n     oversight and technical help to state and local authorities, \n     thus guaranteeing that the latest and most effective \n     strategies to prevent and stop smoking can be employed.\n       The PAST Act provides funds for research to help us \n     understand addiction to tobacco products, and to ensure that \n     the results of this research are swiftly incorporated into \n     community-based programs.\n       The PAST Act establishes an innovative and far-reaching \n     national public health promotion and health education \n     campaign on the dangers of smoking.\n       1. Required Reduction in Underage Use of Tobacco Products.\n       Purpose: To promote an immediate reduction in the number of \n     underage consumers of tobacco products by imposing financial \n     surcharges dramatically stiffer than the June 20 proposed \n     tobacco settlement on participating manufacturers if underage \n     tobacco-use reduction targets are not met.\n       If the targets are not met, surcharges will be imposed on \n     manufacturers, and for each 5 percentage points short of the \n     target, the surcharge on manufacturers increases \n     substantially.\n       Cigarettes: for the first 5 percentage points for which the \n     rate of youth smoking falls short of the target: the product \n     of $80,000,000 and the number of applicable percentage \n     points; for 6 to 10 percentage points short of the goal: the \n     product of $400,000,000 and the number of applicable \n     percentage points; for 11 or more percentage points short of \n     the goal: the product of $500,000,000 and the number of \n     applicable percentage points.\n       Smokeless Tobacco Products: for the first 5 percentage \n     points for which the rate of youth smokeless tobacco use \n     falls short of the target: the product of $15,000,000 and the \n     number of applicable percentage points; for 6 to 10 \n     percentage points short of the goal: the product of \n     $30,000,000 and the number of applicable percentage points; \n     for 11 or more percentage points short of the goal: the \n     product of $45,000,000 and the number of applicable \n     percentage points.\n       Targets for reduction of tobacco product use in individuals \n     under 18:\n       Cigarettes: 30 percent in the fifth and sixth years; 50 \n     percent in the seventh, eighth and ninth years; 60 percent in \n     the tenth and subsequent years.\n       Smokeless tobacco: 25 percent in the fifth and sixth years; \n     35 percent in the seventh, eighth and ninth years; 45 percent \n     in the tenth and subsequent years.\n       2. Restrictions on Access to Tobacco Products.\n       Purpose: To ensure that strict state laws are passed and \n     enforced that will prohibit the sale and distribution of \n     tobacco products to minors, and to provide civil penalties to \n     minors who purchase or smoke tobacco products.\n       State laws must include the following provisions, and may \n     include stricter provisions:\n       At least 90% of minors attempts to purchase must be \n     unsuccessful; requirement of a state or local license to sell \n     tobacco products; a prohibition on sale of cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco to individuals under 18 years of age; the \n     following requirements for distribution:\n       The licensee must verify age through a government issued \n     photo identification; no verification is required for any \n     individual who is at least 27 years of age; no direct access \n     to tobacco products; face-to-face exchange for purchase; no \n     out-of-package sale of tobacco products; no special marketing \n     rules for adult only stores; minors may not purchase or \n     consume tobacco products. States may enforce this provision \n     through civil penalties, including a written warning, a \n     possible fine of up to $150 for repeated offenses, or other \n     civil penalties determined appropriate by the state.\n       3. State and Community Action Programs.\n       Purpose: To promote the development of state and community \n     action programs designed to educate the public on addiction \n     and the hazards of tobacco use, and to promote prevention and \n     cessation of the use of tobacco products.\n       Funds will be available to each state from the Tobacco \n     Settlement Trust Fund after approval of a state plan. Funding \n     increases from $145,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1999 \n     and 2000 to $440,000,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n       State and local initiatives may include: evidence-based \n     programs to prevent tobacco use and promote cessation; health \n     education and promotion efforts relating to tobacco use; \n     public policy initiatives to prevent tobacco use and promote \n     cessation; evidence-based programs in schools to prevent and \n     reduce tobacco use and addiction.\n       4. Tobacco Use Cessation Programs.\n       Purpose: to help addicted individuals who want to quit.\n       Funding allocated to the states from the Tobacco Settlement \n     Trust Fund: $1,000,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 1999 \n     through 2002; $1,500,000,000 for each of the fiscal years \n     2003 through 2008.\n       Programs to be funded may include: evidence-based programs \n     designed to assist individuals to stop their use of tobacco \n     products; training for health care providers in cessation \n     intervention methods; efforts to encourage health plans and \n     insurers to provide coverage for evidence-based tobacco use \n     cessation treatment.\n       5. Research Initiatives to Prevent Tobacco Addiction.\n       Purpose: To promote tobacco-related research strategies.\n       The Institute of Medicine will perform an independent study \n     to provide recommendations for tobacco-related research. \n     Tobacco-related research at CDC, NIH, and AHCPR will include \n     investigation of: surveillance and epidemiology of tobacco \n     use; prevention of tobacco use; the science of addiction; \n     cessation strategies.\n       An interagency council will ensure that: the research \n     strategy is implemented, and that it is modified to take into \n     account new findings; new developments are disseminated to \n     states and communities.\n       6. National Public Health Education Campaign.\n       Purpose: To provide for a national public health promotion \n     and health education campaign designed to reduce the use of \n     tobacco products.\n     III. Standards to Reduce Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco \n         Smoke\n       The PAST Act will require OSHA to promulgate within 12 \n     months a final rule relating to indoor air quality in \n     industrial and nonindustrial indoor and enclosed work \n     environments.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Jeffords and Enzi in introducing the Preventing Addiction to \nSmoking Among Teens Act.\n  Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States, \naccounting for more than 400,000 deaths a year and more than $50 \nbillion in health care costs. Clearly the single most effective thing \nwe can do to improve our Nation's health and control health care costs \nis to stop smoking.\n  While recent headlines detailing the settlement of multimillion \ndollar lawsuits against the tobacco industry might delude us into \nthinking that we are winning the war against tobacco, the facts tell a \nfar different story. Despite extensive public health campaigns linking \nsmoking to heart disease and cancer, smoking rates are actually going \nup, particularly among our young people. Tragically, addiction is \nincreasingly a ``teen-onset'' disease: in fact, Mr. President, 90 \npercent of all smokers began smoking before age 21,\n  What is particularly alarming is that children, especially girls, are \nsmoking at younger and younger ages. Smoking is at a 19-year high among \nhigh school seniors and has increased over 35 percent among eighth \ngraders and 43 percent among tenth graders over the last 7 years.\n  Moreover, of the 3,000 teens who enter the ranks of ``regular \nsmokers'' every day, one-third will die tobacco-related deaths. Mr. \nPresident, I am very proud of many of the accomplishments and \nachievements of my great State of Maine, but there is one area where we \ndo need to do much, much better. The sad fact is that my State of Maine \nhas the dubious distinction of having the highest smoking rate among \npeople age 18 to 34 in the entire United States. In Maine, almost 40 \npercent of high school students smoke. They purchase 1.4 million packs \nof cigarettes illegally each year. If this trend continues, more than \n31,000 young people in Maine currently under the age of 18 will die \nprematurely from tobacco-related diseases. If we are to put an end to \nthis tragic yet preventable epidemic, we must accelerate our efforts \nnot only to help more smokers to quit, but also to discourage young \npeople from ever lighting up in the first place.\n  The Preventing Addiction to Smoking Among Teens Act, which we are \nintroducing today, adopts a comprehensive approach to prevent teens \nfrom smoking and builds upon and improves the public health components \nof the tobacco settlement announced last summer. It is not designed to \ndeal with every question and every issue raised by the settlement. \nRather, it focuses on what I believe should be the prime goal of any \ntobacco settlement, and that is to reduce teen smoking.\n  Among its provisions, this legislation gives clear and comprehensive \nauthority to the FDA to regulate tobacco products and their components. \nThe tobacco industry will have to turn over all--all--of its documents \nto the FDA related to cigarette research and health, and the FDA will \nbe able to require the companies to reduce or to eliminate harmful \ningredients or to require safer technological improvements through \ninformal rulemaking. Moreover, after 10 years, the FDA could can \npropose an outright ban on\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\ncigarettes or smokeless tobacco products. However, should such a \nprohibition be required or undertaken, it would require congressional \napproval. I think that is appropriate. I think that a decision of that \nmagnitude should come back to Congress.\n  In my judgment, these provisions represent a marked improvement over \nlast summer's proposed tobacco settlement. The settlement has been \ncriticized for requiring the Food and Drug Administration to go through \nan arduous formal rulemaking process. Moreoever, unlike the tobacco \nsettlement, our bill does not require the FDA to prove the absence of a \nblack market--which critics have rightly pointed out would be \nimpossible--in order to regulate a product. Finally, to provide the \nresources necessary for their expanded regulatory powers, the bill \nrequires the FDA to assess a ``user fee'' of $100 million annually on \nall manufacturers selling FDA-regulated tobacco products in the United \nStates.\n  The bill also incorporates very important recommendations on \ncombating teenage smoking. It calls for strong warning labels. It calls \nfor a ban on vending machine sales that make tobacco products so \navailable to teenagers, it would ban outdoor advertising and the brand-\nname sponsorship of sporting events, and it would prohibit the use of \nimages like Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man.\n  It also, Mr. President, holds the tobacco companies accountable by \nimposing stiff financial penalties if the smoking rate among children \ndoes not decline by 30 percent in 5 years, 50 percent in 7 years, and \n60 percent in 10 years. Moreover, under our bill, there is no cap on \npenalties, and the price goes up the more the companies miss the \ntargets. These are very important, tough new improvements over the \nproposed settlement.\n  Our bill incorporates strong measures to ensure that restrictions on \nyouth access to tobacco products are tough and enforceable. It promotes \nthe development of State and community action programs designed to \neducate the public on addiction and the hazards of tobacco use and to \npromote the prevention and the cessation of cigarette smoking.\n  It calls for a national public education campaign to deglamorize the \nuse of tobacco products and to discourage young kids from smoking. And \nfinally, it calls for a comprehensive tobacco related research program \nto study the nature of addiction, the effects of nicotine on the body, \nand how to change behavior, particularly that of children and teens.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the legislation we are introducing \ntoday can serve as a basis for broad, bipartisan support to deal with \nthe public health issues that should serve as the foundation for any \nnational health policy in this area.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Jeffords, Senator Enzi, and \nmy other colleagues on the Labor Committee as Congress deals with this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation offered by my esteemed colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords. I appreciate his steady commitment to improving our nation's \npublic health--especially as it relates to the pending global tobacco \nsettlement. I, too, believe that we have an opportunity to dramatically \naffect the number of current and future smokers through education, \nresearch and regulation of tobacco products. It is my belief that the \nPrevention Addiction to Smoking Among Teens, or PAST Act, is a \nsignificant component that accomplishes just that.\n  The PAST Act is the first piece of legislation fashioned after the \nglobal tobacco settlement--reflecting the resolution's public health \naspects. I commend the Senator and his staff for working with me on \nremedying a number of outstanding issues in this bill. I look forward \nto working closely with my colleague on tightening this legislation as \nit works its way through the mix.\n  I do wish to share my thoughts on a number of issues in the global \nsettlement that must not be overlooked. In addition, I would point out \nthat a handful of these issues relating to public health are already \naddressed in the PAST Act. First, I believe the settlement fails to \ncomplement FDA's regulatory role by tapping the expertise of other \nfederal agencies with relative jurisdiction. Second, the look-back \nprovisions prescribed by the global settlement are only geared toward \nour nation's youth and don't apply to smokers above the age of 18. \nThird, the settlement focuses largely on reimbursing Medicaid \nexpenditures and ignores enormous Medicare expenditures for smoking \nrelated illnesses. Finally, the settlement's overall compensation \nmechanism fails to address long-term smoking attributed illnesses. In \nlight of these and other inherent difficulties, I am reluctant to \nembrace the entire global settlement with open arms. We are accepting \nrevenues for past problems and insuring the future without \ncompensation.\n  Let me first share my concerns regarding the FDA's role. The global \nsettlement would delegate all regulatory authority of tobacco products \nto the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including advertising and \neducation. Although I favor FDA being the key regulatory agency of \ntobacco products, I do not believe the agency needs an annual \nallocation of $300 million to carry out its obligations--that's nearly \n10 times what the FDA requested to enforce its original tobacco rule \nand one-third the agency's total annual budget. Such funding for one \nagency could not only foster regulatory abuses, but also stretch FDA's \ninternal resources while simultaneously compounding Congress' oversight \nresponsibilities. Such an approach is nothing more than a blueprint for \nyet another big government bureaucracy incapable of meeting its alleged \npurpose. I believe Senator Jeffords has acknowledged this predicament \nin the PAST Act. Rather than allotting $300 million each year for the \nFDA, the agency would receive $100 million, while other federal \nagencies with jurisdiction would receive $135 million, with the \nremaining $65 million going to the states for enforcement. This is a \nvery fairminded approach and we largely avoid an unfunded federal \nmandate.\n  Second, the look-back provisions included in the global settlement \nwere written to be applicable to our nation's youth--ages 18 and under. \nAs a result, Senator Jeffords' bill only addresses the admirable \nobjective of reducing underage smoking. While I have no problem with \nsetting strict goals for reducing underage tobacco use, I firmly \nbelieve that the global settlement and any subsequent legislation \nshould not overlook the need to reduce the overall impact of smoking \nrelated illnesses. We must be careful not to lend pride of being an \nadult to smoking. I appreciate Senator Jeffords' commitment to \nstrengthening this section of the PAST Act.\n  Third, the global settlement fails to address Medicare smoking-\nattributable expenditures by focusing all of its attention on \nreimbursing states for Medicaid expenditures. This is a substantial \nfinancial oversight in my opinion. In 1995, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration spent $176.9 billion in Medicare payments. Medicare \noutlays for fiscal 1996 are estimated to be $193.9 billion. \nConservatively assuming that only 5 percent of those expenditures were \nsmoking related, the average Medicare expenditures attributable to \nsmoking during 1995-1996 would still amount to $9.3 billion per year, \nthereby bringing the twenty-five year total to $192.3 billion. This is \nan astronomical sum that deserves consideration.\n  Finally, the global settlement's reimbursement structure is dubious \nat best. It is my belief that Senator Jeffords' legislation must \nreceive a sound, long-term financial commitment from the tobacco \nindustry. Under the current settlement, tobacco companies would pay an \ninitial $10 billion, and make annual payments starting at $8.5 billion \nin the first year and increases to $15 billion in the fifth year of the \nsettlement. While the total estimated payments over 25 years would be \n$368.5 billion, there is no guarantee under the settlement's structure \nthat the total amount would be collected. Economic conditions could \nchange or tobacco companies could be driven out of business leaving the \nfederal government holding an enormous tab for a very expensive \nregulatory scheme. Moreover, a large portion of the global settlement \ntotal may not even go to reimburse government for the costs of \ncigarette smoking. The money is designed to fund everything from \nunderage smoking cessation campaigns to\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\npotentially large civil damage awards. The scope of expenditures under \nthe global settlement is too broad and the reimbursement mechanism is \ntoo incomplete to warrant Congressional approval.\n  In the coming weeks, I will continue to advocate an alternative \nreimbursement mechanism that not only caters to the PAST Act, but \ncompensates for smoking attributed illnesses under the Medicare program \nas well. Two principles lie at the heart of this alternative approach. \nFirst, nonsmoking taxpayers should not be expected to continue footing \nthe bill for what are largely self-induced illnesses. Second, Congress \nmust ensure that the actual compensation fund is solvent for years to \ncome. To these ends, I believe we should give serious thought to a new \nindustry-based approach in which the government determines the costs \ncaused by the manufacturer's product, and then requires the \nmanufacturer and smoker to pay for these costs. Such a program would \nentirely eliminate smoking-attributed reimbursements from Medicaid and \nMedicare.\n  A ``Smoker's Compensation Fund'' of this type could be modeled on the \nWorker's Compensation Funds already in existence in the states. The \nproceeds for this fund would come from the tobacco industry, and \nultimately from smokers themselves in the form of higher cigarette \nprices. The tobacco industry's annual contributions to the fund could \nbe tied to the number of occurrences of smoking illnesses--the greater \nthe occurrences, the larger the contribution. Using Worker's \nCompensation as a model, a rolling multi-year average could form the \nbasis of annual premiums to individuals suffering from smoking-\nattributed illnesses. This would create an economic incentive for the \ntobacco companies to take actions to reduce tobacco-related illnesses, \nthereby driving down the number of smokers over the long-term--a true \nlook-back policy.\n  Moreover, an industry-based approach would not allow tobacco \ncompanies to walk away from long-term smoking attributed illnesses \nthrough a total $368.5 billion payment over a 25 year period. Instead, \nit would administratively make the tobacco companies and the smokers \nthemselves responsible for paying for the medical care of individuals \nwith smoking-related illnesses indefinitely. I believe that the \nSmoker's Compensation Fund concept would be the best vehicle to provide \nlong-term financial coverage not only for the Medicaid and Medicare \nprograms and smokers of all ages, but for the public health provisions \noutlined in Senator Jeffords' bill being introduced today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 1649. A bill to exempt disabled individuals from being required to \nenroll with a managed care entity under the medicaid program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n        medicaid managed care exemption for disabled individuals\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to exempt \ncertain disabled individuals from mandated managed care coverage under \nMedicaid. During consideration of last year's budget legislation, this \nissue arose but was not addressed in a satisfactory manner. That \nlegislation provided a broad grant of authority to states to require \nindividuals eligible for Medicaid to enroll in managed care plans. \nPrior to this change, states were required to obtain waivers from the \nfederal government in order to initiate such cost savings measures \nwhich would shift large portions of their Medicaid populations into \nmanaged care.\n  However, states have generally not been interested in shifting \ncertain categories of individuals into managed care, such as \nindividuals in nursing homes or special needs children. In fact, last \nyear's legislation specifically exempted certain categories of special \nneeds children under age nineteen.\n  Mr. President, I believe for certain categories of individuals it \ndoes not make sense to limit this exemption to individuals under age \nnineteen. For example, mentally retarded individuals receiving Medicaid \nbenefits do not enter into a new health care category once they reach \ntheir nineteenth birthday. I believe limiting the exemption for such \nindividuals is arbitrary and unwise policy. My legislation would simply \nremove the age limitation for severely disabled individuals.\n  I want to express my thanks to the Voice of the Retarded for their \nleadership on this issue and their willingness to bring it to my \nattention. I ask unanimous consent that a letter in support of this \nlegislation from that organization be inserted into the Record. I also \nwant to thank Louise Underwood, a constituent of mine who has been a \ntireless advocate over the years for the rights of mentally retarded \nand other disabled individuals. It is my hope that this straightforward \ncorrection to last year's legislation will be viewed as \nnoncontroversial, and can be enacted into law in the months ahead.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Voice of the Retarded,\n\n                                                 February 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: On behalf of all members of Voice of the \n     Retarded (VOR) nationwide, I wish to thank you for your long-\n     standing attention to the many intense needs of society's \n     most-impaired people. More than any other public figure, you \n     have consistently championed the causes of those who cannot \n     speak for themselves. We, their family members and only \n     spokespersons, are eternally grateful to you.\n       We come once again to seek your assistance in correcting \n     what seems to have been an unintentional oversight in the \n     language of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       As you know, the ability of traditional managed care models \n     to meet the unique health care requirements of people with \n     disabilities is uncertain. Congress recognized this when it \n     exempted SSI-eligible special needs children from mandatory \n     managed care provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. \n     This exemption reconciled the states' interest in maintaining \n     cost control and flexibility in program management with the \n     disability community's concern that managed care would \n     negatively impact access to appropriate specialized health \n     care.\n       It is our belief that age is an arbitrary, artificial \n     barrier to the provision of health care services. Mental \n     retardation is a life-long impairment that does not disappear \n     at age 19. We, therefore, respectfully request that you \n     support corrective legislation to ensure that adults with \n     mental retardation can receive the specialized health care \n     that they need throughout their lives unimpaired by managed \n     care.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Polly Spare,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1662. A bill to authorize the Navajo Indian irrigation project to \nuse power allocated to it from the Colorado River storage project for \non-farm uses; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n              navajo indian irrigation project legislation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will mean a great deal to the future economic development of the \nNavajo Nation and to the people in the Four Corners Region of New \nMexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado.\n\n  Mr. President, we are truly fortunate today to have one of the lowest \nnational unemployment rates in recent memory. Unfortunately, the \nadministration's economic juggernaut has not been felt everywhere. \nWhile national unemployment rates are below five percent, in my state \nof New Mexico, unemployment remains stuck at 8%. According to the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, New Mexico has the second highest \nunemployment rate in the country, right behind the District of \nColumbia.\n  Regrettably, one of the nation's highest unemployment rates is on the \nNavajo Indian Reservation, where unemployment is a staggering 50%. The \nunemployment rate in neighboring San Juan County is 12%, which is more \nthan twice the national average. These statistics should be deeply \ntroubling to all senators. Clearly, there is no region in this country \nin greater need of targeted economic development. Creating jobs is \nprecisely the purpose of the legislation I am introducing today.\n  In a nutshell, this bill allows the Navajo Nation's Indian Irrigation \nProject to use a portion of its existing allocation of federal electric \npower to help spur economic development and to create good jobs in the \nregion.\n  Mr. President, in 1962 Congress authorized the construction and \noperation of the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project. The project has \nblossomed into a 60,000 acre agricultural enterprise growing potatoes, \nbeans, alfalfa,\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nwheat, corn and livestock with annual revenues of $36 million. Today, \nthe ``Navajo Pride'' brand name is a hallmark of agricultural quality \nnationwide. The Tribe's own Navajo Agricultural Products Industry \n(NAPI) operates this successful all-Indian project. NAPI has a full-\ntime staff of 300. The workforce swells to 1,200 during the summer \ngrowing season.\n  In the 1962 legislation, Congress authorized the Bureau of \nReclamation to reserve eighty-seven megawatts of electric power for use \nby the project. It is clear from the original authorization that the \nprimary purpose of the project was to deliver water for the development \nof farming and allied industries. The reserved electric power is \ncurrently used to pump water to the project and to provide the water \npressure needed for irrigation. The original plans called for the use \nof gravity-fed irrigation; however, the irrigation method was later \nchanged to a more efficient electric-powered center-pivot system. \nUnfortunately, Congress had not foreseen these improvements and did not \nspecifically authorize the use of federal power to run irrigation \nsprinklers. In a letter to me dated November 5, 1997, Commissioner \nMartinez of the Bureau of Reclamation stated that Congress had not \nprovided the bureau with sufficient authority to allow NAPI to use its \nexisting allocation of electric power for anything other than water \npumping. Congress simply failed to authorize the use of federal power \nto run the sprinklers or for processing of the products grown there.\n  The legislation I am introducing would allow NAPI to use its existing \npower allocation to run the project's irrigation sprinklers or \nfactories on the reservation that process the agricultural products. \nThis legislation does not increase the amount of power allocated to \nNAPI--nobody's allocation of electric power is reduced or affected in \nany way. Moreover, the change would have no cost or other impact on \ntaxpayers.\n  This legislation is a simple technical change. It clarifies existing \ncongressional language. Moreover, because this is an all-Indian project \nestablished by Congress to benefit the Navajo Nation, this legislation \ndoes not create a precedent that would apply to any other irrigation \nproject.\n  This bill has the support of the Bureau of Reclamation. In addition, \nthe Republican Governor of the state of New Mexico and the nearby \ncities, counties, and electric utility companies support this change \nbecause they recognize the economic benefits for the entire Four \nCorners Region. I would particularly like to acknowledge the City of \nFarmington and Republican Mayor Thomas C. Taylor for support of the \nproject as reflected in a Memorandum of Understanding between the City \nand NAPI. In addition, the State of New Mexico has supported this \neffort with a grant to study water issues and by permitting the Navajo \nNation to use state bonding capacity.\n  Mr. President, Congress must not delay action to help reduce the \nunacceptable unemployment rates on the Navajo Reservation. This bill is \nan important step toward creating hundreds of year-round jobs and \nspurring economic development in San Juan County and the rest of the \nFour Corners Region. I urge the Chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to schedule a hearing on this worthy legislation at \nthe earliest possible date.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of the bill included in the \nRecord along with a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding between the \nCity of Farmington and the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry. I \nalso ask unanimous consent to include in the Record letters supporting \nthis legislation from the Bureau of Reclamation; Governor Johnson, the \nCities of Farmington and Bloomfield, New Mexico; San Juan County, New \nMexico; and the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1662\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Navajo Indian irrigation project (in this section \n     referred to as the ``irrigation project'') was authorized for \n     construction and operation as a participating project of the \n     Colorado River storage project by the Act of June 13, 1962, \n     Public Law 87-483, pursuant to plans approved by the \n     Secretary of the Interior on October 16, 1957;\n       (2) the irrigation project is an all-Indian irrigation \n     project authorized for the primary purpose of delivering \n     water to develop farming and allied industries that benefit \n     the Navajo Nation;\n       (3) the Bureau of Reclamation has reserved 87 megawatts of \n     power and associated energy from the Colorado River storage \n     project for current and future use on the irrigation project, \n     but currently not more than 25 megawatts of power is being \n     used because the project is only partially completed; while \n     the initial and subsequent plans and authorizing legislation \n     for the irrigation project allow power to be used to deliver \n     water to the irrigation project by canals and to lift water \n     to heights sufficient to pressurize the sprinkler delivery \n     system, clarification is necessary to approve the use of \n     power for on-farm uses such as for powering center-pivot \n     irrigation systems or for related agricultural industry \n     purposes; and\n       (4) the irrigation project is of vital economic importance \n     to the Navajo Nation, and substantial economic development \n     for the Four Corners Region and the Navajo Nation could be \n     realized if a portion of the 87 megawatt power allocation \n     were made available by the Bureau of Reclamation for powering \n     center-pivot irrigation systems and for related agricultural \n     industry purposes.\n\n     SEC. 2. USE OF POWER.\n\n       The first section of the Act of June 13, 1962 (Public Law \n     87-483; 76 Stat. 96) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: ``The Navajo Indian irrigation project may use its \n     allocation of 87 megawatts of power from the Colorado River \n     storage project for water delivery, on-farm production, and \n     related agricultural industry purposes.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Navajo Agricultural Products Industry and City of Farmington--\n                      Memorandum of Understanding\n\n       This Memorandum of Understanding (Agreement), between the \n     Navajo Agricultural Products Industry (NAPI) and the City of \n     Farmington (City), New Mexico, sometimes referred to as the \n     Parties, sets forth the terms and conditions to clarify \n     conflicting interests in delivery of electrical service to \n     the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry.\n       Whereas, NAPI seeks the support of the City for the use of \n     Other Priority Use Power for the development of the proposed \n     french fry factory which will require a legislated Change in \n     Purpose; and\n       Whereas, the City of Farmington recognizes and agrees with \n     NAPI that the development of the french fry factory will have \n     positive economic impact for the Navajo Nation, the City and \n     San Juan County; that the french fry factory will create over \n     600 jobs; and, that it will require the development of three \n     additional agricultural blocks which will have an important \n     and positive long range influence on the economic development \n     of the region; and\n       Whereas, NAPI's General Manager Lorenzo Bates and the \n     City's Mayor Thomas C. Taylor met on November 21, 1997, to \n     resolve outstanding issues which have arisen regarding NAPI's \n     legislative request for a Change in Purpose of NAPI's \n     Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) Project Use Power \n     allocation.\n       Therefore, as a result of the meeting the Parties agree as \n     follows:\n       1. NAPI agrees to continue to utilize electric power \n     provided by the City for its center pivots located in the \n     City's service area;\n       2. The use and amount of such service to the center pivots \n     shall remain similar to the amount used by NAPI at the \n     signing of this Agreement and shall continue until the City \n     implements customer choice in its service area;\n       3. This Agreement will be applicable and bind any person, \n     corporation, or entity which may purchase or acquire through \n     any means the Farmington Electric Utility System (FEUS).\n       In consideration of NAPI's promises and covenants, the City \n     agrees as follows:\n       1. To support NAPI's request for a legislative Change in \n     Purpose of a remaining portion of their eighty-seven \n     megawatts (87 mW) of CRSP allocation of federal power to be \n     used to supply electricity to the proposed french fry plant;\n       2.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Thank you for your May 8, 1997, \n     letter co-signed by the New Mexico and Arizona Congressional \n     delegation, regarding the use of Federal power for the Navajo \n     Agricultural Products Industry's (NAPI) center pivot \n     irrigation system and industrial uses. The Bureau of \n     Reclamation (Reclamation) has no express authority to\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\n     allow the use of project power for these proposed on-farm \n     uses. Although Reclamation might have implicit authority \n     which would allow for the use of project power in the manner \n     requested, such an interpretation would not be consistent \n     with the past instances of Reclamation practice. While we \n     will continue to review the matter, given the lack of express \n     authority, legislation to resolve the matter conclusively and \n     expeditiously may be appropriate.\n       The sale of Federal power from a Reclamation project is \n     governed by general Federal Reclamation law and authorizing \n     acts for specific projects. Reclamation may provide power \n     only for the uses authorized by Congress. Power is sold \n     either as project power at the project,\\1\\ or for other uses, \n     on or off the project (non-project power). The Navajo Indian \n     Irrigation Project (NIIP) was authorized for construction and \n     operation as a participating project of CRSP by Public Law \n     87-483 passed on June 13, 1962, pursuant to plans approved by \n     the Secretary of the Interior on October 16, 1957. Although \n     NIIP is an Indian irrigation project, it is subject to \n     Federal Reclamation law as provided by Section 4 of the \n     Colorado River Storage Project Act of April 11, 1956. The \n     planning and authorization documents, along with subsequent \n     planning reports, indicate that project power was intended to \n     accommodate delivery of water to the farm by canals and by \n     lifting water to heights sufficient to pressurize the \n     sprinkler irrigation delivery system. No specific indication \n     is made that project power would be available to run center \n     pivot irrigation systems or for on-farm municipal and \n     industrial uses, however, it is clear that the primary \n     purpose of the project is to deliver water for the \n     development of farming and allied industries.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ There are two types of project power, ``project use \n     power'' and ``priority use power.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Reclamation has reserved 87 Megawatts (MW) of project power \n     from the CRSP for current and future use on the NIIP for \n     authorized purposes. Although as you point out in your May 8, \n     1997, letter, the terms of the 1990 interagency agreement and \n     revisions agreed to by the Western Area Power Administration, \n     Reclamation, and NAPI provide that NAPI can use other \n     Priority Use Power for sprinkler irrigation and industrial \n     uses, specific Congressional authority for such uses does not \n     exist and therefore legislation making such authority clear \n     would be appropriate. As development of NIIP continues, there \n     are increasing opportunities for application of various \n     conservation measures with attendant energy saving. With \n     specific Congressional authorization, we believe that overall \n     power usage, including the proposed on-farm uses can be \n     accommodated within the present 87 MW allocation.\n       If you desire to discuss these matters further, please \n     contact Arlo Allen at (801) 524-3612.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Eluid L. Martinez,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                  Santa Fe, NM, February 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Pete V Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman and Senator Domenici: It is with \n     pleasure that I give my support to the Navajo Agricultural \n     Products Industry French Fry Plant. This project offers great \n     opportunities for self-sufficiency and economic development \n     for the Navajo Nation, City of Farmington, San Juan County \n     and the State of New Mexico, as well as the Navajo \n     Agricultural Product Industry. The creation of up to 500 \n     plant jobs and another 100 farming jobs will benefit the \n     community and the state. We commend everyone involved for the \n     collaboration between state, federal, local and tribal \n     agencies to make the french fry project a reality.\n       The Department of Economic Development has been heavily \n     involved in this project for several years and spearheaded \n     the effort to pass a new law to allow Nations, Tribes and \n     Pueblos access to the New Mexico Finance Authority bonding \n     capacity. I supported and signed into law this piece of \n     legislation. The New Mexico Department of Environment also \n     gave a grant to the Navajo Nation of $200,000 to study water \n     issues for the french fry factory. The funding for the study \n     came through the State Legislature with my full support In \n     1997, the New Mexico Legislature and my administration worked \n     to pass legislation to further assist the Navajo Nation \n     recruit the french fry factory to NAPI.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gary E.

Furthermore, our understanding is that the \n     electricity required for the french fry plant will be \n     provided from resources available to NAPI under the \n     Interagency Agreement among NAPI and the US Department of \n     Interior--Bureau of Indian Affairs and the US Department of \n     Interior--Bureau of Reclamation and the US Department of \n     Energy--Western Area Power Administration, Colorado River \n     Storage Project and that NTUA proposes to build the \n     transmission/distribution system necessary to deliver such \n     resources to NAPI.\n       In order for NAPI to have access to the resources under the \n     Agreement referred to above, it is necessary to have \n     legislation introduced which will provide for a change in \n     purpose for the use of the project power. Senator Bingaman's \n     office is intending to introduce that legislation in the \n     Senate during the latter part of February, 1998. The City of \n     Farmington, in accordance with the Memorandum of \n     Understanding between NAPI and the City dated December 10, \n     1997, supports NAPI's request for a legislative Change in \n     Purpose of a remaining portion of the eighty-seven megawatts \n     (87mW) of CRSP allocation of federal power to be used to \n     supply electricity to the proposed french fry plant.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas C.

This project has the potential of creating numerous \n     job opportunities for a large, unemployed segment of the \n     population. In the City's application to the Empowerment \n     Zone/Enterprise Community program we attempted to focus on \n     job creation in areas south of our city where residents live \n     far below the poverty standards. This project is the best \n     opportunity for Navajo employment in that area.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas C.

We understand that Legislation is being prepared to \n     allow NAPI to utilize WAPA Power for the plant and other \n     purposes. We therefore, request your support of this \n     Legislation.\n       As you are well aware, the Navajo Nation has a 49% \n     unemployment rate on the reservation, therefore we feel that \n     the development of the potato processing plant is of utmost \n     importance to the Navajo Nation, San Juan County and the City \n     of Bloomfield.\n       On behalf of myself and the City Council I would like to \n     reaffirm the City's support for what can only be an economic \n     benefit to all the citizens in Northwest New Mexico.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Sam Mohler,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              San Juan County,\n\n                                      Aztec, NM, February 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Re: Navajo Agriculture Products Industry (NAPI)--Potato \n     Processing Plant\n\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: San Juan County has been supportive \n     of the NAPI's ``Potato Processing Plant'' since its \n     inception. On numerous occasions we have met with Mr. Lorenzo \n     Bates of NAPI and our legislative delegation to attempt to \n     bring this project to fruition.\n       The Navajo Nation has a 49% unemployment rate on the \n     Reservation and because of this, we feel that the Potato \n     Processing Plant is of upmost importance to the County.\n       On behalf of myself and the San Juan County Commission, I \n     would like to reaffirm the County's support for what I feel \n     will be an economic benefit to all the citizens in San Juan \n     County.\n       Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tony Atkinson,\n     County Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Navajo Tribal Utility Authority,\n\n                             Fort Defiance, AZ, February 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Re: Navajo Indian Irrigation Project On Farm Use of Colorado \n     River Storage Project Power\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, \n     the public agency and enterprise of the Navajo Nation which \n     provides power and energy to consumers within the Navajo \n     Indian Reservation, has been advised of the possibility of \n     legislation which would authorize the use of an existing \n     allocation of 87 megawatts of Colorado River Storage Project \n     Power for certain on farm uses, including center pivot \n     sprinkler irrigation and for processing agricultural products \n     for consumer use.\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\n       The Utility Authority supports the proposed legislation \n     which clarifies the availability of this power for on farm \n     uses. The Navajo Indian Irrigation Project has for many years \n     been delayed in its completion and the allocation of power, \n     originally made on the basis of a flood irrigation \n     arrangement, may not be totally used for many, many years.\n       Since the promised benefits for agreement to share water \n     shortages have not materialized as expected, it seems \n     appropriate to suggest that, in some small measure, passage \n     of this legislation would attempt to address the many delays \n     which have consistently plagued the Navajo Indian Irrigation \n     Project.\n       The Authority recognizes that the initial allocations of \n     ``project use'' power to the Irrigation Project did not \n     specifically mention sprinkler irrigation by center pivot \n     methods nor the development of municipal or industrial uses \n     on the farm. However, these activities must have been \n     contemplated within the plan for the development of a 110,000 \n     acre irrigation farm for the Navajo Nation.\n       As the current serving utility for a substantial portion of \n     the Irrigation Project, the Authority supports enactment of \n     the legislation by the Congress.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Malcolm P.

FROM IRAQ\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 76\n\n       Whereas hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on \n     February 28, 1991, and the cease fire was codified in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 686 (March 2, 1991) and \n     687 (April 3, 1991);\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 \n     requires that international economic sanctions, including an \n     embargo on the sale of oil from Iraq, remain in place until \n     Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass destruction \n     programs and capabilities and undertakes unconditionally \n     never to resume such activities;\n       Whereas Resolution 687 further established the United \n     Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq to uncover all \n     aspects of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program;\n       Whereas, despite the sustained opposition of the Government \n     of Iraq, UNSCOM has discovered many instances of inaccurate \n     actions by Iraq concerning Iraqi ballistic missile \n     capabilities and chemical and biological programs;\n       Whereas Security Council Resolution 986 (April 14, 1995) \n     partially lifted international economic sanctions by allowing \n     Iraq to sell $1 billion in oil every 90 days, the proceeds of \n     which are designed, in part, for humanitarian assistance to \n     the people of Iraq;\n       Whereas a report by the Secretary General of the United \n     Nations submitted on February 2, 1998 recommends further \n     easing of economic sanctions by allowing Iraq to sell $5.2 \n     billion in oil every six months;\n       Whereas the United States has indicated it will support the \n     easing of further economic sanctions proposed by the UN \n     Secretary General;\n       Whereas revenues from oil exports have historically \n     represented nearly all (95 percent) of Iraq's foreign \n     exchange earnings;\n       Whereas in the year preceding hostilities in Operation \n     Desert Storm, Iraq's export earnings totaled $10.4 billion;\n       Whereas Iraq, since the end of Operation Desert Storm, has \n     been steadily increasing exports of oil to Jordan from 60,000 \n     to 80,000 barrels per day and in December 1997, agreed to \n     increase such shipments to approximately 96,000 barrels per \n     day;\n       Whereas Iraq has been able to circumvent international \n     economic sanctions by exporting oil to Turkey;\n       Whereas the Multinational Interdiction Force that conducts \n     maritime searches in the Persian Gulf has reported that \n     exports of contraband Iraqi oil through the Gulf have \n     increased seven-fold in the past year, from $10 million in \n     diesel fuel sales in 1996 to $75 million in 1997;\n       Whereas Iraq's military capabilities, including its \n     capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction, are \n     significantly enhanced by its ability to earn foreign \n     exchange primarily from oil exports;\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the continued \n     threat to international peace and security posed by Iraq's \n     refusal to meet its international obligations and end its \n     weapons of mass destruction programs;\n       (2) urges the Administration to oppose any further \n     weakening of economic sanctions including extension of, or \n     expansion of, United Nations Security Council Resolution 986;\n       (3) urges the President to propose to the United Nations \n     Security Council measures to significantly tighten the \n     international embargo on the sale of oil from Iraq, including \n     efforts to strengthen the Multi-lateral Interdiction Force \n     and inspection operations near the Port of Basra;\n       (4) urges the President to enter into negotiations with oil \n     producing nations in the Gulf to encourage them to make \n     subsidized sales of oil to Jordan;\n       (5) urges the President to submit a report to Congress 30 \n     days before the UN is authorized to consider renewing Iraq's \n     authority to export oil setting forth a detailed accounting \n     for the disposition of the proceeds of UN authorized sales of \n     oil from Iraq.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent \nresolution addressing the international sanctions regime that has been \nin place against Iraq since the end of the Persian Gulf war. As we all \nknow, there has been a great deal of deliberation in this Chamber \nrelative to potential action that might be initiated by our Government \nagainst Iraq. And there is a feeling of, I think, growing concern as to \njust what type action we might take and what it will accomplish.\n  But, Mr. President, I think I bring a different approach to this \ndilemma. As we acknowledge the risk of the approach to this dilemma. As \nwe acknowledge the risk of the approaching confrontation with Iraq that \nhas been brought about by Saddam Hussein's continuing unwillingness to \nallow the U.N. inspectors the right to inspect the facilities in Iraq, \nwhat we also know is that Saddam Hussein is very likely continuing to \nmanufacture and develop weapons of mass destruction, probably of a \nbiological nature.\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\n  I was in Iraq in the early 1980s with a number of Senators and had an \nopportunity to visit with Saddam Hussein before the Persian Gulf war. \nIt was clear from that meeting that we had a very unusual personality, \none who is dangerous and clearly unpredictable.\n  As a consequence, we find ourselves in the position that until the \nU.N. inspectors are allowed unfettered access to the facilities in \nIraq, the world will continue to be held hostage to the destructive and \nthreatening tendencies of Saddam Hussein.\n  With the world's economy so heavily dependent on the free flow of oil \nfrom the Mideast, so long as these weapons of mass destruction exist, \nthe economic stability of every nation in the world is somewhat at \nrisk. Make no mistake about it, Mr. President, the Persian Gulf war was \na war to ensure that Saddam did not take over the oil fields of Kuwait. \nThat was Saddam's objective. It was a war about oil and the necessity \nof keeping oil flowing to the free markets of the world.\n  So, Mr. President, one question that seems to be lost in the debate \nis, how--how--has Saddam been able to obtain the technology and the \nresources to construct facilities capable of producing poison gas and \nbiological weapons? The U.N. economic embargo has been in place for 7 \nyears, but somehow--somehow--he appears to have been able to maintain a \ncash flow to purchase the necessary technology for building these \nlaboratories of death.\n  Just this morning, the Washington Post is reporting that U.N. \ninspectors have uncovered evidence that in 1995 the Russian Government \nmay have entered into a multimillion dollar deal to sell Iraq \nspecialized fermentation equipment that could be used to develop \nbiological weapons. If this story turns out to be true, Russia's \ncredibility in its alleged efforts to broker a diplomatic solution to \nthe current crisis could be seriously called into question.\n  More importantly, the question remains, how could Iraq have financed \nthis deal? Well, surely the Russians were not going to sell such \nequipment in exchange for worthless Iraqi dinars. The deal had to be \nfinanced with dollars, had to be financed with hard currency. But how \ncould Iraq amass millions in hard currency in the face of 7 years of \nU.N. sanctions?\n  Well, Mr. President, there is only one answer. It is an obvious one. \nThe only mechanism that Iraq has to enable it to gain hard currency is \nto export its oil. There is virtually nothing else, besides dates and \nsome agriculture products, that Iraq has to export.\n  Prior to the U.N. sanctions in 1990, Iraq had exports of $10.4 \nbillion. Of that amount, more than 95 percent--or almost $10 billion--\nwas derived from oil exports. Clearly, Iraq's capacity to purchase \nequipment in the world market to develop weapons of mass destruction is \ndirectly linked to its ability to sell oil, and only oil.\n  Ever since the gulf war ended, Iraq has been shipping oil into \nJordan. Initially, Jordan received about 60,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a \nday. That figure has recently climbed to over 80,000 barrels a day, and \nin an agreement reached in December, the oil trade between Iraq and \nJordan is scheduled to climb to 96,000 barrels a day.\n\n  Although the Jordanians claim that the oil is traded for food and \nmedicine, I personally find it hard to believe that, with millions of \ndollars worth of oil and products daily crossing the Iraq/Jordanian \nborder, that some of that oil is not leaking into the world market or \nthat hard currency and sophisticated machinery are not flowing back \ninto Iraq. As a matter of fact, we know that oil is leaking out.\n  Moreover, there is a great deal of evidence that Iraqi oil is being \nshipped across the border into Turkey. Dollars are surely being traded \nin exchange for the oil, and those dollars are likely to be used to \nfinance Saddam's factories of death.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the Multinational Interdiction Force, the \nMIF, that conducts maritime searches in the Persian Gulf reported \nfactually last fall that exports of contraband Iraqi oil through the \ngulf and jumped sevenfold in the past year, from $10 million in diesel \nfuel sales in 1996 to $75 million in 1997. Much of that oil is believed \nto be transshipped through Iran and the United Arab Emirates and on to \nthe world market.\n  What does Saddam do with the revenues from those contraband sales? \nWell, he keeps his weapons factories running, keeps the Republican \nGuards well armed and fed.\n  Mr. President, the United States has been concerned about the \nhardships, of course, that the economic sanctions have imposed on the \npeople of Iraq. Our conflict is not with the Iraqi people; it is with \nthe dictator who has run that country for some 19 years while depriving \nthe people of the basic dignities of life and slaughtering some tens of \nthousands of minority citizens of Iraq.\n  In 1995, the United States supported a fundamental weakening of the \neconomic sanctions against Iraq. We supported a resolution permitting \nIraq to sell $1 billion worth of oil every 90 days under the oil-for-\nfood program. I believe this was a weakening of the sanctions, and as a \nconsequence was a mistake.\n  What this has done is it has allowed Saddam to import food and \nmedicine for the Iraqi people, which is true and certainly worthy, but \nit has also made it far easier for Saddam to divert some of the \ninvestment billions that he has hidden in accounts around the world. \nPrior to the oil-for-food program, Saddam had to use these investment \nprofits to import food and medicine. The oil-for-food program frees up \nhis investment profits to purchase equipment that can enhance all of \nhis weapons capabilities, including his capacity to manufacture weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the United States must make every \neffort now to ensure that Saddam cannot use his oil assets to obtain \nmore hard currency for weapons programs. That is why I am introducing \nthe resolution today. The resolution specifically urges the President \nto oppose any measure that weakens the international sanctions that \npermit Iraq to export oil.\n\n  Recently, the Secretary-General of the United Nations recommended a \nsignificant easing of the Iraq sanctions and proposed that Iraq be \npermitted to sell more than twice as much oil as is currently \npermitted. Under this proposal, Iraq could conceivably sell $10.4 \nbillion worth of oil in a single year. I was shocked to learn that this \nadministration has indicated it would support this unwarranted \nexpansion of Iraqi oil exports. Mr. President, if this U.N. proposal is \nadopted we might just as well end all sanctions on Iraq. Mr. President, \n$10.4 billion dollars was the amount of oil that Iraq exported before \nher invasion of Kuwait. Are we going to allow Iraq to to return to that \nlevel of exports and still retain a public stance in support of \nsanctions? That proposal makes a mockery of the sanctions.\n  My concurrent resolution would also urge the President to develop \nmeasures that will tighten the oil embargo on Iraq and prevent the \nleakage into the would marketplace that we have seen over the past few \nyears. It also urges the President to try and convince both the \nGovernments of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to end their boycott of Jordan \nand begin making subsidized oil sales to Jordan to replace the Iraqi \noil. The Jordanian border is one of the most porous in the Middle East \nand the Jordanians are forced to trade with Iraq primarily because the \nSaudis and Kuwaitis will not sell Jordan oil. That policy may have made \nsense immediately after the gulf war but today it must be reconsidered. \nIf we can replace 96,000 barrels of oil that Jordan imports from Iraq, \nwe will have made a significant step toward tightening the flow of \ndollars to Iraq.\n  Mr. President, oil is the key to controlling the future military \ncapacity and capabilities of Iraq, and we must move more vigilantly in \nour efforts to stop the leakage of Iraqi oil onto the would market if \nwe are going to contain Saddam Hussein.\n  Mr. President, let me again highlight the specifics of the resolution \nI just introduced. The resolution urges the administration to oppose \nany further weakening of economic sanctions against Iraq. The \nresolution urges the President to propose to the United Nations \nmeasures to significantly tighten the international embargo on the sale \nof oil from Iraq, including efforts to strengthen the multilateral \ninterdiction force so that these illegal shipments can be stopped. And \nfinally, the resolution urges the President to enter into negotiations \nwith oil producing\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\nnations in the gulf to encourage these nations to make subsidized sales \nof oil to Jordan.\n  Mr. President, recognizing the concern that we all share over \ndevelopments in Iraq since the Persian Gulf war, we are faced with the \nnecessity to take a hard look at our options. One option is the \nstrategic bombing of the sites where we believe we have enough \ninformation to satisfy ourselves that a strike will have a meaningful \nimpact. On the other hand, strategic bombing is likely to result in \ntelevision shots of injured children and women that undoubtedly will be \nplaced as human shields around strategic sites in Iraq.\n  Another option is the use of ground forces to back up an air campaign \nto try and take out Saddam Hussein himself. Although the United States \nhas significant resources, there is a recognition that a ground strike \nunder current circumstances is unlikely given the increasing likelihood \nthat American solders would lose their lives. Of course there is also \nthe unanswered question of what we would do if Saddam survived such an \nattack?\n  With either of these options we must address the reality that we do \nnot have the multilateral coalition which included our Arab neighbors \nthat we had when the Bush administration initiated Desert Storm. I \nthink it is unfortunate that this administration has not maintained \nthat coalition. So now we are pretty much alone. Great Britain, Canada \nand Australia are with us, and for that we are grateful, but from there \non it gets pretty lonesome.\n  Going it alone or going it with others, we still must talk about the \nend game. If Saddam Hussein survives, do we continue these same efforts \nin another few years? Are we going to give Saddam Hussein carte blanche \nin his ability to recover? Because he will recover by selling oil. That \nis what he has.\n\n  Saddam Hussein has been able to generate roughly $1 billion per \nquarter from the sale of oil. There is information--and unfortunately I \ncan't reveal some of the information because it is classified--\nconcerning the large amount of illegal oil that is flowing out of Iraq. \nAnd we are not able to stop this flow both because there are not enough \nmultilateral intervention force (MIF) vessels in the area and because \nthe rules of engagement under which the MIF forces operate don't allow \nthem to stop such illegal movement.\n  It is these illegal sales that are primarily fueling Iraq's economy. \nMr. President, it simply makes sense to this Senator to recognize that \noil is the lifeblood of Iraq. We need to shut off this lifeblood, maybe \nthrough a combination of increased enforcement of the embargo and \njawboning some of our allies who are purchasing Iraq's oil. Perhaps we \nneed to go further, and consider the merits of a maritime blockade of \nsome sort. A blockade certainly is not an unreasonable alternative when \nyou consider that we might initiate a military action against Saddam. \nStop Saddam Hussein's oil and you shut down his ability to funnel \nresources into his war machine and the economy, and ultimately, I think \nhis regime will collapse.\n  As a Congress, we must address the issue of oil sales and we must do \nit in a prompt manner. I believe we must terminate these illegal sales \nof oil and we must be more vigilant in our oversight to ensure that the \noil that is allowed to be sold under the sanctions and the dollars \ngenerated are really going for the benefit of the people and their \nsocial needs. That is the basis of my resolution. We must stop Saddam \nHussein's ability to fund his war machine by cutting off his ability to \nsupply the markets with Iraqi oil. That is an action that we should \nhave taken some time ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the merits of my concurrent \nresolution. It is certainly appropriate to consider this action as we \naddress the merits of any further military action that might be \ncontemplated to stop Saddam from whatever his ultimate objective is. \nCut off his oil and you are going to get his attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S770-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 77--RELATIVE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources:\n\n                            S.

Res. 176\n\n         \n       Whereas young people will be the stewards of our \n     communities, Nation, and world in critical times, and the \n     present and future well-being of our society requires an \n     involved, caring citizenry with good character;\n       Whereas concerns about the character training of children \n     have taken on a new sense of urgency as violence by and \n     against youth threatens the physical and psychological well-\n     being of the Nation;\n       Whereas more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and that character \n     counts in personal relationships, in school, and in the \n     workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play a very important role in supporting \n     family efforts by fostering and promoting good character;\n       Whereas the Senate encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the valuable role \n     our youth play in the present and future of our\n\n[[Page S773]]\n\n     Nation and to recognize that character is an important part \n     of that future;\n       Whereas in July 1992, the Aspen Declaration was written by \n     an eminent group of educators, youth leaders, and ethics \n     scholars for the purpose of articulating a coherent framework \n     for character education appropriate to a diverse and \n     pluralistic society;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``Effective character \n     education is based on core ethical values which form the \n     foundation of democratic society.'';\n       Whereas the core ethical values identified by the Aspen \n     Declaration constitute the 6 core elements of character;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character are \n     trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, \n     and citizenship;\n       Whereas the 6 core elements of character transcend \n     cultural, religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the Aspen Declaration states, ``The character and \n     conduct of our youth reflect the character and conduct of \n     society; therefore, every adult has the responsibility to \n     teach and model the core ethical values and every social \n     institution has the responsibility to promote the development \n     of good character.'';\n       Whereas the Senate encourages individuals and \n     organizations, especially those who have an interest in the \n     education and training of our youth, to adopt the 6 core \n     elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society as a whole; and\n       Whereas the Senate encourages communities, especially \n     schools and youth organizations, to integrate the 6 core \n     elements of character into programs serving students and \n     children: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of October 18 through October 24, \n     1998, as ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to embrace the 6 core elements of character and to \n     observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                     NATIONAL CHARACTER COUNTS WEEK\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, fellow Senators, today, for the fifth \nconsecutive year I am going to submit a resolution on behalf of myself, \nSenators Dodd, Cochran, Bennett, Lieberman, Mikulski, Kempthorne, \nDorgan, Frist, and Cleland. This resolution that we have introduced 5 \nconsecutive years sets aside the week of October 18-24 of this year for \nwhat we call National Character Counts Week.\n  About 6\\1/2\\ years ago, a very distinguished group of Americans from \nall walks of life met for 3 or 4 days to talk about the character of \nAmerica and the character of American people and decided after 3 days \nof debate that there were, in fact, six pillars of character. If these \npillars could permeate our society and our children, we would all be \nbetter for it, America would be better for it and, most of all, our \nlives would be better for it.\n  These six pillars were determined at that point in time and they have \nremained ever since as trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, \nfairness, caring, and citizenship. They are referred to as the six \npillars of character.\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, when one looks at what has \ndeveloped in these years, to help our teachers--be they in private or \npublic schools--talk to students and teach them about these six \npillars, it is obvious that these are basic concepts, basic ideas that \nhardly anyone in America would disagree with. That is not to say that \nanybody is preaching, but would we not like our children to learn the \nvalue of honesty? That is what trustworthiness is. Would we not like \nour young children and even our business community to be cognizant of \nand practice respect? And would we not want, as our children grow and \nas people begin to understand what holds a country together, would we \nnot want responsibility to become part of the vocabulary of every \nchild, every young person?\n  I can go through all six, and I can find different words to express \neach of the six. It is obvious, however, if you move throughout the \nState of New Mexico or the State of Georgia--I note my good friend, \nSenator Cleland is here--if you ask a group of people from all walks of \nlife, various religions, various degrees of faith, even agnostics: ``Do \nyou object to our young people learning trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship?'', you rarely get a \nnegative response.\n  Now, this six pillars-character approach is spreading throughout our \ncountry, and those who came up with the idea and the foundation which \nhas the right to use these pillars of character do not intend to impose \nfrom on high; rather they ask that individuals, schools, leaders, \norganizations such as the Boy Scouts, NFL player groups, adopt these \nsix pillars and then do something about them.\n  I would be less than honest if I did not tell you the place these six \npillars are spreading most rapidly is the right place--in the schools. \nTeachers are excited, believe it or not. Some have expressed to me they \nare now permitted to do what they always thought they should do but \nbecause we got all mixed up in terms of what you couldn't do in a \nclassroom, these kind of lessons were left out. It now seems that \nwithout much objection, many school boards have said let's do it. \nTeachers are trying to permeate the halls, the classrooms, the meeting \nrooms and the minds of young people with these six pillars.\n  I will in my prepared remarks talk just a little bit about my State, \nthe State of New Mexico. We organized partnerships with a number of \nmayors, the Governor joined, and we have now about 90 percent of all \nthe schoolchildren in the State of New Mexico, parochial and private, \nthat are exposed and taught and work with these six pillars--not some \nother words that describe it--these six words.\n  So there is a commonality now of usage of words. A commonality of \nexamples that are used. Mr. President, you might have been thrilled to \ngo to a grade school in New Mexico with me on a given day when the \npillar called ``responsibility'' had been the subject matter in that \nschool for one month. The way a significant number of schools do it is \ntake one pillar a month. Teach everything else you teach, but also \ninclude the word of the month in these classes. You would have walked \ninto that grade school and seen the walls plastered with signs and \npictures the students had drawn about the word of the month, such as \nthe word responsibility. You could then go to an assembly where all the \nlittle children with their teachers talked about responsibility for \nabout an hour and gave awards where young people said that is the most \nresponsible student in the class and this is what he or she did. It is \nrather exciting.\n  Now, frankly, it is not the business of any State Department of \nEducation, If character education is going to be done, each school has \nto desire to do it along with the principal, teachers, and parents.\n  Needless to say, people ask, is it working? Frankly, I can't stand \nhere and tell you I am absolutely certain of all the positive aspects, \nbut I can tell you that we are beginning to get more than anecdotal \ninformation from schools that have been doing it for 2 or 3 years. They \nnote that there is a noticeable change in behavior and relationship of \nchildren to children and, indeed, of teachers to children. Many would \nclaim, indeed, that this does more for changing the character of our \ncountry in the right direction than almost anything that is going on \nout there except the organized activity of the faith people of the \ncountry as they proceed with their faith-filled lessons.\n  In our State we are now experimenting with the very first group of \nbusinessmen who are trying to inculcate the six pillars of character, \nin an institutional way, into their businesses. They are going to try \nto see if they can incorporate these values as a part of the life of a \nbusiness, the life of the employees, and all of their relationships to \nthe public. They hope that these values will then be passed on to \nothers, if indeed, it has a measure of success.\n  Now, we are not unique. I happened to put the resolution in the \nSenate 5 years ago and asked ten Senators to join me. Former Senator \nSam Nunn was one of the original ten. His successor, Senator Max \nCleland, has joined us now as an original sponsor. He is here now in \nthe chamber, and I will yield to him in a few minutes.\n  I in no way stand here suggesting that there are not many better \nexamples than my State of New Mexico. There probably are. I just feel \nvery good every now and then, once a year, to tell the Senate a few \nexciting stories about what is going on in our State in this regard. In \nthe prepared remarks I cite many other examples of how the six pillars \nare working and how the public is responding and how televisions and \nradio stations help promote\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\nthese pillars. They are now kind of common, ordinary language among the \npeople in the State of New Mexico. I think that is all a very good \nstart.\n  This resolution will designate the week of October 18-24, 1998, as \nNational Character Counts Week, when individuals and organizations may \nobserve specifically their programs and activities supporting character \ndevelopment.\n  All of us who have been involved with character education programs \nknow about the extraordinary growth of these efforts across the \ncountry. Regardless of our support here in Washington, the development \nof character programs the grassroots level has been the most exciting. \nGood character can be endorsed and supported by Government, but it is \nfamilies, schools, and communities that make the real difference.\n  Over the past 4 years since we initiated community-based Character \nCounts programs in New Mexico, the public and private schools in the \nState have incorporated the Character Counts message in most of the \nState's schools. Almost 200,000 students are receiving instruction and \nare involved in activities that promote the Six Pillars of Character: \nTrustworthiness, Respect, Responsibility, Fairness, Caring, and \nCitizenship. Whether the Six Pillars appear on billboards, on town \nwaterbills, or are incorporated into a school's curriculum, the message \nof good character permeates the community.\n  The six simple words are not just words in a vocabulary. They are \nconcepts that have meaning to children and adults alike, resulting in \ntangible actions that change for the better how they relate to and \ninteract with one another. Today, I would like mention just a couple of \nexamples of how the Character Counts efforts in New Mexico are changing \nthe daily lives of its citizens for the better.\n  I would like to recount one of the most inspiring Character Counts \ninitiatives I have seen in New Mexico. It is about Emerson Elementary \nSchool in Albuquerque. The school has 800 students speaking more than \n11 languages. The school is located in a densely populated, culturally \ndiverse and highly mobile area, with a 98.5 percent poverty rating. \nMany refer to this area of the city as a ``war zone'' because of its \nhigh crime rate. The challenges facing the school administration, \nteachers, and its Principal Linda Torres far exceed those of most \nschools; its academic challenges are as great as the community's social \nchallenges.\n  The Character Counts program at Emerson Elementary was initiated as a \ntotal Social Skills Curriculum, with the Six Pillars integrated into \nall its daily classes and reinforced with various activities to reward \nthe students for good behavior. At the same time, the school utilizes a \nhuman services collaborative support program for the 500 families \nassociated with the school. It works with social service organizations \nto ensure the entire family is assisted, whether it is providing \nnutritional advice or clothing to needy families. In an effort to \nmaximize community involvement of adults and children, the school \nchildren adopted the Veterans Memorial Park across the street from the \nschool as one of their civic projects. They help maintain and patrol \nthe park, and since the project began there have been no problems with \ngraffiti.\n  Emerson Elementary has become a virtual community center in this area \nof the city and a true haven for the children and their parents. \nPrincipal Linda Torres believes that among all the conflicts that need \naddressing or resolving within the school and in the community, it is \nclear that the values that reside ``inside a person'' are as critical \nas anything the school attempts to provide. In summarizing the success \nof Character Counts, Principal Torres says, ``the community gives back \nto the school and the school gives back to the community--it's not just \na situation of taking, it's the concept of giving that makes a \ndifference.''\n  In another New Mexico community far to the south of Albuquerque near \nthe Texas border is a medium-sized town, Las Cruces, that has embraced \nCharacter Counts in both its private and public schools, and within the \ncommunity itself.\n  As an example, the Las Cruces University Hills Elementary School \nsends parents regularly scheduled communications and newsletters \nexplaining new Character Counts initiatives. Each month the school \nfocuses on one of the six pillars with a school-wide assembly to kick \noff each new pillar. Teachers include the words in lessons throughout \nthe school day, each day of the month. The students are urged to \ndiscuss their experiences and how the concepts relate to their daily \nlives. The school's monthly newsletters report how students identify \nwith the various pillars.\n  I believe the children's own words best express how they apply the \nCharacter Counts concepts to their daily lives:\n  ``Citizenship is caring about our country and other people * * * Make \nthe community a better place by cleaning the environment and taking \ncare of it. Take care of nature, animals, plants, and land. Be a nice \nneighbor.''\n  Jammal: ``In our group respect means treating one another equally, \neven if they are not good looking, handicapped, or if they're slow. \nShowing respect means not being bossy and treating people fairly. I \nrespect people for what they are, and all their different abilities. \nWhen I show respect, I am kind and polite to people. My way of showing \nrespect is by manners and helping others.''\n  Brenna, Karina, Christopher, Spencer and Shoji: ``If you want to be a \nrespectful person, then it's a good time to start knowing about respect \nand be one to the end. Be polite and the world will be safe once again. \nIf you respect others, respect is what you will get back.''\n  Tyrel: Sometimes we forget that each and every day there are ways of \npracticing good character traits. Parents, teachers, civic and business \norganizations, and community leaders are responding with enthusiasm to \nthis fairly simple program of teaching and practicing the tenets of \ngood character.\n  Creative community programs are developed so the messages are not \nconfined to the classrooms but are shared by all citizens. In \nAlbuquerque, a new program Character Counts in the Workplace is \ndesigned to apply the Six Pillars to workplace ethics. In Lea County, \nthe Character Counts Board of Directors meets monthly to coordinate \nactivities, with each community independently expanding its Character \nCounts message through its local festivities, service clubs, and \nschools. In Roswell, the Future Homemakers of America of Sierra Middle \nSchool, using the lessons learned about caring, assisted students at \nValley View Elementary School with holiday crafts projects.\n  In April, the State of New Mexico will host the National Character \nCounts Conference, followed by 2 days of its own State Conference. Just \na quick review of a few of the planned meetings at the New Mexico \nConference tells us of the variety of programs being developed \nthroughout the State: the Police Role in Community Character Counts \nPrograms; Join-A-School Projects--What to Do; Character Counts in the \nWorkplace; At-Risk Youth and Character Counts; School and Community \nYouth Athletics; and Parenting for Character Development. These \nsessions clearly show how broadly-based the Character Counts activities \nhave become throughout the State.\n  When we first introduced the National Character Counts Week \nresolution in 1994, I doubt we could have envisioned how quickly \nparents, teachers, schools, towns, cities, and civic organizations \nwould develop programs to address the issue of character building. It \nhas universal appeal, and it has touched the lives of millions of our \ncitizens. The ``crisis in character'' is being addressed by America's \ncitizens, at the local level, where it matters most. I am very proud to \nbe a part of this effort. Practicing the principles of good character \npays enormous dividends not only to each of us personally but to \ncountless generations in the future.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico, Senator Domenici, my personal friend and dear colleague, \nfor his character and especially his courage in putting forward this \nresolution and in taking the leadership in making sure that this \nresolution is enacted. I am honored to be a cosponsor of the National \nCharacter Council Week resolution.\n  Mr. President, the stories and statistics are painfully familiar; we \nhave all\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\nheard them--children having children, young boys joining gangs out of a \nneed to belong, children as young as 9 years old smoking marijuana or \nshooting up heroin or inhaling freon from the living room air \nconditioner just to find a high.\n  Now the latest figures are in from the Department of Justice: 25,000 \njuveniles murdered between 1985 and 1995. Half of all high school \nstudents who carry a weapon take that weapon to school. Juvenile \narrestees are now more likely, according to the Department of Justice, \nthan adult arrestees to have used a gun in committing a crime.\n  James Agee once said, ``In every child who is born, under no matter \nwhat circumstances * * *  the potentiality of the human race is born \nagain.''\n  Mr. President, how many times have we heard that our children are the \nfuture of our country? I believe that our highest obligation is, and \nour biggest challenge is, with the children of America. We can work \ntogether to help ensure that all children will start school ready to \nlearn. We can pool our efforts--parents, teachers, community leaders, \nand elected officials--to enable our students to be first in the world \nof scientific and academic achievement. But I believe the greatest gift \nand most effective tool we can give to our children is to instill in \nthem, from the beginning, the values and beliefs which mold their \ncharacter. Character is the essential building block in each \nyoungster's journey to become a responsible, moral adult.\n  George Matthew Adams once said:\n\n       There is no such thing as a ``self-made'' man. We are made \n     up of thousands of others. Everyone who has ever done a kind \n     deed for us, or spoken one word of encouragement to us, has \n     entered into the makeup of our character, and of our \n     thoughts, as well as our success.\n\n  Robert Kennedy credited his father with shaping his beliefs about \nwhat the definition of true character is. He said:\n\n       He has called on the best that was in us. There was no such \n     thing as half-trying. Whether it was running a race or \n     catching a football, or competing in school, we were to try. \n     We might not be the best, and none of us were, but we were to \n     make the best effort to be the best.\n\n  For Ronald Reagan, it was his mother, Nelle, who was his source of \ninspiration. He said about his mother:\n\n       My mother, God rest her soul, had an unshakable faith in \n     God's goodness. And while I may not have realized it in my \n     youth, I know now that she planted that faith very deeply in \n     me.\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution. It \ncalls on our citizens and communities to teach and promote the core \nelements of character: trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, \nfairness, caring and citizenship.\n  Decades ago, during the war in Korea, one of our generals was \ncaptured by the Communists. He was taken to an isolated prison camp and \ntold that he had but a few minutes to write a letter to his family. The \nimplication was that he was to be executed shortly. The general's \nletter was brief and to the point: ``Tell Bill,'' he wrote, ``the word \nis integrity.''\n  The word is indeed integrity, Mr. President. As our resolution \nstates, ``the character of a nation is only as strong as the character \nof its individual citizens.'' If this is so, Mr. President--and I hope \nit is and I think it will be--the future of this country will be in \nvery good hands.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased this morning to join with the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico and a group of my colleagues in \ncosponsoring this Senate Resolution designating October 18th through \n24th as National Character Counts Week.\n  Nothing that we do in this country will have a more direct impact on \nour collective future than how we educate our children. And as the face \nof our society changes, and children are faced with modern problems \nlike illegal drug use and violence, we should look at ways to expand \nour traditional definition of education. We must recognize that \neducation should be more than the transmission off acts. It ought to be \nmore than the relaying of concepts. Education should also seek to \ndevelop the moral character of our children. Schools need to reinforce \nthe lessons that children are taught at home. Education must help teach \nyoung people what they need to know to be good citizens in our society. \nStrengthening the mind is not enough. We must also nurture the \ncharacter.\n  That is why so many of us in the Senate come to the Floor each year \nto speak in support of character education in our schools. We believe \nthat it is entirely appropriate for schools to instruct students on the \nimportance of qualities like trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, \nfairness, caring, and citizenship. This is not a substitute for \ndisciplined instruction in reading, math, composition, and other \nsubjects. This is simply an effort to instill in our young people the \nvalues that we cherish in a civil society.\n  I have been working on character education issues for about 5 years \nnow, and all of my experiences with this initiative have reinforced my \nbelief that this is a good idea that can have a positive impact in the \nlives of our children. In 1994, I Introduced a character education \namendment to the elementary and secondary education bill when it was \nbeing considered by the Labor Committee. This amendment was adopted, \nand it provided funding for schools to start character education \ncurriculums.\n  Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of visiting schools \nin Connecticut that have received some of these funds and begun \nteaching character education. In each and every classroom, I have seen \nthe positive impact that these programs are having in our children's \nlives. Children, as well as teachers and parents, are responding \nenthusiastically to these lessons, and the result has been better \nattendance, higher academic performance, and improved behavior among \nour students. Character education may be a relatively new initiative, \nbut these programs are already reaching 100,000 students in the State \nof Connecticut alone. And character education is not only making a \ndifference in my home State, but all over the country as many of my \ncolleagues can confirm.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``To educate a person's mind and not \nhis character is to educate a menace.'' It is imperative that we build \na society whose institutions will help support a strong ethical \nupbringing for our children, and character education should be a \ncritical component of our efforts to reach that goal.\n  Again, I commend my friend and colleague from New Mexico for all of \nhis work in this area. And I invite all my colleagues from both sides \nof the aisle to join us in supporting National Character Counts week \nand embracing character education as a vital means of molding better \nindividual, strengthening families and creating a responsible American \ncitizenry.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Domenici in \nsponsoring the 1998 Character Counts Week resolution. As an original \nmember of the Character Counts Coalition here in the United States \nSenate, it has been my honor to cosponsor Character Counts Week every \nyear since 1994.\n  In the past we learned the Golden Rule and were taught how to act by \nour parents and teachers or at Sunday School, and the community helped \nreinforce acceptable conduct. Today, because there are so many who \ndon't have a chance to grow up in that kind of environment, we must \ndevelop alternative ways of teaching and learning how to behave in a \nfree society.\n  Former United States Deputy Under Secretary of Education, Dr. Peter \nR. Greer, wrote an article, called ``Teaching Virtue,'' published in \nEducation Week, February 4, 1998. In his article, he describes his \nexperiences in developing effective curriculum for teaching ethics and \ncharacter in kindergarten through grade twelve. He found that one of \nthe most troublesome aspects for teachers to overcome was their \nreluctance to identify right and wrong. He also found that teaching \nvirtues had to be a school-wide and a community-wide commitment.\n  The Character Counts! Coalition began as an effort to put values \neducation at the top of the national agenda. The values are called \n``Pillars of Character,'' and they are: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship.\n  The core elements of good character reflect a consensus that was \nreached by eminent and diverse educators and youth leaders who thought \nthe pillars would be widely understood, accepted and effective.\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\n  The Coalition is made up of over 180-member organizations who \ncollectively pursue the goal of teaching that character does count and \nis essential for our nation's survival and success. Included in this \ngroup are the American Association of School Administrators, American \nRed Cross, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Little League Baseball, 4-\nH, National Honor Society and many regional and community-based \norganizations. They are all working to build awareness of the pillars \nof character and to encourage their teaching ``from the family room to \nthe school room to the locker room.''\n  In my state of Mississippi, Ocean Springs is a Character Counts \nCommunity. The Chamber of Commerce sponsors programs that stress the \nimportance of making good character traits an intrinsic part of the \nlives of students, teachers, administrators, and citizens.\n  The Ocean Springs Character Counts Business Club members display \nCharacter Counts stickers in their windows and help raise funds for the \nChamber of Commerce. Each year, those funds are used for programs and \nmaterials to train teachers in the Ocean Springs public schools on \nbetter ways to incorporate character education into their regular \ncurriculum.\n  The programs are designed for repetition and emphasize action and \nbehavior. Youngsters are encouraged to express their thoughts about \ncharacter through essays, poems, songs, artwork, posters or videos.\n  I am very proud of the people of Ocean Springs, Mississippi. They \nunderstand that teaching good character begins at home, but it must be \nreinforced at school and by the entire community.\n  Character Counts! Week is October 18-24 this year. I hope that \ncommunities will use this as a time for new and renewed commitments to \ncharacter education.\n  If we all practiced what Character Counts teaches, America would be \nbetter indeed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nresolution submitted by my colleague Senator Domenici to designate \nOctober 18 through October 24, 1998 as ``National Character Counts \nWeek.''\n  I have cosponsored this resolution for the past four years and I am \nhonored to do so again this year.\n  Character is an increasingly important issue in our society. I \nbelieve character counts. It counts in our homes, our schools, and our \nneighborhoods.\n  I believe character is the foundation of our society and will \ncontinue to be into the next century. I have been concerned that we \nhave gone from being a progressive society to being a permissive \nsociety.\n  Character shapes how we behave in our families, in our own \ncommunities, and in our own workplaces.\n  Character education helps our children grow into responsible and \ncaring adults. But character must be taught. It is our responsibility \nto teach character to children.\n  In this day and age of juvenile crime, particularly crime in schools, \na renewed commitment to character education is even more important for \nour society.\n  Character development should be taught along with other core academic \nsubjects. The state of Maryland has encourage the inclusion of \ncharacter education in schools. I support this approach.\n  There are six pillars of character: trustworthiness, respect, \nresponsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship. These are values \nthat last a lifetime.\n  Our country was built on the foundation of virtue and value. These \nare the ties that bind and the habits of the heart. Character \nencourages self-respect and the respect of others.\n  I believe in supporting character education as much as possible. In \nmaking sure that character counts, we will create the habits of the \nmind and the habits of the heart that will be the social glue that will \nhold our society together.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution. I believe \nin support for character education. It is even more crucial as we enter \nthe next century.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the National Character Counts week resolutions submitted by \nmy esteemed colleague, Senator Domenici. I have cosponsored similar \nresolutions for the past 4 years and am honored to have the opportunity \nto do so again this year.\n  I stand before you today, because children and adults alike are \nconstantly being bombarded by violence, profanity, and immorality, both \nthrough the media and in every day life. This onslaught of negative \nimages and expressions has expanded the issue of character from a \ncasual concern to a matter of considerable social importance. During my \ntenure in the Senate it has been my goal, and the goal of many of my \ncolleagues, to raise awareness of the importance of raising our younger \ngenerations in an atmosphere of strong principles. I can think of few \nthings we could do to better achieve this goal than to bring the \nattributes of good character to a level that will be admired by our \nchildren. If, through our own actions, we demonstrate the value, and \nindeed the necessity, of good character, we may help turn future \ngenerations away from the all too often glamorized visions of \nunscrupulous activities.\n  As a father, I am concerned that the role models our nation's \nchildren seek for leadership and guidance do not exemplify the \nintegrity and character that most parents would condone. As an elected \nleader, I believe it is my job, and the obligation of my colleagues, to \ntake an initial step to reinvigorate the attributes of character--\ntrustworthiness, respect, responsibility, justice and fairness, caring, \ncivic virtue, and citizenship--which National Character Counts Week \nhighlights. We need to regain these qualities in our communities, in \nour families, and in the development of our own lives.\n  Mr. President, as we watch our children blossom into the leaders of \nthe future it is my hope that each and every one of them will be able \nto look up to individuals who epitomize the values and attributes that \nare represented by National Character Counts Week. I am proud to stand \nwith my fellow colleagues today, to discuss the importance of having \ngenuine character. The simple step of raising awareness of the value of \ngood character can have a powerful and long lasting impact. In the \nwords of President Ronald Reagan, ``They say the world has become far \ntoo complex for simple answers. They are wrong. There are no easy \nanswers, but there are simple answers. We must have the courage to do \nwhat we know is morally right.''\n  Mr. President, I believe by standing before you today, the supporters \nof National Character Counts Week are taking the initial step in \naccomplishing what is morally right. We are, however, only a single \npiece in the puzzle. My colleagues and I, along with civic \norganizations around the Nation, are only emissaries of a message. The \ntrue fundamental values that will instill character in our children \nmust begin at home. No amount of moral instruction from outside the \nhome can replace the guidance of a loving and supportive family.\n  Recognizing a national week to stress the importance of character is \nbut a small step in addressing the crisis of ethics the Nation faces. \nAt the same time, it is an important step which I believe all of us \nshould support. I would like to thank Senator Domenici for his \ncontinued leadership on National Character Counts Week, and urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S772-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S776-S777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SENATE RESOLUTION 177--RELATIVE TO PRISONERS OF WAR\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, \nMr. Lott, Mr. Hagel, and Ms. Moseley-Braun) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, Saturday, February 14, has a \nspecial significance: it is the first National Donor Day to promote the \nFive Points of Life, gifts that we can give others to help save lives. \nThe Five Points of Life are whole blood, platelets, bone marrow, \numbilical cord blood, and organ/tissue transplants; gifts of these \nvaluable resources have been responsible for saving numerous lives.\n  The National Donor Day was developed by a partnership of the Saturn \nMotor Company, one of the leading corporations in my home state of \nTennessee, and the United Auto Workers. The National Donor Day has the \nstrong support of the Department of Health and Human Services and the \nenthusiastic cooperation of other volunteer associations, such as the \nAmerican Red Cross, America's Blood Centers, National Marrow Donor \nProgram, National Minority Organ/Tissue Transplant Education Program, \nthe Transplant Recipients International Organization, Coalition on \nDonation, and Rotary International.\n  On National Donor Day, February 14, all Saturn automobile dealerships \nwill be participating in a program to promote donation of the Five \nPoints of Life. Blood donor drives will be conducted, and registration \nforms will be available to sign up as an organ donor or bone marrow \ndonor.\n  This type of public/private partnership is the key to solving the \nshortage of donors. The stocks of whole blood and platelets have to be \nconstantly replaced so their life-saving components will be available \nto the millions who use them. There are over 56,000 people on the \nwaiting list for organ transplants, and ten die each day because organs \nare not available to save their lives. The National Marrow Donor \nProgram has over 2.6 million people registered, but still there are \nmany people who need bone marrow donation who are unable to find a \nsuitable match among these individuals. Medical science has developed \nways to save peoples' lives by using these resources, but unless \neveryone helps by offering the gift of Five Points of Life, all the \nskills of our doctors and physicians are for nought.\n  In response to this need for the Five Points of Life, people from all \nover the country are stepping up to meet the call. Tom Meredith from \nNashville is a donor dad whose tragedy at the loss of two children was \nsomewhat alleviated by the thought that their donated organs benefitted \n97 people. Dr. Kenneth\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nMoritsugu, an Assistant Surgeon General of the United States, is a \ndonor husband and donor dad who tells movingly how organs donated by \nhis wife and daughter, who were killed in separate traffic accidents, \nbrought life to many others.\n  Mr. President, this altruism in the face of despair is a challenge to \nus all to become donors and give a gift of the Five Points of Life. I \nonly wish all of you had the chance to see first-hand, as I have, the \nlook of joy on the face of a child who, after receiving a transplant, \nno longer has to gasp for breath. As we give gifts of love to our \nspouses and sweethearts this Saturday, Valentine's Day, let us promise \nto give another gift of love to others we may not even know, the \ngreatest gift of all, the gift of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S778-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SOUTH DAKOTANS DEPLOYED TO THE PERSIAN GULF\n\n   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto thank the brave South Dakotans who are part of the latest deployment \nof American troops to the Persian Gulf. The men and women from \nEllsworth Air Force Base and the South Dakota Air National Guard embody \nthe spirit of all Americans by assisting the international effort to \nrid Iraq of nuclear and biological weapons.\n  Saddam Hussein's deportation of United Nations weapons inspectors and \nhis continued obstruction of international monitoring efforts clearly \nshow that Iraq does not desire to live by international rules of peace \nand commerce.\n  We now face the possibility of using force against Saddam Hussein to \nensure that Iraq does not develop the capability to make and use \nweapons of mass destruction, and our thoughts and prayers are with our \nAmerican troops stationed overseas and their families back home. We \nhave faith in the readiness of our troops and know that, if called \nupon, they will succeed in their mission. The 114th Fighter Wing of the \nSouth Dakota Air National Guard will be enforcing the no-fly zone over \nsouthern Iraq, a task they have performed since 1992. The recent \ndeployment is also a historic occasion for Ellsworth Air Force Base \nbecause it marks the first time B-1 bombers have been deployed in a \npotential military conflict.\n  I am a strong supporter of the National Guard working alongside \nactive duty personnel in response to future emergencies, both at home \nand abroad. The Persian Gulf War was the truest test of this strategy \nand illustrated the Guard's ability to be trained, mobilized, deployed, \nfight alongside active duty personnel, and demobilized in response to a \nnational emergency. As you know, Mr. President, South Dakota National \nGuard participated in that impressive effort.\n  The National Guard's effectiveness further proved itself in the \nnatural disasters of the past few years. Our state is indebted to the \nNational Guard for its stellar performance in the recent past in \nhelping communities deal with crises ranging from flood waters to snow \ndrifts.\n  I join all South Dakotans in wishing our troops from Ellsworth Air \nForce Base and the South Dakota Air National Guard a safe and \nsuccessful completion of their mission as they protect our interests \noverseas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S779-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WOMEN'S RIGHTS NATIONAL HISTORIC TRAIL ACT\n\n   Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan to \nintroduce the ``Women's Rights National Historic Trail Act'' which \nauthorizes that the Secretary of the Interior study alternatives for \nestablishing a national historic trail to commemorate and interpret the \nhistory of women's rights. New York has that history.\n  In 1848, despite social, legal and economic constraints, the action \nof several women from New York led to a movement that would eventually \nprovide freedom to women across this country and for generations to \ncome.\n  In Seneca Falls, 1848, the first Women's Rights Convention was held \nleading the way for the 19th Amendment which granted women the right to \nvote. On July 19th, the first day of the two day convention, the \nDeclaration of Sentiments was read at the convention promoting the \nright to vote, the right for a woman to attain a higher education, the \nright to own property and the right to retain one's own wages--some of \nthe most fundamental principles of our democracy. As stated by \nElizabeth Cady Stanton, one of the leaders of the convention, ``We hold \nthese truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created \nequal.''\n  The other leaders of the Convention including Lucretia Mott, Jane \nHunt, Ann M'Clintock and Martha Wright began the movement to fulfill \nthe freedom of Americans by changing the treatment of women in American \nsociety.\n  I support the designation of a corridor commemorating the triumphs of \nthese and other women, and believe that the Buffalo-Boston trail \ndeserves serious consideration. Areas like Seneca Falls, where we can \nfind the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House, and her church, the Old Trinity \nChurch, I believe, should be part of the historical trail for women's \nhistory. Other areas in New York have a tremendous historical \nsignificance for women's rights including: the Susan B. Anthony House, \nvoting site and gravesite in Rochester and the M'Clintock House where \nthe idea of a convention was conceived and the Declaration of \nSentiments was written.\n  This bill only requires the Secretary to study the alternatives \navailable to him and does not dictate where that commemoration occurs. \nBut the events that occurred the summer of 1848 should be remembered \nand treated as part of a historical connection. The importance of \nSeneca Falls is key in the advancement of the rights of women in our \nnation and that is why I have also joined with Senator Moynihan in June \n1997 to introduce a S. Con. Res. 35, urging the U.S. Postal Service to \nissue a commemorative postage stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary \nof the first Women's Right Convention.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Moynihan in this effort to preserve the \nhistorical significance of women's rights in New York and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in co-sponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S779-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S779-S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HARRY S. ASHMORE: COURAGEOUS JOURNALIST\n\n   Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the revered journalist Harry \nAshmore died last month at the age of 81. He died one day after the day \nset aside to observe Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday and our \nnation's bitter struggle for civil rights. Mr. Ashmore was a leader in \nthe struggle to integrate schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. His \nwritings helped deliver Americans peacefully from unjust and oppressive \nlaws.\n  A native of Greenville, South Carolina, Mr. Ashmore was raised to \nrevere Southern traditions. His grandfathers fought for the \nConfederacy. As a young man, he was graduated from Clemson Agricultural \nCollege and then worked as a reporter in Greenville and in Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina. He served during the Second World War as an infantry \nbattalion commander in the European theater and completed his military \nservice a Lieutenant Colonel. After the war, he returned to North \nCarolina and to The Charlotte News, where he rose to the position of \neditor. In 1948, he moved to Little Rock and began his eleven years at \nThe Arkansas Gazette. There, he would become The Gazette's executive \neditor.\n  Harry Ashmore loved the South. He embodied the dignity of a southern \ngentlemen throughout his years. But he was never provincial--either in \nhis writing or his thinking. He studied at Harvard University as a \nNieman fellow; from 1960 to 1963, he was editor-in-chief of the \nEncyclopedia Britannica and from 1969 to 1974, he was president of the \nCenter for the Study of Democracy in Santa Barbara, California. In \naddition, he found time to author, co-author and/or edit a dozen books. \nIn 1996, he was honored with the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Lifetime \nAchievement Award.\n  But it was in newspapers where he would have his greatest influence \non American life. In 1957, three years after the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Brown, Arkansas' Governor Orval E. Faubus called out the \nNational Guard because of ``evidence of disorder and threats of \ndisorder.'' As ever, Harry Ashmore called it like he saw it. He \ndescribed\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\nthe eerie scene as, ``the incredible spectacle of an empty high school \nsurrounded by the National Guard, troops called out by Governor Faubus \nto protect life and property against a mob that never materialized.''\n  Ashmore knew Governor Faubus wanted to prevent nine students from \nentering Little Rock High School. He warned against delay, realizing \nthat resisting the Supreme Court would bring bloodshed. In The Gazette, \nhe argued dispassionately for the people of Arkansas to uphold the law. \nHe wrote: ``There is no valid reason to assume that delay will resolve \nthe impasse which Mr. Faubus has made. We doubt that Mr. Faubus can \nsimply wear the Federals out--although he is doing a pretty good job of \nwearing out his own people.'' Harry Ashmore understood before so many \nothers the power and the moral force of civil liberty. And yet, he also \nknew the rooted strength of the opposition.\n  Above all he was honest, to himself and to his readers. Through his \ncalm and reasoned editorials he stood for justice despite daily threats \non his life and on his family. The Gazette suffered financially for his \ncourage. It lost advertising revenue and circulation. Harry Ashmore, \nhowever, fought for his beliefs, and he helped lead Arkansas and the \nNation toward equality for all its citizens. In 1958, the Pulitzer \ncommittee recognized Harry's excellence in editorial writing by \nawarding him the Pulitzer Prize for ``clearness of style, moral \npurpose, sound reasoning, and power to influence public opinion.'' In \naddition to his own Pulitzer, in 1958, The Gazette was awarded the \nPulitzer for public service.\n  Harry Ashmore was on the front lines of the struggle for civil rights \nin this country. His leadership, courage, and wise words must not be \nforgotten.\n  I ask that the New York Times' article on Harry Ashmore from January \n22, 1998, be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 22, 1998]\n\n    Harry S. Ashmore, 81, Whose Editorials Supported Integration in \n                             Arkansas, Dies\n\n                             (By Eric Pace)\n\n       Harry S. Ashmore, who was executive editor of The Arkansas \n     Gazette when he won a Pulitzer Prize for antisegregation \n     editorials he wrote during the crisis and confrontation over \n     admission of black students to a Little Rock high school in \n     1957, died on Tuesday night in the infirmary of the Valle \n     Verde retirement home in Santa Barbara, Calif., where he and \n     his wife moved several years ago. He was 81.\n       He evidently died as the result of a stroke he suffered \n     early this month, his wife, Barbara, said.\n       Mr. Ashmore, a native of South Carolina, was a prominent \n     figure in Southern journalism while he was executive editor \n     of The Gazette--published in Little Rock--from 1948 to 1959. \n     He went on to be the editor in chief of the Encyclopedia \n     Britannica from 1960 to 1963 and president of the Center for \n     the Study of Democratic Institutions, a liberal think tank \n     headquartered in Santa Barbara, from 1969 to 1974.\n       On The Gazette's editorial pages in the eventful days of \n     1957, he argued with controlled but eloquent passion that the \n     law of the land--following the Supreme Court's 1954 ruling \n     that all segregation in public schools was ``inherently \n     unequal''--should be honored and that Arkansans should permit \n     the admission of nine black students who wanted to enter the \n     school under an integration plan drawn up by the Little Rock \n     school board. He contended that resistance was useless.\n       Confrontation loomed when Arkansas' populist Governor, \n     Orval E. Faubus--formerly a boon companion of Mr. Ashmore's--\n     ordered the National Guard to bar the nine from the school. \n     But President Dwight D. Eisenhower gained control of the \n     Guard and ordered Federal troops to be sent to Little Rock to \n     restore order and accompany the nine. And the school became \n     integrated.\n       Well before the crisis, a plan was adopted by the Little \n     Rock school board that restricted integration of the city's \n     schools initially to only one of them, Central High School, \n     and scheduled that for 1957.\n       Tension rose as the integration date approached. Resistance \n     to the plan, called the Phase Program, swelled among white \n     people. Robert Ewing Brown, leader of a segregationist group \n     in Little Rock, said, ``The Negroes have ample and fine \n     schools here, and there is no need for this problem except to \n     satisfy the aims of a few white and Negro revolutionaries.'' \n     And early in 1956, Mr. Faubus declared he could not cooperate \n     in ``any attempt to force acceptance of change to which the \n     people are so overwhelmingly opposed.''\n       In August 1957, someone hurled a stone through the window \n     of an Arkansas N.A.A.C.P. leader, Daisy Bates. An attached \n     note said: ``Stone this time, dynamite next.''\n       In September 1957, the night before Little Rock's schools \n     were to open, Governor Faubus proclaimed that he was going to \n     deploy National Guard troops around Central High School \n     because of ``evidence of disorder and threats of disorder.''\n       And when Central High opened, more than 200 National Guard \n     troops were on guard. As Mr. Ashmore put it in an editorial, \n     there was ``the incredible spectacle of an empty high school \n     surrounded by the National Guard, troops called out by \n     Governor Faubus to protect life and property against a mob \n     that never materialized.''\n       But a 15-year-old black girl, Elizabeth Eckford, who tried \n     to enter the school, recounted later that ``somebody started \n     yelling, `Lynch her! Lynch her!' '' A white woman accompanied \n     her away from the scene.\n       After the nine black teenagers were eventually permitted to \n     begin attending the school and, as Mr. Ashmore wrote in one \n     editorial, ``peacefully attending Central High School under \n     Federal court order and Federal military protection,'' \n     Governor Faubus contended that resolving the crisis required \n     that the nine withdraw from the school. He said that all he \n     wanted was delay in integrating the high school until some \n     unspecified future time.\n       But Mr. Ashmore said in that editorial: ``There is no valid \n     reason to assume that delay will resolve the impasse which \n     Mr. Faubus has made. We doubt that Mr. Faubus can simply wear \n     the Federals out--although he is doing a pretty good job of \n     wearing out his own people.''\n       Yet Mr. Ashmore's approval of integration was limited then, \n     though it became complete later. One of his editorials during \n     the crisis advocated acceptance of the phased desegregation \n     plan worked out by the school board as the handiwork of \n     individuals who felt ``(as we do) they were working to \n     preserve the existing pattern of social segregation'' by \n     coming up with a program which would lead to ``the admission \n     of only a few, carefully screened Negro students to a single \n     white high school.''\n       Recalling those days, Henry Woods, a Federal district judge \n     in Little Rock who was a leading Little Rock lawyer in 1957, \n     said: ``Harry was the central figure in the crisis. He was \n     the leader of the opposition to mob rule, and all of us who \n     opposed Faubus rallied around him. The thing I admire most \n     was the great courage Harry displayed. He received daily \n     threats against his life and his family, but he stood in the \n     breech and held the walls against the barbarians.''\n       During the crisis, Mr. Ashmore's editorials caused declines \n     in advertising revenue and circulation. An unsigned letter \n     was sent to some business people in Little Rock saying that \n     The Gazette, in taking its antisegregation stand, was \n     ``playing a leading role in destroying time-honored \n     traditions that have made up our Southern way of life.''\n       In 1990, Mr. Ashmore, speaking of himself and two other \n     Southern editors of that era, Ralph McGill of The Atlanta \n     Constitution and Hodding Carter of The Delta Democrat-Times \n     of Greenville, Miss., said, ``As refugees of the Old South, \n     we were never comfortable being called liberals or \n     integrationists. Philosophically, we all knew segregation was \n     wrong, but we weren't doctrinaire liberals. I had a \n     temperamental difference with the two of them, though. They \n     were more glandular, more angry about the segregationist \n     abuses, whereas I tended to laugh more at the absurdity of it \n     all.''\n       He also did not take himself too seriously. A former \n     colleague at The Gazette recalled not long ago that after \n     attending a daily afternoon meeting about the paper's news \n     coverage, Mr. Ashmore would go off to write editorials and, \n     as he departed, he would often observe wryly, ``I'm off to \n     think great thoughts.''\n       When Mr. Ashmore won his Pulitzer Prize, The Gazette was \n     given another Pulitzer award, for public service, for its \n     news reporting about the events of 1957. Mr. Ashmore was \n     cited for ``the forcefulness, dispassionate analysis and \n     clarity'' of his editorials during the crisis, and The \n     Gazette was cited for ``demonstrating the highest qualities \n     of civic leadership, journalistic responsibility and moral \n     courage in the face of mounting public tension.''\n       In 1991 the newspaper ceased publication, and its \n     competitor, The Arkansas Democrat, acquired its assets and \n     became The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The paper's editorial \n     page editor, Paul Greenberg, said yesterday that Mr. Ashmore \n     ``was a part of the great epic of The Gazette's courageous \n     stand in coverage of the Central High crisis of 1957.'' Mr. \n     Greenberg, who won a 1969 Pulitzer Prize for editorials on \n     race that he wrote for The Pine Bluff Commercial of Arkansas, \n     said: ``He will always be a much admired figure in Arkansas \n     journalism. No account of Arkansas history will ever be \n     complete without mentioning Harry Ashmore.''\n       Mr. Ashmore wrote, was co-author or editor of a dozen \n     books. Over the years, he was also in the active leadership \n     of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the Fund for \n     the Republic, the Committee for an Effective Congress, the \n     American Civil Liberties Union and other national \n     organizations.\n       He received the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Lifetime \n     Achievement Award in 1996.\n       Harry Scott Ashmore was born in Greenville, S.C. He became \n     aware of black people's problems partly when he became a \n     summer laborer on a cotton farm. He went on to graduate in \n     1937 from Clemson Agricultural College in Clemson, S.C., \n     worked for some southern newspapers and studied as a Nieman \n     Fellow in Journalism at Harvard.\n       During World War II he served with the Army in France and \n     elsewhere and rose to\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\n     the rank of lieutenant colonel. After the war he rose to \n     become editor of The Charlotte News in North Carolina. He \n     went to The Arkansas Gazette as editor of its editorial page \n     in 1947 and was promoted to executive editor.\n       In addition to his wife, the former Barbara Edith Laier, \n     whom he married in 1940, Mr. Ashmore is survived by a \n     daughter, Anne Ashmore of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S779-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PRAISING CRAIG A.

He is well known to be a dedicated and conscientious staff member \nwho, like many staff members, has spent countless hours of energy, \ntime, and effort in producing bills, reports, and hearings. During his \nstewardship of our subcommittee, Craig has continued the tradition of \nbipartisanship in the formulation of this very important bill. He \nunderstands the many needs of the American people and sought \nconstructive solutions to better enable our government to address those \nneeds. He devoted considerable time helping individual constituents and \ninforming the public about the work of the subcommittee.\n  Craig has earned the respect of the leadership of these agencies and \nof the Members and staff of the Senate by being fair, responsive, and \nhelpful. Both Democrats and Republicans have trusted his advice and \ncounsel as our subcommittee confronted the many issues.\n  In his new position at NIH, Craig will no doubt continue his \noutstanding work in advancing the promise of genome research. With his \nprofessionalism and legislative experience, he brings to the task \nexceptional talent and energy, and I have the highest degree of \nconfidence that his ability and dedication will continue his remarkable \nrecord of excellence.\n  I would take this opportunity again to thank Craig for his service to \nour subcommittee. As a devoted father to his children, Keith and \nKristin, and husband to his wife, Wendy, Craig, like the many other \nparents in our workforce, has balanced home life with career. In many \nways, his work in the Senate is motivated in large part in securing a \nstronger future for all families, including his own. I join my Senate \ncolleagues in wishing Craig well and we expect for him to continue the \nhighest traditions of excellence at his new post at the National Human \nGenome Research Institute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S781-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CRS PRODUCTS OVER THE INTERNET\n\n   Mr. LEAHY.

CRS performs \ninvaluable research and produces first-rate reports on hundreds of \ntopics. The taxpayers of this country, who pay CRS's annual budget of \n$60 million, deserve speedy access to these wonderful resources.\n  I understand that the staff at CRS has raised some questions about \nhow this bill may affect their charter mandate to provide \n``confidential analysis and information exclusively for Congressional \nclients.'' I want to work with Senator McCain, the other cosponsors of \nthis bill and the Senate Rules Committee to ensure that Members who \nrequest confidential research have control over the release of that \nresearch. But we can do both--protect truly confidential research and \ngive our citizens electronic access to non-confidential CRS products.\n  I want to commend the Senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership \non opening public access to Congressional documents. I share his desire \nfor the American people to have electronic access to many more \nCongressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the days \nto come on harnessing the power of the information age to open up the \nhalls of Congress to all our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S781-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REGULATING DUNGENESS CRAB HARVEST ON THE WEST COAST\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to state that I \nintend, with my colleague from Washington state, Senator Murray, to \nintroduce legislation shortly after this recess to ensure fair \nmanagement of Dungeness crab on the West Coast. The legislation is \nsupported by the Pacific Fishery Management Council, and represents an \nagreement reached by industry representatives, tribal representatives, \nand state fishery management agencies in Washington, Oregon, and \nCalifornia. The legislation will extend and expand the current interim \nauthority for these states to manage Dungeness crab beyond three miles \nfrom their shores.\n  Historically, the crab fisheries off the coasts of California, \nOregon, and Washington have been managed by the three states, and \nthrough cooperative agreements between them. The state jurisdiction, \nhowever, extends only to three miles. This limitation is particularly \nsignificant in Washington state, where approximately 60-80 percent of \nthe crab is caught beyond three miles. While states can regulate their \nown fishermen beyond three miles, they have not historically been able \nto regulate fishermen from other states.\n  Although Washington, Oregon, and California have all adopted limited \nentry programs to conserve and manage crab, Oregon vessels can and do \nfish for Dungeness crab in waters more than three miles off Washington, \nand, until interim authority was granted in 1996 in the Sustainable \nFisheries Act, Washington could not regulate these vessels. The same, \nof course, was true of Washington vessels fishing off the coast of \nOregon.\n  The problem with the inability to manage out-of-state vessels beyond \nthree miles became critical in 1995, when a Federal district court \nallocated a large portion of the crab to Indian tribes, and threatened \nin this way to deprive non-tribal fishermen, who have been fishing for \ngenerations, of their livelihoods. Without the ability to regulate \nvessels from Oregon, all of the allocation to the tribes would come \nfrom Washington non-tribal fishermen. This simply is not fair. The bill \nI will introduce will continue to give the fishery managers in Oregon, \nCalifornia, and Washington, the authority to regulate all crabbers \nequally in the exclusive economic zone adjacent to the state. This \nregulatory authority will help to ensure that the cost of the tribal \nallocation will be borne more fairly by all commercial crabbers who \nfish in the EEZ adjacent to Washington, not just crabbers whose vessels \nare registered in the state.\n  As I mentioned, in 1996, I succeeded in obtaining a provision in the \nSustainable Fisheries Act, which gave limited interim authority to the \nWest Coast states to manage the Dungeness crab fishery beyond three \nmiles. This interim authority expires in 1999. It was anticipated that \nthe Pacific Council would, by that time, prepare a Fishery Management \nPlan that could be delegated to the states. The Council has determined, \nhowever, through a careful, public, and inclusive process, that, given \nthe unique nature of the West Coast fisheries in which you have \neffective state management, cooperation among the states, and agreement \non the legislation I will introduce, there is no need for Federal \nmanagement of this fishery.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure quick passage \nof the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S781-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S781-S782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PHILIP HITCH\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Defense Department and \nCongress recently lost an able and dedicated adviser. Mr. Philip Hitch, \nDepartment of\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nDefense Deputy General Counsel for Fiscal Matters died recently at the \nage of 52. Phil had served the Department of Defense for 27 years in a \nnumber of positions.\n  Mr. Hitch began his career in the Army, serving from 1971 to 1975 as \nan Assistant Staff Judge Advocate for the Military Traffic Management \nCommand. Upon leaving the Army in 1975, he represented the Office of \nthe Counsel for the Navy Comptroller. He became the Counsel for the \nNavy Comptroller in 1981.\n  In 1992, Philip Hitch became the Deputy General Counsel for Fiscal \nMatters for the Department of Defense. In this role, Phil served the \nDefense Department capably by supporting DOD's legislative proposals \nregarding financial matters. Equally important, at a time of \nsignificant Congressional activity in the areas of Defense navigate its \nway through the process of change.\n  However, few know that the Congress, particularly the Senate \nAppropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense, relied heavily on \nPhil for advice on general provisions and other financial legislation \nunder consideration. In this sensitive and occasionally conflicting \nrole, Phil was able to provide thoughtful and precise legal counsel \nwhile maintaining the trust the Committee needed in the delicate task \nof seeking Defense Department views on legislative proposals. In this \nrole, Phil was able to make a significant contribution to the nation's \ndefense acquisition process, serving both the Defense Department and \ncommittee on Appropriations as confidant and counsel.\n  In a busy town dominated by people seeking to be heard and \nrecognized, Phil Hitch generally sought neither. Indeed, one of Phil's \nstrong qualities as his willingness to take time and listen to all \naspects of the issue at hand. When asked for his advice, it was clear \nand concise--formulated to make the process of managing fiscal legal \nmatters more productive for the nation as a whole.\n  Fortunately, I can tell you that the quality of Phil's work was \nrecognized through his receipt of the Presidential Rank Award for \nMeritorious Service and the Navy Distinguished Service Award.

Mr. President, one hundred years ago this Sunday, \nFebruary 15, a tragic event took place in Havana harbor which claimed \nthe lives of 260 officers and crew and hurtled our nation into war. I \nrise today to remember the U.S.S. Maine on the 100th anniversary of her \ndestruction, and to honor the memories of those brave men who died in \nservice aboard that mighty ship.\n  True to her namesake's motto, ``Dirigo'', or ``I Lead'', the Maine \nwas one of the first surface combatants to be designated as a \nbattleship. When she was commissioned in 1895 she was, at 319 feet in \nlength, the largest ship ever built in a U.S. Navy shipyard. A state-\nof-the-art vessel, the Maine was showcased in many ceremonial events \nand was the pride of the U.S. Navy.\n  Then, on February 15, 1898, destiny called upon the U.S.S. Maine, her \nofficers and her crew. On that night--a quiet and still evening by \naccounts from survivors--an explosion shattered the tranquility of \nHavana Harbor and tore through the Maine, blowing apart her berthing \ndeck and hurling much of her starboard side into the water. After \nseveral smaller explosions in the ship's magazines, only 88 men \nremained among the living, and the United States and Spain were one \ngiant step closer to war.\n  Soon after the tragedy, eight more men died and in the weeks \nfollowing six more deaths would be attributed to injuries suffered \naboard the Maine. Initial Navy reports suspected a mine sank the Maine, \nbut urged caution until further investigations could be conducted. The \noutrage surrounding the incident was taking on a life of its own, \nhowever, as papers throughout America reported to a stunned and \noutraged nation that the pride of our Navy had been destroyed by an \nenemy mine set in Havana Harbor with the sole and deadly purpose of \nsinking the Maine.\n  On March 23, 1898, a Navy board officially concluded that it was, in \nfact, a mine that put the Maine on the bottom of Havana Harbor. By \nApril, the infamous expression ``Remember the Maine'' became a rallying \ncry for a nation and by the end of that month, President McKinley had \nordered a naval blockade which precipitated a formal declaration of war \nby the U.S. Congress against Spain.\n  The Captain of the U.S.S. Maine, Captain Charles Sigsbee, who \nsurvived the tragedy, put the scope of the U.S.S. Maine disaster in \nperspective after the Spanish-American War ended. He said: ``During the \nrecent war with Spain, about 75 men were killed and wounded in the \nUnited States Navy. Only 17 were killed. On board the Maine, 252 men \nwere killed outright and eight died later--nearly fifteen times as many \nas were killed in the United States Navy by the Spanish land and naval \nforces during the entire war.''\n  We may never know precisely why the Maine met her end that night one \nhundred years ago. Today, controversy still surrounds the original \ntheory that it was a mine that sank her. Indeed, a 1976 report compiled \nby the order of Admiral Hyman Rickover concluded that it was an \ninternal fire in a coal bunker next to the Maine's powder magazines \nthat led to the fatal explosion. More recently, tests results reported \nin National Geographic magazine, based on a careful computer analysis \nof photographs of the twisted hull, proved inconclusive.\n  While the means by which she met her end may always be a mystery, one \nthing is for certain: there will never be a debate about her place in \nhistory. And there will never be a debate about the bravery of those \nsouls lost aboard the Maine in a flash of fire and chaos.\n  That is why we remember the Maine. Captain Sigsbee, knowing of the \ncontroversy surrounding the cause of the explosion and its \nconsequences, admonished us to recall the most honorable reason to \nremember her: ``In the way that the men of the Maine suffered there was \nenough of the heroic to provide a sound foundation for the motto, \n``Remember the Maine''.\n  And so we do so today, and always. Remembrance events are scheduled \nto take place across the country: at Arlington Cemetery, in Bangor, \nMaine--where the shield and scroll of the ship rest today, in Central \nPark in New York City, in Key West, Florida, and at the Naval Academy \nin Annapolis, Maryland. Liz Henning, Midshipman at the Naval Academy, \nwill likely be there: in the recent National Geographic story on the \nMaine, she was quoted as saying, ``We still think about those guys on \nthe Maine * * * Navy people never forget''.\n  Nor will Mainers ever forget. In Bangor, an appropriate memorial to \nthe Maine reminds us of that fateful day one hundred years ago. In the \nBlaine House in Augusta--the Governor's residence--the silver soup \ntureen and vegetable dish from the original U.S.S. Maine, along with \nthe loving cup, have been displayed for the past 70 years and have \nbecome one of our state's most unique treasures. The story of the \nrecovery of these pieces from the bottom of the ocean in Havana Harbor \nhas always brought a look of awe and amazement to the eyes of Maine's \nchildren, and it was always clear to me that these pieces are our \nliving link to Maine's maritime heritage.\n  And now, I am proud to say that the U.S. Postal Service will help \nkeep the spirit of those lost on the Maine alive. Key West, Florida, \none of the last ports of call for the U.S.S. Maine, and the place where \nmany of the brave Americans who died aboard the Maine are buried, is \nthe location for the First Day and City of Issue for the stamp. Key \nWest will host a first-day ceremony and will use a distinctive First \nDay of Issue cancellation.\n  I would like to thank Postmaster General Marvin Runyon for agreeing \nto my request for a special, limited advance release this weekend of \nthe Postal Service stamp commemorating the centennial of the sinking of \nthe Maine. The stamp will be distributed during the U.S.S. Maine \nCentennial observance in Bangor. Rather than the First Day of Issue \ncancellation, the stamps will be canceled with a special pictorial of \nthe U.S.S. Maine designed in Bangor.\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\n  This and other centennial celebrations will ensure that the Maine \nwill indeed not be forgotten--nor will those aboard who made the \nultimate sacrifice. They answered the call when their country needed \nthem, and we must honor their memories with our respect and \nremembrance. As a Mainer and a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I have nothing but the utmost respect for the men and women \nwho throughout history have risked their lives and invested their \ncareers in our armed forces.\n  In that light, let us keep their memory alive, and let us ensure that \nfuture generations will understand and appreciate the legacy of the \nU.S.S. Maine, and the tragic sacrifice of her gallant crew. Let us \nremember the Maine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S782-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OLYMPIAN ERIC BERGOUST\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize an \nOlympian from the great state of Montana. Eric Bergoust, a Western \nMontana native from Missoula, will represent our nation next week in \nthe 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.\n  Eric, 28, is a freestyle aerialist skier--a sport that requires \nathletes to launch themselves off a snow ski ramp, twist and turn their \nbody in mid-air and land on the slope below. You certainly cannot \nappreciate the physical requirements of this sport until you are able \nto see it. And the landings don't always end up feet down. Watch the \nsport long enough and you are bound to see an unplanned landing.\n  But Eric is not new to the challenges of freestyle aerial skiing. \nEric was profiled on network television earlier this week during a look \nat the 1998 Winter Olympics. The profile included photos of Eric diving \noff the roof of his parents' Missoula home into mattresses on the \nground below. Mr. President, I am happy to see that Eric's adventurous \nspirit is now compensated and insured.\n  When I was a kid, we also had to be creative to fill our time, but my \nfeet stayed on the ground and rarely reached a height higher than the \nstirrups of a tall horse.\n  Although he has claimed his share of injuries from the physically \ndemanding sport, I am proud to claim Eric as a native Montanan. He has \nrepresented our state well in world class events.\n  Eric is participating in his second Olympic games and has matured \ninto one of the sport's premiere athletes. Last month, Eric won a World \nCup event in British Columbia and is at the top of the World Cup \nstanding entering the Olympics.\n  I've sent Eric a telegram wishing him well next week in the freestyle \naerial events. I wanted to make sure my colleagues and the American \npeople are aware of Eric's roots and the Montana spirit that drives him \nto be the world's best in his sport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S783-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JANE JOHNSON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, throughout the years, I have had the \nopportunity to criss-cross the State of Connecticut countless times, \nand along the way I have met a number of remarkable individuals. Their \noccupations and backgrounds may vary, but they are all linked by a \ncommon commitment to helping others and making a positive difference in \ntheir communities. These are the unsung heroes in our society, and they \nare the foundation on which our communities are built. Sadly, \nConnecticut lost one its heroes earlier this month, when Jane Johnson \nof New Britain died at the age of 59.\n  Jane Johnson's entire career was dedicated to working with poor and \nunderprivileged children so that they may have a brighter future. A \nnative of New Britain, she spent more than 30 years working in her home \ntown's Head Start program, and for the past 17 years she served as its \nDirector.\n  I was fortunate to work with Jane over the years, and I, along with \neveryone else who knew her, had the highest regard for Jane and for her \nopinions on issues concerning children. Not only was she well-respected \nthroughout the State but her efforts on behalf of young people earned \nher national recognition. That is why she was invited to several White \nHouse Conferences on Head Start.\n  As if her efforts with Head Start were not enough, Jane also \nvolunteered her free time to serve her community. She was involved with \nmany service organizations, including as a member of the board of \ndirectors for the Sheldon Community Guidance Clinic and the United Way \nof New Britain. She was also active in her church, singing in the choir \nand actively working with the young people in the congregation.\n  No one really knows exactly how many children showed up to their \nfirst day of school ready to learn and came closer to reaching their \nfull potential because of Jane Johnson's efforts. But everyone in New \nBritain and throughout the State of Connecticut knows that she was a \nremarkable woman who touched many young lives and will be dearly \nmissed.\n  I offer my heartfelt condolences to her friends and family, and I ask \nthat her obituary be printed in the Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n              [From the New Britain Herald, Feb. 6, 1998]\n\n                              Jane Johnson\n\n       New Britain.--Jane Johnson, 59, of New Britain, Director of \n     the New Britain Head Start Program, died Tuesday, Feb. 3, \n     1998, at New Britain General Hospital.\n       Born in New Britain, she was the daughter of Josephine \n     (Gray) Hines of New Britain and the late James Johnson. She \n     was a lifelong New Britain resident. Jane Johnson worked for \n     the New Britain Head Start Program at the Human Resources \n     Agency for 30 years. She began her career in public service \n     as a teacher's assistant in 1965, the first year of the \n     national Head Start Program which was begun by President \n     Lyndon Johnson as a central part of his Great Society \n     Program. In order to fight the ``War on Poverty,'' programs \n     like Head Start were developed on the national level.\n       Ms. Johnson was an exemplary model of the program. She \n     began participating as a client through the Parent \n     Involvement Component of the Head Start Program. From 1965-\n     67, she worked directly with the children as a teacher's \n     assistant. The first director of the program, John E. \n     Francisco, recognized Ms. Johnson's talent and promoted her. \n     For the next five years, she worked first as an assistant, \n     and then as the coordinator in the Social Service component \n     of the Head Start Program. During the mid-1970's, she \n     returned to school and earned an Associate Degree from Tunxis \n     Community College in 1976.\n       Mr. Francisco promoted Ms. Johnson again in 1977, when she \n     became his Administrative Assistant. She continued her \n     education, earning a Bachelor of the Arts Degree from Central \n     Connecticut State University in 1979. She graduated with \n     honors and was named to Alpha Kappa Delta National Honor \n     Society.\n       From 1980-98, Ms. Johnson was the Director of the Head \n     Start Program. During this period, her innovative public \n     policy initiatives earned National recognition. She was \n     selected as a Johnson and Johnson Management Fellow and \n     attended an honorary program at the University of Southern \n     California in 1995.\n       In addition to her brilliant work as a leader in the \n     National Head Start Program, Ms. Johnson served her community \n     as a volunteer. She served as a member of the Board of \n     Directors at the Sheldon Community Guidance Clinic and at the \n     United Way of New Britain. She was a member of the \n     Connecticut and National Association of Head Start Directors. \n     Ms. Johnson also volunteered as a coordinator for the \n     Conference on Coordinated Child Care For The State of \n     Massachusetts.\n       Ms. Johnson was a member of the McCullough Temple C.M.E. \n     and during the 1960's, was active as a choir member and \n     served as a Junior District and Secretary Delegate to their \n     young people's conference.\n       Throughout her life, she made countless contributions to \n     the children and their families who came to the New Britain \n     Head Start Program. The staff, the children, and the families \n     who were involved with the program for the past 30 years will \n     miss her loving guidance, her wonderful sense of humor and, \n     most of all, her kind heart. She will continue to inspire \n     them to serve their community with hard work and commitment.\n       In addition to her mother, she is survived by three \n     children, Carnell Small of New Britain, Cheryl Small-Parris \n     and her husband, Colin Parris of New Britain, and Wayne Small \n     of Calif.; two sisters, Beatrice Walker of New Britain, and \n     Margaret Johnson of Hartford; two grandchildren, Torey Small \n     and Tia Parris; a great granddaughter, Taryn Fudge; and \n     several nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by an infant \n     son, Todd Anthony Small.\n       Funeral services will be held on Monday, 11 a.m. at the \n     Spottswood AME Zion Church. Burial will take place at \n     Fairview Cemetery, New Britain. Calling hours are Sunday \n     evening from 6 to 8 p.m. at the church. Memorial donations \n     may be made to the HRA Head Start Program, 180 Clinton St., \n     New Britain, CT 06053.

Mr. President, few have had as distinguished a \ncareer in the Senate as Howell Heflin, our former colleague from the \ngreat state of Alabama. One of the ways through which I\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\ncame to know and appreciate the indomitable optimism and warmth of \nSenator Heflin was through our work together as chairmen of the Senate \nDelegation to the North Atlantic Assembly.\n  The NAA brings together on a regular basis parliamentary and \nlegislative leaders of NATO's 16 nations to discuss matters of \ntransatlantic concern, generate initiatives addressing key challenges, \nand reinforce this strategic partnership.\n  Senator Heflin was not only an outstanding representative of the \nSenate to the Assembly and an ardent supporter of the NATO Alliance, \nbut he was also an energetic and persuasive leader on an important \ninitiative before us today, NATO enlargement.\n  I recently corresponded with Senator Heflin. He brought to my \nattention a speech on NATO enlargement by Deputy Secretary of Defense \nJohn Hamre delivered on Veteran's day before an audience in Birmingham.\n  Senator Heflin suggested that I submit this speech for the Record, \nand I gladly do so. It's a strong articulation of the moral and \nstrategic underpinnings of NATO enlargement. It decisively addresses \nthe key concerns voiced by those who still harbor reservations about \nthis policy.\n  I urge my colleagues to take Senator Heflin's advice and read this \nspeech.\n  The speech follows:\n\n Remarks by Deputy Secretary Hamre at Birmingham World Peace Luncheon, \n                            11 November 1997\n\n       Senator Jeff Sessions, Senator Howell Heflin, Congressman \n     Spencer Bachus, and Mayor Richard Arrington. It is great to \n     be in Birmingham on Veterans' Day. The sons and daughters of \n     Birmingham have served our nation both on the battlefront and \n     on the homefront. So many served in World War II that this \n     area was known as the ``great arsenal of the South.''\n       November 11th is set aside to honor all veterans of \n     American wars. But I would like to single out two individual \n     veterans today because their feats in uniform are a tribute \n     to all veterans. In fact, their names are inscribed in the \n     Hall of Heroes at the Pentagon, which honors America's Medal \n     of Honor winners. We are fortunate to have these two heroes \n     seated with us today: Bill Lawley and Lee Mize. Bill received \n     his Medal of Honor after World War II for flying his damaged \n     B-17 and his crew to safety in spite of his terrible wounds \n     and continued enemy attacks. Lee received his Medal of Honor \n     after the Korean War for almost single-handedly defending a \n     strategic outpost from brutal and continuous enemy assaults, \n     and then leading the counterattack that drove the enemy off. \n     Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of all veterans here and \n     everywhere, let's show our appreciation to these two American \n     heroes.\n       Colonels Lawley and Mize--and all their comrades-in-arms--\n     did a great deal to make America safe, both at home and \n     abroad.\n       Let me share with you a story--a true story. It now seems \n     so long ago, but let me remind you of events back in 1989 \n     before the Warsaw Pact collapsed and before the Berlin Wall \n     came down. At that time there was an announcement by Hungary \n     that they would not block East German citizens living in \n     Hungary from emigrating to West Germany. Within days of that \n     announcement East German citizens started showing up in \n     Budapest. Some 800 individuals, as I recall, were ``camping'' \n     in the yard at the West German embassy in Budapest. It became \n     a crisis--what to do with them all.\n       After a day or so the West German government rented an \n     entire train and transported these East German refugees to \n     Frankfurt. I recall how CNN was on the scene, showing the \n     train as it slowly moved west.\n       The night it arrived in Frankfurt a CNN news crew was on \n     the scene and interviewing the refugees. I recall they \n     cornered a young German couple--probably in the mid-20s. The \n     wife was holding an infant. After asking a series of inane \n     questions, the reporter asked the Germans, ``Is there \n     anything you would like to say?'' The man said, ``Yes, there \n     is something I would like to say. I would like to thank \n     America for keeping a place in the world that is free.''\n       For me, it was a stunning moment. The United States decided \n     after painful deliberation to retain troops in Europe. We had \n     spent hundreds of billions of dollars during the Cold War \n     maintaining a tense peace. And just when many Americans were \n     getting tired and forgetting what it was all about, this \n     young German said in such simple words what it all amounted \n     to--``keeping a place in the world that is free.''\n       Right now, America is at relative peace. But it is an \n     uneasy peace because we face new dangers of regional \n     aggression, terrorism, and the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction. Just look at the headlines--Iraq rattling its \n     saber, North Korea threatening and unstable, conflict brewing \n     just below the surface in Bosnia. The challenge before our \n     nation today was posed recently by a scholar named Donald \n     Kagan in his book, On the Origins of War. He writes that: ``A \n     persistent and repeated error through the ages has been the \n     failure to understand that the preservation of peace requires \n     active effort, planning, the expenditure of resources, and \n     sacrifice, just as war does.''\n       President Clinton and Secretary Cohen are determined that \n     the United States will not fail to seize the opportunity to \n     preserve peace. Today, I want to talk about how we are going \n     to preserve peace in Europe. The United States has devoted \n     too much blood and treasure in two World Wars and a Cold War. \n     The key to preventing war in Europe in the 21st Century is to \n     spread the democracy, stability, and prosperity of Western \n     Europe into Eastern and Central Europe, all the way to \n     Russia. And the key to that is by enlarging NATO--inviting \n     new members into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n       Last summer, President Clinton and his 15 NATO counterparts \n     took the historic step of inviting three former communist \n     countries--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--to join \n     NATO in 1999. But before this can happen, it must be approved \n     by the citizens of all 16 NATO nations through their elected \n     legislatures, including the United States Senate. This is a \n     very serious decision for American and our Senate to make.\n       Fifty years ago, when George Marshall proposed the Marshall \n     Plan to help rebuild Europe after World War II, he went \n     around the country explaining the importance of rebuilding \n     Europe. As a result, the Marshall Plan--in Harry Truman's \n     words--was ``more than the creation of statesmen. It comes \n     from the minds and hearts of the people.'' NATO enlargement \n     must also come from the minds and hearts of the people. As \n     President Clinton said, ``Because [NATO enlargement] is not \n     without cost and risk, it is appropriate to have an open, \n     full, national discussion.''\n       As the Senate prepares to consider NATO enlargement, it is \n     crucial that all Americans join in this debate. We especially \n     need to hear from our veterans. It is your voice--the voice \n     of the American veteran--that must be heard in support of \n     NATO enlargement.\n       We must remind America how the fiery hatreds of Europe drew \n     us into World War I. Too many failed to make it to the 11th \n     hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, the anniversary we \n     honor today. We all must remind Americans how this ``lost \n     generation'' served and sacrificed to give America a chance \n     to build a safer Europe for the next generation. We must warn \n     them how, when the guns of November fell silent, American \n     ignored the embers of hatred that still smoldered in Europe, \n     and we missed the opportunity to prevent another war.\n       To those who would turn our backs on Europe today, tell \n     them the price our veterans paid in World War II as Hitler \n     stoked the embers of hate into the deadliest war in human \n     history. Tell them how sons returned to the very same terrain \n     that their fathers had died to set free, as they plunged into \n     the crashing surf at Normandy. A reporter for Star and \n     Stripes was there, and filed this searing dispatch: ``There \n     have been only a handful of days since the beginning of time \n     in which the direction the world was taking has been changed \n     for the better in one 24-hour period by an act of man. June \n     6, 1944 was one of them. What the Americans, the British, and \n     the Canadians were trying to do was to get back an entire \n     continent that had been taken from its rightful owners, whose \n     citizens had been taken captive. It was one of the most \n     monumentally unselfish things that one group of people ever \n     did for another.'' That D-Day observer was today's Andy \n     Rooney of ``60 Minutes'' fame.\n       We cannot turn our backs on Europe today. The generation \n     that won the second World War gave us a second chance to \n     build a safer world. The Marshall Plan offered an American \n     hand of help and hope, to lift Europe out of the slough of \n     despair and snuff the embers of war forever. Western Europe \n     embraced the Marshall Plan and built strong democracies, \n     strong economies, and a strong alliance called NATO. But the \n     other half of Europe was denied the Marshall Plan when Joseph \n     Stalin slammed down the Iron Curtain on America's helping \n     hand. But still, America did not turn its back.\n       Through the long winter of the Cold War, we stood again \n     with the free people of Europe. And today, having emerged \n     victorious from that long, twilight struggle, we have an \n     historic opportunity and a very sober challenge. We must \n     complete George Marshall's vision for a Europe healed, whole, \n     and free to ensure that Americans never again have to fight \n     and die on European battlefields. The key is for NATO to \n     reach out across the old Cold War divides, to nurture the new \n     democracies in Eastern and Central Europe that have emerged \n     from the iron grip of Soviet domination, and, when these \n     countries are ready, willing, and able to join the Western \n     Alliance, to invite them to join NATO.\n       That is what NATO has done. And today, when you visit the \n     old capitals of the former Warsaw Pact nations, you can see a \n     new spring in the air--of liberty, prosperity, and national \n     security. The lines of commerce and communications are criss-\n     crossing the old Cold War fault lines, knitting the continent \n     closer together. Former NATO enemies are seizing every \n     opportunity to meet, engage, and exercise their militaries \n     with NATO--and three of these nations are now ready to join \n     the Alliance.\n       This is a major step and we must have a full national \n     debate. Some will argue that making NATO larger is going to \n     make NATO weaker and therefore weaken America. I believe the \n     reverse is true; a larger NATO reflects a wider allegiance to \n     our values. Veterans of our European wars know the power of \n     military alliances in deterring and defeating a common enemy. \n     It was the creation of NATO in 1949 that halted Soviet \n     designs on\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\n     Western Europe. It was the enlargement of NATO with Greece, \n     Turkey, West Germany, and Spain that helped to strengthen the \n     wall of democracy. And thanks to NATO, no American blood has \n     been shed fighting another war in Europe for more than 50 \n     years. So enlarging NATO with Poland and Hungary and the \n     Czech Republic is going to carry that promise into the next \n     century.\n       Some argue that these countries aren't ready to bear the \n     burdens of membership. But in the past few months, our \n     national security leaders have visited these nations and they \n     came away convinced that the Poles, the Hungarians, and the \n     Czechs fully intend to carry their responsibilities to \n     contribute to the Alliance, not just benefit from it.\n       Some argue that by enlarging NATO we are going to be \n     creating new lines of division in Europe. But in fact, NATO \n     is at the center of a new dynamic in Europe that is rapidly \n     erasing these old lines and bridging over old divisions. The \n     mere prospect of jointing NATO has unleashed a powerful \n     impetus for peace on that continent. Old rivals have settled \n     their historic disputes and they have struck new accords and \n     arrangements. Poland and Lithuania, Poland and Ukraine, \n     Hungary and Romania, Italy and Slovenia, Germany and the \n     Czech Republic--all have healed border disputes and other \n     kinds of controversies that in the past have erupted into \n     war. More than that, these old rivals are sealing these new \n     ties by working together in the conference rooms and the \n     training fields under NATO auspices.\n       Some argue that enlarging NATO is going to create new \n     tensions and divisions in Russia and jeopardize Russia's move \n     to democracy and its cooperation with the West. But in \n     numerous actions, large and small, NATO and Russia are \n     forging new links to overcome these old divisions. NATO and \n     Russian air forces are now making authorized observation \n     flights over each other's territory. Last spring, NATO and \n     Russia signed a Founding Act that gives Russia a voice in--\n     but not a vote or a veto over--NATO deliberations. And for \n     the past two years, Russian and American troops have been \n     serving together in Bosnia, going out on joint patrols to \n     settle disputes before they ignite into conflict.\n       Finally, there are those who claim that NATO enlargement \n     will cost too much. But alliances actually save money because \n     they promote cooperation, interoperability, and they reduce \n     redundancy. Simply put, it costs America less to defend our \n     interests in Europe if Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic are in alliance with us, just as it costs them less \n     to defend their interests by joining hands in the alliance \n     itself. And we estimate that the cost to the United States \n     each year over the next decade will be less than one-tenth of \n     one percent of our defense budget. The costs of enlarging \n     NATO are meager when weighed against the cost of potential \n     instability and aggression in Europe if we fail to enlarge.\n       George Marshall knew the cost of war in Europe. He said it \n     is ``spread before us, written neatly in the ledger, whose \n     volumes are grave stones.'' Well, today, there are more than \n     70,000 such volumes written across Europe, the grave stones \n     of Americans who rest where they fell, liberating a \n     continent. And so their sacrifice echoes down to us through \n     the decades from the hillsides in Florence, from the sloping \n     green in Luxembourg, from the dignified rows on a cliff \n     overlooking the Normandy shore. They did not serve, they did \n     not sacrifice, they did not die for us so that we could walk \n     away from the lands that they freed. It's their voices that \n     we have to heed and the voices of every veteran of every \n     conflict that we have ever fought. You know it is better to \n     pay the price for peace than suffer the cost of war.\n       John F. Kennedy once said, ``A nation reveals itself not \n     only by the individuals it produces, but also by those it \n     honors, those it remembers.'' Here, today, on behalf of every \n     man and woman who serves in the Department of Defense, let me \n     say thank you to Birmingham. Thank you for remembering. Too \n     many Americans observe Veterans Day in shopping malls. Too \n     many school kids think of Veterans Day as a holiday. Too few \n     cities pause to honor their native sons and daughters--the \n     quiet heroes of freedom. But not Birmingham. It is because of \n     Birmingham that America still keeps places in the world that \n     are free. Every Veterans Day, America reveals its commitment \n     to our armed forces by honoring and remembering the \n     sacrifices of America's veterans. So I want to thank all the \n     citizens of Birmingham for hosting this special event for 50 \n     years and for making veterans everywhere feel like the heroes \n     they are. And I want to thank all our veterans for keeping \n     our nation safe and our citizens secure. God bless our \n     veterans . . . God bless Birmingham . . . and God bless the \n     United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S783-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S785-S786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DUNGENESS CRAB CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, soon after the upcoming recess, I \nwill join my colleague, Senator Slade Gorton, to introduce the \nDungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act. The ocean Dungeness \ncrab fishery in WA, OR, and CA has been successfully managed by the \nthree states for many years. The states cooperate on season openings, \nmale-only harvest requirements, and minimum sizes; and all three states \nhave enacted limited entry programs. Although the resource demonstrates \nnatural cycles in abundance, over time the fishery has been sustained \nat a profitable level for fishermen and harvesters with no biological \nproblems.\n  The fishery is conducted both within state waters and in the federal \nexclusive economic zone (EEZ). Although state landing laws restrict \nfishermen to delivering crab only to those states in which they are \nlicensed, the actual harvest takes place along most of the West Coast, \nroughly from San Francisco to the Canadian border. Thus, it is not \nunusual for an Oregon-licensed fisherman from Newport to fish in the \nEEZ northwest of Westport, WA, and deliver his catch to a processor in \nAstoria, OR.\n  In recent years, federal court decisions under the umbrella of U.S. \nversus Washington have held that Northwest Indian tribes have treaty \nrights to harvest a share of the crab resource off Washington. To \naccommodate these rights, the State of Washington, has restricted \nfishing by Washington-licensed fishermen. This led Washington fishermen \nto request an extension of state fisheries jurisdiction into the EEZ. \nThe Congress partially granted this request during the last Congress by \ngiving the West Coast states interim authority over Dungeness crab, \nwhich expires in 1999 (16 U.S.C. 1856 note). The Congress also \nexpressed its interest in seeing a fishery management plan established \nfor Dungeness crab and asked the Pacific Fishery Management Council \n(PFMC) to report to Congress on this issue by December, 1997.\n  The PFMC established an industry committee to examine the issues, \nwhich developed several options. At its June meeting, the PFMC selected \ntwo options for further development and referred them for analysis to \nthe Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee which operates under the Pacific \nStates Marine Fisheries Commission. After lengthy debate, the Tri-State \nCommittee recommended to the Council that the Congress be requested to \nmake the interim authority permanent with certain changes, including a \nclarification of what license is required for the fishery, broader \nauthority for the states to ensure equitable access to the resource, \nand clarification of tribal rights. The Tri-State Committee agrees that \neach state's limited entry laws should apply only to vessels registered \nin that state. I ask unanimous consent to include the report of the \nTri-State Dungeness Crab Committee and the membership list of the \nCommittee in the Record following my remarks.\n  On September 12, 1997, the PFMC unanimously agreed to accept and \nsupport the Tri-State Committee recommendation. The Council agreed that \nthe existing management structure effectively conserves the resource, \nthat allocation issues are resolved by the restriction on application \nof state limited entry laws, that tribal rights are protected, and that \nthe public interest in conservation and fiscal responsibility after \nbetter served by the legislative proposal than by developing and \nimplemeting a fishery management plan under the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act. This legislation will fully \nimplement the Tri-State Committee recommendation and ensure the \nconservation and sound management of this important West Coast fishery.\n  I look foward to the Senate's timely consideration of this bill.\n\nReport of the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee to the Pacific Fishery \n Management Council on Options for Dungeness Crab Fishery Management, \n                             August 7, 1997\n\n       The Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee met on August 6-7, \n     1997 to review the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) \n     Analysis of Options for Dungeness Crab Management. A list of \n     the attending Committee members, advisors, and observers is \n     attached. After completing that review, the Committee \n     discussed the merits of each option and offered the following \n     comments for PFMC consideration.\n       There was general agreement within the Committee that \n     Option 1, No Action, would not satisfy the current needs of \n     the industry. There was unanimous opposition, however, among \n     Oregon and California representatives to Option 3, \n     Development of a Limited Federal Fishery Management Plan \n     (FMP). Washington representatives were not strongly in favor \n     of a FMP, but viewed it as the only realistic means to \n     address their concerns for the fishery. After an extended \n     discussion, it\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\n     was the consensus of the Committee that a modified version of \n     Option 2, Extension of Interim Authority, was preferred.\n       There were three common themes that appeared during the \n     discussion. No Committee members believe that there should be \n     fishing or processing of Dungeness crab in waters of the EEZ \n     under PFMC jurisdiction by any vessel not permitted or \n     licensed in either Washington, Oregon, or California. The \n     Committee generally accepted that additional tools beyond \n     area closures and pot limits could be needed to address \n     tribal allocation issues. Finally, the Committee also agreed \n     that as a matter of fairness, vessels fishing alongside each \n     other in an area should be subject to the same regulations. \n     On that basis, the Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee \n     recommends that:\n       1. The PFMC immediately request that Congress make the \n     current Interim Authority a permanent part of the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, applying \n     only to Pacific coast Dungeness crab, with the following \n     adjustments.\n       (a) delete the limitations listed in the current Section 2 \n     of the Interim Authority so that state regulations will apply \n     equally to all vessels in the EEZ and adjacent State waters; \n     and\n       (b) clarify the language in the current Section 3B of the \n     Interim Authority to prohibit participation in the fishery by \n     vessels that are not registered in either Washington, Oregon, \n     or California.\n       2. The PFMC defer action on a Dungeness crab FMP until \n     March 1998 to determine whether Congress will be receptive to \n     this extension of the Interim Authority.\n       Proposed draft bill language for an extension of the \n     Interim Authority is attached.\n       This recommendation is not made without reservations on \n     both sides. Washington representatives were reluctant to \n     totally withdraw consideration of a federal FMP option, in \n     the event that efforts to extend the Interim Authority fail. \n     They expressed little confidence that a request for \n     Congressional action would be successful. Representatives \n     from Oregon were concerned that discriminatory regulations \n     could be enacted in the future by other states that could \n     effectively exclude them from participation on traditional \n     fishing grounds. They preferred this risk over the \n     involvement of federal agencies under a federal fishery \n     management plan.\n\n  Tri-State Dungeness Crab Committee Meeting, Attendance--August 6-7, \n                           1997, Portland, OR\n\n\n                           Committee Members\n\n     Dick Sheldon, Columbia River Dungeness Crab Fishermen's \n         Association, Ocean Park, WA\n     Ernie Summers, Washington Dungeness Crab Fishermen's \n         Association, Westport, WA\n     Larry Thevik, Washington Dungeness Crab Fishermen's \n         Association, Westport, WA\n     Terry Krager, Chinook Packing, Chinook, WA\n     Paul Davis, Oregon Fisher, Brookings, OR\n     Bob Eder, Oregon Fisher, Newport, OR\n     Tom Nowlin, Oregon Fisher, Coos Bay, OR\n     Stan Schones, Oregon Fisher, Newport, OR\n     Russell Smotherman, Oregon Fisher, Warrenton, OR\n     Joe Speir, Oregon Fisher, Brookings, OR\n     Rod Moore, West Coast Seafood Processors Association, \n         Portland, OR\n     Harold Ames, CA Fisher, Bodega Bay, CA\n     Mike Cunningham, CA Fisher, Eureka, CA\n     Tom Fulkerson, CA Fisher, Trinidad, CA\n     Tom Timmer, CA Fisher, Crescent City, CA\n     Jerry Thomas, Eureka Fisheries, Inc., Eureka, CA\n\n\n                                Advisors\n\n     Steve Barry, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, \n         Montesano, WA\n     Paul LaRiviere, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, \n         Montesano, WA\n     Neil Richmond, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, \n         Charleston, OR\n\n\n                               Observers\n\n     Tom Kelly, WA Fisher, Westport, WA\n     Mike Mail, Quinault Tribe, Taholah, WA\n     Nick Furman, Oregon Dungeness Crab Commission, Coos Bay, \n         OR\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S785-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S786-S787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JULIAN SIMON\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to bring to my \ncolleagues attention an article by Ben Wattenberg on the recent passing \nof economist Julian Simon. Dr. Simon, who I had the pleasure of \nmeeting, was a great lover of freedom and a strong advocate for free \nmarkets. He was a pioneer who presented important research showing the \nbenefits of legal immigration. His research also demonstrated that the \nrationale for the type of population control practiced in many places \nin the world is misguided and harmful. In other words, human beings are \nnot problems to be solved. Such positions never won him popularity \ncontests among certain groups, but as The Washington Times wrote of \nJulian Simon: ``His forecasts about trends in resource availability, \npollution and other effects of additional people have been completely \nborne out by events.'' A fitting epitaph. I ask that the articles by \nBen Wattenberg and Julian Simon be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Feb. 11, 1998]\n\n                           Malthus, Watch Out\n\n                          (By Ben Wattenberg)\n\n       Julian Simon, who waged intellectual war on \n     environmentalists and Malthusians, died suddenly on Sunday. \n     He would have been 66 tomorrow, the day of his funeral.\n       Simon could sometimes glow like an exposed wire, crackling \n     with nervous intellectual intensity. Privately, he had a soul \n     of purest honey. But by force of will, fueled by his sizzling \n     energy, Simon helped push a generation of Americans to \n     rethink their views on population, resources and the \n     environment. By now it is clear that in this task he was \n     largely successful. As the years roll on he will be more \n     successful yet, his work studied, and picked at, by regiments \n     of graduate students.\n       His keystone work was ``The Ultimate Resource,'' published \n     in 1981 and updated in 1996 as ``The Ultimate Resource 2'' \n     (Princeton University Press). Its central point is clear: \n     Supplies of natural resources are not finite in any serious \n     way; they are created by the intellect of man, an always \n     renewable resource. Coal, oil and uranium were not resources \n     at all until mixed well with human intellect.\n       The notion drove some environmentalists crazy. If it were \n     true, poof!--there went so many of the crises that justified \n     their existence. From their air-conditioned offices in high-\n     rise buildings, they brayed: Simon believes in a \n     technological fix! The attacks often got personal: Simon's \n     doctorate was in business economics, they sniffed; he had \n     merely been a professor of advertising and marketing, and--\n     get this--he had actually started a mail order business and \n     written a book about how to do it. Never mind that he also \n     studied population economics for a quarter century.\n       In fact, it was Simon's knowledge of real-world commerce \n     that gave him an edge in the intellectual wars. He knew \n     firsthand about some things that many environmentalists had \n     only touched gingerly, like prices. If the real resource was \n     the human intellect, Simon reasoned, and the amount of human \n     intellect was increasing, both quantitatively through \n     population growth and qualitatively through education, then \n     the supply of resources would grow, outrunning demand, \n     pushing prices down and giving people more access to what \n     they wanted, with more than enough left over to deal with \n     pollution and congestion. In short, mankind faced the very \n     opposite of a crisis.\n       Simon rarely presented a sentence not supported by facts--\n     facts arranged in serried ranks to confront the opposition; \n     facts about forests and food, pollution and poverty, nuclear \n     power and nonrenewable resources; facts used as foot soldiers \n     to strike blows for accuracy.\n       In a famous bet, gloom-meister Paul Ehrlich took up Simon's \n     challenge and wagered that between 1980 and 1990 scarcity \n     would drive resource prices up. Simon bet that progress would \n     push prices down. Simon won the bet, easily. Mr. Ehrlich won \n     a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant. But the wheel turns, \n     and we'll see who's a genius. Fortune magazine listed \n     Simon among ``the world's most stimulating thinkers.'' Mr. \n     Ehrlich didn't make the cut.\n       Simon sensed the primacy of something else that many \n     environmentalists and crisis-mongers didn't catch on to for a \n     quite a time: Human intellect could best be transformed into \n     beneficial goods and services in an atmosphere of political \n     and economic liberty. At the United Nations' Mexico City \n     population conference in 1984 Simon winced, and \n     counterattacked, when population alarmists caricatured the \n     Reagan-appointed American delegation as promoting the idea \n     that ``capitalism is the best contraceptive.'' It was not a \n     good idea to ridicule capitalism, or free markets, or human \n     liberty, in Simon's presence.\n       Of course, rising living standards do tend to depress \n     fertility. Living standards do rise faster under democratic \n     market systems. Smart folks now know that the fruits of \n     economic growth can be used to diminish pollution. You don't \n     hear much anymore about how we're running out of everything. \n     (Next task: Simonize the Global Warmists.)\n       Finally, unlike many of his opponents, Julian was a \n     traditionalist. He did not work on the Sabbath, and the \n     Friday Sabbath dinner at the Simon house was always a gentle \n     and joyous celebration.\n       At rest on the Sabbath, Julian was indefatigable the rest \n     of the week, chasing his precious facts. If Thomas Malthus is \n     in heaven, he's in for an argument, laced with facts, facts, \n     facts.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Wall Street Journal Tuesday, April 22, 1997]\n\n                     Another Sure Bet on Earth Day\n\n                          [By Julian L. Simon]\n\n       The message of Earth Day is uplifting today just as it was \n     in 1970. But any reasonable person who looks at the \n     statistical evidence must agree that Earth Day's original \n     scientific premises are simply wrong.\n       Panic reigned during the first Earth Week. The doomsaying \n     environmentalists--among whom the pre-eminent figure was Paul \n     Ehrlich--asserted that the oceans and the Great Lakes were \n     dying; great famines were impending; the death rate would \n     quickly increase, due to pollution; and increasingly-scarce \n     raw materials would reverse the past centuries' progress in \n     the standard of living.\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\n     Every ill was the result of exploding populations in the U.S. \n     and abroad. The doomsayers urged government-coerced birth \n     control, abroad and even at home.\n       Of course none of those calamities have occurred. Indeed, \n     long before 1970, however, most agricultural economists--led \n     by Nobel Prize winner Theodore Schultz--had known that people \n     throughout the world have been living longer and eating \n     better since at least 1950 in the poor countries, and for two \n     centuries in the rich countries. Fewer people die of famine \n     than a century ago. The real prices of food are lower than in \n     earlier periods.\n       All other raw materials, too: In the great 1963 book \n     ``Scarcity and Growth,'' Harold Barnett and Chandler Morse \n     had documented that prices had been declining throughout \n     history, signaling increased natural-resource availability \n     rather than growing scarcity.\n       Data showing improved cleanliness of air and purity of \n     water in the rich countries had been published before 1970. \n     Since then the major air and water pollutions in the advanced \n     countries have continued to abate rather than worsen. And \n     statistical studies by Richard Easterlin and Nobel Prize \n     winner Simon Kuznets had in 1967 shown there to be no \n     statistical evidence that population growth hinders economic \n     progress. Yet the environmental organizations, the press, and \n     the Clinton administration still take as doctrine exactly the \n     same falsified ideas expressed by the doomsayers in 1970.\n       Scientific opinion about population growth has now shifted \n     away from the doomsayers' apocalyptic views. In 1986 the \n     National Academy of Sciences published a report on population \n     growth and economic development prepared by a prestigious \n     scholarly committee chaired by economists D. Gale Johnson and \n     Ronald Lee. It reversed almost completely the frightening \n     conclusions of the previous NAS report in 1971. The expert \n     group found ``no statistical association between national \n     rates of population growth and growth rates of income per \n     capita,'' though they hedged their qualitative judgment a \n     bit. The report found benefits of additional population as \n     well as costs.\n       I'm sufficiently certain about these trends that I'm \n     willing to put my money where my mouth is. In 1980, Mr. \n     Ehrlich and two associates bet me that increasing scarcity \n     would bring higher prices of raw materials. We agreed to \n     assess the trends in $1,000 worth of copper, chrome, nickel, \n     tin, and tungsten for ten years. I would win if resources \n     grew more abundant and thus cheaper, and they would win if \n     resources became more expensive. At settling time in 1990, \n     the Ehrlich team sent me a check for $576.07. The inflation-\n     adjusted price of our basket of metals had declined more than \n     40% over the bet period.\n       More environmental and resource data are available \n     nowadays. And a single bet proves little. Hence I make the \n     new broader bet offer to any prominent doomsayer that just \n     about any trend pertaining to material human welfare will \n     improve rather than get worse. The other person picks the \n     trend(s)--life expectancy, a price of a natural resource, \n     some measure of air or water pollution, the number of \n     telephones per person, or whatever--and chooses the area of \n     the world, and the future year a decade or more hence.\n       Professor Ehrlich and global-warming climatologist Stephen \n     Schneider have responded to my offer with a strategy one \n     might call switch-and-bait. They first switch the subject \n     from material human welfare, and offer to bet on a set of \n     physical indicators such as sperm count, global temperature, \n     and levels of carbon dioxide and ozone. They call these \n     elusive measures ``indirect indicators.'' But they are not \n     relevant. The subject is economic welfare (including health) \n     and not atmospheric science.\n       Furthermore, the economic goodness or badness of many \n     physical indicators is quite unknown. Carbon dioxide makes \n     the plants grow faster; more of it may be a good thing. And \n     only two decades ago Mr. Schneider wrote a book about the \n     imminent danger of global cooling, so perhaps a higher mean \n     temperature is not the demon he now warns us of.\n       When I explain these ideas, Mr. Ehrlich baits me--on \n     National Public Radio and elsewhere--by saying that I \n     ``chickened out'' and ``ran.'' The fact that these folks have \n     to resort to such a switch-and-bait ploy reveals a lot about \n     the strength of their position.\n       The continuing influence of the failed forecasters among \n     the media and policy makers is frustrating. But it's spring, \n     so let's look at the good news. There is every scientific \n     reason to be joyful about the trends in Earth's condition, \n     and to be hopeful for humanity's future. So we can safely \n     ignore the scare stories and have a Happy Earth Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S786-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TODAY'S LINE-ITEM VETO DECISION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia has again held the line-item veto \nunconstitutional. I respect the decision of Judge Thomas F. Hogan. I \nrespect it not only because his analysis is consistent with that which \nled me to oppose this legislation when it was being considered by the \nSenate. I also respect it because it was right as a matter of \nconstitutional law and as a means to preserve the separation of powers \nthat is so central to the checks and balances that preserve our \nfreedoms and liberty.\n  We hear a lot of speeches around here condemning judges. Here is a \nJudge who has done his job and stood up for the Constitution against \nthe ill-advised action of the political branches.\n  It is not our independent federal judiciary that is upsetting the \nlimits of government and fundamental freedoms of us all. Congress has \nshown a dangerous tendency over the last few years to ignore \nconstitutional limits on Federal legislative branch authority. Maybe it \nis Members of Congress who need to read the Constitution and consider \nits wisdom.\n  The last week of its last term, the United States Supreme Court \nstruck down three congressional actions as unconstitutional, including \nthe so-called Communications Decency Act and the Brady Act, both of \nwhich I voted against. The Supreme Court withheld ruling on the line-\nitem veto law at that time, because it held that the plaintiffs in that \ncase were without standing to bring the challenge. It was just a matter \nof time and occasion. The decision by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in \nthe earlier case had presaged the ruling today. The line-item veto was \nand is unconstitutional. I proudly stand with Senator Byrd on this \nmatter.\n  I would ask Congress to step back from this specific decision and \nconsider how unprecedented this is: Four statutes that do not comport \nwith the constitutional limits on congressional authority overturned \nfrom a single Congress.\n  It is unfortunate that Congress is far too often overstepping its \nconstitutional bounds. It is unfortunate that the courts have to rein \nCongress in from time to time, with increasing frequency as the \nRepublican majority loses its moorings, but that is the thankless \nresponsibility of the courts under our system of checks and balances.\n  I have come to this floor often in the last several months to defend \nthe judiciary against shrill attacks. I come today to offer my \ncontinuing gratitude and respect for our co-equal branch of government. \nWe are the envy of the world in part because our free and independent \njudicial branch has served our country so well for more than 200 years.\n  We should be doing more to keep it that way, not less. We are finally \nbeginning to consider longstanding judicial nominations to fill the \nvacancies that plague the federal judiciary and threaten the \nadministration of justice. We need to do more. We should consider \nwithout further delay the judiciary's requests for the resources that \nthey need. We should consider S. 678, the Federal Judgeship Act, which \nI introduced at the request of the Judicial Conference to provide an \nadditional 55 judges where needed around the country. We should act on \nS. 394, which I sponsored with Senator Hatch to unlink judicial \nsalaries from our own. We should consider and confirm qualified \nnominees to the 83 vacancies to the federal courts.\n  Finally, I hope that members of Congress will rethink the rush to \npropose amendment to our Constitution and consider how well our \nfundamental charter serves us. We do not need to rewrite the \nConstitution, we need to respect it and act in accordance with its \ndesign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S787-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S787-S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nKATHLEEN JONES AND MOIRA DELAHANTY--WINNERS OF THE PRUDENTIAL SPIRIT OF \n COMMUNITY AWARD AND CHRISTOPHER VACHON, CHRISTOPHER PAPPAJOHN, JOSEPH \n           ALLISON, JUSTINE BARRETT, DISTINGUISHED FINALISTS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Kathleen Jones and Moira Delahanty who have achieved \nnational recognition for recieving the Prudential Spirit of Community \nAward. I commend their youthful spirit and aggressive drive to improve \nthe quality of life in New Hampshire through community service.\n  The award, presented by The Prudential Insurance Company of America \nin partnership with the National Association of Secondary School \nPrincipals, recognizes young people who have shown a great deal of \ncommitment and dedication to improving their community. As New \nHampshire's honorees,\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nKathleen and Moira will receive $1,000, a silver medallion and a trip \nin May to Washington, D.C., where they will join other honorees for \nfour days of national events.\n  According to Kathleen, she wanted to make a difference in her \ncommunity and spend time helping others. As a result, she launched an \nenvironmental group called Earth Service Corps. Today, the group has \nnearly 70 members who help build and maintain hiking trails, initiate \nand conduct recycling programs, and plant trees throughout the state. \nKathleen not only was the founder, but she also plans group meetings, \nserves as a liaison with community groups, and handles all \nadministrative work for the Corps.\n  Moira volunteers as an aide to a swimming instructor with the local \nchapter of the American Red Cross. She helps younger kids overcome \ntheir fears of water and then teaches them to swim. She completed a \nspecial training session and volunteered for one month over the course \nof two summers. Her love for teaching and her passion to help others \novercome individual fears is a great attribute I admire dearly.\n  I also would like to salute four other young people who were named \nDistinguished Finalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Award and \nrecieved the bronze medallion for their outstanding volunteer service. \nThey are: Christopher Vachon, 14, Pinkerton Academy in Derry, created \nseveral multimedia presentations to promote driving safety among \nteenagers; Christopher Pappajohn, 16, Keene High School, raised $40,000 \nwith a group of friends to build a skate park in his town; Joseph \nAllison, 13, Hudson Memorial Middle School, volunteers in his community \nfor a variety of nearby organizations; and Justine Barrett, 14, West \nRunning Brook Middle School in Derry, helped collect money for the \nneedy through a Holiday Fund at her school.\n  These extraordinary young people continue to keep alive the virtue of \ncommunity service and inspire others to do the same. Their personal \ninitiatives, dedicated service and hard work have impacted the lives of \nmany. In a time when Americans seem to be less involved in their \ncommunities, these young Americans continue to defend and keep the \ncommunity flame shining brightly. Mr. President, I want to congratulate \nthese individuals for their outstanding work and I am proud to \nrepresent them in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S787-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         JAMES FARMER AWARDED THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, while this Congress was in recess, \nthe President of the United States awarded the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, our country's highest civilian honor, to James Farmer. The \nMedal was given to Mr. Farmer on January 15, 1998, the birthday of the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr., in a symbolic gesture that reminded \nus again of the value of freedom, and the debt we owe those who \nsacrificed greatly for racial equality in America.\n  Mr. President, James Farmer was one of the six major civil rights \nleaders of the civil rights era, joining A. Philip Randolph, Roy \nWilkins, Whitney Young, John Lewis and Martin Luther King, Jr. He \nhelped establish, and later lead, the Congress of Racial Equality \n(CORE). He was the father of the famous Freedom Rides through the \nSouth. He organized and inspired. He placed himself in great personal \ndanger again and again.

Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to \nexplain why I voted against cloture on S. 1601, the Human Cloning \nProhibition Act introduced by Senators Bond, Frist, Lott, and Gregg.\n  First of all, I want to state unequivocally that I am against the \ncloning of a human being. Cloning of a human child raises serious moral \nand ethical questions about society's perception of human life. The \nNational Bioethics Advisory Commission, after a thorough review of the \nethical and legal issues involved, has recommended that Congress enact \nlegislation to prohibit the use of cloning to create a child, and I \nagree that Congress needs to act on this issue.\n  We should not, however, rush to enact legislation that could do \nserious harm to other critical medical research. The legislation before \nthe Senate today is only eight days old. The Senate Labor Committee and \nSenate Judiciary Committee, which have jurisdiction over this bill, \nhave not had the opportunity to hold hearings on this specific \nlegislation or the other bills that have recently been introduced, much \nless consider amendments to the language.\n  In the meantime, the Food and Drug Administration has already \ndetermined that it has authority and jurisdiction over human cloning \nand has stated that it would act to prohibit any attempt to clone a \nhuman being. In addition, professional organizations representing more \nthan 64,000 scientists have voluntarily imposed upon themselves a five-\nyear moratorium on human cloning.\n  Most importantly, as we take action to ban the cloning of humans, I \nwant to be sure that we do not also ban valuable medical research that \ncould lead to cures or treatments for the millions of Americans \nsuffering from cancer, heart disease, diabetes, organ failure, \nAlzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, severe skin burns, and many \nother diseases that perhaps we haven't even identified yet. Scientists \ndo not yet understand exactly how somatic cell nuclear transfer, the \ntechnique used in cloning Dolly the sheep in Scotland last spring, \nworked.\n  But medical researchers believe that this technology can be used to \ngenerate stem cells to treat disease. For instance, imagine being able \nin the not-so-distant future to repair the damage to the cardiac muscle \ncaused by a heart attack. Using stem cell technology, we may be able to \nreplace damaged cardiac cells with healthy cells that would then \ndifferentiate into cardiac muscle. I do not know whether this will \nultimately prove to work, but I believe we should continue to pursue \nthis type of research if it could help to save the lives of millions of \nAmericans each year.\n  The Nation's scientific community has expressed deep concern that the \nlegislation before us, as currently drafted, could halt stem cell \nresearch and other related research that would not lead to the cloning \nof human beings. Everyone I have talked to agrees that this is a \ncomplicated and difficult issue. We need to proceed, but we need to do \nso in the careful, considered way that has earned the Senate the \nreputation of the ``world's greatest deliberative body.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that a New York Times editorial on this subject \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 10, 1998]\n\n                     A Slapdash Proposal on Cloning\n\n       The shock caused by the physicist Richard Seed's grandiose \n     intention to clone human beings may be about to cause more \n     damage than anything Dr. Seed could do in the laboratory. \n     Senate Republicans are now rushing to enact a bill that would \n     outlaw cloning a human embryo and, in the process, ban a \n     valuable technique that could potentially cure a wide range \n     of diseases. No wonder a slew of scientific associations and \n     high-tech industry groups are urging more carefully \n     constructed legislation. The sensitive scientific and moral \n     issues involved here require careful handling, not \n     grandstanding by politicians more interested in pandering \n     than in reaching a reasoned solution.\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\n       Congress may ultimately want to impose limits on cloning, a \n     technique that has arrived sooner than expected with the \n     announcement last year that Scottish scientists had cloned a \n     lamb from the cell of an adult sheep. That achievement, if it \n     proves practical in humans, would make it possible to take a \n     cell from an adult and use it to produce a genetically \n     identical twin many years younger than the parent. A national \n     bioethics commission, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical \n     industries and many scientific groups have all called for a \n     moratorium on actually cloning a person until society has \n     time to grapple with the ethical and moral issues.\n       But the bill sponsored by the Republican Senators \n     Christopher Bond, William Frist and Judd Gregg does not \n     simply prohibit the use of cloning to produce a human embryo \n     for implantation in the womb. It would also prohibit use of \n     the technique to produce genetically identical tissues in the \n     laboratory to treat diseases or injuries where a person's \n     existing cells are damaged or insufficient. Such ailments \n     include leukemia, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord \n     injury, heart attacks and severe burns, among others.\n       The Republicans contend that even these approaches require \n     creating what amounts to an embryo in the laboratory and then \n     experimenting on it to produce the desired tissues. But that \n     is a complex matter of definitions and techniques that \n     requires careful evaluation. The Republican bill and others \n     on the subject have not even gone through committee hearings. \n     When the matter comes up for a floor vote this week, the \n     Senate should postpone action and demand more considered \n     deliberation. It would be a shame if the rush to ban cloning \n     of people ended up crippling biomedical research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S788-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 50TH BIRTHDAY OF MICHAEL B. ROBERTSON\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, next Wednesday, February 18, \nmarks an auspicious occasion: Michael B. Robertson--a constituent--will \nturn 50. He will become a quinquagenarian. Individuals often approach \nthis milestone with some trepidation. That need not be, for as Sir \nRichard Steele wrote, ``Age in a virtuous person, of either sex, \ncarries in it an authority which makes it preferable to all the \npleasures of youth.'' Now, Steele was all of 38 or 39 when he wrote \nthat in 1711, but I can attest to the sentiment, having become a \nseptuagenarian last March. More important, we learn from Leviticus \n25:10 that ``Ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty \nthroughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a \njubilee unto you.''\n  Michael Robertson was born in Scotland in 1948. But he ``left fair \nScotland's strand'' at the age of six and moved with his family to the \nUnited States. He obtained a bachelor of arts degree in English from \nWilkes University in Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania in 1969. From there, as \na young man, he headed west, following the advice of Horace Greeley \n(actually, it was the advice of John Babsone Lane Soule, in an article \npublished in the Terre Haute Express in 1851).\n  His car and his funds made it to Los Angeles. He had to find work, \nand ended up taking a job in the mailroom of Carson/Roberts \nAdvertising. His superiors quickly recognized his innate ability and \nwork ethic, and promoted him to copywriter. Soon thereafter, he was an \nassociate creative director with Young & Rubicam, eventually returning \nto the East Coast. Onward and upward in the highly competitive business \nof advertising to his present position as executive creative director \nof Bates USA, where he is responsible for the overall creative product \nof a $1.1 billion agency.\n  Mr. Robertson, I might note, is a neighbor of sorts. His office is in \nthe venerable Chrysler Building, a few floors below the suite which is \nmy New York City office. He has a lovely family, including a daughter, \nMegan (just recently married); a son, Brendan (a strapping young man \npresently in college); and another daughter, Charlotte (a star fourth-\ngrader at the Nightingale-Bamford School). His wife, Linda, is quite \naccomplished in her own right: she produced the television commercials \ncommemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations.\n  I would like to take this opportunity, Mr. President, to join with \nMichael Robertson's family and friends too numerous to count in wishing \nhim a very happy fiftieth birthday. May it truly be a jubilee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S789-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S789-S790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   LONDONDERRY HIGH SCHOOL LANCER MARCHING BAND, PARTICIPANT IN THE \n               WASHINGTON, D.C., ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate the students of the Londonderry High School Lancers \nMarching Band for the distinguished honor of representing New Hampshire \nin the Washington, D.C., St. Patrick's Day Parade. All 201 band members \nand Andrew Soucy, the Band's director, deserve special commendation for \ntheir hard work and achievement.\n  These band members have proven that determination, hardwork and \ndedication are the hallmarks of success both as musicians and students. \nMany of the songs they play symbolize American pride and forever keep \npatriotism alive through the language of music. ``Londonderry Ear,'' \nalso known as ``Oh Danny Boy,'' is a hometown favorite that is also \nplayed in tribute to the Granite State and their home town.\n  I am indeed honored to have the Londonderry High School Lancer \nMarching Band representing New Hampshire with their outstanding musical \nperformances. I had the pleasure of meeting some of the band members, \nyoung men and women, who have recognized their own talents and continue \nto develop them into something great. I am proud to say, this continual \ndrive for perfection and aggressive strive for greatness are \ncommendable characteristics among Granite State students.\n  These students not only attended school and practice, but they also \nhad to raise money through several fundraisers to come to Washington, \nD.C. As a result, the band accomplished their goal by implementing a \nplan and having the right attitude and talent to meet their goal.\n  The Londonderry High School Lancers Marching Band with their classic \nred, white, and blue uniforms have performed for audiences throughout \nthe country. To name a few, they played at the Foxboro Stadium, home of \nthe New England Patriots in Boston, Massachusetts, Nascar Winston Cup \nSeries, and for Good Morning America, an ABC Television Network.\n  I also want to recognize the Londonderry community, for giving so \nmuch support in helping these young adults. I am well aware of the \npride the community has for this talented band. It is much easier to be \nsuccessful when you have the support of others and the backing from \nfriends and family.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate all the students and the \ndirector on such a magnificent accomplishment and I am proud to \nrepresent them in the U.S. Senate. I also ask that a list of the names \nof these outstanding students be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n\n              Londonderry High School Lancer Marching Band\n\n       Scott Abernethy, Noura Alkhamis, Bridget Ambrose, Heather \n     Applegate, Jordon Avalos, Christina Belmonte, Matthew Blake, \n     Danielle Boshetto, Katie Broadhead, Carolynne Camillieri, \n     Greta Carlson, Sarah Chretien, Ashley Clover, James Dahlfred, \n     Jessica Davis, Arthur Decaneas, Tim Desmarais, William Doss, \n     Amanda Eaton, Sheridan Farrah Jr., Bethany Ferreira, Nathan \n     Formalarie, Kim Garrison, Madelyn Gonzalez, Bridget \n     Gugliotta, John Harding, Andrew Hatin, Tara Henry, Nik \n     Janson, Adam Keller, Kerry Kilpatrick, Joy Arbruzese, Vanessa \n     Allum,\n       Dan Anderson, Patrick Applegate, Sabrina Baker, Kristin \n     Beltrimini, Suzanne Blundell, Meleah Brackett, Candice Brown, \n     Ashley Carlson, Mike Carlson, Tim Christensen, Sarah Cody, \n     Katie Daneau, Dave Day, Robert Decker Jr., Jenn Dillon, \n     Kristen Dubois, Michelle Eddy, Mike Fawcett, Greg Fisher, \n     Rachael Fryd, Leah Gaumont, Nicole Gregorio, Kate Gunnery, \n     Jason Harrington, Kristen Hatin, Neil Huntemann, Elizabeth \n     Jones, Andrew Keller, Katie Klasner, Alexandra Adams, Allison \n     Alper, Andrew Applegate, Ryan Arnold, Diego Batista, Erin \n     Blake,\n       Robyn Bookman, Christine Bradbury, Melissa Burns, Drew \n     Carlson, Leslie Cast, Diana Church, Rachel Cox, Abby \n     Davidson, Karen Day, Barbara Deluca, Michelle Dillon, Dan \n     Dussault, Michael Edwards, Adam Fernald, Marc Flore, Dana \n     Garrison, Jamie Gogla, Kirsten Griffiths, Chris Hajjar, Karen \n     Harvey, Erin Hegarty, Kim Huston, Kristine Jones, Carin \n     Kilar,\n       Jason Krampfert, Kristen Krampfert, Danielle Levison, Greg \n     Lufkin, Jaimie Machado, Caitlin Marrinan, Kaylie Matos, Katie \n     McCarthy, Dary Mcgrath, Julia Mechachonis, Kim Mendonca, Paul \n     Mistovish, Tom Morse, Sarah Munday, Kim Novielli, Elizabeth \n     Oswald, Jason Pelletier, Katie Piper, Tim Porter, Jennifer \n     Reynolds, Elizabeth Rockwell, Melissa Ross, Steven Roy, \n     Collean Scali, Shannon Scioscia, Anne Shea, Katie Silvius, \n     Matthew Smith, Joseph Soucy, James Stewart, Ashley Taylor, \n     Jamie Thomas, Mark Tuden, Marianne Vanagel,\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\n     Christine Walker, Melissa Wills, Stephanie Young, Amanda \n     Leitch, Ryan Levison, Dave Lymburner, Kelly Macneil, Joseph \n     Martin, Jim Maxwell, Kerry McCarty, Caitlin McIntire, Robert \n     Mee, Eric Meyer, Emily Morgano, Eric Mosse, Colleen Murphy, \n     Cortiney Nye, Brian Paciulan, Jessica Pelletier, Lindsay \n     Piper, Toby Porter, David Poberson, Katherine Rork, Seana \n     Roussel, Amanda Rudy, Paul Schacht, Kayla Seaman, Carly \n     Sheehan, Dennis Slozak, Stephanie Smith, Sarah Soucy, Jackie \n     Sunderland, Georgia Theodore, Robert Tobin, Jay Vaccaro, \n     Emily Violette,\n       Kerry Walton, Adam Wobrock, Victoria Zabierek, Amanda \n     Lever, Jesse Lore, Drew Macculloch, Dan Marchegiani, Lance \n     Martin, Rachel McCarter, Shannon McCarty, Jen McMahon, Dan \n     Melnick, Deryc Miller, John Morse, Jessica Moulton, Jessica \n     Napier, Amanda Oswald, Enrique Paniagua, John Perry, Sue \n     Plissey, Rebecca Predko, Mike Roberson, Jennifer Ross, \n     Melissa Roy, Jack Ryan, Andrew Schroeder, Matthew Sharpe, Tim \n     Sheehan, Crystal Smith, Kevin Socha, Ethan Stern, Nicki \n     Sweet, Sarah Thesse, Peter Tomaselli, Jeff Vaccaro, Christina \n     Vitale, Richard Williams, Renee Wright, Scott \n     Zdankiewicz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S789-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A TRIBUTE TO AN AMERICAN FREEDOM FIGHTER\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as one man who had the privilege to \nmarch and demonstrate alongside this dedicated pioneer during the Civil \nRights Movement, and another who has long respected his courage and is \nproud to represent him in the U.S. Senate, we both have enormous \nrespect and admiration for James Farmer. Now, all Americans are being \ngiven the opportunity both to learn more about this man and to \nappreciate his lifetime of contributions to our nation as a civil \nrights activist, community leader and teacher.\n  Yesterday, on the birth date of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., \nPresident Clinton presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom, our \ncountry's highest civilian honor, to fifteen distinguished Americans. \nWe are grateful that James Farmer, one of the ``Big Six'' leaders of \nthe Civil Rights Movement and the father of the Freedom Rides, was \namong them.\n  As the Nation prepares to officially celebrate the life and legacy of \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr., it is also fitting that we join the \nPresident in recognizing one of the great soldiers and leaders of the \nCivil Rights Movement. In the 1940's, while still in his early \ntwenties, James Farmer was already leading some of the earliest \nnonviolent demonstrations and sit-ins in the Nation, over a decade \nbefore nonviolent tactics became a vehicle for the modern Civil Rights \nMovement in the South.\n  Early in his academic career, James Farmer became interested in the \nGhandian principles of civil disobedience, direct action, and \nnonviolence. In 1942, at the age of 22, he enlisted an interracial \ngroup, mostly students, and founded the Congress of Racial Equality \n(CORE), with the goal of using nonviolent protest to fight segregation \nin America. During these early years, James Farmer and other CORE \nmembers staged our Nation's first nonviolent sit-in, which successfully \ndesegregated the Jack Spratt Coffee Shop in Chicago.\n  Five years later, in what he called the ``Journey of \nReconciliation,'' James Farmer led other CORE members to challenge \nsegregated seating on interstate buses.\n  In 1961, James Farmer orchestrated and led the famous Freedom Rides \nthrough the South, which are renown for forcing Americans to confront \nsegregation in bus terminals and on interstate buses. In the spring of \nthat year, James Farmer trained a small group of freedom riders, \nteaching them to deal with the hostility they were likely to encounter \nusing nonviolent resistance. This training would serve them well.\n  During the journeys, freedom riders were beaten. Buses were burned. \nWhen riders and their supporters--including James Farmer and the \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr.--were trapped during a rally in \nMontgomery's First Baptist Church, Attorney General Robert Kennedy \nordered U.S. marshals to come to their aid and protect them from the \nangry mob that had gathered outside.\n  In reflecting on the ride from Montgomery, Alabama to Jackson, \nMississippi, James Farmer said, ``I don't think any of us thought we \nwere going to get to Jackson * * * I was scared and I am sure the kids \nwere scared.'' He later wrote in his autobiography, ``If any man says \nthat he had no fear in the action of the sixties, he is a liar. Or \nwithout imagination.''\n  James Farmer made it to Jackson and spent forty days in jail after he \ntried to enter a white restroom at the bus station. On November 1, \n1961, six months after the freedom rides began, the Interstate Commerce \nCommission ordered all interstate buses and terminal facilities to be \nintegrated.\n  Six years ago, James Farmer told a reporter that while the fight \nagainst racism in the 1960's ``required tough skulls and guts * * * now \nit requires intellect, training and education.''\n  Not surprisingly, James Farmer continues to do his part. Just as he \ntaught his freedom riders how to battle segregation over three decades \nago, he has taught civil rights history at Mary Washington College in \nFredericksburg, Virginia, for the past twelve years. He teaches his \nstudents how to remember and how to learn from history.\n  James Farmer has, in truth, spent a lifetime teaching America the \nvalue of equality and opportunity. He has taught America that its most \nvolatile social problems could be solved nonviolently. He has reminded \nus of the countless acts of courage and conviction needed to bring \nabout great change. He has shown us the idealism needed to act and the \npragmatism needed to succeed. His respect for humanity and his belief \nin justice will forever inspire those of us privileged to call him \nmentor and friend.\n  As we celebrate the Martin Luther King Holiday on Monday, and as we \nhonor James Farmer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, let us vow \nto continue to learn. If we truly believe in the idea of the beloved \ncommunity and an interracial democracy, we cannot give up. As a nation \nand a people, we must join together and strive towards laying down the \nburden of race. And we must follow in the footsteps of a courageous \nleader, to whom, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, we can finally \nsay: thank you, James Farmer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S790-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S790-S791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AUTHORIZING PRODUCTION OF SENATE DOCUMENTS BY SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 178, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senators Lott and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 178) to authorize production of \n     Senate documents and representation by Senate Legal Counsel \n     in United States f.u.b.o. Kimberly Industries, Inc., et al. \n     v. Trafalgar House Construction, Inc., et al.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a contract dispute, \npending as a civil case in the United States District Court for the \nSouthern District of West Virginia, between a subcontractor and the \nprime contractor constructing a Department of Labor Job Corps facility \nin Charleston, West Virginia. Prior to the litigation, the \nsubcontractor, a West Virginia firm, sought assistance from Senator \nByrd's and Senator Rockefeller's offices in contacting the Labor \nDepartment regarding the firm's difficulties over payment for its work \non the project. In the civil lawsuit that has ensued between the two \ncontracting firms, the prime contractor has now requested that the \noffices of Senator Byrd and Senator Rockefeller produce from their \nfiles copies of documents concerning the West Virginia Job Corps \nproject.\n  The constituent subcontractor firm has advised, through the Senate \nLegal Counsel, that it has no objection to the release of its \ncorrespondence with the Senator's offices. Thus, the usual principle of \nconstituent confidentiality is not implicated here. However, as is \noften the case when a constituent reports difficulties in dealing with \nan executive agency, Senator Byrd's office and Senator Rockefeller's \noffice have advised that their constituent's communications regarding \nthis matter informed the Senators' consideration of potential \nalternatives to address the problem, including undertaking legislative \nor oversight action regarding the Labor Department's construction \nprogram and procurement procedures. In\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\norder to protect Senators' ability to undertake their legislative \nresponsibilities free from interference and questioning, the Speech or \nDebate Clause of the Constitution privileges from compelled production \nin court proceedings materials from Senators' files relating to the \nlegislative sphere.\n  Nevertheless, Senators Byrd and Rockefeller are willing to provide to \nthe parties in this case copies of documents reflecting their offices' \nrole, to the extent that they may properly do so without impairing the \nimportant interests underlying the Senate's constitutional privileges. \nIn view of the subcontractor's lack of objection, the Senators also \nhave no objection to furnishing copies of their correspondence with the \nsubcontractor. In addition, both Senators would like to provide the \nrecords of their communications with the Labor Department regarding \nthis matter. Consistent with the overriding importance that the \nConstitution recognizes in fostering unimpeded communications between \nSenators and their staffs concerning matters of potential legislative \naction, the Senators will not waive their legislative privileges for \ntheir offices' internal records and work product.\n  Accordingly, this resolution would authorize Senator Byrd's and \nSenator Rockefeller's offices to produce documents in this case, except \nwhere a privilege or objection should be asserted. The resolution also \nwould authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent employees in \nSenator Byrd's and Senator Rockefeller's offices, should such \nrepresentation become necessary to protect the Senate's privileges in \nconnection with this matter.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 178) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 178\n\n       Whereas, in the case of United States f.u.b.o. Kimberly \n     Industries v. Trafalgar House Construction, Civil Case No. \n     97-0462, pending in the United States District Court for the \n     Southern District of West Virginia, documents have been \n     requested from the offices of Senator Robert C. Byrd and \n     Senator John D. Rockefeller IV;\n       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United \n     States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no \n     evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate \n     may, by the judicial process, be taken from such control or \n     possession but by permission of the Senate;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     represent employees of the Senate with respect to any \n     subpoena, order, or request for evidence relating to their \n     official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or \n     in the possession of the Senate may promote the \n     administration of justice, the Senate will take such action \n     as will promote the ends of justice consistently with the \n     privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved That the offices of Senator Byrd and Senator \n     Rockefeller are authorized to produce documents in the case \n     of United States f.u.b.o. Kimberly Industries v. Trafalgar \n     House Construction except concerning matters for which a \n     privilege or objection should be asserted.\n       Sec. 2. That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to \n     represent employees of the Senator Byrd and Senator \n     Rockefeller in connection with any subpoena or request for \n     documents or testimony in United States f.u.b.o. Kimberly \n     Industries v. Trafalgar House Construction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S790-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 1998\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition, and as the \nfinal speaker before we adjourn for a recess, I am going to comment \nabout the situation in Iraq.\n  It had been my hope that the Congress might have addressed this \nissue. But it is obvious now that we will not. I think that the \nCongress--at least the Senate--is not addressing the issue because \nthere is not clear-cut agreement in this body as to how to proceed.\n  My own view is that an air attack and a missile attack, if one is to \nbe carried out, constitutes an act of war. And under the Constitution \nthat requires Congressional authorization. The President is authorized \nas the Commander in Chief--and there is only one Commander in Chief, \nand it is obvious that where the 535 Members of the Congress cannot \nagree upon a program that we are not committed to be the executive. \nThat is why we have an executive. But still the Constitution requires \nthat war would be declared only by an act of Congress. And I think the \ninternational law interpretations make it plain that military action, \nlike air attack or missile attack, does constitute an act of war.\n  I believe that we have not yet seen a clear definition of U.S. \nobjectives as to what we are seeking to accomplish. My sense is that \nthe American people are not prepared for what may occur.\n  I make it a practice, as I know the Chair does, of having open house \ntown meetings. And I had three this week--\n\n[[Page S792]]\n\non Monday in Cumberland County, Lebanon County, and Lancaster County, \nPA. There is great concern among my constituents--those whom I have \ntalked to there and other places--of not having an idea as to precisely \nwhat we are going to accomplish.\n  It is my hope, if action is to be taken, that before any action is \ntaken the President of the United States will address the American \npeople and will identify the goals as he sees them and evaluate our \nlikelihood of attaining those goals so that the people of the United \nStates will be prepared and understand what is going to happen. But I \ndo not see at this date how there can be public support for an attack \nin the absence of informing the American people, preparing them and \nhaving a public dialog on the subject. The Congress is speaking loudly \nby not speaking at all on a resolution to authorize the use of force \nagainst Iraq.\n  In 1991, on January 10, this body authorized the use of force. I was \nat the forefront arguing that force should be used at that time. We had \nan extended debate. The Congress--the Senate specifically--was \ncomplimented for having a classic debate on what our vital national \ninterests were and how we should respond. I do believe that we have a \nvital national interest in what is going on in Iraq at the present \ntime. I do believe that there are great dangers posed by Saddam Hussein \nand by his weapons of mass destruction.\n  I had an opportunity back in January of 1990--just 8 years ago on a \ntrip with Senator Richard Shelby--to talk to Saddam Hussein. It is not \nan easy matter to deal with Saddam Hussein, as we have seen. There is \nsome talk that Saddam Hussein ought to be toppled. But the air attacks, \nthe missiles, and the planes will not accomplish that. It is plain at \nthis juncture that there is no positioning of the kind of ground forces \nnecessary to topple Saddam Hussein. Even as to the air attacks, it is \nplain that we will not destroy all of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  The question is: How will Saddam Hussein come out of whatever \nmilitary force we use? I am very much concerned that he may come out a \nmartyr. Certainly the lack of support for the United States raises \nmajor questions as to how the rest of the world views this issue.\n  On my travels--and I have traveled extensively, Mr. President, in my \ncapacity as Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the 104th \nCongress, and my work on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee--I have \nfound that there is great admiration for the United States around the \nworld. People all over the globe admire our economic achievements. They \nadmire our values. They admire our freedom, and the success of our free \nenterprise system. But there is also a touch of concern about abuse of \npower or excessive use of power, perhaps arrogance. And, we have to \nevaluate that very carefully in what we do as to Iraq.\n\n  I made a trip to the Mideast from late December to mid-January, and \nwherever I went I heard concerns about the projection of American power \nand concerns about the Iraqi civilian population, not Saddam Hussein, \nbut concern about the Iraqi civilian population. It is an odd quirk of \nhistory that after the great success of the United States, the \ncoalition put together by President Bush, which was a masterful job, \nPresident Bush is in Houston and Saddam is still in Baghdad running \nIraq.\n  I have spoken with some frequency on the question of greater personal \nPresidential involvement in international dispute resolution, a subject \nthat I have discussed personally with the President. It is my view that \nPresident Clinton can leave the Department of Agriculture to Secretary \nGlickman and the Department of the Interior to Secretary Babbitt, and \nso forth, but only the President of the United States can wield the \nenormous power that comes from the Presidency.\n  In 1995, Senator Brown and I spoke to Prime Minister Gowda of India, \nwho said to us that he hoped the subcontinent could become nuclear \nfree. The next day we passed that information on to Prime Minister \nBenazir Bhutto of Pakistan, who asked us if we had it in writing. We \ntold her, of course, we did not. But we asked her when she had last \ntalked to the Prime Minister of India. She said, ``We don't talk.''\n  That night Senator Brown and I cabled President Clinton with those \nviews fresh in our mind, urging the President to call those Prime \nMinisters to the Oval Office; nobody turns down an invitation to the \nOval Office. And later talking to the President, he said, well, I \nintend to do that after I am re-elected. I have talked to him since, \nand it has not yet happened.\n  I think the President did an outstanding job, and I compliment him on \nthe negotiations in the Mideast in the 1995 timeframe where the \nPresident and the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, almost \nbrokered an agreement between Syria and Israel. When I met with the \nPresident in mid-December before my trip to the Mideast, I urged him to \nbecome active again on that track of the peace process because I think \nthe parties are very close.\n  I had a chance to talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu and President \nAssad in August-November of 1996, and they were pretty far apart. Prime \nMinister Netanyahu said that he wanted to resume peace negotiations but \nhe had a new mandate, he wanted to start fresh. President Assad of \nSyria said that he would want to start negotiations but would want to \npick up where he, or Syria, and Prime Minister Rabin left off before \nPrime Minister Rabin's assassination in November of 1995. In talking to \nthem last month the words were about the same but the music was \ndifferent.\n  I think that Presidential involvement there might find success, \nespecially with the explicit condition that any agreement would be \nsubject to ratification by the Israeli electorate on the Golan Heights, \nsomething about which only Israel could make a decision for themselves \nconsidering all the security factors, and the issue with the \nPalestinians much more difficult, the Israel-Palestine crack. But here \nI think personal Presidential involvement might be very successful. I \nthink there has been the absence of that, where we find ourselves with \nonly Great Britain at our side now as we look to action against Iraq. I \nhave heard what the Secretary of Defense has had to say, and I have \ntotal respect and confidence in Secretary Cohen based on the 16 years \nthat I worked with him in the Senate. But he alone cannot carry the \nExecutive burden in this matter.\n  On the information at hand, we do not have the cooperation of others \nin a military attack. I think that has to be weighed very carefully. I \ndo think that there are alternatives. I do think that the issue of a \nblockade is something that might bring Saddam Hussein, if not to his \nknees, to a greater economic impasse. It would be my hope that before \naction is taken which constitutes an act of war, the issue would be \ndebated by the Senate and by the House of Representatives and an \nappropriate resolution would be put before us to have the appropriate \nconstitutional authorization.\n\n  I know that many of our colleagues have spoken on this matter in the \ncourse of the last several days, and as the last speaker in the Senate \nbefore we go to adjournment, I did want to make these comments for \nwhatever consideration the President and the Executive may choose to \nmake of them.\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF JUDGE MASSIAH-JACKSON\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I did not have an opportunity yesterday \nafter the Majority Leader announced the resolution of the proceedings \nas to the pending nomination of Judge Massiah-Jackson for the United \nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I \nsought recognition to speak with unanimous consent for up to 1 minute, \nand there was an objection levied so I was not able to talk at that \ntime.\n  I cannot limit my remarks to a single minute today because there are \nother things to be commented upon, but I believe that the referral of \nthis matter to the Judiciary Committee is the appropriate course of \nconduct. Notwithstanding my continuing efforts to set forth the facts, \nmy own personal activities have been grossly inaccurately reported.\n  First, it is President Clinton who has recommended Judge Massiah-\nJackson for the Federal court. That is the President's nomination. It \nis not my nomination or the nomination of Senator Santorum. It is true \nthat Massiah-Jackson was cleared by a nonpartisan panel appointed by \nSenator Santorum and me, but that approval\n\n[[Page S793]]\n\ndoes not involve any personal activity or action by either of the \nSenators.\n  Second, in my capacity as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand since Judge Massiah-Jackson is a constituent, I have vigorously \nsought to see that she received fair treatment, just as I did when the \nJudiciary Committee considered the nomination of Justice Clarence \nThomas.\n  Third, I have made a public commitment to review all the matters \nsubmitted by her opponents before casting my vote on the Senate floor.\n  Fourth, I have been proactive in seeking all the facts against her \nconfirmation as well as all of the facts of those who support her.\n  The charge has been made that I made a ``deal'' with the White House \nto appoint Judge Massiah-Jackson in exchange for the appointment of \nJudge Bruce Kauffman, who was sworn into the United States District \nCourt on January 20. The facts are that I am party to an arrangement \nfor Republicans to receive one nomination for the district courts for \nevery three Democrats who are nominated, an arrangement identical with \nthat now applicable to the State of New York. But I am not under any \nobligation to support any specific nominee, nor anybody submitted by \nthe White House from the Democratic ranks. I am not under any \nobligation to support anyone, including Judge Massiah-Jackson, if I \nconclude the person is not qualified.\n  When Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination was announced by the \nPresident on July 31, 1997, there were rumors of opposition, and in \norder to try to find out what the facts were in opposition, Senator \nSantorum, Senator Biden and I held a hearing in Philadelphia on October \n3. All of the witnesses who testified favored Judge Massiah-Jackson, \nincluding five of her colleagues from the Common Pleas bench.\n  Mayor Rendell, who had been district attorney for 3 of her 7 years on \nthe criminal bench, was enthusiastically in support of her nomination. \nThen the Judiciary Committee held its formal hearing on October 29, and \nagain no witnesses opposed her. Senator Kyl, Senator Sessions and I \nquestioned her closely on her record, and on November 6 she was \nreported out of the Committee by a vote of 12 to 6.\n  Thereafter, when district attorneys from Pennsylvania raised \nobjections, Senator Santorum and I took a proactive position to meet \nthose district attorneys, and we heard them out on January 23. I then \narranged to get all of their opposing cases by January 30, with an \nopportunity for Judge Massiah-Jackson to respond, and that is what we \nawait at the present time. As a matter of fundamental fairness, she is \nentitled to that hearing.\n  So, I think the Senate has taken the appropriate stand to have the \nhearing, and those who object will hear what Judge Massiah-Jackson has \nto say and then I, as a juror, along with my colleagues, will take a \nlook at all of the facts and make a decision as to whether she is to be \nconfirmed or whether she should be rejected. I thank the Chair for the \ncourtesy and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/12/senate-section/article/S791-6", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
