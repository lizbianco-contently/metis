Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of the veto message on H.R. 1122, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Veto message on H.R. 1122, to amend title 18, to ban \n     partial-birth abortions.\n\n  The Senate resumed reconsideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to speak \non behalf of millions of defenseless unborn children who cannot speak \nfor themselves. If they could speak, I know that they would ask for a \nchance to live. Tragically, too many unborn children are not given a \nchoice and they lose their chance at life to abortion.\n  We are not here today to debate the legality of abortion. We are here \nto discuss ending partial-birth abortion--a particularly gruesome \nprocedure that would be outlawed today but for the President's veto \nlast year of a national ban.\n  Banning partial-birth abortions goes far beyond traditional pro-life \nor pro-choice views. No matter what your personal opinion regarding the \nlegalization of abortion, we should all be appalled and outraged by the \npractice of partial-birth abortions. This procedure is inhumane and \nextremely brutal, entailing the partial delivery of a healthy baby who \nis then killed by having its vibrant brain stabbed and suctioned out of \nthe skull.\n  This is simply barbaric.\n  I have heard from thousands of people in my home State of Arizona who \nare outraged that this brutal procedure is permitted. Many of them have \ndiffering views regarding the legalization of abortion, but they all \nconcur that partial-birth abortions are particularly cruel and must be \nstopped.\n  Arizonans were recently reminded about the devastating effects for \nunborn children of partial-birth abortions. On June 30 of this year, a \nphysician in Phoenix attempted to perform a partial-birth abortion. Dr. \nJohn Biskind of the A-Z Women's Center was aborting what he believed \nwas a 23-week-old baby.\n  After beginning the procedure, Dr. Biskind realized that the child \nwas actually a 37-week, 6-pound baby girl. He immediately stopped the \nabortion procedure and delivered the baby girl. She suffered a \nfractured skull and facial lacerations, but thankfully is now \nrecovering with a loving family who adopted her.\n  This deplorable incident should never have occurred. It could have \nbeen prevented, sparing this little girl, now known as Baby Phoenix, \nthe physical and emotional trauma of nearly being killed at birth.\n  If a national ban on partial-birth abortion had been the law, this \nArizona doctor would not have been performing such a horrific procedure \non a viable 23-week-old baby--let alone 37-week-old Baby Phoenix.\n  Clearly, this near-tragedy illustrates the urgent need for a ban on \npartial-birth abortions in our Nation. We simply cannot allow this \nheinous procedure to continue taking the lives of viable, healthy \nbabies.\n\n[[Page S10552]]\n\n  Some would argue that abortion, including partial-birth abortion, is \na matter of choice--a woman's choice. Respectfully, I must disagree.\n  What about the choice of the unborn baby? Why does a defenseless, \ninnocent child not have a choice in their own destiny?\n  Some may answer that the unborn baby is merely a fetus and is not a \nbaby until he or she leaves the mother's womb. Again, I disagree, \nparticularly, in the case of infants who are killed by partial-birth \nabortions.\n  Most partial-birth abortions occur on babies who are between 20 and \n24 weeks old. Viability, ``the capacity for meaningful life outside the \nwomb, albeit with artificial aid'' as defined by the United States \nSupreme Court, is considered by the medical community to begin at 20 \nweeks for an unborn baby. Most, if not all, of the babies who are \naborted by the partial-birth procedure could be delivered and live. \nInstead, they are partially delivered and then murdered. These children \nare never given a choice or a chance to live.\n  Today, we have to make a choice. We can choose to protect our \nNation's most valuable resource--our children. We can choose to give a \ntomorrow full of endless possibilities to unborn children throughout \nour Nation. We can choose to save thousands from being murdered at the \nhands of abortionists.\n  Or we can choose to allow this barbaric procedure to continue, \npermitting doctors to kill more innocent, unborn children.\n  We each have a choice, a choice which unborn children are denied. We \nmust make the right choice when we vote today, the choice to save \nthousands of unborn children by banning partial-birth abortions in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nterrific statement.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be taken off the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 2 \nminutes off the time of the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been listening, as I have in years \npast, to the debate, to the eloquence of those dedicated individuals \nwho feel so strongly about this issue, particularly the leadership of \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania and the things he has said, the things he \nhas stood for, and the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, and \nthen Dr. Frist.\n  I hope people heard what Dr. Frist said because he really is the only \none who truly is a professional, who truly understands what this is all \nabout, who can articulate the pain that a small baby during the birth \nprocess feels when he is put to death in the very cruel way that this \ntakes place.\n  As he described that procedure--the procedure of going under the \ncranium with scissors and opening it up with no anesthesia and the baby \nfeeling that pain--something occurred to me: that those individuals who \nwant to keep that procedure alive and keep it legal are the same ones \nwho, if you did that to a dog, would be picketing your office.\n  I think somehow we have developed, in a perverted way, into a \nsociety, many of whom put a greater value on the lives of critters than \non human life. I hope we change that today. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time run off the time of the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak and have \nmy time allocated to the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in approximately 40 minutes, this Senate \nis going to cast a historic vote. We are going to have the opportunity \nto, again, define who we are as a people.\n  I urge my colleagues, as I have in the past, to vote to override the \nPresident's veto. I ask unanimous consent that a letter which I have be \nprinted into the Record. This is a letter dated May 8, 1997. This is a \nletter that is signed by a number of law professors.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator: We write to you as law professors in support \n     of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, S. 6. We do not write \n     as partisans. We are both Democrats and Republicans, and we \n     are of different minds on various aspects of the abortion \n     issue. We are concerned, however, that baseless legal \n     arguments are being offered to oppose a ban on partial-birth \n     abortions, and we are unanimous in concluding that such a ban \n     is constitutional.\n       We have learned that some Senators are concerned about \n     claims that a ban on second trimester partial-birth \n     abortions, or a ban on third trimester procedures without a \n     ``health'' exception, would be unconstitutional under Roe v. \n     Wade and later abortion decisions.\n       The destruction of human beings who are partially born is, \n     in our judgment, entirely outside the legal framework \n     established in Roe v. Wade  and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. \n     No Supreme Court decision, including these, ever addressed \n     the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of partially \n     born children. In fact, Roe noted explicitly that it did not \n     decide the constitutionality of that part of the Texas law \n     which forbade--and still forbids--killing a child in the \n     process of delivery.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ 410 U.S. 113, fn. 1 (1973), citing Art. 1195, of Title \n     15, Chapter 9. (Presently, this law is codified at Vernon's \n     Ann. Texas Civ. St. Art. 4512.5.) A similar ban remains in \n     effect in Louisiana (L.A. Revised Statutes 14.87.1). The \n     Texas and Louisiana statutes are also consistent with \n     existing case law in California. See People v. Chavez, 77 \n     Cal. App. 2d 621 (1947) (``It should equally be held that a \n     viable child in the process of being born is a human being \n     within the meaning of the homicide statutes, whether or not \n     the process has been fully completed.''); accord Keeler v. \n     Superior Court, 2 Cal. 3d 619 (1970).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Even should a court in the future decide that a law banning \n     the partial-birth procedures is to be evaluated within the \n     Roe/Casey ``abortion'' framework, we believe such a ban would \n     survive legal scrutiny thereunder. The partial-birth \n     procedure entails mechanical cervical dilation, forcing a \n     breech delivery, and exposing a mother to severe bleeding \n     from exposure to shards of her child's crushed skull. Before \n     viability, an abortion restriction is unconstitutional only \n     if it creates an ``undue burden'' on the judicially \n     established right to have an abortion. A targeted ban of a \n     single, maternal-health-endangering procedure cannot \n     constitute such a burden.\n       To the extent of its constitutionally delegated authority, \n     Congress may also ban all forms of abortion after viability, \n     subject to the health and life interests of the mother. Under \n     the most recent Supreme Court decision concerning abortion, \n     Planned Parenthood v. Casey, there is no reason to assume \n     that the Supreme Court would interpret a post-viability \n     health exception to require the government to tolerate a \n     procedure which gives zero weight to the life of a partially-\n     born child and which itself poses severe maternal health \n     risks. Furthermore, according to published medical testimony, \n     including that of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop: \n     ``Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the \n     contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to \n     both her immediate health and future fertility.'' Even the \n     American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists--which \n     opposes the bill--acknowledges that partial-birth abortion is \n     never the ``only option to save the life or preserve the \n     health of the woman.'' Banning this procedure does not \n     compromise a mother's health interests. It protects those \n     interests.\n       In short, while individuals may have ideological or \n     political reasons to oppose banning the partial-birth \n     procedure, those objections should not, in good conscience, \n     be disguised as legal or constitutional in nature.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       Rev.

Mr. President, this letter addresses a lot of the \nconcerns that were expressed on the floor yesterday about the \nconstitutionality of this piece of legislation. I call Members' \nattention to portions of this letter. They will have an opportunity to, \nof course, read the entire letter. This is what, in part, the letter \nsays:\n\n       We write to you as law professors in support of the \n     Partial-Birth Abortion Ban. . . . We do not write as \n     partisans. We are both Democrats and Republicans, and we are \n     of different minds on various aspects of the abortion issue. \n     We are concerned, however, that baseless legal arguments are \n     being offered to oppose a ban on partial-birth abortions, and \n     we are unanimous in concluding that such a ban is \n     constitutional.\n       The destruction of human beings who are partially born is, \n     in our judgment, entirely outside the legal framework \n     established in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. \n     No Supreme Court decision, including these, ever addressed \n     the constitutionality of forbidding the killing of partially \n     born children. In fact, Roe noted explicitly that it did not \n     decide the constitutionality of that part of the Texas law \n     which forbade --and still forbids--killing a child in the \n     process of delivery.\n       Even should a court in the future decide a law banning the \n     partial-birth procedure is to be evaluated within the Roe/\n     Casey ``abortion'' framework, we believe such a ban would \n     survive legal scrutiny thereunder. The partial-birth \n     procedure entails mechanical cervical dilation, forcing a \n     breech delivery, and exposing a mother to severe bleeding \n     from exposure to shards of her child's crushed skull. Before \n     viability, an abortion restriction is unconstitutional \n     only if it creates an ``undue burden'' on the judicially \n     established right to have an abortion. A targeted ban of \n     single, maternal-health-endangering procedure cannot \n     constitute such a burden.\n\n  The letter goes on to quote C. Everett Koop, who has been quoted on \nthis floor before on this issue.\n\n       Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to \n     protect the mother's health or future fertility. On the \n     contrary, this procedure could impose a significant threat to \n     both her immediate health and future fertility.\n\n  It is abundantly clear that this law is constitutional. I again ask \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of the override.\n  I first had the opportunity to listen to this debate several years \nago when a nurse from my home State of Ohio, nurse Brenda Shafer, \ntestified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. She is the first \nperson, really, to draw public attention to this procedure. She was \npro-choice. She was called in on a temporary basis to go to Dr. \nHaskell's abortion clinic in Dayton, OH. What she saw and what she \ndescribed, I think, has shocked the Nation. This pro-choice nurse \nbecame a person adamantly opposed to partial-birth abortion. She \ndescribed it in detail, as has been described on this floor many, many \ntimes. It is something that no civilized society should tolerate.\n  This vote that we are going to cast in a moment is about who we are \nas a people, what we tolerate, and what we do not tolerate. It is time \nfor this country, for the Senate, and this Congress, to say this \nbarbaric procedure we simply will no longer tolerate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes from our time to the \nchampion and initial author of this bill in the Senate, Senator Bob \nSmith of New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, \nSenator Santorum, for his leadership on this issue.\n  I pick up on what Senator DeWine just said about Nurse Shafer. \nThirteen years she worked in an abortion clinic. She testified before \nthe Judiciary Committee, and I think it might be interesting to read \nher statement about what she saw, word for word. I don't think anybody \nhas done that. Listen to Nurse Shafer, who witnessed this partial-birth \nabortion.\n\n       I stood at the doctor's side and I watched him perform a \n     partial-birth abortion on a woman who was 6 months pregnant. \n     The baby's heart beat was clearly visible on the ultrasound \n     screen. The doctor delivered the baby's legs and arms. \n     Everything but his little head. The baby's body was moving. \n     His little fingers were clasped together. He was kicking his \n     feet. The doctor took a pair of scissors and inserted them \n     into the back of the baby's head and the baby's arms jerked \n     out in a flinch, a startled reaction like a baby does when he \n     thinks that he might fall. Then the doctor opened the \n     scissors up. Then he stuck a high-powered suction tube into \n     the hole and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby was \n     completely limp. I never went back to the clinic, but I'm \n     still haunted by the face of that little boy. It was the most \n     perfect angelic face I have ever seen.\n\n  My colleagues, if we continue to tolerate this, somehow, some way, \nsome day, we are going to be judged. This is wrong. This is immoral. \nWhen we see and hear the things that are going on in our country today \nand read and hear the polls, maybe we shouldn't be surprised. This is \nthe standard that we set for our children? What a disgraceful thing to \ndo, not to override this veto.\n  The President's own Southern Baptist religion, past and current \npresident of the Southern Baptist Convention, wrote a letter to the \nPresident of the United States pleading with him to change his \nposition, telling him why they believe he was wrong, that there is no \nmedical reason to improve the health or to save the life of the mother. \nThere is no medical reason to perform this--180 doctors in a letter I \nreferred to yesterday on the floor said so; 4 doctor at a press \nconference yesterday said so; so did Dr. Koop, one of the most \nrespected people ever to serve in government, former Surgeon General.\n  Yet here we are. This is a terrible thing. I just hope and pray that \nmy colleagues in the next hour or the next half hour will see the \nlight, if you will, and change their position so we can win this vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire and thank him \nfor his tremendous leadership on this issue.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Indiana, who is leaving this \nChamber after many years of distinguished service. He has been the \nchampion here for life, Senator Coats from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me first say thanks to my colleagues \nfrom Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Ohio, and others who have so \npersuasively and so relentlessly pursued the truth of this issue and \nbrought us to this point where we have to have an honest, open debate \nand a vote about\n\n[[Page S10554]]\n\nwhere we stand on what I believe is the most important issue facing \nAmerica.\n  We do have fundamental disagreement over the subject of abortion. \nStrong convictions have often led to strident rhetoric. Sometimes \nlabels and name-calling are too easily substituted for persuasion. \nEducation is a means of winning the hearts and minds of our fellow \ncitizens. ``Extremism'' and ``fanaticism'' have been labels that have \nbeen used and attached to those with deeply held beliefs.\n  Yet as civil as our discourse needs to be, sometimes there are issues \nthat are of such weight and such gravity that strong rhetoric is \nnecessary, when the truth--raw and exposed--merits passion and \nrhetoric. This is such a case. There really is only one issue at stake \nhere. That issue is that what we are confronting is an affront to \nhumanity. It is an affront to justice to end the life of a kicking \ninfant as it emerges from its mother's womb. That is at issue here. The \nlegislation that the President has vetoed is not the expression of \nextremism. The expression of extremism is the procedure we are \ndebating--extreme in its violence and disregard for human life and \ndignity. We have heard a description of that. I was going to give that, \nbut I will defer on the description because it has been given by my \ncolleague from New Hampshire. The opposition has used arguments to \ndefend this procedure that I believe are evasive and misrepresent the \ntruth.\n\n  It is said that the procedure is rare and, therefore, we ought not to \nbe discussing it. Despite the fact that the procedure is not rare and \naffects thousands of individuals--children--would we be passing on the \ndebate, the fundamental issue of life itself, if we were talking about \nthe Holocaust because somebody was saying we are not talking about very \nmany people? It is just a few hundred or a few thousand. Does that make \nthe debate or issue any different?\n  The issue is not whether it is rare; the issue is, as a matter of \nundeniable, unalienable human rights, it should not only be rare, this \nprocedure should be nonexistent.\n  It is said that the child feels nothing. We now know that the child \nfeels pain, that a mother's anesthesia does not eliminate her child's \npain. We know that a child killed in this procedure feels exactly what \na preemie would feel if a doctor performed a similar procedure in the \nnursery.\n  It is said that the procedure is done to save the life of the mother. \nWe know that is not true. We also know that this procedure has \nsignificant risks for the mother. In fact, the primary purpose of this \nprocedure is for the convenience of the abortionist.\n  It is said that the partial-birth abortion is part of the mainstream \nof medicine. But we know that the AMA Council on Legislation stated \nthat this practice is not a ``recognized medical technique,'' and that \nthis ``procedure is basically repulsive.'' Those are not the words of \nthis Senator. Those are not the words of those of us in the political \narena. Those are the words of the AMA Council.\n  So when we strip away all the arguments, we are left with an \nuncomfortable truth: This procedure is not the practice of medicine; it \nis an act of violence, an almost unspeakable act of violence--the \ntaking of an innocent life, a life fully capable of being self-\nsustaining.\n  Mr. President, it is hard to clearly confront the reality of this \nmatter because clarity requires such anguish. But that reality is \nsimple and terrible. The reality is that the death of a child should \nhaunt us and shame us as a society. It should cause us to grieve. But \nmore than that, it should cause us to turn our backs on this practice, \nas my colleague from New York has said, which borders on infanticide, \nand which I believe is infanticide.\n  It is hard for me to believe that such a statement, such a debate, \nshould be necessary. It is hard for me to understand how a moral \ncommitment so basic could ever be debated on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. Has our compassion grown so selective? Has our moral sense \ngrown so dull? Have our hearts grown so hard?\n  This is not just another skirmish in the running debate between left \nand right. It raises the most basic of questions asked in any \ndemocracy: Who is my neighbor? Who is my brother? Who do I define as \ninferior and cast beyond sympathy and protection? Who do I embrace and \nvalue, in both law and love?\n\n  This is not a matter of ideology; it is a matter of humanity. This is \nnot just a matter of our Nation's politics; it is a matter of our \nNation's soul. It is a matter of how we will be judged as a nation, not \nonly by history, but by Almighty God.\n  We have disagreed in this body in matters of social policy. Yet, \nsurely, we can come together and agree on this one thing--that an \nunborn child should not be subjected to violence and death. I believe \npersonally that that protection should be applied and extended to all \nof the unborn. That is a debate that we must have, but that is not the \ndebate today. The debate today is over this particular procedure. At \nthe very least, regardless of our view and position of how far this \nought to extend, to all of humanity and all of creation, can we not at \nleast today reject the extinction of a child's life just seconds before \nit is born and fully leaves the womb? Can we not at least refuse to \ncross this line?\n  Mr. President, the vote today is an opportunity for us to take a \ndifferent path. It is an opportunity for Republicans and Democrats, \nliberals and conservatives, and it is an opportunity even for those who \nsupport abortion and take the pro-choice position, to override the \nPresident's veto. We can begin today to define some common ground. We \ncan begin today by saying every child in America will be embraced by \nour community, that no one is expendable, no one will be turned away. \nWe can begin today to define a basic value, a basic common ground, \nbecause if we pass this legislation over the President's objection, it \nwill mean that we will, once again, in this great experiment in \ndemocracy, extend the circle of protection and expand it one more time. \nThis is the test of a just civilization, and this is the standard by \nwhich we, individually and as a nation, will be tested as well.\n  If we defeat this measure, we will say something about this great \nAmerican experiment and the limits that we place on its promise. Our \nfounders raised the standard for the ages that all men are created \nequal and endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. It \nis true that the laws they lived by, even the Constitution they wrote, \nstood in tension with that transcendent ideal. But the standard \nremained and has sustained the hopes of the weak throughout the history \nof this country.\n  The history of our Nation is a story of how the hopes of the weak \nhave been advanced, our progress toward the ideals of the declaration \nhas been bought with blood, demanded with eloquence, and written into \nour law in some historic debates in this Chamber and elsewhere.\n  Mr. President, one by one, the powerless have been embraced and the \nAmerican family has been extended--to African Americans, women, the \ndisabled. Each have redeemed a promissory note, given at our founding. \nEach victory of compassion and justice has been a landmark of liberty. \nOver time, justice has prevailed.\n  Abraham Lincoln wrote of our founders:\n\n       This was their majestic interpretation of the economy of \n     the universe. This was their lofty, and wise, and noble \n     understanding of the justice of the Creator to his creatures. \n     . . . In their enlightened belief, nothing stamped with the \n     divine image and likeness was sent into the world to be \n     trodden on. . . . They grasped not only the whole race of man \n     then living, but they reached forward and seized upon the \n     farthest posterity. They erected a beacon to guide their \n     children, and their children, and the countless myriads who \n     would inhabit the Earth in other ages.\n\n  Does that beacon still shine throughout the world? Does the light of \nthat path of nations, where freedom is new, shine? And what is the \nexample that we set?\n  It is my deepest concern, my nightmare fear that we will extinguish \nthat light, that we will halt the progress of America's promise, and we \nwill cast one class of the powerless into the darkness beyond our \nprotection.\n  Lincoln talked of America as a nation dedicated to a proposition \nembodied in the declaration, but can the weakest member of the human \nfamily find a humble share in the promise of our founding? Will we say, \nafter centuries of struggle, that the gate of\n\n[[Page S10555]]\n\nmercy is now slammed shut, locked and the key thrown away?\n  These are the questions that put the American experiment to the test. \nLet us affirm the words of the Great Emancipator that nothing, nothing \nstamped with a divine image and likeness is denied the right to \nparticipate in this noble experiment called democracy. Let us not fail \nin this test that is now put before us.\n  Mr. President, it appears my time has expired. I thank, again, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania for his outstanding leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to sustain the President's \nveto.\n  The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has \ncontinually expressed deep concern about legislation prohibiting the \nintact D procedure, which is the technical name for the late term \nbirth abortion procedure. They have urged congress not to pass \nlegislation criminalizing this procedure and not to supersede the \nmedical judgment of trained physicians. They have stated, ``The \nintervention of legislative bodies into medical decision making is \ninappropriate, ill advised, and dangerous.''\n  The Supreme Court has ruled that a ban on all abortions after \nviability is permitted under the Constitution providing the ban \ncontains an exception to protect the life and health of the woman.\n  The bill vetoed by the President does not meet that test because the \nexception it provides for does not include language relative to a \nwoman's health.\n  Principally for both those reasons, I voted against this legislation \nand I continue to oppose it. Instead, I support an alternative which \nwould ban all post-viability abortions, regardless of the procedure \nused, except in cases where it is necessary to protect a woman's life \nor health.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have all heard the shocking accounts of \nteenaged girls giving birth and then dumping their newborns into trash \ncans. One young woman from Delaware gave birth in a bathroom stall \nduring her prom, and then proceeded to strangle and suffocate her \nchild, leaving his body in the garbage. Cases in Maryland and Arkansas \ntell similar stories.\n  Criminal charges were recently brought against a young woman in my \nhome state of Utah for secretly giving birth in her parent's Salt Lake \nCity home and then leaving the baby to die in a drawer.\n  As I read these accounts, I find myself wondering about the blurry \nline which exists between late-term abortions and infanticide. William \nRaspberry argued in a July 13, 1998, column in the Washington Post: a \n``short distance [exists] between what [these teenagers] have been \nsentenced for doing and what doctors get paid to do.''\n  Few people would dispute that such incidents constitute murder. Any \ncruelty or intentional harm inflicted on a defenseless child causes \nanger to rise in all of us, particularly when a variety of services \nexist to assist the parents with their responsibilities--or even, \nthrough foster care or adoption, to relieve them entirely.\n  I have sympathy for any young woman who contemplates an abortion. \nSurely this is a difficult decision to make. The circumstances that \ndrive a woman to it must certainly be complex and appear to her to be \ninsoluble.\n  But, the late-term partial birth abortion is not an ordinary \nabortion. It is not contemplated in the Roe v. Wade decision.\n  That is why even pro-choice members of Congress were compelled to \nsupport this legislation. It is incomprehensible that any reasonable \nperson could examine the evidence and continue to defend it.\n  This procedure involves the partial delivery, in the late second or \nthird trimester of pregnancy, of an intact fetus into the birth canal. \nThe fetus is delivered from its feet through its shoulders, so that \nonly its head remains in the uterus. Then, either scissors or another \ninstrument is used to poke a hole in the base of the skull where a \nsuction catheter is inserted to extract the baby's brain.\n  If you are sickened and pained by that description as you listen to \nit--just as I am each time I read it--imagine what it must be like for \nthe child who must experience it. This procedure is not done on a mass \nof tissue. It is performed on a living baby capable of feeling pain \nand, at the time this procedure is typically performed, capable of \nliving outside of the womb with appropriate medical attention.\n  So, then, I agree with William Raspberry and our colleague Senator \nMoynihan. The line between infanticide and partial birth abortion is \nvery blurry indeed.\n  Let me set out for the Senate one more time exactly what this bill \ndoes and does not do. This bill does not ban all abortions after a \ncertain week of pregnancy. It does not dictate the circumstances under \nwhich late-term abortions would be permitted. H.R. 1122 bans this one, \nspecific, abhorrent procedure.\n  Opponents of this bill argue that partial-birth abortions are \nperformed to preserve the health and life of the mother. This point of \nview, however, is based on false claims by advocacy groups and not on \nthe facts. Such claims are a futile attempt at making this procedure \nappear less barbaric and thus more palatable to the American people.\n  I think Americans deserve to hear the facts. They need to know the \ntruth about a procedure which our esteemed colleague from New York, \nSenator Moynihan, has accurately described as ``close to infanticide.''\n  The former U.S. Surgeon General, C. Everett Koop, described his \nopposition to the partial-birth abortion procedure in an interview with \nthe American Medical News, which was published in its August 19, 1996 \nissue. Dr. Koop stated:\n\n       . . . in no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-\n     term abortion as described--you know, partial birth, and then \n     destruction of the unborn child before the head is born--is a \n     medical necessity for the mother. It certainly can't be a \n     necessity for the baby. So I am opposed to . . . partial-\n     birth abortion.\n\n  Dr. Daniel H. Johnson, President of the American Medical Association, \nasserted the AMA's position on the issue in the May 26, 1997, edition \nof the New York Times. Dr. Johnson stated:\n\n       [T]he partial delivery of a living fetus for the purpose of \n     killing it outside the womb is ethically offensive to most \n     Americans and physicians. Our panel could not find any \n     identified circumstances in which the procedure was the only \n     safe and effective abortion method.\n\n  Often the health of the woman is not even under consideration. Dr. \nMartin Haskell, one of a hand full of doctors who perform this \nprocedure, admitted in testimony given under oath in Federal district \ncourt in Ohio that he performs the procedure on second trimester \npatients for ``some medical'' and ``some not so medical'' reasons.\n  The record in support of this legislation is long. In November 1995, \nI presided over a 6\\1/2\\-hour Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the \nissue. At the March 1997 Senate-House joint hearing, we heard from 10 \nwitnesses, including representatives of the major organizations on both \nsides of this issue and a medical doctor who specializes in maternal-\nfetal medicine. As testimony from the hearings demonstrated, this \nprocedure is not performed primarily to save the life of the mother or \nto protect her from serious health consequences. Instead, the evidence \nshows that this procedure is often performed in the late second and \nearly trimesters for purely elective reasons.\n  I acknowledge that there may have been rare cases where this awful \nprocedure was performed and where there was a possibility of serious, \nadverse health consequences for the mother.\n  However, even in those cases, a number of other procedures could have \nbeen performed. In fact, other procedures would have been performed had \nthe mothers gone to any doctor other than one of the handful of doctors \nwho perform these awful partial-birth abortions.\n  I understand that many people on both sides of the abortion issue \nhave very strongly held beliefs. I respect those whose views differ \nfrom my own. And I condemn, as I know every other Member of this body \ndoes, the use of violence or any other illegal method to express any \npoint of view on this issue.\n  It is critical to remember, however, that this bill is not about the \nright of a woman to choose an abortion. That is a debate for another \nday. The only bill we are voting on today is H.R. 1122, a bill that \nseeks to make a particularly gruesome, and I believe inhumane, abortion \nprocedure illegal.\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\n  I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Santorum for his \nleadership on this issue and join him in urging our colleagues to \nsupport this bill and override the President's veto.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this attempt to \noverride the President's veto of H.R. 1122, the so-called ``Partial \nBirth'' Abortion Ban Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, let it be clear that this legislation puts women's \nlives and health on the line. If we vote today to override the \nPresident's veto we will bear the burden of putting women's lives and \nhealth at risk by substituting the judgement of politicians for the \njudgement of medical doctors. And that just isn't right.\n  Twenty-two years ago, the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision in \nRoe versus Wade that held that women have a constitutional right to an \nabortion, but after viability, states could ban abortions--as long as \nthey allowed exceptions for cases in which a woman's life or health is \nendangered.\n  H.R. 1122 is in direct violation of the Court's ruling. It contains \nno exception for the health of the mother, and therefore represents a \ndirect, frontal assault not only on Roe, but on the health and \nreproductive rights of women everywhere.\n  It should be no surprise, then, that similar efforts around the \ncountry to ban the so-called ``partial birth'' abortion procedure have \nnot stood up to constitutional muster.\n  In fact, legal challenges have been mounted in 20 of the 28 states \nthat have passed these laws. Nineteen out of twenty states have had \ntheir laws enjoined or severely limited. Seventeen courts have issued \ntemporary or permanent injunctions stopping laws from taking effect. \nAnd one attorney general has limited enforcement of the law.\n  And I want to be just as clear that innocent women will suffer if we \nvote to override the President's veto. It is not simply the \nConstitution which demands a health exception be included in any such \nlegislation--it is compassion for the lives of our nation's women.\n  There is no question that any abortion is an emotional, wrenching \ndecision for a woman. No one would debate this. And when a woman must \nconfront this decision during the later stages of a pregnancy because \nshe knows that the pregnancy presents a direct threat to her own life \nor health, the ramifications of such a decision multiply dramatically.\n  So, too, is it beyond debate that all of us want to see the instances \nof abortions reduced in America. Unfortunately, contrary to what \nproponents of this legislation believe, H.R. 1122 will not bring us \ncloser to this goal. In contrast, it will force women and physicians to \nchoose another, less safe and potentially life threatening procedure. \nIs that what we really want? To put women's lives and health at risk?\n  Because that is exactly what H.R. 1122 will do. It will put women at \nunacceptable risk, while in turn doing absolutely nothing to lower the \nnumber of abortions in this country.\n  I suggest that there is a better way. I suggest we are not stuck with \nan all-or-nothing approach, even on this most contentious of issues.\n  That is why last year, I supported an amendment which would have \ndecreased the number of abortions in this country without putting the \nlives and health of women on the line.\n  This substitute would have ensured that no abortion will take place \nafter viability unless it is absolutely necessary to avoid grieve \nphysical injury to a woman, while protecting women's lives and health. \nAnd most of all, unlike the underlying bill, it would have reduced the \nnumber of abortions in this country.\n  Critics of this proposal, unfortunately, believed that this language \ncontains a loophole because it leaves it to the doctor to determine \nwhen the fetus is viable.\n  I find this viewpoint curious on two fronts. First, it begs the \nquestion, why did H.R. 1122 proponents trust doctors to determine when \nan abortion is necessary to protect a woman's life, when they do not \ntrust doctors to determine when a woman faces a grievous health risk or \nwhen the fetus is viable?\n  And second, who is in a better position than doctors to determine \nwhen the fetus is viable? Are opponents honestly suggesting the federal \ngovernment has the answer to that question?\n  The Supreme Court has said in Planned Parenthood versus Danforth, and \nI quote ``the time when viability is achieved may vary with each \npregnancy, and the determination of whether a particular fetus is \nviable, is, and must be, a matter for the judgment of the responsible \nattending physician.''\n  It comes down to who should be making these decision. Will it be \npoliticians, whose extent of medical knowledge may be little more than \nwhat they see on ``E.R.''? Or will it be physicians, who live ``E.R.''?\n  The substitute language we championed would have required that a \ndoctor certify that a post-viability abortion is necessary to protect a \nwoman from grievous injury. Any doctor who violated this requirement \nwould not only have faced still civil penalties, but will risk having \nhis or her medical license revoked.\n  Curiously, H.R. 1122 does not require a doctor to certify that this \nprocedure is necessary to protect a woman's life. For this reason, it \nappears far easier for a doctor to falsify information under the \nunderlying bill, because there is no certification requirement.\n  Mr. President, what the vast majority of American people really want \nfrom their leaders on this issue is an answer to the problem of late \nterm abortions, not a ban one procedure which will only force women to \nand doctors to choose other less safe procedures.\n  Because, despite the terrible conflict over H.R. 1122, there is one \narea where almost all Americans agree: That no viable fetus should be \naborted--by any methods--unless it is absolutely necessary to protect \nthe life or health of the mother.\n  By coming together on this issue, we can bridge the chasm that has \ndeveloped in this debate. And despite the fact that the substitute \namendment failed in this body last year, I still strongly believe this \nis the right course to take.\n  Forty-one States, including my home State of Maine, already ban post-\nviability abortions. We need to ensure that healthy pregnancies are \nnever terminated after a fetus is viable, regardless of the procedure \nused. We also need to ensure that any such measure is in keeping with \nthe Constitution and the best interests of the life and health of \nwomen.\n  These are not mutually exclusive goals. This is not a gulf that can \nnever be crossed. And this is an issue that is not going to go away.\n  That is why we are coming back this year, and renewing our effort to \nban all abortions after viability. On Wednesday, Senator Durbin and I, \nalong with Senators Collins, Mikulski, Landrieu, Lieberman, Graham, and \nTorricelli introduced a bipartisan measure, the Late-Term Abortion \nLimitation Act, because we believe this can and will solve the problem \nof late term abortions.\n  While the Durbin-Snowe legislation is similar to last year's \nsubstitute, it states that, prior to an abortion, both the performing \nphysician and an independent physician certify in writing that, in \ntheir medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would \nthreaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical \nhealth. With the opinion required from another doctor, this will ensure \nthat the abortion was absolutely medically necessary.\n  And finally, let me be clear that the health exception for ``grievous \nphysical injury'' could only be invoked under two circumstances.\n  The first involves those heart-wrenching cases where a wanted \npregnancy seriously threatens the health of the mother. The Durbin-\nSnowe language would allow a doctor in these tragic cases to perform an \nabortion because he or she believes it is critical to preserving the \nhealth of a woman facing: Peripartal cardiomyopathy, a form of cardiac \nfailure which is often caused by the pregnancy, which can result in \ndeath or untreatable heart disease; pre-eclampsia, or high blood \npressure which is caused by a pregnancy, which can result in kidney \nfailure, stroke, or death; and uterine ruptures which could result in \ninfertility.\n  Second, the language also applies when a woman has a life-threatening \ncondition which requires life-saving treatment. It applies to those \ntragic cases, for example, when a woman\n\n[[Page S10557]]\n\nneeds chemotherapy when pregnancy, so the families face the terrible \nchoice of continuing the pregnancy or providing life-saving treatment. \nThese conditions include: Breast cancer; lymphoma, which has a 50 \npercent mortality rate if untreated; and primary pulmonary \nhypertension, which has a 50 percent maternal mortality rate.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues, who could seriously object under these \ncircumstances?\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me restate that this is not a problem \nwithout a solution. The Durbin-Snowe language very clearly provides \nthis body with an alternative that will not only ensure that healthy \npregnancies will never be terminated after a fetus is viable; not only \nreduce the number of abortions in this Nation; not only put medical \ndecisions in the hands of medical doctors; but will be in keeping with \nthe requirements of the United States Constitution and our \nresponsibility to America's women.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to vote to sustain the President's \nveto, and I hope we can coalesce around support for the Durbin-Snowe \nbill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation, and I urge the \nSenate to sustain the President's veto.\n  In my view, this legislation is unconstitutional under the Supreme \nCourt's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and \nPresident Clinton was right to veto it. The Roe and Casey decisions \nprohibit the government from imposing an ``undue burden'' on a woman's \nconstitutional right to choose to have an abortion at any time up to \nthe point where the developing fetus reaches the stage of viability. \nThe government can constitutionally limit abortions after the stage of \nviability, as long as the limitations contain exceptions to protect the \nlife and the health of the woman.\n  This bill fails that constitutional test. In cases before viability, \nit clearly imposes an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to \nan abortion. In cases after viability, it clearly does not contain the \nconstitutionally required exception to protect the mother's health.\n  Supporters of this legislation are flagrantly defying these \nconstitutional requirements. In the vast majority of states that have \npassed so-called partial-birth abortion bans, the law is on appeal, \nenjoined, or the subject of a restraining order. With only one \nexception, where the laws have been challenged, the courts have \nconcluded that these bans are unconstitutional.\n  The conclusion is obvious. The supporters of this unconstitutional \nlegislation would rather have an issue than a bill. President Clinton \nvetoed this legislation on October 10, 1997. Almost an entire year has \npassed since that veto. If the Senate Republican leadership genuinely \ncared about preventing these abortions, they would have brought this \nveto before the Senate long ago. Instead, they delayed and delayed and \ndelayed. And now, surprise! The Senate is finally being asked to vote \non this veto a few weeks before election day. They want an issue, not a \nbill.\n  In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Coreen \nCostello put this issue clearly. After consulting numerous medical \nexperts and doing everything possible to save her child, Coreen \nCostello had the procedure that would be banned by this legislation. \nBased on that experience, she said this to our committee:\n\n       I hope you can put aside your political differences, your \n     positions on abortion, and your party affiliations and just \n     try to remember us. We are the ones who know. We are the \n     families that ache to hold our babies, to love them, to \n     nurture them. We are the families who will forever have a \n     hole in our hearts. We are the families that had to choose \n     how our babies would die . . . please put a stop to this \n     terrible bill. Families like mine are counting on you.\n       I want the Senate to sustain the President's veto.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to in support of the \nPresident's veto of the so-called Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act and \nurge my Colleagues to join me in defeating this real threat to women's \nhealth.\n  Most of what has been said here today in support of this ban is \ntroubling, because some have implied that women make health care \ndecisions in haste without much thought or understanding. Let me assure \nmy Colleagues that women have the ability to make informed health care \ndecisions. We are more than capable of understanding the difference \nbetween pre and post viability. We are more than capable of making wise \nhealth care decisions in consultation with our physicians and family. \nWe do not need Members of Congress making our health care decisions. I \nbelieve that most women would argue that health care decisions are best \nleft to physicians and patients.\n  We argue that patients and doctors should make health care decisions. \nNot insurance bureaucrats. Yet today many of my Colleagues are trying \nto make a major health care decision for many women in this country. \nNot just a health decision but for some women a life or death decision. \nThis is why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \noppose this ban. They understand the threat to women. They know first \nhand the complications that can develop throughout a pregnancy. They \nhave experienced first hand the risk that many women face throughout a \npregnancy. They are the one's we should be listening to in this debate.\n  That is the issue. Protecting the life and health of the woman. This \nis not about choice or even about the Constitution. This is about \nprotecting the life and health of women.\n  Let me point out to my Colleagues, post viability abortions are \nprohibited except when necessary to save the life and health of the \nwoman. This is the law of the land and I support it. But the \nlegislation that the Administration wisely vetoed would undermine this \nstandard established by the Supreme Court and includes no exception to \nsave the woman's health and the life exception is so narrow that few \ncould meet the test. There is no exception to protect a women's ability \nto have additional healthy children. There is no exception to give the \ndoctor the ability to do what is right for his or her patient. This is \na dangerous precedent that we cannot allow to go forward.\n  I have come to this floor many time to advocate on behalf of women's \nhealth. I have had many successes in increasing funding for research \nand in working to eliminate gender bias in research. I have worked to \nincrease funding for breast cancer research. I have fought to improve \nand expand mammography coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. I have \nworked to increase focus on cardiovascular disease, the number one \nkiller of American women. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, \nI have always considered women's health one of my top priorities.\n  I am here today for the same reason, to continue my fight for the \nlives and health of women. I urge my Colleagues to talk to women who \nhave had to make this decision to have this procedure. Listen to what \ntheir doctors told them and why they made the decision forced upon \nthem. I know that if you could hear what they have endured and the \nheartache they have faced you would understand why today's vote is a \nwomen's health vote and why this ban is such a danger to women.\n  Let women and their doctors make these difficult decisions. This ban \nis a serious threat to women and their families. Please do not \njeopardize a women's health and threaten her life based on gruesome \ndiagrams that simply do not tell the real story.\n  I would urge all of those who believe that this legislation is \nnecessary to take the time to listen to phyisicans and women who have \nhad this procdure. I can guarantee that this procedure is only done in \nthe final weeks of a pregnancy when it becomes medically necessary to \nsave the women's life or health.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on whether or \nnot to override the President's veto of H.R. 1122, the so-called \n``Partial Birth Abortion Ban''. I will cast my vote to uphold the \nPresident's veto.\n  I do so for several reasons. First and foremost, this bill denies a \nwoman, in consultation with her physician, the right to make necessary \nor appropriate medical decisions. Second, it does not provide any \nprotection for a woman whose health is grievously threatened by her \npregnancy. Third, this bill will not stop a single abortion from \noccurring. Finally, it is unconstitutional.\n  I believe that women, in consultation with their physicians, must \nmake decisions on what is medically necessary or appropriate in \nreproductive matters. These must be medical decisions not political \ndecisions.\n\n[[Page S10558]]\n\n  Mr. President, we need to let doctors be doctors. This is my \nprinciple whether we are talking about reproductive choice or any \nhealth care matter. Physicians have the training and expertise to make \nmedical decisions. They are in the best position to determine what is \nnecessary or appropriate for their patients. Not bureaucrats. Not \nmanaged care accountants. And certainly not legislators.\n  Who is best equipped to decide whether a difficult pregnancy \nthreatens a woman's life? Who decides whether a woman would suffer \ngrievous injury to her physical health if a pregnancy is continued? Who \ndecides what is medically necessary for a particular woman in her \nunique circumstances?\n  The answer must be that doctors decide. The women themselves must \ndecide. Legislators should not take the decision away from them. This \nbill is unacceptable because it shackles physicians. It prevents them \nfrom exercising their best medical judgement on behalf of their \npatients.\n  I also will vote to uphold the President's veto because this bill \ndoes not offer any protections for women's health. I know that there \nare many who view efforts to provide for the health of the woman as \nsome sort of loophole. But I believe we must acknowledge the realities \nof women's health and women's lives.\n  Even the most ardent opponent of reproductive rights would have to \nacknowledge that there are medical crises that arise during pregnancy \nthat could cause profound harm to women's health. Yet the authors of \nthe bill before us refused to make any concession to health concerns\n  I will vote today to sustain the President's veto because this bill \nwould not prevent one abortion--not one. By banning a particular \nprocedure, it does nothing to stop abortions from occurring. A doctor \ncan still opt to use any other abortion procedure--even ones that might \nbe less suitable for the woman's particular health circumstances. So \nlet's be clear--this bill would not prevent abortions.\n  Finally, this bill fails the test of constitutionality. The Supreme \nCourt in Roe versus Wade and in its subsequent decisions has been quite \nclear. Prior to the point of fetal viability, a woman's right to an \nabortion is constitutionally protected.\n  The Court has also insisted that any legislation restricting abortion \nmust ensure that the woman's life and her health are protected. The \nwoman's physician must place her health as the paramount concern. On \nboth of these points, this bill fails to meet the constitutional \nstandard the Court has established.\n  This is not mere speculation. In 19 out of 20 states that have passed \n``partial-birth'' abortion bills, either a court or state attorney \ngeneral has prevented those laws from taking effect. Six of those \nstates used language that is identical to the bill now before the \nSenate. Seventeen courts have ruled that these state laws are \nunconstitutional. So it should be clear that this bill cannot pass \nconstitutional muster.\n  For all of these reasons this bill is seriously flawed. The \nPresident's veto of this legislation was the right thing to do. It was \nthe constitutional thing to do. I expect that the Senate will vote \ntoday to uphold that veto.\n  When the Senate passed this legislation last May, I said that its \npassage was a hollow victory. It was hollow because the bill could \nnever be enacted into law and could never be upheld as Constitutional. \nI believe that subsequent events are proving that prediction to be \ncorrect.\n  There is a better way to address this issue. I believe the vast \nmajority of my colleagues would agree that--absent a threat to life or \na grievous threat to a woman's health--abortion in the last months of \npregnancy is not defensible. Why can't we enact legislation that would \nprovide a ban on those post viability abortions?\n  When the Senate considered this issue last May, I worked with my \nDemocratic Leader Tom Daschle and a bipartisan group of Senators to \ncraft such an approach. The Daschle alternative would have meant fewer \nabortions. It banned all abortions once a fetus had achieved viability.\n  It provided only two exceptions--first, when the woman's life was \nthreatened by continuing the pregnancy. Second, when she was at risk of \ngrievous injury to her physical health. And it allowed the woman and \nher physician to make that medical determination.\n  I still believe that is the correct approach, the common sense \napproach. The Daschle alternative was respectful of the Constitution. \nIt safeguarded women's health. I was disappointed that we were unable \nto pass this alternative. I believe the President would have signed a \nbill along the lines of the Daschle alternative.\n  Because I believe so strongly that this is the correct approach to \ntake, I have joined with my colleague, Senator Durbin, and others, in \nintroducing a bill modeled after the Daschle alternative.\n  I urge my colleagues--whether you support the bill we are considering \ntoday or not and whatever your views on reproductive choice--to take \nanother look at this proposal.\n  It is our best chance to forge a consensus on this issue. We can stop \ninappropriate post-viability abortions while still protecting the lives \nand health of women. The Durbin bill shows us the way. I believe it \nreflects the values and views of the American people.\n  So, Mr. President, I will vote to sustain the President's veto today. \nBut I would urge my colleagues to bring fresh thinking to this matter. \nWe can have a real legislative solution, rather than a political wedge \nissue. We should certainly try.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote to sustain the President's \nveto of HR 1122, the so-called partial birth abortion bill, that seeks \nto outlaw a particular abortion procedure, which is most closely \nanalogous to the intact dilation and extraction procedure, sometimes \ncalled Intact D I do support a ban on post-viability abortions, if \nthe ban is subject to important exceptions to protect a woman's life \nand prevent grievous injury to her physical health. I am disappointed \nthat the proponents of HR 1122 have steadfastly refused to accept any \namendment, no matter how tightly crafted, which would include \nprovisions to protect a woman's physical health in extreme \ncircumstances.\n  I have said repeatedly here on the floor of the Senate, during \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee, and at listening sessions held \nacross the state of Wisconsin that I believe post-viability abortions \nshould be banned, with two exceptions. The first is an exception to \nsave the life of the woman, which is an important and necessary \nprovision. I hope we can agree on that point. The second is to protect \na woman from grievous injury to her physical health. I hope we can also \nagree on that point. I am sensitive to the fears of the bill's \nproponents that any health exception might serve as a major loophole, \nand I agree that the definition of a threat to physical health should \nbe narrow. But it should be there.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Supreme Court has clearly ruled \nthat, although states have the right to restrict post-viability \nabortions, exceptions must always be made to protect the life and \nhealth of the mother. Twenty-eight states, including my own home state \nof Wisconsin, have passed so-called partial birth abortion bans, and \nthe statutes in ten states are substantially identical to HR 1122. \nWisconsin's experience in the wake of the passage of its partial birth \nabortion ban should give all of us, as we consider whether to override \nthe President's veto of HR 1122, some additional pause. For nearly two \nweeks following the passage of the state bill, physicians struggled to \ndetermine which procedures, if any, were allowed under the bill; \nprosecutors proclaimed that they couldn't enforce the new law in their \ncommunities until it was clarified by a court.\n  Last year, I voted for the bipartisan alternative amendment to HR \n1122 introduced by Senator Daschle and others. I voted for that \namendment because it took a comprehensive approach to banning abortions \non viable fetuses, rather than merely banning a single procedure. I did \nso, Mr. President, because I was concerned that the language contained \nin HR 1122 was imprecise. I looked closely at the bill to see how it \naddressed the significant concerns raised by my constituents based upon \naccounts and descriptions of the ``procedure'' they had heard. The text \nof HR 1122 does not specify a gestational age, such as ``late term;'' \nit\n\n[[Page S10559]]\n\ndoes not mention any specific part of the fetus, such as the head; and \nit does not mention any specific medical instruments, medical \nsituations or circumstances.\n  I believe that the Daschle amendment provides that needed clarity \nwhile being sufficiently narrow to satisfy most reasonable people's \nconcerns about healthy women with normal pregnancies who might seek to \nterminate those pregnancies in the third trimester. It would have \nrequired a physician to certify that continuation of the pregnancy \nwould threaten the woman's life or risk grievous injury to her \nphysicial health. Grievous injury was define in the amendment as ``a \nseverely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the \npregnancy, or any inability to provide necessary treatment for a life \nthreatening condition.''\n  The other side claims that abortion is never necessary to protect a \nwoman's health. But Mr. President, I have met women whose doctors \nbelieved differently. The American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists (ACOG) and the Society of Physicians for Reproductive \nHealth supports them. ACOG has stated that although Intact D & E may \nnot be the only option to save a woman's life or preserve her health, \nit sometimes may be the best or most appropriate procedure, depending \non the woman's particular circumstances. Precisely because I am not a \ndoctor. I think it is important for us to uphold the President's veto. \nThe point is, Mr. President, that there is a dispute within the medical \ncommunity about the necessity for and the risk associated with Intact D \n& E. And that is where it should be resolved. It should be women and \ntheir doctors, not politicians, who decide which medical procedure is \nappropriate within the confines of the Daschle amendment.\n  The Daschle alternative amendment struck the right balance between \nprotecting women's constitutional right to choose abortion and the \nright of the state to protect future life. It would have protected a \nwoman's physical health throughout her pregnancy, while ensuring that \nonly grievous, medically diagnosable physicial conditions could justify \nending a viable pregnancy. Within the terms of that amendment, both \nfetal viability and women's health would have been determined by the \nphysician's best medical judgement, as they should be.\n  I hope, as we vote today, we do so in full knowledge of the strong \nfeelings about this issue on all sides. We should respect these \ndifferences, avoid efforts to confuse or distort each others views \nbefore the public, and maintain a level of debate that reflects the \nimportance of relying on the facts about this issue and finding a \nresponse that is sensitive and constitutionally sound.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I opposed the override of the veto of \nH.R. 1122, a bill banning emergency late-term abortions. There are \nseveral reasons why this is a flawed bill. This bill attempts to ban a \nspecific medical procedure, called by opponents, partial-birth \nabortion, but there is no medical definition of partial-birth abortion. \nThe language in this bill is so vague that it could affect far more \nthan the one particular procedure it seeks to ban, procedures used \nduring the second and possibly the first trimester of a pregnancy. \nThere is no exception to protect the health of the woman. This bill \nwould ban a type of medical procedure regardless of whether it is the \nmedically safest procedure under a particular set of circumstances. \nStates are legislating prohibitions on abortions.\n  H.R. 1122 would criminalize the use of a medical procedure called, by \nthe bill, partial-birth abortion. This term does not appear in medical \ntextbooks or training. Doctors do not know what it means. The doctors \nwho testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee could not identify, \nwith any degree of certainty or consistency, what medical procedure \nthis legislation refers to. For example, when asked to describe in \nmedical terms what a partial-birth abortion is Dr. Pamela Smith, \nDirector of OB/GYN Medical Education at Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago \ncalled it ``a perversion of a breech extraction.'' (page 127) Dr. Nancy \nRomer, a practicing OB/GYN and Assistant Professor at Wright State \nUniversity School of Medicine, who said the doctors at her hospital had \nnever performed the procedure, had to quote another doctor in \ndescribing it as ``a dilation and extraction, distinguished from \ndismemberment D and Es.'' (page 182)\n  When the same question was posed to legal experts in Judiciary \nCommittee hearings--to define exactly what medical procedure would be \noutlawed by this legislation--the responses were equally vague. This \nvagueness means that every doctor that performs even a second trimester \nabortion could be vulnerable and could face possible prosecution under \nthis law.\n  The language in this bill is so vague that, far from outlawing just \none abortion procedure, the way this bill is written virtually any \nlegal procedure could fall within its scope. I asked the legal and \nmedical experts who testified at the Judiciary Committee hearing if \nthis legislation could affect abortion-not just late-term abortion-but \nearlier abortions as well. Dr. Lewis Seidman, Professor of Law at \nGeorgetown University, gave the following answer. ``As I read the \nlanguage in a second trimester pre-viability abortion where the fetus \nin any event will die, if any portion of the fetus enters the birth \ncanal prior to the technical death of the fetus, then the physician is \nguilty of a crime and goes to prison for two years.'' Dr. Seidman \ncontinued his testimony, concluding that ``if I were a lawyer advising \na physician who performed abortions, I would tell him to stop because \nthere is just no way to tell whether the procedure would eventuate in \nsome portion of the fetus entering the birth canal before the fetus is \ntechnically dead, much less being able to demonstrate that after the \nfact.'' (223)\n  Dr. Cortland Richardson, Associate Professor of Gynecology and \nObstetrics at John Hopkins University School of Medicine, in testimony \nbefore a House committee, said that the language ``partially vaginally \ndelivers'' is vague, not medically oriented, and just not correct. ``In \nany normal second trimester abortion procedure by any method, you may \nhave a point at which a part, a one inch of umbilical cord, for \nexample, of the fetus passes out of the cervical opening before fetal \ndemise has occurred.'' (H.R. Rep No. 267, September 27, 1995 testimony) \nSo this bill could affect far more than just the few abortions \nperformed in the third trimester, and far more than just the one \nprocedure being described.\n  This bill has no exemption to protect the health of the mother and as \nsuch, would directly eliminate that protection provided by the Supreme \nCourt in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood V. Casey.\n  If this bill were law, a pregnant woman seriously ill with diabetes, \ncardiovascular problems, cancer, stroke, or other health-threatening \nillnesses would be forced to carry the pregnancy to term or run the \nrisk that the physician could be challenged and have to prove in court \nwhat procedure he or she used, and whether or not the doctor \n``partially vaginally-delivered'' a living fetus before death of that \nfetus.\n  Here are some examples, provided to me by gynecologists, of rare \nmaternal medical conditions that could necessitate a post-viability \nprocedure to protect a woman's health. The health of these women would \nbe endangered in these situations.\n  A fetus has a huge hydrocephalic head (or other greatly enlarged \norgan) three times the normal size and a cranium is filled with fluid. \nThe head is so large the woman physically cannot deliver it. Labor is \nimpossible, because the fetus cannot get down the birth canal and out. \nA caesarian is impossible because it would require a huge, up-and-down \nincision, which would rupture in future pregnancies or labor. Thus, a \nwoman could not have future children and this procedure affects her \nability to have future pregnancies.\n  A condition called arthrogryposis, or a rigid fetus, the fetus cannot \nmove down and out in labor, and labor risks rupturing the woman's \ncervix. With prolonged intense pushing the mother's heart is put at \nrisk. If this stiff fetus cannot be delivered by a caesarian, a large \nvertical incision would be required, thus risking future pregnancies.\n  Women with certain health conditions cannot tolerate the stress of \nlabor or surgery. They include cardiac problems like congestive heart \nfailure; severe kidney disease (e.g. renal shutdown); severe \nhypertension, diathesphesis, and Von Willibrand's Disease (bleeding, \nclotting disorder).\n\n[[Page S10560]]\n\n  Pre-eclampsia (toxemia) is a serious complication of pregnancy and a \nleading cause of maternal and fetal death that affects the placenta. \nThe placenta does not attach to the wall of the uterus and thus limits \nthe amount of blood and nutrients reaching the fetus, causing it to be \nunderweight and prone to complications. This condition can progress to \neclampsia, which can lead to convulsions, kidney failure, and death. \nThe only treatment is to deliver the fetus. The woman cannot withstand \nlabor or surgery.\n  A woman with diabetes might have a decline in renal function. She \nmight not be able to tolerate the physical stress of labor or surgery.\n  Why is this legislation even necessary? Roe v. Wade unequivocally \nallows States to ban all post-viability abortions unless they are \nnecessary to protect a woman's life or health. Forty-one States have \ndone so. Surely, anyone who believes in States' rights must question \nthe logic of imposing new, Federal regulations on States in a case such \nas this in area where States have legislated.\n  Medical decisionmaking should be made by medically trained people, \nnot Congress. Congress cannot anticipate every medical situation and \nexplicitly delineate them in law. During pregnancy, labor, and \ndelivery, complicated conditions can develop that are often last \nminute, life-threatening, and complex for the mother and fetus. No \nlegislator can ever anticipate, craft into law, every conceivable \nmedical emergency that a physician caring for a pregnant woman will \nface.\n  We have entrusted and trained physicians to make safe and ethical \nmedical decisions based on scientific and medical data on the benefits \nand risks to the patient. They do so based on their extensive training, \ntheir best medical judgment, proven medical techniques, and therapeutic \nassessment of the patient.\n  Physicians are sworn to protect the health of their patients. \nCongress should not pass legislation that would deny a physician the \nability to provide care that in their professional judgment is \nmedically necessary.\n  Medical decisionmaking or choosing the most appropriate therapy is \nbased on the risk benefit for the mother and fetus, medical training, \nmultiple decisional building blocks by medical experts, often a team. \nIt is highly individualized. Every case is different. The medical \nhistory of patients varies tremendously. There are no absolutes. It is \nbased on medical knowledge and training on a wide array of choices.\n  Only the attending physicians in consultation with the woman, with \nall the facts of the medical case and the medical history assembled, \ncan make the decision. Physicians are bound by ethics, licensing, \npractice guidelines, and liability. Decisions are often team decisions, \nnot made by one isolated physician and always in consultation with the \npatient or family. We hire trained professionals because we want their \nexpertise.\n  In the words of the California Medical Association, ``We believe that \nthis bill would create an unwarranted intrusion into the physician-\npatient relationship by preventing physicians from providing necessary \nmedical care to their patients . . . political concerns and religious \nbeliefs should not be permitted to take precedence over the health and \nsafety of patients.'' The American Women's Medical Association wrote, \n``We do not believe that the federal government should dictate the \ndecisions of physicians . . .''\n  Let me make this clear: I oppose post-viability abortions. They are \nwrong, except to save the mother's life and health. Late-term abortions \nare rare and they should be rare. When the Senate considered this bill \nlast year, on May 14, 1997, I offered a substitute to the bill before \nus. My substitute had 3 provisions. it would have prohibited all \nabortion procedures after a fetus is viable, not prohibited abortions \nif in the medical judgment of the physician, an abortion is necessary \nto preserve the life of the woman or to avert serious adverse health \nconsequences to the woman, and imposed civil penalties. I continue to \nbelieve that my substitute would accomplish the goals of the bill \nbefore us while protecting women's health and constitutional rights.\n  Mr. President, these are tragic situations, situations that most of \nus could never imagine. We had couples come to us and tell us \nheartbreaking stories about babies they dearly wanted, but babies they \ncould not have because to go through labor and delivery the mother \nwould have died, been seriously injured or prevented from having future \npregnancies. These were people who explored every available option, who \nconsulted experts, to save the baby that they very much wanted. These \nare rare and difficult circumstances.\n  The Federal Government has no place interfering, making this tragic \nsituation any more difficult or complicated for these families. This is \na vague, poorly constructed bill. It attempts to ban a medical \nprocedure without properly identifying that procedure in medical terms. \nIt is so vague that it could affect far more than the procedure it \nseeks to ban. It fails to protect women's health at a time when they \nface tragic complications in their pregnancies. I urge my colleagues to \nvote to sustain the President's veto.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senate again is considering the \nPartial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. This bill, which prohibits a procedure \nused to kill unborn children late in pregnancy in a particularly \ngruesome and painful manner, passed both the House and Senate before \nbeing vetoed by President Clinton on April 10, 1996. Last Congress, the \nHouse voted to override the President's veto by a vote of 285-137. \nUnfortunately, we failed in the Senate to override the Presidents' \nveto. The House voted again last year to prohibit partial-birth \nabortions by a veto proof margin of 295-136 and again the Senate passed \nthe legislation by a vote of 64-36. However, President Clinton vetoed \nthe ban for the second time. Today, the Senate again has the \nopportunity to over-ride the Presidents veto and put a stop to this \nhorrific procedure. I rise to state my strong support for this just and \nvery necessary legislation and hope that my Senate Colleagues will join \nwith the House members and override the Presidents' veto.\n  As I am sure all of my colleagues know by now, the procedure banned \nby this bill--the partial-birth abortion procedure--defies description. \nI am not going to go into the terrible details of this procedure, which \nis performed on a living child late in pregnancy.\n  Mr. Presdient, this is a truly shocking procedure. It is absolutely \nindefensible. In fact, Dr. Pamela Smith, an obstetrician at Mt. Sinai \nHospital in Chicago, and Director of Medical Education in the \nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology at that hospital, testified \nlast Congress before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the \nConstitution that even when describing the procedure to groups of pro-\nchoice physicians she found that ``many of them were horrified to learn \nthat such a procedure was even legal.'' [H. Rept. 104-267, p. 5]\n  As Dr. Smith further points out, ``partial birth abortion is a \nsurgical technique devised by abortionists in the unregulated abortion \nindustry to save them the trouble of `counting the body parts' that are \nproduced in dismemberment procedures.'' [Letter to U.S. Senators, 11/4/\n95] She says, in the same letter: ``Opponents [have] insinuated that \naborting a living human fetus is sometimes necessary to preserve the \nreproductive potential and/or life of the mother. Such an assertion is \ndeceptively and patently untrue.''\n  And what about the baby, is the baby exempt from the pain of this \nprocedure? No. As stated in a August 26, 1998, report in the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association: ``When infants of similar gestational \nages are delivered, pain management is an important part of the care \nrendered to them. However, with [this procedure] pain management is not \nprovided for the fetus, who is literally within inches of being \ndelivered. It is beyond ironic that the pain management practiced for \n[this procedure] on a human fetus would not meet the federal standards \nfor the humane care of animals used in medical research.''\n  In a July 9, 1995, letter to Congressman Tony Hall, a registered \nnurse who had observed as Dr. Haskell (who has performed over 1,000 \npartial-birth abortions) performed several partial-birth abortions \ndescribed one such procedure:\n\n       The baby's body was moving. His little fingers were \n     clasping together. He was kicking his feet. All the while his \n     little head was stuck inside. Dr. Haskell took a pair of \n     scissors and inserted them into the back of the\n\n[[Page S10561]]\n\n     baby's head. Then he opened the scissors up. Then he stuck \n     the high-powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the \n     baby's brains out.\n\n  President Clinton has claimed that for some women whose unborn babies \nare diagnosed with grave disorders, this procedure is the only way to \nprevent serious health damage. But according to the Physicians' Ad Hoc \nCoalition for Truth (PHACT), a coalition of about 500 medical \nspecialists including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, even in \ncases involving such severe fetal disorders, ``partial-birth abortion \nis never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or her future \nfertility.'' (See The Wall Street Journal, Thursday, September 19, \n1996, and PHACT press release dated May 7, 1997.)\n  Not only is this procedure not medically necessary, but it actually \nis medically dangerous to the health of the mother! According to a \nrecent article in American Medical News (March 3, 1997), Diana \nGrossheim, on her doctor's advice, opted for the partial-birth abortion \ntechnique to remove her 21 week old child who had died in utero. As a \nresult, she now has an incompetent cervix which endangered a subsequent \npregnancy and required bed rest from week 23 through the duration of \nher pregnancy.\n  Furthermore, according to Dr. Pamela Smith, ``there are absolutely no \nobstetrical situations encountered in this country which require a \npartially-delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health \nof the mother.'' For example, performing a Caesarean section could \nproduce a healthy mother and living child. (American Medical News, \nNovember 20, 1995)\n  Even Dr. Warren Hern, an abortionist who specializes in late-term \nabortions, says that even he would not perform a partial-birth abortion \nbecause it is unsafe for the mother. He notes that turning the fetus to \na breech position is ``potentially dangerous'' and that ``you have to \nbe concerned about causing amniotic fluid embolism or placental \nabruption if you do that.'' (American Medical News, November 20, 1995)\n  Dr. Martin Haskell, one of the major proponents and practitioners of \nthis technique, states that some 80 percent of these procedures which \nhe has performed were for ``purely elective'' reasons. [Interview with \nAMA's American Medical News, July 5, 1993] His late colleague and \nfellow proponent of the partial-birth method claimed in material \nsubmitted to the House subcommittee that ``non-elective'' reasons to \nperform the procedure include ``psychiatric indications,'' such as \ndepression and ``pediatric indications'' (i.e., the mother is young).\n  On January 12, 1997, the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists (ACOG) issued a policy statement regarding this procedure \nstating they ``could identify no circumstances under which this \nprocedure . . . would be the only option to save the life or preserve \nthe health of the woman.'' In July, 1997, the ACOG Executive Board \nsupplemented its policy on abortion toward stating, ``ACOG is opposed \nto abortion of the healthy fetus that has attained viability in a \nhealthy woman.''\n  The American Medical Association, on May 19, 1997 wrote to support \nH.R. 1122, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban. And, on May 26, 1997, AMA \nPresident Daniel H. Johnson. Jr. M.D., stated ``The partial delivery of \na living fetus for the purpose of killing it outside the womb is \nethically offensive to most Americans and physicians. Our panel could \nnot find any identified circumstances in which the procedure was the \nonly safe and effective abortion method.''\n  The stark fact is that unless this bill becomes law, more innocent \nunborn children will have their lives brutally ended by the inhumane \npartial-birth procedure. During last year's debate the New York Times \nquoted the pro-choice National Abortion Federation, as saying that only \nabout 450 partial-birth abortions are performed each year.\n  Well, everyone now knows that was a lie! In February this year, Ron \nFitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition for \nAbortion Providers, said he lied about the frequency and necessity of \npartial-birth procedures. He now admits that this procedure is \nperformed 3,000 to 5,000 times a year with the vast majority being \nperformed during the fifth and sixth months of pregnancy, on healthy \nbabies of healthy mothers. (New York Times, 2-26-97; March 3, 1997, \nAmerican Medical News.)\n  In addition, two lengthy investigative reports published last year in \nthe Washington Post and the Record of Hackensack, New Jersey, reporters \nfor both newspapers found that the procedure is far more common than \npro-abortion groups have claimed, and is typically performed for non-\nmedical reasons.\n  The Record found, for example, that a single abortion clinic in \nEnglewood, N.J., performs ``at least 1,500'' partial-birth abortions a \nyear--three times the number that the National Abortion Federation had \nclaimed occur annually in the entire country. Doctors at the Englewood \nclinic said that only a ``minuscule amount'' are for medical reasons. \nOne of the abortion doctors at that clinic told the Record, ``Most are \nMedicaid patients, black and white, and most are for elective, not \nmedical reasons: People who didn't realize, or didn't care, how far \nalong they were. Most are teenagers.''\n  It is unbelievable to me that this unspeakable abortion procedure \neven exists in this country, much less that we are having to take \nlegislative action to ban such a procedure. It is further unbelievable \nto me that anyone in good conscience can even defend the partial-birth \nabortion procedure. It is a fiction to believe that it is alright to \nend the life of a baby whose body, except the head, is fully delivered. \nIn order to engage in such a fiction, one has to take the position that \ncurling fingers and kicking legs have no life in them. Those who \nsubscribe to such a fiction, are at best, terribly misguided.\n  As Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated:\n\n       . . . in no way can I twist my mind to see that the late-\n     term abortion as described--you know, partial birth and then \n     destruction of the unborn child before the head is born--is a \n     medical necessity for the mother. It certainly can't be a \n     necessity for the baby. American Medical News, August 19, \n     1996.\n\n  Even a Chicago Tribune March 3, 1997 editorial stated:\n\n       The American people have learned enough about partial-birth \n     abortions to know that they should be stopped.\n\n  Twenty-eight states have approved a ban on partial birth abortions. \nNow it is time for the Senate to do the same. It is time to end this \ninjustice and the practice of this inhumane procedure. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in ending this atrocity.\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, this debate offers each Senator an \nopportunity to set forth, in a very real way, his or her vision for \nAmerica. from time to time, we are given a stage, a national audience, \nand a defining moment--a moment in which we must extol that which is \ngood and noble and just, and reject that which is not. I believe that \ntoday provides one such moment in this effort to override President \nClinton's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  I rise today in strong support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act \nof 1997. with this vote, the Senate will protect unborn children from \nthe barbaric procedure known as ``partial-birth abortion,'' or it will \nnot. The Senate will side with truth, or it will not.\n  The president has vetoed this bill on two occasions now, telling the \ncountry that partial-birth abortions are necessary in ``a small number \nof compelling cases,'' to protect the mother from ``serious injury to \nher health,'' and to avoid the mother's ``losing the ability to ever \nbear further children.''\n  Mr. President, that is not the truth. The evidence is quite to the \ncontrary. The procedure is not limited to a small number of cases, but \nrather is far more widespread, numbering in the thousands. As one \nnewspaper has explained, ``[i]nterviews with physicians who use the \nmethod reveal that in New Jersey alone, at least 1,500 partial-birth \nabortions are performed each year.''\n  The procedure is never necessary to protect the mother's health or \nfertility. The Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, which includes \nformer Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, has flatly rejected the \nPresident's assertion on this point:\n\n       Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, \n     partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to \n     protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the \n     opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and \n     immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and \n     fertility.\n\n\n[[Page S10562]]\n\n\n  The opponents of this legislation have gone to great lengths to hide \nthe truth from the American people. One has famously admitted to \ndeliberate falsehoods. Others have tried to obscure the facts by using \nmedical terms like ``intact dilation and evacuation'' or ``intrauterine \ncranial decompression.'' But, no matter what words the other side uses, \nnothing can change the fact that this procedure is a partial-birth \nabortion, it is heinous, and it is wrong.\n  I want to close my remarks this morning, Mr. President, by thanking \nsome very special people for their support on this critical issue. I \nwant to thank Margie Montgomery of Kentucky Right to Life. She has \nworked tirelessly and faithfully on behalf of unborn children. Her \nyears of service have been truly heroic.\n  I also want to thank the Respect Life Committee, and particularly Mel \nMeiners and Dan Bowling. To illustrate the broad support in my state \nfor ending this inhumane act, they have crafted an amazing Prayer \nChain, containing over 3,700 signatures from dedicated people who are \npraying that we will override President Clinton's veto. I would say, \nMr. President, that we could probably take their Prayer Chain and \nstretch it all the way around the Senate floor. We would then be \nenveloped by this symbol of commitment to protecting unborn children. \nThis Chain is a moving display of faith and commitment--I am very \ngrateful for having receive it.\n  Let me list a few of the Catholic churches who are responsible for \nthe Prayer Chain: Guardian Angels, Holy Family, Our Mother of sorrows, \nResurrection, St. Martin of Tours, and St. Stephen Martyr. The chain is \nalso a product of the efforts of the Little Sisters of the Poor Home \nfor the Elderly, Holy Angels Academy, and, as I've already mentioned, \nKentucky Right to Life. I also want the Record to reflect that I have \nreceived over 10,000 letters and cards from concerned Kentuckians \nurging us to end this barbaric practice.\n  I truly appreciate their support and hope that my colleagues will \njoin me in taking a stand for what is right and just. We must send a \nclear and principled message to the President and to the nation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we will vote once again on \nlegislation offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania to ban the \ndilation and extraction, or D, procedure used by doctors, H.R. 1122. \nI will be voting against this ban for the fourth time in as many years.\n  My reasons for opposing this legislation are well-known. First, I \nbelieve that this bill undermines the Supreme Court's decision in Roe \nv. Wade to leave these critical matters to the states. Those states who \nhave chosen not to pass legislation banning late-term procedures leave \nthe decision to the woman, her family and their doctor.\n  Second, I believe that a woman's right to control her own \nreproductive destiny is protected as part of the Constitutional right \nto privacy. The Supreme Court under Roe has decided that the decision \nof whether to undergo an abortion is a matter of individual conscience \nand should be made by a woman in thoughtful consultation with her \ndoctor.\n  Third, preventing doctors from using the D procedure only when it \nis necessary to save the life of the mother clearly goes against the \nSupreme Court's decision in Roe. Roe requires the states to safeguard \nthe life and health of the mother when they regulate late-term \nabortions. Because of the unconstitutionality of this legislation, I \nfeel I cannot support its passage.\n  Finally, I believe that women who choose to undergo a D procedure \ndo so for grave reasons and I trust that those states that have chosen \nto regulate late-term abortions do so in a manner that both protects \nthe mother and prevents unnecessary abortions. The Supreme Court has \nestablished a delicate legal framework in which to address late-term \nabortions and we should not shift the decision making to the federal \ngovernment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM, Mr. President, I believe I am the last speaker. I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent the time run \noff the opposition's side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I might \nuse 2 minutes from the opposition's side of this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, there are some of us who do not have the \neloquent speech of those who have spoken on this issue, but I think \nthat I have a pretty good advisor in this issue.\n  I am wondering if I am listening to the same America in which I grew \nup. In rural America, life was simple but life was precious. We were \nfortunate enough in our family to have a couple of outstanding young \nfolks blessed to our family, one of whom is now a medical doctor in \nfamily medicine.\n  A couple of years ago when this issue came up, she was the first one \nto call me, she being a new graduate of the University of Washington at \nthe Seattle medical school and now doing her residency in Tennessee. \nShe is blessed with a deeply faithful heart and motivated to doing the \ngood things for humanity, taking her oath that she took upon graduation \nfrom medical school very, very seriously. If you have not heard that \noath, maybe one should read it one time and see what the medical \ndoctors take upon themselves, those who really do dedicate themselves \nto humanity. She, plain and simply, told her father that there is no \nreason for this procedure at all, none.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Those of us who have been granted life and been able to \nwork in it and enjoy the full fruits of it sometimes lose sight of just \nexactly where we come from. So this is a matter of conscience, the deep \nAmerican conscience, especially when those who know and are motivated \nto do the right thing, those who work with it every day, tell us there \nis no reason for this procedure. I hope my colleagues will support the \noverride of the President's veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I ask how much time is left on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleagues very much.\n  I thought we had a good debate on this yesterday, and I think the \nissue is pretty clear. I say to my colleagues, there is no health \nexception in this bill at all, which not only makes it \nunconstitutional, but which puts women in harm's way. And the life \nexception in the bill is very narrowly drawn. It is not the usual Henry \nHyde language, the first version of his language or even the second. So \nit becomes very difficult for a physician to act to save the mother's \nlife.\n  If the President would have signed this bill, he would have been \nputting a woman's health and her life at risk. So I think he did the \nright thing to listen to the 39,000 OB/GYNs whose job it is to bring \nbabies into the world. They oppose this bill very strongly. They call \nit, and I am quoting, ``dangerous.''\n  Proponents of this bill argue that it would prohibit a specific \nprocedure. Many of the women who have had this procedure have been here \nthese last few days. They have been visiting us. They were looking in \nour eyes. They were telling us that they believe very strongly, and \ntheir families believe, that without this procedure they could have \ndied. They could have been made infertile. Those women look in our eyes \nand tell us how desperately they wanted their babies.\n  One of them I introduced on the floor in a photo calls herself a \nconservative\n\n[[Page S10563]]\n\nRepublican, an antichoice, pro-life individual. She wanted her baby \nmore than anything else and when tragedy struck, she had to have this \nprocedure. She went to several doctors to try to find a way out, to \nhave her baby. She had to have this procedure. She asks us, don't \noutlaw this without a health exception and a clear life exception.\n  So why would we turn our back to hurt women who want children? Why \nshould we presume to know more than 39,000 obstetricians and \ngynecologists who tell us not to tie their hands in the hospital room?\n  So I know this is a very difficult issue on both sides. I know there \nare strong emotions on both sides. But I think the important thing to \nremember is, if we sustain this President's veto, which I hope we will \ndo, there is not one woman in America who has to have any specific \nprocedure. It is a personal decision. It is a decision based on health. \nIf we go the route of those who are speaking to us today on the other \nside of the aisle, government would say to doctors, not only in this \ncircumstance, but if they had their way--they are very honest about it, \nand I respect them for it--no way would abortion be legal in this \ncountry. If they had their way, government would step in where religion \nshould be; government would step in where families should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself the remainder of the \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Let me respond directly to the Senator from California. \nLet me quote from the 39,000 OB/GYNs letter that was sent up here. It \nsays that the policy committee of this select panel--``could identify \nno circumstances under which this procedure would be the only option to \nsave the life or preserve the health of the mother.''\n  They went on to say that, ``However, it may [I underline may] be the \nbest or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save \nthe life or preserve the health of the mother.''\n  However, after more than a year, ACOG has given no specific example \nof any circumstance under which a partial-birth abortion would be the \nmost appropriate procedure in any circumstance. The silence from that \norganization is deafening. And the reason they cannot give a \ncircumstance is because there is no circumstance. There is no \ncircumstance where this is the best procedure. There is no circumstance \nwhere this is needed to be performed for the health of the mother.\n  This is the last, which I thought was the last, of a series of \nmisinformation that has been spewed out here on the Senate floor and \nacross the country on the issue of partial-birth abortion. I will \nchronologically go through the lies that have been told by all of the \nabortion rights organizations, to stop the passage of this bill.\n  The first lie, when Bob Smith and Charles Canady introduced the bill \nthey maintained in a letter, the National Abortion Federation did, that \nillustrations of this procedure are ``highly imaginative and \nartistically designed, but with little relationship to the truth or to \nmedicine.''\n  They denied it existed, denied it was ever done. What was the truth? \nThree years prior to this statement, Dr. Haskell, who performs this \nprocedure, appeared before the National Abortion Federation meeting and \ndescribed the procedure shown in the drawings that Bob Smith used here \non the floor of the Senate, and talked about partial-birth abortion to \nthis very group. Lie No. 1.\n  Lie No. 2, they said that this was a procedure where the fetus would \nfeel no pain because of the anesthesia. I will combine No. 2 and No. 3. \nLie No. 3, they went on to say the ``anesthesia ensures fetal death.''\n  Planned Parenthood, in a factsheet of October 1995 says, ``The fetus \ndies after overdose of anesthesia given to the mother intravenously.''\n  That is just absurd. Dr. Martin Haskell, again, who is one of the \ngreat users of this procedure, in the American Medical News:\n\n       Let's talk about whether or not the fetus is dead \n     beforehand. . . .\n       Dr. Haskell. No, it's not. It really is not.\n\n  In fact, a group of anesthesiologists came up to the Senate and \npleaded to testify to debunk this myth that somehow anesthesia kills, \nor somehow could anesthetize the baby in the womb, because women were \nrefusing to get anesthesia for fear that they would harm their baby.\n  Lie No. 4, this was a great one: Partial-birth abortion is ``rare.''\n  Testimony after testimony, a letter signed by the Guttmacher \nInstitute, Planned Parenthood, National Organization of Women, Zero \nPopulation Growth, Population Action, National Abortion Federation and \na myriad of organizations said there are fewer than 500 cases in \nAmerica. None of the reporters here or across America challenged them \non it, except one little reporter in Bergen County, New Jersey, who \ncalled an abortion clinic and they found out at that clinic 1,500 were \ndone, in that clinical alone. Another lie debunked.\n  Lie No. 5, another doozy of a lie. This lie said that partial-birth \nabortion is used only to save the woman's life or health or when the \nfetus is deformed.\n  Ron Fitzsimmons on ABC Nightline: ``The procedure was used only on \nwomen whose lives were in danger or whose fetuses were damaged.'' Ron \nFitzsimmons, fast forward, 2 years later, ``What the abortion rights \nsupporters failed to acknowledge is that the vast majority of these \nabortions are performed in the 20-plus week range on healthy fetuses \nand healthy mothers. The abortion rights folks know it, the anti-\nabortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everyone else.''\n  Another great lie but, by the way, that lie continues to be \nperpetrated here on the Senate floor, that this procedure is necessary \nfor the health of the mother.\n  Let's move on to the last great lie, No. 6, partial-birth abortion \nprotects the health of women. Let me tell you what the American Medical \nAssociation said when they endorsed this legislation. They say: ``Thank \nyou for the opportunity to work with you towards restricting a \nprocedure that we all agree is not good medicine.''\n  There is no reason--there is no reason, this goes on to say in \nanother publication, ``There is no health reason for this procedure. In \nfact, there is ample testimony to show that all of the health \nconsequences are more severe for this procedure than any other \nprocedure used.''\n  If you are really concerned about the health of the mother, then look \nat all of the information that has been put out there by a variety of \ndifferent organizations that says that this procedure is dangerous. It \nwould never be used to protect the life of the mother. It is a 3-day \nprocedure. If a mother presents herself in an emergency situation, you \ndon't wait 3 days to evacuate the uterus. You do the procedure \nimmediately. This is not.\n  Just think, common sense, we are delivering a baby. It is almost \nborn. It is this far away from being born. Why is it healthier for the \nmother to insert a pair of scissors into the baby's skull, fracturing \nand shattering that skull inside the mother, causing potential harm to \nthat mother by doing so? It is a blind procedure. Why don't you just \nlet the baby live? The baby is almost outside the mother. Let the baby \nlive. There can be no rationale, can be no rationale for destroying \nthis little baby by executing this little baby at that point in time, \nwhen it is almost born.\n  Let me show you a couple of pictures, because the Senator from \nCalifornia has shown many pictures here on the floor of the Senate of \nwomen who have had partial-birth abortions as the reason this procedure \nneeds to be kept legal. Let me show you the picture of a young man who \nis here in Washington today, Tony Melendez, who is a Thalidomide baby. \nPeople like Tony Melendez, came here to the House and the Senate to \ntestify. It was said we need to keep partial-birth abortion legal \nbecause of people like Tony Melendez, who don't have arms or don't have \nlegs or may be blind, those people should be aborted--those people who \nare not worthy to live. That is why we need to keep this, because of \nthose poor deformed babies.\n\n  Yes, Tony Melendez was disabled in the sense that he had no arms, but \nTony Melendez has been an inspiration to millions across the world in \nhis ability to sing and play the guitar, yes, with his feet, as he did \nfor us this morning downstairs in the Capitol.\n  The Senator from California will have women standing out there in the\n\n[[Page S10564]]\n\nhall. Tony will also be there as a stark reminder that this bill is \naimed at people like him, people who just are not perfect enough for us \nto deserve to be born.\n  I find it absolutely incredible that last year when we debated this \nbill, right before this bill came up, we had a vote on the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. Passionate people on the other side of \nthe aisle, whom I respect greatly for their defense of the disabled, \ngot up and talked about how it was so important to give these people \nmeaningful lives. They gave impassioned speeches, and yet, in the very \nnext vote, they said that while they want to give them the right to \neducation, they don't want to give them the right to live in the first \nplace.\n  The Bible says, ``A house divided against itself cannot stand.'' You \ncannot in any way conceivably fit in that you are willing to fight for \nthe disabled, but only after they survive birth; you won't fight for \nthem--in fact, you point the finger at them and say that those, in \nparticular, should not be born.\n  The Democratic Party, over the last 100 years, has had a wonderful, \nwonderful reputation for fighting for those who are the least among us, \nfor civil rights, for rights for women, rights for minorities, rights \nfor the disabled. They have continued to try to open the American \nfamily, and I salute them for that. But they do a great disservice to \nthat legacy when they turn their backs on people like Tony Melendez and \nDonna Joy Watts.\n  One of the cases that is cited often by the President is cases of \nchildren with hydrocephaly. Donna Joy Watts had hydrocephaly with no \nchance to live. Her mother had to go to three hospitals just to get \nDonna Joy delivered. They wouldn't deliver her. They would abort her, \neveryone would abort her, but they wouldn't deliver her. And Donna Joy \nis here today at 6 years of age. She just earned her white belt in \nkarate.\n  Mr. President, I have been asked many times what pulled me to the \nSenate floor to debate this issue, because I had never spoken a word in \nthe House or Senate about the issue of abortion, and I have given a lot \nof answers as to why I joined Bob Smith in this fight.\n  I finally realized after the birth of my son and the death of my son, \nGabriel; it finally came to me what pulled me to the Senate floor. What \npulled me here was something that my son revealed to me in his short \nlife--that we draw lines that don't exist in our society with respect \nto life. He revealed to me, in the love that I had for him, that what \npulled me to the Senate floor was the love that I have for little \nchildren like Donna Joy and Tony and so many others.\n  I ask my colleagues today if they will open their hearts and love \nthem, too.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk to \nthe substitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provision of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on the committee amendment to S. 1645, the Child \nCustody Protection Act:\n  Trent Lott, Orrin G. Hatch, Spencer Abraham, Charles Grassley, Slade \nGorton, Judd Gregg, Wayne Allard, Pat Roberts, Bob Smith, Paul \nCoverdell, Craig Thomas, James Jeffords, Jeff Sessions, Rick Santorum, \nMitch McConnell, and Chuck Hagel.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote occur at 4:30 p.m. on Tuesday, September 22, and that the \nmandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just so Members will know, there is a \ncloture motion that has just been filed. We should note for the record \nthat we have been working in good faith with the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee and the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nAbraham, on reaching agreement on a unanimous consent agreement. We \nstarted working on this agreement immediately after the majority \ninvoked cloture to proceed to the bill. And in showing our good faith, \neverybody on this side of the aisle voted for that, to proceed to the \nbill. In fact, as I recall, the vote was unanimous in this Chamber.\n  S. 1645 is a bill that provokes strong feelings on both sides. A \nnumber of Members have expressed interest in offering amendments to \nthis bill. In fact, on Tuesday, I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, we \nsent the Republican side a fairly limited list of amendments that \nDemocrats plan to offer to the bill. Some of these amendments, such as \nthose of the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nwere debated in committee with careful thought and consideration, I \nthought, on both sides of the aisle.\n  In fact, I told Senator Abraham later that I believed we had a very \ngood debate on this bill in committee, and, as the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan knows, I did my best to move the bill along \nthrough committee.\n  We have not heard back from the Republican side about where we stand \non the UC with the amendment list we proposed. We are waiting to hear \nback. I think if we work on this we will be able to reach some \nagreement and proceed on this measure with full and fair debate on the \namendments that Members want to offer.\n  I whole-heartedly support the goal of fostering closer familial \nrelationships and the notion of encouraging parental involvement in a \nchild's decision whether to have an abortion. I believe, however, that \nStates should continue to maintain their historically dominant role in \ndeveloping and implementing policies that affect family matters, such \nas marriage, divorce, child custody and policies on parental \ninvolvement in minors' abortion decisions. That is the nature of our \nfederal system, in which the States may, within the common bounds of \nour Constitution, resolve issues consistent with the particular mores \nor practices of the individual State.\n  In my view, this bill significantly undermines important federalism \nprinciples that we have respected--at least since the Civil War. In \naddition, while I know as a parent that most parents hope their \nchildren would turn to them in times of crisis, no law will make that \nhappen. No law will force a young pregnant woman to talk to her parents \nwhen she is too frightened or too embarrassed to do so. Instead, of \nencouraging a young woman to involve her parents in a decision to have \nan abortion, this bill will drive young women away from their families \nand greatly increase the dangers they face from an unwanted pregnancy. \nFor these reasons, I oppose this bill.\n  Proponents contend that the bill's ``simple purpose'' is to provide \nassistance to States that have elected to adopt parental consent \nrequirements. Yet, the bill would not give federal enforcement \n``assistance'' to all forms of parental consent or notification laws \nadopted in 40 states. Under the definition in the bill, only the most \nrestrictive State parental consent or notification laws would get such \nassistance. The bill carefully restricts the parental involvement laws \nthat would enjoy the new federal ``assistance'' offered by the bill to \nthose that require the consent of or notification to only parents or \nguardians of a pregnant minor. States that have adopted a law that \nallows for the involvement of any other family member, such as a \ngrandparent, aunt or adult sibling, in the decision of a minor to \nobtain an abortion would not be covered and not entitled to any Federal \n``assistance.''\n  Only 20 States have adopted parental consent or notification laws \nthat are currently enforced and meet the bill's definition of a ``law \nrequiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision.'' Thus, \nthe majority of the States either have opted for no such law or are \nenforcing a law that allows for the involvement of adults other than a \nparent or guardian in the minor's abortion decision.\n  Proponents are just plain wrong when they argue that this bill ``does \nnot supersede, override, or in any way alter existing State laws \nregarding minors' abortions.'' On the contrary, the direct consequence \nof this bill would be to federalize the reach of parental involvement \nlaws in place in the minority of States in ways that override policies \nin place in the majority of the States in this country.\n  The fact that the bill establishes no new parental consent or \nnotification requirements is a mere fig leaf which cannot hide its \nanti-federalism effect. The bill would use federal agency resources to \nenforce the minority--20--States' parental involvement laws wherever \nminors from those States travel and in connection with actions taken in \nother States. Furthermore, it would create a federal crime as a \nmechanism for such federal intervention.\n  This is an extraordinary step to extend one State's parental consent \nlaws against its residents wherever they may travel throughout the \nNation. The twenty State parental involvement statutes ``assisted'' by \nS. 1645 were not drafted with this extraterritorial application in \nmind. These statutes do not say that the parental involvement \nprovisions hinge on residency but provide restrictions on abortions to \nbe performed on minors within the State where the law applies. \nNevertheless, even if these States have not contemplated and neither \nneed nor want Federal intervention to enforce their parental \ninvolvement laws, this bill would federalize the reach of these laws \nwherever the pregnant minors of those States travel within the country.\n  This is not even how these State parental consent laws were drafted: \nThey do not say that they do not hinge on residency. They do not say \nthat they apply to the residents of the State no matter where those \nresidents may travel. These State laws were drafted to apply only to \nconduct occurring within the State's borders and to provide \nrestrictions on abortions to be performed on minors within the State.\n  Ironically, even if a State does not enforce its own parental \ninvolvement law, due to a court injunction or determination of a State \nAttorney General, this bill may still make it a federal crime to help a \nminor cross State lines for an abortion without complying with that \nunenforced or unenforceable State law. Despite the sponsors' intention \nthat S. 1645 not apply in those circumstances, the language of the bill \nis simply not clear on that issue.\n\n\n                         S. 1645 and Dred Scott\n\n  I can think of only one other instance in which the federal \ngovernment applied its resources to enforce one State's policy, absent \na State judgment or charge, against the residents of that State even \nwhen the resident found refuge in another State: fugitive slave laws \nbefore the Civil War. While none of us--and certainly not the sponsors \nof this legislation--would ever condone slavery. I know they would join \nwith me and the other opponents of this legislation in condemning that \nheinous part of our country's history. Yet, unfortunately, that is the \nonly legislative\n\n[[Page S10566]]\n\nprecedent we have for a bill that would use federal law to enforce a \nparticular State's laws against its citizens wherever those citizens \nmay travel.\n  Thankfully, the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution outlawed \nslavery and repealed article IV, section 2, paragraph 3 of the \nConstitution, which authorized return of runaway slaves to their \nowners. That authority, and congressional implementing laws [The \nFugitive Slave Act of 1793], enabled slave owners to reclaim slaves who \nmanaged to escape to ``free States or territories.\n  In fact, the notorious Dred Scott decision relied on this since-\nrepealed constitutional provision to decide that slaves were not \ncitizens of the United States entitled to the privileges and immunities \ngranted to the white citizens of each State. This is why Dred Scott, \nborn a slave, was deemed by the Supreme Court to continue to be a \nslave, even when he traveled to a ``free'' territory that prohibited \nslavery.\n  In 1858, Abraham Lincoln, who was at the time running for the U.S. \nSenate, criticized the Dred Scott decision, ``because it tends to \nnationalize slavery.'' Indeed, the dissenting opinion in Dred Scott, \nmade plain that ``the principle laid down [in the opinion] will enable \nthe people of a slave state to introduce slavery into a free State * * \n*; and by returning the slave to the State whence he was brought, by \nforce or otherwise, the status of slavery attaches, and protects the \nrights of the master, and defies the sovereignty of the free State.''\n  So, too, with S. 1645. It tends to nationalize parental consent laws, \neven in those States that have declined to adopt that policy. Fugitive \nslave laws are no model to emulate with respect to our daughters and \ngranddaughters.\n  Make no mistake, despite the sponsors' contention that this bill does \nnot ``attempt to regulate any purely intrastate activities related to \nthe procurement of abortion services,'' the effect of this bill would \nbe to impose the parental consent policies in the minority of States on \nthe residents of the majority of States. For example, Vermont has no \nparental consent or notification law, though a neighboring State--\nMassachusetts--does. In the early 1980's, press reports indicated that \na two percent increase in abortions in Vermont were attributable to \nminors from Massachusetts coming across the border to avoid telling \ntheir parents under that State's parental consent law.\n  If this bill becomes law, Vermont health care providers could be put \nin the position of enforcing Massachusetts' parental involvement laws \nbefore any abortion procedures are performed on minors from \nMassachusetts; otherwise these health care providers run the risk of \ncriminal or civil liability. In other words, when confronted with a \nnonresident pregnant minor, who may be from Massachusetts, a Vermont \nhealth care provider would not be able to perform procedures that are \nlegal in Vermont and protected by the United States Constitution. \nInstead, that Vermont health care provider would be forced to import \nand enforce another State's law.\n  Since it is not always easy to tell where a minor's ``home'' State \nis, health care providers would end up bearing the burden, in terms of \ntime, cost and resources, of checking on the residency of every minor \nwho comes to them for abortion services. This may be the only way to \nensure that there are no nonresident minors among them who have not \ncomplied with their ``home state'' parental involvement laws. This is \nnot the policy that the majority of States have chosen for the minors \nwithin their borders, yet the bill would force the laws and policies of \nthe minority of States on them.\n  Health care professionals share this concern. Dr. Renee Jenkins, \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee about the effect of this bill \non clinics, doctors and other health care providers. She told us:\n\n       I am concerned about the effect on and responsibilities to \n     the health care providers involved: the doctor's \n     responsibility when providing abortion services to women \n     of any age from out-of-state. . . . I am very concerned \n     that Congress may put health care providers in the \n     position where they must violate their state's \n     confidentiality statutes in order to meet the obligations \n     of a neighboring state.\n\n  Moreover, the Federal Government would be in the unfortunate position \nof prosecuting people differently, depending on the State in which that \nperson has established residence. This disparate treatment would result \nfrom the non-uniformity of State parental involvement laws. State \nstatutes on parental involvement in a minor's abortion decision vary \nwidely and, as noted, a number of States have no such requirement at \nall. Thus, under the bill, whether a person is subject to Federal \nprosecution would depend upon the vagaries of State law.\n  Just because some in Congress may prefer the policies of some States \nover those in the majority of the States does not mean we should give \nthose policies federal enforcement authority across the nation. Doing \nso sets a dangerous precedent.\n  We should think about how this policy might impact additional \nsettings. For example, some states, such as Vermont, allow the carrying \nof concealed weapons without a permit, while other States bar that \npractice. Should Congress authorize federal intervention that would \nallow residents of States, like Vermont, to enjoy the privilege of \ncarrying their concealed weapons into States, like Massachusetts, with \nmore restrictive concealed weapons laws?\n  Or what about State laws governing the sale of fireworks? Vermont \nbars the sale of all kinds of consumer fireworks, including roman \ncandles and sky rockets. These fireworks are perfectly legal in other \nStates, including New Hampshire. What would we think about making it a \nfederal crime for a Vermonter to go to New Hampshire to buy consumer \nfireworks because they are illegal in Vermont? I believe we would view \nsuch a law--even if it were constitutional and even if it would promote \nthe ``safer'' State fireworks law--as overreaching in the exercise of \nour federal power.\n  It is the nature of our Federal system that when residents of a State \ntravel to neighboring States or across the Nation, they must conform \ntheir behavior to the laws of the States they visit. When residents of \neach State are forced to carry with then only the laws of their own \nState, they may be advantaged or disadvantaged but one thing is clear: \nWe will have turned our federal system on its ear.\n  Significantly, the Department of Justice, in a July 8 letter to me, \nhas described the myriad of practical enforcement problems with this \nbill. According to the Department, this bill would be ``notably \ndifficult to investigate and prosecute, and would involve significant, \nand largely unnecessary, outlays of federal resources.''\n  For example, the Department points out that since this bill is \npredicated on conduct that may be perfectly lawful under the law of the \nState where the conduct occurred, local law enforcement may be unable \nto assist. This will leave the detection and investigation of \nviolations of S.1645 entirely to the FBI and ``place a great burden on \nthe FBI.''\n  Practically speaking, if this bill becomes law, FBI agents may have \nto serve as ``State Border Patrols'' to ensure that pregnant minors \ncrossing State lines with another person is not doing so to have an \nabortion without complying with her home State's parental consent law.\n  Just last week, we held a hearing on counter-terrorism policies and \nheard from the FBI Director about the challenges the Bureau is already \nfacing both here and abroad to protect the safety of Americans. They \nare currently investigating the deaths of 19 U.S. servicemen in Khoban \nTowers bombing in Saudi Arabia, and the deaths of over 250 people, \nincluding 12 Americans, caused by the recent bombings in Kenya and \nTanzania. If this bill becomes law, how much of the FBI's attention \nwill be diverted to help enforce the parental consent laws of 20 \nStates? I think the FBI already has a full plate of duties that should \nnot be diverted by this new federal enforcement authority called for in \nthis bill.\n  In addition, the bill would sweep into its criminal and civil \nliability reach family members, including grandparents or aunts and \nuncles, who respond to a cry for help from a young relative by helping \nher travel across State lines to get an abortion, without telling her \nparents as required by the laws of her home State. Even the sponsors of \nthis bill acknowledged the over-broad reach of the criminal liability \nprovision in the original bill and took steps, with a substitute \namendment\n\n[[Page S10567]]\n\nadopted during the Committee's consideration of the bill, to exclude \nparents, but only parents, from the threat of criminal prosecution and \ncivil suit.\n  The purported goal of this bill, to foster closer familial \nrelationships, will not be served by threatening to throw into jail any \ngrandmother or aunt or sibling who helps a young relative travel out-\nof-State to obtain an abortion without telling her parents, as required \nby her home State law. The real result of this bill will be to \ndiscourage young women from turning to a trusted adult for advice and \nassistance. Instead, these young women may be forced then into the \nhands of strangers or into isolation. In fact, a 1996 report by the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, cites surveys showing that pregnant \nminors who do not involve a parent in their decision to have an \nabortion, often involve other responsible adults, including other \nrelatives.\n  Keep in mind what this bill does not do: it does not prohibit \npregnant minors from traveling across State lines to have an abortion, \neven if their purpose is to avoid telling their parents as required by \ntheir home State law. Thus, this bill would merely lead to more young \nwomen traveling alone to obtain abortions or seeking illegal ``back \nalley'' abortions locally, hardly a desirable policy result. Young \npregnant women who seek the counsel and involvement of close family \nmembers when they cannot confide in their parents--for example where a \nparent has committed incest or there is a history of child abuse--would \nsubject those same close relatives to the risk of criminal prosecution \nand civil suit, if the young woman subsequently travels across State \nlines for an abortion.\n  Threatening an FBI investigation and a criminal prosecution of any \nloving family member who helps a young pregnant relative in distress to \ngo out of state to obtain an abortion, would be a short-sighted and \ndrastic mistake.\n  In addition to close family members, any other person to whom a young \npregnant woman may turn for help, including her minor friends, health \ncare providers, and counselors, could be dragged into court on criminal \ncharges or in a civil suit. The criminal law's broad definitions of \nconspiracy, aiding and abetting, and accomplice liability, in \nconjunction with the bill's strict liability, could have the result of \nindiscriminately sweeping within the bill's criminal prohibition a \nnumber of unsuspecting persons having only peripheral involvement in a \nminor's abortion--even if they were unaware of the fact that a minor \nwas crossing state lines to seek an abortion without complying with her \nhome State's parental involvement law. As a result, the law could apply \nto clinic employees, bus drivers, and emergency medical personnel.\n  I also fear that the bill may have the unintended consequence of \nencouraging young women in trouble to abandon their family, friends and \nhomes. If they are willing to travel across State lines to obtain an \nabortion, will this bill effectively force them to move their domicile \nacross State lines to avoid engendering criminal and civil liability? \nIf becoming a resident of another State will eviscerate the hold of a \nhome State's restrictive parental consent law, moving, or running away \nfrom home may be the only choice that passage of this bill may leave to \nthem if a young woman is determined not to tell her parents. And, what \nof those young woman who intend to move or those who tell others that \nthey intend to move, does that defeat the claims the bill is intended \nto create to deter abortions?\n  No law--and certainly not this bill--will force a young pregnant \nwoman to involve her parents in her abortion decision if she is \ndetermined to keep that fact secret from her parents. Indeed, according \nto the American Academy of Pediatrics, the percentages of minors who \ninform parents about their intent to have abortions are essentially the \nsame in States with and without notification laws. Yet, while doing \nnothing to achieve the goal of protecting parental rights to be \ninvolved in the actions of their minor children, S. 1645 would isolate \nyoung pregnant women forcing them to run away from home or drive them \ninto the hands of strangers at a time of crisis, and do damage to \nimportant federalism and constitutional principles.\n  Finally, because the bill imposes significant new burdens on a \nwoman's right to choose and impinges on the right to travel and the \nprivileges and immunities due under the Constitution to every citizen, \nconstitutional scholars who have examined the proposal have concluded \nthat it is unconstitutional.\n  I am particularly struck by Harvard University Law School Professor \nLaurence Tribe's statement that that ``the Constitution protects the \nright of each citizen of the United States to travel freely from state \nto state for the very purpose of taking advantage of the laws in those \nstates that he or she prefers.'' He concluded.\n  A vote against this bill is a vote for preserving a young woman's \nability to turn to a close relative or friend, in what may be the \ntoughest decision she has ever faced, without fear that her trusted \ngrandmother, stepparent, or best friend would be fined or jailed. A \nvote against this bill is a vote for preserving the important \nfederalism principles.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I want to acknowledge that the Senator from Vermont and \nothers on the Judiciary Committee, who are on the minority side, have \nworked with us. I think we did have, as the Presiding Officer knows, a \nvery fair and I think thoughtful debate about the Child Custody \nProtection Act in committee. Let me just make a couple of points as to \nwhere, it seems to me, the situation currently stands.\n  First of all, we have had a list of potential amendments submitted. \nWe have not seen language for any of those that are new. Some were in \nfact offered in committee. But the new ones we have not seen, and it \nwould be very helpful, from the standpoint of moving the process \nforward, if we could get a better sense of what those are and how many, \ntherefore, might be acceptable.\n  Second, I point out to all Members that amendments that were offered \nin committee, a number of which constitute the list we have seen, would \nremain relevant amendments postcloture on the bill because in fact they \nwould stay in play. So even if cloture were invoked on the bill, it \nwould not preclude those amendments from being considered and voted on \nhere.\n  The fundamental problem is the Presiding Officer and, frankly, all \nMembers are aware that what we confront now is a time problem. And if \nwe can come up with an agreed upon list of amendments with reasonable \ntime limits, I think we can move forward on this bill in the same \nproductive way here in the full Senate that we did in the committee. \nBut I think to get there we really require a couple of things. One is a \nlittle more information about some of the amendments that have been \noffered, particularly those that do not appear to be relevant \namendments, and then some cooperation with respect to reaching an \nagreement on time limits for the amendments.\n  I do not think this is a situation that has to go to a cloture vote \nif we can resolve some of this. I again urge my colleagues to note, to \nthe extent of the amendments that have been proposed, at least the ones \nwe do know about because of they having been offered in committee, they \nwill remain relevant amendments postcloture.\n  I think the majority leader and the full Senate understand the \nlimited time we have. We cannot have this legislation on the floor for \ntoo long a period of time given all the other important pieces of \nlegislation that demand our attention. But if we can limit the time and \nmove to the amendments, I think it is possible to move forward. But \neven if we were to invoke cloture, it would not preclude many of these \namendments. It would presumably eliminate some that truly are not \nrelevant to the bill. And this is, I think, where we find ourselves.\n  So our staff, certainly on the majority side, is anxious to continue \nworking with the ranking member and his staff to see if we can come to \nsome agreement, hopefully, by the end of the day on Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10564-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10567-S10573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

That vote will occur at 2:20 p.m. The vote at 2:20 on \nTuesday will be the first vote of the week in observance of the Jewish \nholiday, Rosh Hashanah, which occurs on Monday. It is my hope that \nother amendments will be stacked in sequence to occur after the 2:20 \np.m. vote. I appreciate all of my colleagues' consideration.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3602 to Amendment No. 3559\n\n(Purpose: To ensure payment of trustees' costs under chapter 7 of title \n    11, United States Code, of abusive motions, without encouraging \n          conflicts of interest between attorneys and clients)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment for \nmyself and Senator Specter, and I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] for himself, and \n     Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 3602 to amendment \n     no. 3559.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, strike Section 102(3)(A) on lines 18 through 25.\n       On page 5 on line 17 after ``bad faith,'' insert:\n       ``(3)(A) If a panel trustee appointed under section \n     586(a)(1) of title 28 brings:\n       (i) a motion for dismissal under this subsection and the \n     court grants that motion and finds that the action of the \n     debtor in filing under this chapter was not substantially \n     justified, the court shall order the debtor to reimburse the \n     trustee for all reasonable costs in prosecuting the motion, \n     including reasonable attorneys' fees; or\n       (ii) a motion for conversion under this subjection and the \n     court grants that motion the court shall award reasonable \n     costs in prosecuting the motion, including reasonable \n     attorneys' fee, which shall be treated as an administrative \n     expense under Section 503(b) in a case under this title that \n     is converted to a case under another chapter of this title.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, section 102(A)(3) of S. 1301, the \nsection of the bill that would make a debtor's attorney responsible for \nthe costs and the fees of the trustee if the attorney loses a 707(b) \nmotion and the chapter 7 filing if it is found not to be \n``substantially justified'' is a very troubling provision.\n  As we know, a 707(b) motion does allow the court to dismiss or \nconvert a bankruptcy petition. This is an important safeguard that \nprotects the bankruptcy system from having abusive chapter 7 filings. \nThere certainly is some abuse by some debtors' attorneys. However, this \nprovision does not punish the attorneys. It actually punishes their \nclients.\n  This provision, Mr. President, in effect, will deny debtors their \nright to be represented by counsel. What it will do is deny debtors any \nmeaningful access to chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. Therefore, \nultimately, this provision will have the effect of denying debtors \nequal access to justice.\n  This bill makes the debtor's attorney responsible for the costs and \nfees of the trustee--not if the bankruptcy filing was brought in bad \nfaith, not if the bankruptcy was frivolous, but only if the motion was \n``not substantially justified.''\n  I believe this is unprecedented in American law. Parties--not their \nlawyers--are sometimes assessed fees under fee shifting statutes that \nare designed to level the playing field or encourage certain types of \nsuits. However, unlike section 102(A)(3), every other provision in \nwhich lawyers are assessed fees requires affirmative wrongdoing by the \nlawyer. In every other case the lawyer has to be found to, in effect, \nhave been guilty of affirmative wrongdoing.\n  As we all know, the standard of ``not substantially justified'' is a \nsignificantly lesser standard than a ``frivolous'' standard. Indeed, \nthe Supreme Court held in Pierce v. Underwood that ``not substantially \njustified'' is a standard ``greater than general reasonableness,'' but \na standard which ``falls short of that necessary to issue sanctions for \nfrivolousness.''\n  Given the vaguely defined contours of this standard, it is likely \nthat cases would be dismissed in which there was a good-faith argument \nthat the chapter 7 filing was proper. Indeed, in other contexts, courts \nhave interpreted that the ``not substantially justified'' standard is \nwidely varying.\n  The impact in this provision will be, in effect, to eliminate the \nfiling of chapter 7 cases by debtors' attorneys except in the most \nclear-cut cases, regardless of whether a chapter 7 filing would \nactually be in the best interest of the client. Obviously, very few, if \nany, debtors' attorneys are likely to put their own finances and \nwelfare on the line for such a filing. Or if a few debtors' attorneys \ndo continue to handle such cases, they will likely raise their fees to \naccount for this tremendous risk, thereby pricing themselves out of the \nmarket except for the most wealthy of debtors. It is an oxymoron to \ntalk about the wealthiest of debtors.\n  In the end, the result of this attorney's fees provision is that many \ndebtors will be denied the benefit of counsel if they wish to file for \nchapter 7. In other words, many chapter 7 debtors will be forced to \nproceed pro se. As we have recently seen in the well-publicized abuses \nby Sears and others, many pro se debtors, due to their lack of \nknowledge about the system, suffer abuse under existing bankruptcy law.\n  The bill, as a whole, supplies potentially unprincipled creditors \nwith many new tools to take advantage of pro se debtors. The bill would \nallow an unscrupulous creditor to make threats of 707(b) motions, \nthreats of discharge ability complaints, and threats of repossessing \nhousehold goods, which may ultimately result in debtors signing ill-\nadvised reaffirmation agreements.\n  In addition, the attorney's fees provision, because it will compel \nmany debtors now to file pro se, will likely result in a number of \ndebtors having their petitions dismissed for even trivial or procedural \nmistakes.\n  As you know, pro se cases are frequently dismissed because debtors \nfile papers incorrectly and cannot correct them quickly enough. And, of \ncourse, this bill, by forcing more and more debtors to go with pro se \nrepresentation, simply exacerbates this problem.\n  Mr. President, Section 303 of the bill creates a presumption of bad \nfaith when a case is dismissed for failure to file the required papers \nin the proper form. This provision, coupled with the fact that \nsignificantly more debtors will be forced to file pro se, will mean \nthat many people who filed in good faith will have their petitions \ndismissed and, thus, will never receive their rightful bankruptcy \nrelief.\n  Moreover, in this the bill's current attorney's fees provision is \nmaintained; it will have the perverse effect of increasing abuses in \nthis area. As previously noted, this provision will cause attorney fees \nto increase; therefore, more people will be unable to pay attorneys. In \naddition to catalyzing the pro se problems that I have already \ndiscussed, the provision will also cause nonattorney petition preparers \nto proliferate and they--much more so than debtors' attorneys--have, \nunfortunately, historically been the No. 1 source of the abusive \nbankruptcy filings, which this entire bill is so focused upon.\n  Indeed the nonattorney petition preparers have always been most \nprevalent where bankruptcy attorney's fees are the highest, notably in \nsouthern California and, to a lesser extent, in cities like New York. \nVery few pro se debtors actually prepare their own papers. Most have to \nseek help from these petition preparers who sometimes do a terrible job \nfor them, give faulty legal advice, and file cases that often prejudice \nthe debtor as well as landlords, mortgage companies, and other \ncreditors.\n\n[[Page S10569]]\n\n  Mr. President, in the end, on an issue like this, we have to be \nhonest with ourselves. These attorney fees provisions are designed to \nintimidate lawyers into counseling against a chapter 7, plain and \nsimple; that is the goal. This is inherently troubling, but such a \nprovision, Mr. President, creates a blatant conflict of interest \nbetween the debtor's attorney and his or her client. What if the client \nhas a valid chapter 7 case and would be better served by a chapter 7? \nUnder this new rule, if we don't change it with this amendment, the \nattorney will have the perverse incentive to counsel his or her client \nto enter into chapter 13 in order to protect the attorney's financial \ninterests.\n  This issue was actually raised at one of the hearings called by the \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Grassley. A powerful and troubling example \nwas offered to illustrate the dilemmas that bankruptcy lawyers will \npotentially face under this bill.\n  The scenario presented was that of a client who supports an elderly \nrelative. Since a lawyer could not be sure if supporting an elderly \nrelative would be considered a ``reasonable living expense,'' the \nlawyer would be taking a risk, a personal risk, by filing for chapter 7 \nand zealously arguing--as the attorney is required to do--her or his \nclient's case. Indeed, rule 1.7(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct \nspecifically prohibit a lawyer from handling a case ``if representation \nof that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's * * * own \ninterests.'' Mr. President, this bill would institute a scenario in \nwhich a debtor's attorney would arguably violate this rule whenever \nchapter 7 is at issue.\n  The amendment I am offering aims to prevent the inevitable conflicts \nof interest, perverse incentives, and harm to vulnerable good-faith \ndebtors that this provision would create. My amendment would simply \nmake all reasonable costs of prosecuting a 707(b) motion incurred by a \ntrustee an administrative expense. Characterization of trustees' fees \nas an administrative expense would then ensure that the trustee receive \nreimbursement if the debtor's case is dismissed or converted; but what \nit would do, also, is prevent the conflict of interest specifically \nprohibited by the Rules of Professional Conduct that I just mentioned.\n  Senator Specter and I offered in committee an amendment that would \nhave amended the bill to provide that the debtor's attorney would only \nbe liable if his or her chapter 7 filing was frivolous. This amendment \nwould have simply placed debtors' attorneys in the same position as all \nother attorneys. That is, they would only be held personally liable if \nthey engaged in some kind of affirmative wrongdoing.\n  This proposed amendment was, however, defeated in committee, but it \nwas defeated by a 9-9 vote. Those Senators who voted no on our \namendment claimed they were doing so because they wanted to maintain \nthe financial incentive for panel trustees to challenge allegedly \nabusive chapter 7 filings. We have carefully, and in response to that, \nrecrafted our amendment to retain this financial incentive. Under this \namendment, the panel trustee who successfully challenges a chapter 7 \nfiling will be rewarded for their efforts.\n  In addition, if the debtor's attorney does file a frivolous chapter \n7, that attorney will be punished. Just as every other attorney can be \nsanctioned for frivolous filings, the bankruptcy code already provides \nfor sanctions to be assessed against an attorney who has actually acted \nin bad faith.\n  So, Mr. President, in sum, my amendment seeks to equitably reimburse \nthe panel trustee if he or she is forced to prosecute a party who \ninappropriately filed for chapter 7; but it also tries to strike the \nright balance by striving to protect a debtor's right to counsel. \nNothing is more fundamental to our legal system than the right of every \nAmerican to be represented by a qualified and zealous attorney. We \nshould not risk compromising this right, particularly for vulnerable \nparties who often seek protection under the bankruptcy system.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to make this change, which I think \nwould be in the spirit of improving this piece of legislation that both \nthe Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Illinois have worked so \ndiligently on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for \nbringing this issue up. It is one that had a close vote in the \ncommittee. I presume it has a legitimate place in discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate because of the very close vote. However, I opposed \nit in committee, and I intend to oppose it here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I would say that in this area, Senator Durbin and I have tried to \nrespond to some of the concerns that Senator Feingold has had. We did \ninclude in our legislation, as a result of his proposals in committee, \nthat when a lawyer was substantially justified in feeling that this \nperson should be placed in chapter 7, the penalties that we have in the \nbill otherwise applicable to lawyers who would put people in 7 that \nshould be in 13, would not be applicable if the judge found so.\n  But this amendment--and I apologize to the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin--just goes too far. I think we need to look at some of the \nbasic reasons why we have legislation. Not everybody would agree with \nmy long list of reasons that we ought to have legislation; but, \nobviously, I have talked about the lack of personal responsibility.\n  Second, we have had Congress for 30 years setting a bad example for \nthe individuals of America because we have had 30 years of deficit \nspending. What sort of a signal does that send to the people of this \ncountry? If the government can do it, surely they can do it. Hopefully, \nwe will get over that hurdle this year. For the first time in 30 years, \nwe will have a balanced budget. Hopefully, I think we are going to pay \ndown something like $63 billion on the national debt, and hopefully \neven more than that.\n  We also have the credit card industry that we have talked about here \nin the last several days on this bill. Maybe they are not careful \nenough about who they encourage to use credit cards and go into debt \nwith the credit card purchase of goods and services. But we have a very \naggressive bar. That is my feeling--that the bankruptcy bar is not \ncounseling their clients like they used to of whether or not they could \ngo into bankruptcy. We even hear that it isn't the lawyer that can get \npeople into bankruptcy, it is a legal aid, a legal assistant, who can, \nthrough the forms that are made and the electronic filing of collecting \na fee, very quickly get people into chapter 7. We are trying to deal \nwith the behavior of the bankruptcy bar in the sense that we want them \nto get to the point where they are counseling people. Should they be in \nbankruptcy at all? And, second, should they be in chapter 7, or chapter \n13?\n  So, obviously, if we feel that there has been some abuse of the \npresent practices of the bar, we want to make sure that we have \ndisincentives for people to go into 7, if they go into 13. And we have \nused disincentive penalties against the legal profession, if they \nshould have been in 13 against the lawyers, I should say, who advise.\n  We have responded to some of those concerns that Senator Feingold has \nalready raised. But we can't respond to all of them.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment, because one of the key features of \nour bill is that it holds debtor lawyers accountable for their actions. \nWe do this by imposing fines when they steer clients into chapter 7 who \notherwise can repay their debts.\n  We all have heard stories about the bankruptcy mills which recklessly \nsend people into bankruptcy and process people in bankruptcy like \nsometimes we process cattle. Any meaningful reform must address the \nissue. The Grassley-Durbin bill does that--S. 1301, the bill before us.\n  This amendment by Senator Feingold, in my estimation, would \neffectively nullify the new financial incentives for debtor lawyers to \nact responsibly. This amendment completely takes away the fines that \nbankruptcy lawyers must pay when they recklessly steer people to have \nthe ability to repay their debts into chapter 7 and away from chapter \n13. These fines will be an effective and meaningful way to ensure that \nlawyers advise clients responsibly.\n  If adopted, this amendment will allow bankruptcy mills to continue\n\n[[Page S10570]]\n\nturning out knew bankruptcy cases. Under this amendment, a debtor's \nlawyer who is deliberately ignorant of a debtor's ability to repay his \ndebt gets off scot-free. Perhaps we should call this amendment the \n``Bankruptcy Mills Protection Act.''\n  I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do so.\n  The amendment will not provide true financial incentives for chapter \n7 trustees to go over all of the filings that are in chapter 7 and find \nout which ones can be removed to chapter 13, because this work of the \npublic trustees--chapter 7 trustees--is one of the two major tools that \nwe have to make sure that people who have the ability to repay debt do \nit rather than getting off scot-free, as most often happens in chapter \n7.\n  The Feingold amendment won't provide a penny when a 707(b) motion is \nacceptable and the case is then dismissed. In that case, there won't be \na chapter 13 case to allow trustees to collect expenses.\n  I ask my friends to help us keep this bill tightly written so that \nthere is, in fact, a change of behavior among bankruptcy lawyers to \nadvise clients to be responsible for debt--to maybe not go into \nbankruptcy at all, or if bankruptcy would be charted to chapter 13 as \nopposed to chapter 7.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I enjoy and appreciate working with the \nSenator from Iowa on many issues, and I have enjoyed all of his remarks \nexcept for the suggestion that somehow this is going to be a bad-faith \nattempt to try to improve the bill, or somehow attempt to benefit \nattorneys.\n  I feel like I identified some very specific arguments that are real \nand that are important to the legal system; and, that, although I share \nthe concerns of the Senator about the general system, in fact I think \nthere are abuses in chapter 7. There is no question about that. But \nwhat I tried to do is craft an amendment that creates a fair balance. I \nam not trying to prevent punishment of an attorney who does something \nwrong.\n  But let me just quickly review the arguments about why this is a \nreasonable amendment and I don't think was responded to.\n  First of all, I heard nothing about my argument that this creates a \nconflict of interest. A lawyer has a responsibility under the rules of \nprofessional conduct to zealously advocate on behalf of their client. \nTherefore, it is very rare that our legal system would function well \nand that attorneys would zealously advocate for their clients if they \nare afraid that their family and their house could possibly be taken \naway because they might be assessed with the entire cost of litigation. \nThat is the conflict of interest that this creates.\n  The Senator suggested in an attempt to suggest that we are going to \nleave no opportunity to punish a wrongdoing lawyer that there is \nnothing left. That isn't true. Under the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure and under the Bankruptcy Code there are rules about filing \nfrivolous claims. In fact, I remember when I was a young attorney. The \nfirst thing I learned when I came into the office as a young associate \nwas you had better not file a pleading that is frivolous or you might \nbe personally assessed for having done so. That is applicable to these \nsituations and would be effective.\n  There is no truth to the suggestion by the Senator from Iowa that the \nattorney can go off scot-free, if he brings up a ridiculous claim.\n  Furthermore, in fairness to the Senator from Iowa, he did make a \npoint about whether a trustee would be protected in getting his fees in \na situation where the case is dismissed. We sent a modified version of \nthis to the desk which addresses that issue. We understood the point of \nthe Senator from Iowa. We listened to him and modified our amendment \nfrom committee, because it was pointed out in that there was a \nconversion from a chapter 7 to a chapter 13; that in that case the \ntrustee would be protected, but not if the chapter proceeding was \nactually dismissed. That is a fair point. We changed it. It applies to \nboth the dismissal as well as the conversion.\n  I hope it is clear from the Record that the Senator's comments about \nthat provision relates to the amendment we originally proposed, but not \nthe amendment that was sent to the desk.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let's talk for just one second about the real \neffect of this.\n  The provisions that are in the bill relate only to ``counsel''--an \nattorney, a licensed attorney. If this goes through and attorneys feel \na fear of being assessed these fees in a case where they can't bring a \ncase that they know is airtight, and they don't represent the client, \nwho do they go to? They go to these petition preparers. These petition \npreparers are the very people who are most likely to do a sloppy job \nand not care if they bring a frivolous proceeding.\n  But guess what, Mr. President? The petition preparer isn't \nresponsible. The petition preparer would not be under this standard. So \nwhat you are doing is pushing these debtors from legitimately licensed \nattorneys, who know what they are doing, hopefully, to people who are \nbasically in many cases scamming people, and they would have no \nresponsibility at all. That is bad for the debtor. It is bad for the \ncreditor. That is bad for the legal system. That is bad for the \ncongestion in the courts as a result of the bankruptcy system. For all \nof these reasons, we have a frivolous standard.\n  We make sure that the trustee is protected, whether it is a \ndismissal, or a conversion. And we try to address the inherent conflict \nof interest that exists when an attorney has to wonder if their own \npersonal finances are going to be affected because they think they have \naddressed the best interests in arguments on behalf of a client but \nthey are not certain. This goes too far, and I really hope in good \nfaith that the Senator takes a look at these arguments and the \nmodifications we have made, and considers that this really is a \nreasonable balance in the context of the larger bill.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank Senator Grassley and Senator Durbin for the great work they \nhave done in building bipartisan support for this bankruptcy bill. I \nthink this is a historic step forward in bringing integrity and \nfairness and efficiency to the bankruptcy system. It came out of the \ncommittee with a 16-to-2 positive vote, and I think that reflects the \nstrong bipartisan support this bill has.\n  With regard to Senator Feingold's concerns about this provision, it \nis not for punishment of a lawyer who files these bankruptcy petitions. \nIt simply defines the standard of care they ought to adhere to. We are \nalways having the plaintiff lawyers tell us that they cannot do \nanything to reduce the standard of care on the part of private \nbusinesses. For example, they argue that we must not lower the standard \nof care for doctors because it might result in a patient or user of \ntheir product being injured or somehow being harmed. Nothing can reduce \nthat, but yet at the same time the bar will take as much protection as \nthey can get for anything they do in their professional capacity for \nwhich they were hired.\n  Bankruptcy lawyers are not mere clerks, although the truth is, for \nthose of us who know what is going on, most of the bankruptcy filings \nin America are done by lawyers who run bankruptcy mills, who advertise \nin phone books and newspapers and on television and radio, which just a \nfew years ago lawyers could not do. In fact, there is some indication \nthat the dramatic rise in bankruptcy is derived more from attorney \nadvertising and the encouraging of people to file bankruptcy than any \nother factor. Particularly this appears to be true in light of the fact \nwe have more bankruptcies in a time of strong economic growth and \nprosperity in this country.\n  So I say to you, these lawyers have to comfort to some standard of \ncare.\n  What does Senator Grassley's bill say? It says they ought to be \nsubstantially justified in filing their bankruptcy under chapter 7. \nThat is all. What is bad about that kind of standard? And if they are \nnot substantially justified, what happens?\n  Take for example, a person with a $100,000 income, and let's assume \nsomeone sues that person for an automobile accident and wins a $25,000 \njudgment\n\n[[Page S10571]]\n\nagainst them. Although the judgment need not be that high, it could be \nany amount that the person does not want to pay. So they go to their \nlawyer and ask him how they can get out of paying it, and he says \n``file bankruptcy.'' This will wipe out the debt, although he could \nhave paid it on the income level he has.\n  When the case comes to the bankruptcy court, they file under chapter \n7, which would eliminate all debts. The chapter 7 trustee objects, and \nthey hold a hearing. They present evidence, and they say: ``No, you \nshould go into chapter 13 because you do not qualify for chapter 7.'' \nAnd then the judge must go further. Under the Grassley version, the \njudge must find not that the lawyer made a mistake but he was not \nsubstantially justified in filing the petition under chapter 7. Then he \ncan assess the attorney the cost of that hearing--not huge amounts of \nattorney's fees, just the cost of the hearing that had to be held on \nthe complaint of the chapter 7 trustee.\n  Let me ask you--it comes down to this--who pays? Who pays for the \nexpense of having to challenge this chapter 7 petition which was not \nsubstantially justified? Under Senator Feingold's proposal, it would be \nan administrative expense. That sounds OK, but we know in this country \nthat there ``ain't no free lunches.'' You have heard that saying. \nSomebody always pays. Who pays, in this case, the administrative \nexpense? The people who pay will be the ones who are owed money, the \ncreditors, the ones who have not and probably will not be paid all they \nare owed, and it comes out of the money that goes to them. They pay for \nthe lawyer filing a petition that is substantially unjustified.\n  When we come down to the choice of who ought to pay, I say the lawyer \nought to pay. He ought to be sure of what he is doing when he files the \npetition. He should know where it ought to be filed. I do not think \nthat presents a conflict of interest. I understand that you could \nconjure that up as some theoretical possibility, but the truth is, \nunder ethical rules of practice today, a lawyer cannot file a complaint \nhe does not believe to be justified. He is required to do some \npreliminary work before he files it.\n  So I do not believe that this would be contrary to the standards that \nare required currently of lawyers in what they do. And, again, it \nrequires the action of a judge. And a bankruptcy judge knows these \nlawyers. There is usually a small group of lawyers that file the \noverwhelming number of bankruptcy cases in their courts, and many are \nnot going to be unfairly abusing these lawyers. However, when a judge \nsees one who is consistently filing chapter 7 petitions that ought to \nhave been filed in chapter 13, and his trustee has to have hearings and \nchallenge it, and there are not sufficient facts to justify it, then he \nis going to have the opportunity under this bill to assess some costs \nagainst that attorney.\n  This is not going to bankrupt the attorney. I know of attorneys in \nAlabama who are running advertisements, who are making $1,000 per \nbankruptcy case and filing 1,000 cases a year. They are making big \nbucks off this system. Maybe they are justified in doing that, but they \nought to on occasion, when they make the point to go to great expense \nto hold a hearing, have the trustee challenge what they have done, and \nthen find out they are not substantially justified--they ought to pay.\n  I hope we will keep the Grassley amendment. The other alternative is \nto keep the present standard of assessing costs against an attorney, \nand that is the standard of frivolousness. That is a very high \nstandard, and the net effect of the frivolousness standard is that \nnobody will ever recover, because it is just very, very difficult to \nmeet that standard.\n  The bankruptcy judges are not going to abuse these attorneys. It will \ngive the bankruptcy judges a little leverage, a little power to say to \nthese attorneys who are filing cases recklessly without enough thought, \ncausing the creditors to lose money and otherwise abuse the system, \nthat they can bring a little integrity to and have some watchfulness \nover the system and maintain discipline on the lawyers who practice \nthere.\n  I understand the Senator's concern about it, but I do not see this as \nan extreme position at all. I think it is quite consistent with the \nbankruptcy court. I believe it will help, as Senator Grassley said, \nmake sure people file their petition right the first time. If it is \nchapter 13, they ought to file in chapter 13, not in chapter 7 on a \ntheory that, well, we will just have a hearing and maybe we will win or \nmaybe they won't object. We need it filed right the first time so we \nwill have fewer proceedings to transfer the action. That is the purpose \nbehind this and I think the Feingold amendment would undermine that \npurpose.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is fairly easy to try to make the \nwords ``not substantially justified'' sound like a reasonable standard. \nBut what really is going on here is an intrusion into the attorney-\nclient relationship that is very dangerous.\n  I practiced law for several years before running for the Wisconsin \nState Senate, and I remember always when looking at a client's \nargument--first of all, I obviously didn't think I could file any \nargument that was frivolous. That was prohibited both under the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure and under the Wisconsin Rules of Civil \nProcedure. But there would be a number of occasions where we would have \ntwo or three possible arguments to make. One we might think was our \nstrongest argument, and then another might be our sort of middle \nargument, and then there might be a third legal argument where it was a \nlong shot but we thought the facts were strong. Any good lawyer would \nbring all three of those arguments, in most cases, because if a judge \nfound any one of the three to be persuasive, that could be the basis.\n  I like to think I would have had the courage as a young attorney to \ngo forward with that third argument, even with this provision. But I \ndidn't have any money, and if I thought that bringing that third \nargument could cause me to be assessed with attorney's fees that would \nmake it impossible for me to pay my mortgage--I am human. I wonder if I \nwould have done what is right, which is to counsel that client: This \none is about a 25-percent possibility, but under the right facts, and I \nthink you might have the right facts here, sir, you ought to bring it.\n  Lawyers should not be put in a position where they believe, except \nfor cases where there is a frivolous claim, that bringing an argument \nwill cause them to have personal harm come to them. That destroys the \nwhole notion of zealous advocacy. This is a serious problem for the \nrelationship between attorney and client, and I really do think to \nsuggest that the ``not substantially justified'' standard is simply a \nreasonable restraint does not show an understanding of what really goes \non in a situation where a lawyer and client sit down and try to come up \nwith the best argument possible. So I reject that suggestion and again \nurge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire of the proponent of the \namendment, and the floor manager on the Democratic side, how much more \ntime will be consumed on the bankruptcy matter this morning? I have a \nspeech which I should have gotten up and offered 15 or 20 minutes ago, \nbefore we started this.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am merely responding to arguments made \nin response to my arguments. When that ceases, I will cease. I was \nasked to come down here and offer two amendments this morning. This is \nthe first. If it is in the interests of the Senate that I defer the \nsecond to next week, I will be happy to do that, as long as I am \nassured my opportunity to present it at that time.\n  I have nothing further to say on this amendment, unless somebody \nwants to debate it further.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no desire to prolong the amendments. I will come \nwhen you are all finished. I will be here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \namendments are complete I be granted 15 minutes for a floor speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S10572]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer another amendment for \nmyself and Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the first amendment offered \nby the Senator will be set aside.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3565 to Amendment No. 3559\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a waiver of filing fees in certain bankruptcy \n                     cases, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself and \n     Mr. Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 3565 to amendment \n     No. 3559.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title IV, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 4____. BANKRUPTCY FEES.\n\n       Section 1930 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``Notwithstanding \n     section 1915 of this title, the parties'' and inserting \n     ``Subject to subsection (f), the parties''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(f)(1) The Judicial Conference of the United States shall \n     prescribe procedures for waiving fees under this subsection.\n       ``(2) Under the procedures described in paragraph (1), the \n     district court or the bankruptcy court may waive a filing fee \n     described in paragraph (3) for a case commenced under chapter \n     7 of title 11 if the court determines that an individual \n     debtor is unable to pay that fee in installments.\n       ``(3) A filing fee referred to in paragraph (2) is--\n       ``(A) a filing fee under subsection (a)(1); or\n       ``(B) any other fee prescribed by the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States under subsection (b) that is payable to \n     the clerk of the district court or the clerk of the \n     bankruptcy court upon the commencement of a case under \n     chapter 7 of title 11.\n       ``(4) In addition to waiving a fee described in paragraph \n     (3) under paragraph (2), the district court or the bankruptcy \n     court may waive any other fee prescribed under subsection (b) \n     or (c) if the court determines that the individual is unable \n     to pay that fee in installments.''.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when I heard that bankruptcy was the \nonly Federal Court proceeding in which a poor person is not entitled to \nfile an in forma pauperis petition, I thought there must be some \nmistake. I found it somewhat surprising, counterintuitive, that \nbankruptcy, which by definition deals with people who are broke or have \nvery limited funds, does not provide even the poorest of debtors a \nwaiver of the filing fee.\n  The filing fee for consumer bankruptcy is $175. Mr. President, $175 \nis more than the take home pay of an employee working 40 hours a week \nat the minimum wage. Tell me, how are the indigent--those who \ndesperately need bankruptcy protection--going to afford $175 simply to \nfile for such protection?\n  Congress acknowledged that the bankruptcy system may need an in forma \npauperis proceeding when it directed the Judicial Conference to \nimplement a pilot program in six judicial districts around the nation. \nThis pilot program operated from October 1, 1994, through September 30, \n1997, in the following six districts: the Southern District of \nIllinois, the District of Montana, the Eastern District of New York, \nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Western District of \nTennessee, and the District of Utah. The pilot program was clearly a \nsuccess. Many of the judges who administered the program, and who were \ninitially skeptical, now support it. In particular the pilot program \nrevealed the following information:\n\n       An application for waiver of the filing fee was filed in \n     only 3.4% of all Chapter 7 cases, and the large majority of \n     those waivers were granted. Indeed, the U.S. Trustees Office \n     filed objections to less than 1% of the applications. In \n     other words, only those very few individuals who really \n     needed the fee-waiver applied for it.\n       The fee-waiver program enhanced access to the bankruptcy \n     system for indigent single women more than any other group. \n     We have heard a great deal about how this bill, S. 1301, will \n     hurt women and children. We cannot strike another blow \n     against single mothers and their children by denying them \n     access to the bankruptcy system because they cannot even \n     afford the filing fee.\n       The nature of the debt for those who filed for the fee-\n     waiver differed from that of other debtors in that their \n     debts more often related to basic subsistence--education, \n     health, utility services and housing. Moreover, 63 percent of \n     the housing-related debts of those who filed for the fee-\n     waiver owed their debts to public housing authorities. Only \n     one of the debtors who owed a debt to a housing authority did \n     not file for a fee waiver. These findings show that indigent \n     debtors were not filing bankruptcy to escape paying for their \n     boats or their fancy entertainment systems. They were filing \n     bankruptcy merely to subsist. Oftentimes these people use the \n     bankruptcy system simply to prevent homelessness.\n       There was only a minimal increase in the number of filings, \n     and there was no indication that debtors filed for Chapter 7 \n     rather than Chapter 13 just to obtain the benefit of the fee-\n     waiver program. Simply stated, the debtors typically did not \n     abuse the system.\n       A nation-wide program would cost between $4 and $5 million \n     in lost filing fees. Projections state that there will be 1.5 \n     million Chapter 7 filings next year. We can, therefore, off-\n     set the cost of a nation-wide program by merely raising the \n     price of Chapter 7 filings by between $2.70 and $3.40. If we \n     increase filing fees for all bankruptcy filings we can reduce \n     that cost to about $2 per filing fee--a negligible amount.\n       In short, the pilot program was a resounding success.\n\n  I offered this amendment in committee, where it was defeated by a 9-9 \nvote, with all the Democrats supporting it. One concern articulated by \nSenators who voted against the amendment in committee involved the \npossibility that, if we implement a fee waiver program, unscrupulous \nlawyers would advertise ``free filings'' and make a profit. However, \nunder the program, debtors cannot obtain fee waivers if they can pay \ntheir lawyers; therefore, private lawyers would have no incentive to \nencourage in forma pauperis cases.\n  Let me repeat that point: debtors who can pay their lawyers cannot \nobtain fee waivers. Only truly indigent people, those who need \nbankruptcy protection the most, can have their fees waived.\n  The Specter-Feingold amendment would build upon the strong foundation \nestablished in the pilot program, and direct the Judicial Conference to \nestablish a nation-wide in forma pauperis program for the bankruptcy \ncourt system. If we examine the findings of the pilot program we find \nthat: (1) only those who really needed the assistance of the program \nused it; (2) that there was little to no abuse of the fee-waiver \nprogram; and (3) that the program in large measure helped those who \nneeded it to subsist and, in many cases, avoid homelessness.\n  Given these findings, how can we choose not to implement a nation-\nwide program? Why did we direct the Judicial Conference to conduct a \npilot program if we were not going to use the results to shape public \npolicy? How, in good faith, can we deny bankruptcy relief to those who \ntruly need it--those who cannot even afford the filing fee? I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to restore some fairness in the \nbankruptcy filing process for the most financially strapped filers. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this amendment \nby the Senator from Wisconsin. He is correct. We tried this across the \nUnited States in, I think, six different jurisdictions, to see what \nwould happen. What is at issue here is a person is about to file for \nbankruptcy and is so penniless that they cannot even afford the filing \nfee of $175, then in these six different court jurisdictions we waived \nit. That is what this is all about. We found as a result of that \nexperience they didn't open the floodgates to people coming in filing \nfor bankruptcy. In fact, just the opposite was true. A lot of very \nserious cases, and those called out for justice, were served by this \nprogram.\n  One of the judges in my home State of Illinois, the southern \ndistrict, who tried this, Judge Meyers, has written a letter to me and \nsaid it was quite a success and he encouraged it be done on a national \nbasis.\n  If there is anything that distinguishes American jurisprudence from \nsome other countries, it is the fact that we have basically said the \ncourt system is open to the rich and poor alike. It is an oddity in our \nlaw that we don't allow those who are truly poor to have a waiver of \nthe filing fee so that they can come into bankruptcy court.\n\n[[Page S10573]]\n\n  Senator Feingold has a good amendment. I was happy to support it in \ncommittee. I hope now, because of the evidence of its success across \nthe country that has been shared on both sides of the aisle, it \nultimately will be adopted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, I note for my colleagues that the \nchairman of the Democratic Senatorial Committee and the chairman of the \nRepublican Senatorial Committee are on the floor at this moment, and we \nhave a message for candidates in both our parties and for the American \npeople.\n  Having served as chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee during the \nPackwood investigation, and having offered the first resolution of \nexpulsion in the history of the Senate in a case involving sexual \nmisconduct, I am well aware of the bright line that exists between \nprivate failings and public wrongs. And, of course, that line is \nblurred, as it was in that case, and is again in the allegations made \nagainst President Clinton when one's public office is used to pursue \nprivate misconduct and shield it from legal inquiry.\n  But if we start turning every instance of past personal misconduct \ninto cannon fodder for our political campaigns, we risk turning our \ndemocracy into a nuclear waste dump of slander, gossip, innuendo, and \ncheap moralizing about other people's problems.\n  Even without this threat, the multifaceted scandal that currently \nengulfs the White House represents a crisis of national and \nconstitutional proportions. Our only hope of guiding this country \nthrough the next several months without a major catastrophe in our \nGovernment, or in our financial markets, or in the world, absolutely \ndepends on our ability to resist the subtly escalating arms race of \ndirt digging, garbage searching, mudslinging, and poison leaking that \nis currently swirling around the Nation's Capital.\n  Where that awful trend must be resisted first is in our political \ncampaigns. For better or for worse, campaigns are the most direct \nexpression of our Government that people see.\n  This election, let's make it for the better, not for the worse. \nEveryone in this body certainly knows that I believe in robust, \npointed, hard-hitting campaigns. And I believe those kinds of campaigns \nare good for our democracy and good for the voters, but only when \npolitical campaigns are focused on issues and not on purely private \nbehavior.\n  So to set the standard, I want to make it clear that the national \nRepublican Senatorial Committee will not fund--will not fund--any \ncandidate who engages in personal attacks on the private problems and \npast failings of his or her opponent. Digging through their record is \none thing, digging through their garbage is quite another. Criticizing \nsomeone for their vote on the marriage tax is fair game. Attacking \nsomeone for a failed marriage certainly is not.\n  Let us prove over the next 6 weeks at least that this Congress is \ncapable of fairly and responsibly executing the solemn constitutional \nduty that may await us in the months ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I note the presence of my friend \nand colleague from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as the distinguished \nSenator from Kentucky said--as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee--to make the same commitment that the Senator from \nKentucky just made, that our committee will not fund any candidate who \nuses the personal problems or past failures of their opponent to win \ntheir election.\n  The objective in a campaign is not just to win an office. And we all \nknow in campaigns that there is a temptation to justify every means by \nthe end that is in sight. As the Senator from Kentucky described \nhimself, I describe myself the same way. I am not reluctant or shy to \nhave full contact sport when it comes to campaigns, but I do believe \nthat the ultimate objective of the candidate needs to be to not just \nacquire the office, but also to serve the larger good of preserving our \nDemocratic institutions, in this case the U.S. Congress.\n  I have been asked many times, and suspect the Senator from Kentucky \nhas as well, Is this going to have a negative impact on your chances in \nthe fall? He has probably been asked more times, Is this going to have \na positive impact on your chances in the fall?\n  But my answer has always been that my chief concern is that there are \ngood men and women in America today who have thought about running for \noffice--it may be the Senate or a local school board--and they have \nsaid, ``Gosh, I don't want to go through what I see Henry Hyde going \nthrough. And if I run for office, that is exactly what is going to \nhappen to me. I don't want everything that I have done since I was an \ninfant to be drug out and paraded before the people of my district or \nthe people of my city or the people of my State.''\n  Far be it from me to say that any vote or statement or belief I have \nshould be withheld. They should not be withheld and should be subject \nto the review and debate and discussion of the people. But my concern \nand why it is important that my colleague from Kentucky, whose \nsuggestion this was, and I do this in this campaign is that if we do \nnot exercise restraint and show American citizens that we will not fund \ncandidates who use personal problems or past failures to win their \noffice, the institutions of democracy will suffer.\n  Forget the impact upon political parties. Neither party is going to \ndo very well if citizens increasingly turn off and withdraw and say \nthat ``I may do many things for my country, but one of them will not be \nto be a candidate for any office'' because of the fear that they have \nthat something that happened 30 years ago or 40 years ago or 20 years \nago--that is irrelevant to the campaign itself and that they have dealt \nwith their family and their friends and their God, in whatever way that \nthey felt was necessary--now becomes drug out into the open.\n  So I join enthusiastically in making the commitment that we will not \nfund any candidates who do that. I appreciate that very much because \nwhat the Senator from Kentucky suggested serves the interests of \ndemocracy, and I am willing, as well, on the part of the DSCC to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I commend my friend from Nebraska for his statement. \nWe see this matter precisely the same. As for my side of the aisle, I \nintend to convey this statement to our candidates, both incumbents and \nchallengers, this afternoon with the message that I mean every single \nword of this statement.\n  I thank my friend from Nebraska.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10573-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10573-S10574]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3565\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, with regard to the Feingold amendment \nthat deals with the waiver of filing fees for those who file \nbankruptcy, I think we need to be very cautious about that amendment. \nIt has very serious implications. It has been considered by this Senate \nnumerous times and rejected.\n  It has been the argument that this is somehow unfair and denies \naccess to\n\n[[Page S10574]]\n\nthe court system. Courts themselves have denied this argument \nrepeatedly. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has rejected this \nposition. Fees run from around $110 to $160. By that time, the filer \nwould have already hired a lawyer, probably for much more than that.\n  I have here an ad of a lawyer in Texas who says: ``Bankruptcy can be \na smart financial move.'' He does not say that bankruptcy is a way to \ntake care of unacceptable debts that you have no chance of paying. This \nis the what we used to think bankruptcy was for: to help those who, \nthrough various circumstances, have found themselves hopelessly in \ndebt. This man says: ``Bankruptcy can be a smart financial move.''\n  It can be a smart financial move. You can legally--under the current \nlaw--defeat legitimate debts. You can just walk away from them, as this \nman says ``For $350 total.'' And the truth is, that is why we have \nincreased filings of these kinds of advertisements in phone books, in \nnewspapers, in magazines, in the yard sale publications that are passed \nout free in this country.\n  These people go to their lawyers and they quit paying all their \ndebts, and they then file for bankruptcy. Virtually every court filing \nin America requires a fee. And this is a reasonable fee. This fee has \nso been upheld by the courts. Somebody will pay for the cost of these \nfilings, if it is not going to be those who use this system, then the \ntaxpayers will pay for it. We are talking about a large amount of money \nand a drain on the system. Also, it would create a large number of \ncourt hearings, adding to an already crowded docket.\n  I am a critic of our court systems on occasion, but I must say that \nthe bankruptcy courts have, done an outstanding job, Mr. President, in \nhandling an ever-increasing caseload. The caseload has doubled. We have \nnot had a doubling of the judges, but they have used computers, they \nhave used staff people, they have used sophisticated measurement \ntechniques, and they have been able to keep up with their caseloads \nwithout a massive expansion of the number of bankruptcy judges. If \nbankruptcy courts are going to have a hearing on everybody that comes \nbefore them to determine whether or not there is any way they can pay \ntheir filing fee, then we are going to have to add severe costs to the \nsystem and more overloading. Judges, along with lawyers and clerks \nrepresenting people on both sides will run up expenses that could, in \nfact, exceed the real cost of the filing fee in this matter.\n\n  I understand the sentiments behind this amendment. It is something \nthat has been considered for years, rejected consistently, and upheld \nby the courts. It is a road we should not go down.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was pleased to read an article in the \nSeptember 15 edition of the Washington Times, titled, ``Classics Back \nin Fashion at Some Schools.''\n  Speaking precisely to the point that I have made countless times \nduring my years in the Senate, this article reiterates the need to get \nback to the basics in education. I would like to get back to the little \ntwo-room schoolhouse in which I started along about 1923. I laud those \nschools that have taken this valuable step back and are getting back to \nthe basics in order to reintroduce classical education into their \nclassrooms.\n  Who better to teach our students today than the true historians, the \npoets, and the playwrights of yesteryear. I long for the old McGuffey \nreaders--I still have a set of those old McGuffey readers in my \npersonal library--where the students read poems and wholesome stories \nthat taught them good morals, how to act, how to grow up and be good \ncitizens. The old McGuffey readers. The historians, the poets, and the \nplaywrights of yesteryear, such as Euripides, Aeschylus, Shakespeare, \nand Sophocles, who were the four great master poets of tragedy \nthroughout the years and were outstanding as writers of tragic plays, \ntheir works were among the classics that have built history, influenced \nthe framers of our Constitution, and can serve to enhance our ability \nto better understand the present and to set goals for the future.\n  Today, our students are caught up in the MTV generation--some of \nthem--watching mind-polluting television sitcoms, listening to shock \nradio, and repeating the degrading language that they acquire by \ndigesting this steady diet of unhealthy perversity.\n  Sadly, many modern classrooms often offer nothing to counteract this \nflood of popular junk and ignorance, which are smothering our country's \nstudents. The classics have been ignored in recent years and replaced \nby psuedoliterature filled with profanity and violence, and textbooks \nwhich do a better job of teaching I don't know what than basic algebra. \nIt alarms me to think that students cannot even begin to identify the \ngreat heroes of our past or the authors of the Federalist Papers.\n  If our Nation hopes to produce better students, students who can \nmatch or outperform the competition in international exams, we must \nreturn to the basics, return to the great books and history, such as \n``Plutarch's Lives,'' Milton's ``Paradise Lost,'' Milton's ``Paradise \nRegained,'' Daniel Defoe's ``Robinson Crusoe,'' Emerson's essays, \nCarlyle's ``History of the French Revolution,'' the Bible, the \n``Iliad'' and the ``Odyssey.'' Alexander the Great kept a copy of The \nIliad under his pillow.\n  It was called the ``casket copy''. He submitted Homer's ``Iliad'' to \nAristotle, and asked Aristotle to critique it. Then Alexander the Great \nprized it above all other literature.\n  Shakespeare's 37 plays: I quoted extracts from Shakespeare's 37 plays \none year in the Senate.\n  These are all replete with the history and philosophy that are \nintegral elements in a well-rounded, uplifting education.\n  When I talk about an education, I mean one that goes through one's \nlifetime. It doesn't stop with graduating from high school or from \ncollege or from getting a Ph.D. in physics, as two of my grandsons have \ndone. It means continuing to educate one's self throughout one's life.\n  Solon, one of the seven wise men of Greece, said, ``I grow old in the \npursuit of learning.'' That is a goal that all of us should emulate: \n``I grow old in the pursuit of learning.''\n  I try to follow in Solon's footsteps in that regard. During the last \nbreak I read Cicero's ``Republic''--not Plato's ``Republic.'' I had \nalready done that some time ago, but Cicero's ``Republic,'' and \nCicero's ``Law''--and De Tocqueville's ``Democracy in America''--two \nexcellent volumes.\n  Ours is not a democracy. We are talking about a form of government. \nOurs is not a democracy. We live in a democratic society and we promote \ndemocratic principles. But, as for our form of government, it is not a \ndemocracy. So many people loosely and glibly refer to it as a \n``democracy.''\n  One needs only to read the Federalist Papers No. 10 and No. 14, to \nget a good definition of what is a ``democracy'' and what is a \n``republic.'' Madison, in both of those essays, defines and \ndistinguishes between a democracy, as a form of government, and a \nrepublic.\n  So let us continue to study and to learn. Learning can be one of the \nmost rewarding of the human activities. But it must be a lifelong \njourney.\n  It ought to be a lifelong journey which carries one across the rivers \nof changes in events and into the recesses of man's immortal spirit. \nThere is no better way to build upon shallow and superficial knowledge \nthan to ponder the lessons of the past. There is no better way. As \nCicero said, ``To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born, is \nto remain always a child.''\n\n[[Page S10575]]\n\n  I encourage all schools to give their students this opportunity to \ngrow, to share the lessons of the past, to share history, to read \nancient history. Herodotus who wrote about Persia, and who wrote about \nEgypt, lived somewhere between 484 and 424 B.C.--Xenophon, Thucydides, \nSallustius, Polybius, Zosimus, Orosius, Ammianus, Appianus, Arrianus, \nCaesar himself who wrote the Gallic Wars, Florus, Procopius, Eutropius, \nCassius Dio Cocceianus, Livius, Tacitus, Plutarch, Gibbon on The \nDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Read histories of England. Of \nRome and Greece.\n  Read these histories, and read American history, and read the history \nof the U.S. Senate. These are illuminating. They are uplifting. And we \ncan learn by past events how, in many instances, to deal with current \nevents.\n  Napoleon said, ``Teach my son to study history. It is the only true \nphilosophy.''\n  Enjoy the vision of the poets and the philosophers and begin to shape \nleaders, who can take us confidently into the future because they so \nwell understand the past.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nfor the remarks of the Senator from West Virginia, and to take this \nmoment to repeat again to him how much I appreciated his remarkable \naddress earlier this week in the Old Senate Chamber in the majority \nleader's Lecture Series on the History of the Senate. He had the \nlargest crowd I can remember. He had the rapt attention of virtually \nevery Senator as he shared with us the great traditions of this body. \nOf course, we know that he has written a three-volume history on the \nU.S. Senate. On Fridays, I am often in the Chair that the Presiding \nOfficer is in today, and I had the occasion to hear him address this \nbody.\n  I have written two letters congratulating Senators on speeches, and \nthey have both been to Senator Byrd. I remember one of his speeches \ntalked about education. He referred to our textbooks as ``touchy, feely \ntwaddle.'' Too often, I think, they don't have or possess the power of \nthe great historians to uplift, causing us to think and dream about \nheroic acts. He shared with us on one of those occasions his experience \nin the two-room schoolhouse where he grew up. I thought then of my \ngrandmother who taught in a one-room schoolhouse. I remember the \nschoolhouse as I was growing up. Although it has been torn down now, I \nremember in her library--I don't know how she obtained it--was \nMacauley's ``History of England,'' Gibbon's ``The Decline and Fall of \nthe Roman Empire,'' Shakespeare, and other great literary works. She \nshared those with the elementary schoolchildren in those schoolrooms.\n  I am of a belief that they were richly educated in that one-room \nschoolhouse. There is something more significant than color pictures \nand videos in transmitting what it is that we are about as a people.\n  I taught in the sixth grade 1 year, and we used what they called \nBasil Readers. They wrote stories in little pieces, and at the end of \nthem were a lot of questions, and in each story they would add new \nwords. It was all scientifically done, you see. It was to teach them \nvocabulary and things of that nature. But the children hated them and \nwould not read those books. And around the classroom--it was an old \nclass school--there were a lot of books like I had in my schoolroom--\nDaniel Boone, the old bluecoat, the Hardy Boys, Tom Swift. And so I \nstarted encouraging them to read those books, and they loved them \nbecause they were stories that had some meaning and some adventure and \nshowed people in situations which required courage.\n  At any rate, I say to Senator Byrd, thank you for sharing your \nopinions with us. You can have a $500 textbook, but if it has no moral \nmessage, no meaning to it, does not uplift the spirit and no one wants \nto read it, then that textbook is not worth very much. Too often I \nthink that is the problem with modern education.\n  I, again, say how much I appreciate the Senator's remarks and the \nSenator's leadership in this Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I express my deep appreciation to the distinguished Senator \nfor his comments. It has been my privilege to serve over these 40 years \nin the Senate with some great Senators from Alabama.\n  Senator James Allen was an expert in the rules and procedures. He had \nbeen Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, and I believe he told me that as \npresiding officer over the Alabama lower house, I believe it was, he \nused the rules of the U.S. Senate. He certainly was very conversant \nwith the U.S. Senate rules, a master of the rules of the Senate, a very \nable man, and courageous. He had no difficulty in taking a stand even \nif he stood alone. We were sorry at his untimely passing.\n  There were other great Senators from Alabama--John Sparkman, who \npromoted and wrote important legislation dealing with housing; Lister \nHill. I can see Lister Hill--that is his desk, I believe it was that \ndesk right there--speaking. He had a fine way of speaking. I believe he \ntold me that he had been named after Dr. Lister--a great English \nsurgeon, Dr. Lister. Senator Hill told me, if I am not mistaken in my \nrecollection, that Dr. Lister had performed an operation on a man who \nhad gangrene in one of his legs. They didn't have the anesthetics in \nthat day and time that they have today. This man went through this \nexcruciating experience and then wrote the poem ``Invictus.'' And the \nsurgeon was a Dr. Lister. Senator Hill was given the name Lister, after \nthat great English surgeon.\n  I am proud to recall these fine Senators from Alabama who were here \nwhen I came to the Senate. I have lately come to appreciate the work of \nthe distinguished Senator who is now standing at the desk of the \nmajority leader, and I appreciate his kind words. I have treasured his \nletters, and I know that ours is a friendship which will be a lasting \none. I shall cherish it.\n  I thank him for relating his experiences in the little country \nschoolhouse. It doesn't have to be a massive building with beautiful \ncolumns and hallways decorated with shining pieces of furniture. The \nteacher makes the school. James A. Garfield, hearkening back to his \nschooldays, said that if he had his old teacher, Mark Hopkins, on one \nend of the log and he himself on the other there was a university. \nThose are not the exact words, but they were well spoken.\n  I am trying to remember a poem about a teacher. It doesn't come back \nto me just now, except in part:\n\n       A Teacher builded a temple\n       With loving and infinite care,\n       Planning each arch with patience,\n       Laying each stone with prayer.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       But the temple the teacher builded\n       Will last while the ages roll\n       For that beautiful unseen temple\n       Was a child's immortal soul.\n\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his comments. I do share his views about teachers. My grandmother, \nin her first job--and I have a photograph of the class--had a real \nrough looking group of poor kids, no doubt. But in that group was an \nindividual who may have been somewhat inspired by her and who went on \nto become a U.S. Congressman, Frank Boykin, a man of some note. I \nalways claim that whatever he learned, he learned in that first through \nsixth grade schoolroom when she taught there.\n\n  So I think teachers do inspire us. Good teachers understand and are \nknowledgeable and learned people themselves, and they can then share \nthat. Sometimes I think we spend too much time on process rather than \non substance.\n  I again express my appreciation to Senator Byrd for his leadership of \nthis body, this Senate, for reminding us on a regular basis of what we \nare about, our heritage here, and calling us to our best and highest \ninstincts.\n  Thank you, Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10576]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10574-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PREVENTING CUTOFFS OF SATELLITE TV SERVICE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard from scores of Vermonters \nlately who are steaming mad. They have been told by their home \nsatellite signal providers they are going to lose some of their home \nnetwork satellite channels just as the new TV season starts. They have \nevery right to be upset, because it is within the ability of Congress \nto unmuddle the mess that satellite viewers are facing. The public has \nevery reason to expect Congress to get its act together to do that, and \nto do it quite promptly.\n  Under a court order, thousands of viewers, many of them living in my \nhome State of Vermont, are going to be cut off from receiving TV \nstations. These are TV stations, incidentally, that they are paying to \nreceive. We have 65,000 home satellite dishes in Vermont. The court \norder directly affects only those subscribers who signed up for service \nafter March 11, 1997, but most subscribers are being warned by the \nsignal providers they are going to soon lose several of the network \nchannels they now receive, several of the network channels they \nexpected to receive, several of the network channels they are paying to \nreceive.\n  In a rural State like mine, there are many, many areas where the only \nway you can receive television is by satellite dish. This huge policy \nglitch is intruding right now into hundreds of thousands of homes \nthroughout the country. It is a royal mess, and Congress and the FCC \nneed to fix it.\n  I introduced a bill in March of this year with Chairman Hatch of the \nJudiciary Committee so we could try to resolve this issue before it \nbecame a major problem. We have tried since then to push Congress to \nfind a solution. But many viewers have lost their signals already. We \nare trying to get these bills passed in the next couple of weeks to \nrestore service and to keep other households from losing their \nsatellite TV signals, not just in Vermont but in every State in this \ncountry.\n  I am pleased Senator Hatch and I have worked out arrangements with \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee and other Senators who have been \nactive on this issue, including Senators DeWine and Kohl, and what we \nhave worked out significantly raises the prospect that Congress can \nsoon pass a bill to prevent the cutoff of thousands of viewers this \nmonth and in October. The good news is that we hope and believe that \nall Senators can support our approach.\n  Our legislation would keep signals available to Vermonters and \nsubscribers in other States until the FCC has a chance to address these \nissues by the end of next February. Our legislation will direct the FCC \nto address this problem for the future. In fact, our proposal \nultimately will mean, as technology advances, that Vermonters will be \nable to receive satellite TV for all Vermont full-power TV stations, \nand viewers in other States will be similarly protected. Where this \nhelps all of us is that this effort will eventually promote head-to-\nhead competition between cable and satellite TV providers.\n  The goal is to provide satellite TV viewers at home in Vermont with \nmore choices, more channel selections, and at lower rates. The evidence \nis so clear from our hearings: In the areas of the country where there \nis full competition between cable providers, rates to customers are \nconsiderably lower. The same is going to be true when there is greater \neffective competition between cable providers and satellite signal \nproviders. Over time, the effort will permit satellite TV providers to \noffer a full selection of local TV channels to viewers--even those \nliving near Burlington, VT, where local signals are now blocked.\n  I live about 25 miles from Burlington. I get 1\\1/2\\ channels. There \nare three stations, three network stations, in Burlington. But because \nI am out on the side of a mountain, I get 1\\1/2\\ channels. Under the \nrules they are talking about, I would not be allowed to get satellite \nTV to have those same networks. It is ridiculous. It defies reality. \nBut our legislation will cure that.\n  Under current law, those families have to get their local TV systems \nover an antenna. If their situation is like mine, it does not give you \na clear picture. These bills we now have before us will remove that \nlegal limitation that prohibits satellite carriers from offering local \nTV signals to viewers.\n  What we want is this: That over time, satellite carriers will have to \nfollow the rules that cable providers have to follow, which means they \nwill have to carry, in our case, all local Vermont TV stations--and the \nsame in other States. In addition, Vermont stations will be available \nover satellite to many areas in Vermont like my own that today are \nunserved by satellite or by cable. And the second major improvement \noffered through our legislation is satellite carriers that offer local \nVermont channels in their mix of programs will be able to reach \nVermonters throughout our State.\n  People who have spent money on satellite dishes do not know how this \nthing could become as fouled up as it is. Frankly, I do not either. But \nI do know that we can correct it, and our legislation will. It is time \nfor this Congress to step up to the plate and solve this policy \nnightmare. It is now at the door of countless homes, not only in \nVermont but throughout the country. Constituents should know they \nshould not have to take, ``Well, not now,'' as an acceptable answer. We \nhave plenty time left in this Congress to correct this.\n  I commend Senators Hatch and McCain for the leadership they have \nshown in solving this problem. I am going to continue working with them \nand I think we are going to get somewhere. I certainly hope we are \ngoing to get somewhere, because I don't want to have to tell my \nneighbors that the Congress has so much time for so many other things \nbut cannot take some time to fix something that directly affects so \nmany hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10576-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10576-S10577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FORTIETH RATIFICATION OF THE OTTAWA LANDMINE TREATY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in October of 1996, I was privileged to \nparticipate in a conference in Ottawa hosted by Canada's Foreign \nMinister Lloyd Axworthy. I was there with Tim Rieser of my staff who \nhas done so much work on the issue of banning landmines. We were also \naccompanied by Bobby Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica Foundation, a man who was way ahead of most of us in pushing \nfor a ban on antipersonnel landmines.\n  The purpose of the conference in 1996 was to chart a strategy \nculminating in a global treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. The \nOttawa process was conceived of by Canada and a number of other \ngovernments that were fed up with the failure of previous efforts to \nseriously deal with the mine problem.\n  Over 70 governments and dozens of nongovernmental organizations \naccepted Minister Axworthy's invitation to Ottawa. At that conference, \nto the surprise of everyone present--but certainly to my delight--\nMinister Axworthy took the courageous step of challenging the world's \ngovernments to return in a year's time to sign a treaty that would \naccomplish nothing less than a total ban on antipersonnel landmines.\n  It was that bold challenge which enabled the international community \nto finally move from rhetoric to action. In December 1997, just barely \nover a year later, 122 governments returned to Ottawa to sign a treaty \nbanning the production, transfer, and use of antipersonnel mines \nforever.\n  During the previous year, the United States had refused to \nparticipate in the treaty-drafting process. In fact, some U.S. \nofficials dismissed the Ottawa process as a ``sideshow.'' They \npredicted that without U.S. support, the Canadian effort would \neventually run out of steam. They predicted that this treaty would \nnever take effect.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the opposite happened. A few days ago, \nBurkina Faso, one of so many African countries whose people have been \nmaimed and killed by landmines, became the 40th state to deposit its \npapers of ratification with the United Nations, triggering the 6-month \nperiod before the treaty formally comes into force.\n  What many once dismissed as a naive and far-fetched dream is now a \nreality. In fact, today the treaty has some 129\n\n[[Page S10577]]\n\nsignatories, including every NATO country, except the United States and \nTurkey, and every Western Hemisphere country, except the United States \nand Cuba.\n  Mr. President, this is a historic achievement. It is, I am told, by \nfar the shortest period of time that any humanitarian law or arms \ncontrol treaty has come into force. It is indicative of the tremendous \nsense of urgency and determination that has grown around the world to \nstop the carnage caused by landmines.\n  But more than anything, it is a tribute to Minister Axworthy, the \nGovernment of Canada, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, \nlandmine survivors, and all the other governments, the U.N. Secretary \nGeneral, and U.N. agencies like UNICEF and UNDP. It indicates the \ncommitment of people like the late Princess Diana, Queen Noor of \nJordan, the former coordinator of the International Campaign to Ban \nLandmines, Jody Williams, and so many others who have worked so hard to \nend this scourge.\n  The treaty's significance is in its simplicity. It establishes a new, \nunambiguous international norm. The 20th century saw large portions of \nthe globe contaminated by landmines. Two days ago, a process was \nformally set in motion to reverse that legacy in the first years of the \nnext century. It is a gift to the next generation, and generations \nbeyond.\n  The treaty is a beginning. There are still many millions of mines \nburied in the ground waiting to be triggered by an innocent footstep or \na curious child. Many of the treaty's signatories were once producers, \nexporters and users of landmines. They are no longer. The parties to \nthe treaty have also pledged to get rid of the mines in the ground, and \nthe United States, to its credit, and many other governments and \norganizations are already hard at work at demining.\n  I had hoped that the United States would be among the 40 original \nparties to the treaty. That was not to be, but I have no doubt that the \nUnited States will yet sign, and I resolve to work with the \nadministration to reach that goal as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I have traveled throughout the world and have seen the \ndamage caused by landmines. I have been impressed by the dedication of \nTim Rieser in my own office who has given so much of himself to this. \nMy wife is a registered nurse, and she has gone into the hospitals and \nto the clinics run and funded by the Leahy War Victims Fund. She, too, \nhas seen the damage caused by landmines.\n  This is a weapon that is often used against civilians. It is a weapon \nthat stays in the ground long after the peace agreements are signed, \nthe armies have left the field and the soldiers have been disarmed. It \nis a weapon that waits for its victim to pull the trigger by stepping \non it, stumbling on it or brushing up against it. It is a weapon that \nis no longer needed, certainly not by the United States, the most \npowerful nation on Earth.\n  We have to understand that in the end, whether it is a child in \nHonduras, a farmer in Mozambique, or an American peacekeeper in Bosnia, \nwe all stand to gain in a world in which landmines are banned and their \nuse is a war crime.\n  Mr. President, I have been privileged to do many things in my time as \na Member of the U.S. Senate on issues that involve us both domestically \nand worldwide. It is hard to think of anything that has been more of a \nprivilege than working on the landmine issue. Certainly nothing has \nmade me more proud than authoring the first piece of legislation passed \nanywhere in the world banning the export of landmines--the export \nmoratorium.\n  Today, Mr. President, I compliment those who have gotten us this far. \nAs I told Minister Axworthy when I talked to him on the phone a couple \nevenings ago, we would not be here if he had not made the brave, bold \nmove that he did in Ottawa in 1996. I still recall the reaction when \nLloyd Axworthy launched the treaty effort in the Fall of 1996. He said, \n``Let us come back in a year with a landmine treaty.'' Indeed, they \ndid. Indeed, that is where the world is now. Indeed, we are all better \nfor it.\n  Mr. President, I see nobody else seeking recognition, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10576-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMPLIMENTING SENATORS RICK SANTORUM AND BOB SMITH\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I would like to report briefly on the \neffort to bring up the Endangered Species Recovery Act, S. 1180.\n  When we were debating the Interior appropriations bill on Wednesday, \nSenator Kempthorne, the Senator from Idaho, indicated that he planned \nto offer an amendment that would largely embody the substance of S. \n1180.\n  I strongly support S. 1180. But we are no longer considering the \nInterior appropriations bill, and it is not clear whether we will \nagain. I think the far better approach is to take up S. 1180 as a \nfreestanding bill. After all, that bill was reported on October 31, \n1997, almost 1 year ago. It is a solid bill, it is balanced, it is good \nfor endangered species, and it is good for private landowners. It has \nbipartisan support. The vote in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee was 15-3. The bill was supported by every Republican member \nof the committee and by a majority of the Democratic members. The bill \nis also strongly supported by the Clinton administration.\n  To my mind, there is no good reason why we cannot bring up S. 1180 \nfor debate on the Senate floor. Moreover, that approach has two \nimportant advantages over trying to attach it to the Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  First, we do not have the Interior appropriations bill. That is one \nbig difficulty. In addition, bringing up S. 1180 as a freestanding bill \nassures full and fair debate and an opportunity for amendments. We are \nlikely to get amendments from the left, from the right, from the \nmiddle, and who knows where. I am sure that we can work out most of \nthem.\n  Of course, I will oppose amendments that would disrupt the balance of \nthe bill. That is the agreement I reached with Senator Kempthorne and \nSenator Chafee, Interior Secretary Babbitt, those of us who put this \nbill together; that is, oppose amendments that would disrupt the \nbalance achieved in the bill. But every Senator should have a shot. In \nthe end, such a process, I believe, will increase support for the bill.\n  In addition, this approach--bringing it up as a freestanding bill--\nassures that the bill will be taken up under the leadership and \njurisdiction of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and that \nincludes any conference with the House.\n  Members of the committee have worked long and worked hard--over \nseveral years, I might add--to develop this legislation. We should \nfollow through rather than hand the bill off to an Appropriations \nCommittee that is already bearing such heavy burdens as the fiscal \nclock winds down.\n  S. 1180, I say to my good friend, the Presiding Officer, is on the \ncalendar. Here is the calendar. S. 1180 is on it. It has been on the \ncalendar for almost a year. It is a good bill. We can be proud of it. \nWe should take it up as a freestanding bill.\n\n[[Page S10578]]\n\n  So where do things stand today? Yesterday, both Cloakrooms asked \nSenators whether they wished to offer any amendments. On our side there \nare about 20. I am now beginning to review the amendments and discuss \nthem with Members and their staff to see if we can reduce that number. \nThe majority is doing the same.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that, working with the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Chafee, and the majority and minority leaders, we \nwill be in a position to bring the bill up, for debate and for \namendment, within a matter of days. For my part, I will do whatever I \ncan to make this possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I traveled to the recent Summit meeting \nin Moscow. At that Summit, a protocol was signed that will, if \nsuccessfully implemented, safeguard 50 tons of Russian weapons-grade \nplutonium and transform it into new forms that should ensure that it is \nnever again used in nuclear weapons.\n  I've placed special emphasis on this agreement for many months, and I \ninvested a great deal of personal effort to achieve success. I welcome \nthese recent steps. At the same time, I recognize that this protocol \nonly creates an opportunity for real progress, we have to go far beyond \njust signing the protocol to secure the benefits that it can provide.\n  I've spoken out in the past on the need to ensure that Russian stocks \nof weapons-grade materials do not find their way to terrorists or rogue \nstates. The current financial crisis in Russia only adds further \nemphasis to these concerns. The former Soviet Union relied on guards \nand guns to safeguard their fissile materials. Now those guards may not \nhave been paid for months--that has to increase our concerns. At the \nSummit we certainly heard about the tremendous burdens being borne by \nthe Russian people from the current economic uncertainties and rampant \ninflation.\n  Some programs already exist to improve the protection of nuclear \nmaterials. The Materials Protection Control and Accounting program is \ndemonstrating some real successes in improving this situation. But the \ncurrent opportunity to remove 50 tons of weapons-grade material from \npotential weapons use is most unique. I've worked to be sure that we \nquickly seize it. In fact, my visit to Russia in July with Senators \nThompson and Grams was motivated largely by my interest in finding ways \nto progress more rapidly with this 50 tons.\n  After that visit in July, I spoke with you about my misgivings with \nthe Administration's plan to couple the rate of weapons dismantlement \nto the rate at which the weapons-grade plutonium could be used in \nreactors, as mixed-oxide or MOX fuel. At that time, the Administration \nwas planning for Russia to use about 1.3 tons of this material per year \nin a set of Russian reactors. I argued that this was far too slow a \nrate. It would take 35 years to dispose of the 50 tons at that rate--\nnone of us can be the least bit sure that the current window of \nopportunity for progress with Russia will stay open anywhere near that \nlong.\n  In July, I proposed that we structure an agreement that decouples the \ninitial steps in dismantlement from the final step of reactor use. \nSpecifically, I believed that the Russians would accept a program that \ntargets a goal for moving 10 tons per year of weapons-grade plutonium \nthrough the weapons dismantlement step, through conversion of \nclassified shapes into unclassified ones, and into safeguarded storage. \nThese steps have the effect of significantly reducing the risk that \nthis material will be re-used in weapons.\n  We still need to proceed with the final disposition of the Russian \nplutonium in reactors, and I want to accomplish that step as rapidly as \npossible as part of our overall integrated program on plutonium \ndisposition. But construction of MOX fuel fabrication facilities, plus \nlimitations on the number of reactors in Russia that can accept MOX \nfuel, will lead to slower progress for this final step.\n  I discussed this approach with President Clinton in late July and \nencouraged that plutonium disposition be a focus of his next Summit. I \nappreciate his willingness to include this subject at the Moscow \nmeetings.\n  I've just recently corresponded again with the President to outline \nmy suggestions on key principles that should guide our negotiations of \nthe detailed agreements required to implement the new plutonium \ndisposition protocol. In that letter, I repeated my strong advice that \nhe appoint a special envoy charged with the entire plutonium \ndisposition effort. This program requires coordination across multiple \nfederal agencies, as well as negotiations with Russia and the G-7 \ncountries. In my view, an envoy who commands domestic and international \nrespect, and who clearly has Presidential authority, is essential to \nexpedite success.\n  I listed six key negotiating points in my letter to the President. \nFirst, I emphasized that agreements must focus on rapid progress for \nthe initial steps of the process, the dismantlement, conversion of \nclassified shapes, and the safeguarded storage. These steps can and \nshould be targeted at a rate of 10 tons per year.\n  Second, all milestones that we establish to gauge progress must \ninclude sufficient transparency that we can be positive that agreed-\nupon steps are accomplished.\n  Third, Russian plutonium must eventually be used in MOX fuel, but the \nrate for this step will be much slower than 10 tons per year. \nNevertheless, we need to make progress toward this ultimate goal and \nthis step must be part of the overall integrated program. I also noted \nthat in my conversations with Russian leadership, they are very \nsensitive to achieving the best utilization of their plutonium. They \nbelieve that new generations of reactors can best utilize some of their \nplutonium. I believe that we should respect their interests, as long as \nthe weapons material is always stored under effective safeguards while \nawaiting eventual use.\n  Fourth, we should minimize the construction of new Russian \nfacilities. We should seek and perhaps help to convert some existing \nRussian facilities. For example, some of their weapon production \nfacilities should be converted to weapon dismantlement.\n  Fifth, it is important to involve the other G-7 countries. Plutonium \nrepresents a global risk prior to disposition and careful disposition \nof plutonium is a global benefit. For that reason, we should encourage \nmeaningful participation from our G-7 friends as we work together on \nthese goals.\n  And finally, we should assure that any U.S. resources that subsidize \nthe Russian Federation's program are provided only upon assurance that \ntasks and milestones were satisfactorily completed.\n  It will be a challenge to negotiate agreements that follow these six \npoints, but it is essential that we promptly start serious \nnegotiations. I'm pleased to be informed by the Administration that the \nfirst discussions with the Russians on this subject will occur very \nsoon.\n  In closing, I want to note that this current emphasis on disposition \nof excess weapons materials is only one action in what I hope will be a \nlong series of important steps toward dramatic reductions in global \nrisks and tensions. This agreement is important, but it has to be \nfollowed by more agreements. Each of these subsequent agreements must \nbe carefully and fully implemented, and should target further \nreductions in the large world-wide stocks of weapons materials.\n  In order to achieve these reductions, new agreements have to be in \nplace to inventory global sources of fissile materials; and obviously \nall nations will eventually have to participate to achieve real \nsuccess. Other future agreements need to provide reliable counts of \nactual warheads, and eventually to dramatic reductions in the numbers \nof such warheads.\n\n[[Page S10579]]\n\n  Our long term goal should be a world without nuclear weapons, but \nthat goal will only be achieved by many many years of patient progress \ntoward intermediate goals. Each step along this journey must be focused \non further reductions in global tensions and in risks of international \nconflicts.\n  In the near term, I am committed to the importance of the disposition \nof the current 50 tons of Russian excess weapons-grade plutonium. We \nhave a golden window of opportunity to rid the world of materials for \nthousands of nuclear weapons, we must not squander the chance.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are a number of problems that have \ncontributed to the increase in bankruptcies in this country. We are now \nconsidering what I believe to be a historic and exceptionally fine \nbankruptcy bill. It came out of the Judiciary Committee with a 16-2 \nvote, demonstrating overwhelming support from Democrats and \nRepublicans. This legislation is something that we need to pass. But in \nsome ways, the filing of a bankruptcy petition is the cleaning up of \nspilled milk. The milk has already been spilled, and it is difficult \nthen to have any kind of fair and just determination or allocation of \nassets, and many problems arise from it.\n  What we need today is more people who manage their money well. The \ngeneration that grew up during the Depression, like my father and \nmother, knew how to manage their money. They were cautious. Maybe they \ndidn't make great sums of money and great investments, but they took \ncare of themselves and their families through frugal living--and I mean \nfrugal living. In my background, oftentimes it was very tough for us to \nfund the things that we felt we would like to have. However, what we \nhave is a generation that has not been taught how to manage money.\n  Today, more people have credit available to them. Frankly, I am not \none of those who says the problem is that you can get access to credit. \nIt would be a terrible thing in this country if you could not get a \ncredit card, if you had to have a $40,000-a-year income before anybody \nwould give you a credit card. A credit card is a very valuable thing \nfor a person on a low income when they are trying to work and take care \nof their families. When they have a flat tire or a $400 car repair bill \nand they don't have $400 in their pocket, they can use a credit card to \npay for it now and the pay it off over a period of months. This way \nthey would not have to deny their family food, or not be able to get to \nwork because of an automobile that he does not have the money to fix. \nThose are the kinds of things that are good.\n  I don't see how we need to be critical of the fact that many credit \ncard companies are offering cards. For the first time, credit card \ncompanies are beginning to get competitive. I have been very displeased \nwith the high rates of interest some of these cards charge. For the \nfirst time now, they are soliciting business and offering lower \ninterest rates. I think that is a good thing, also.\n  But, fundamentally, we get into trouble because we don't have enough \ndiscipline and ability to manage the debt that we face. The way to deal \nwith bankruptcy, fundamentally, is to educate the public on how to \nmanage money. So this bill, for the first time in history, provides \ndebtor education. It provides it both before filing and before you can \nbe discharged from bankruptcy.\n  I was pleased to offer the consumer credit counseling amendment. I \nwas very pleased, and thrilled, actually, that it received so much \nsupport and was made a part of this bill.\n  Let me just say this, Mr. President. I live in Mobile, AL, and I \nbegan to talk with people I know and respect about debt matters. I \nserved with and go to church with an individual who is a bankruptcy \nadministrator in Mobile. I know some of the bankruptcy judges. I have \nspent time talking with them about the problems with bankruptcy. Mr. \nTravis Bedsole and I both taught the same Sunday school class together \nover the years. We had some heart-to-hearts about what we really ought \nto do that would help people. When you have the ads that you see in the \nnewspapers and on television, ``Come down, and, for $350, we will wipe \nout all your debt,'' that may work just like that advertising lawyer \nsays, but it will not leave that debtor with a better understanding of \nhow to manage his money.\n  What I found was that there are alternatives to bankruptcy. Mr. \nBedsole and I went to meet Sandra Dunaway in Mobile, who has a credit \ncounseling agency. Families, married individuals, people in trouble, go \nto credit counseling agencies. Then, counselors sit down with the \npeople who need assistance and help prepare a household budget; the \nlawyers don't do that. They look at all their debts and interest rates \nand figure out a way to save interest rates.\n  Credit counseling agencies even have the ability--because of their \nprior relationships with banks and credit card companies and other \nfinancing companies--to call those institutions and say, ``This person \nis in credit card debt; they are paying 16 percent interest to you. We \nbelieve we can work them through this if you will cut your interest \nrate to 7 percent.'' They can actually reduce payments in various ways \nthrough negotiations with creditors. Often, creditors will cooperate \nwith that. Then they help the debtor develop a family budget. Sometimes \nthey will have them put their paycheck into the credit counseling \ndepartment's account, and the counselor will pay the checks to the \ncreditors and give the family what is left over for their normal needs \nand make sure they have enough to meet their household needs in that \nfashion.\n  If they can't absolutely work their way out of this debt crisis, then \nthey advise them to seek an attorney and file for bankruptcy. What we \nhave discovered is that this sytem works. They tell me that there are a \nnumber of different things that are at work here. One of them is \ngambling. Many people are filing bankruptcy today because of the \nproliferation of gambling. They are addicted to gambling, and they are \nlosing large sums of money gambling, and their families are suffering \nfrom it. So sometimes the way to help a family is to make sure they are \nconnected with Gamblers Anonymous or some other State agency or private \norganization that can help those addicted to gambling. Sometimes there \nis a drug problem or an alcohol problem in the family, and these credit \ncounseling agencies, who are United Way agencies, for the most part \nfilled with people who care about the individuals, in a service \nmentality, not just to get the money and file bankruptcy, but help them \ngo to Alcoholics Anonymous or to drug treatment and get in contact with \nmental health agencies if there is a mental health problem in the \nfamily, and seek other forms of assistance that are already available \nin the community and then help that family develop a plan to get \nthrough this financial crisis.\n\n  It is a good thing and a lot of people see these ads: ``Bankruptcy \nCan Be a Smart Financial Move''--from $350 and up. This ad has another \nthing in there, by the way. ``Divorce, $300, including court \nappearance.'' ``Injuries, sexual harassment at work, call us. $350.'' \nSo they test that. They have a paralegal administrative assistant who \nmeets with the person and they fill out all the bankruptcy forms. The \nlawyer may never even see them. He takes the forms. It looks OK. He \ntakes them down to the court, files the forms, and, boom. They go to \nbankruptcy. There has been nothing done to deal with the fundamental \nproblem that causes them to be in the circumstance they were. So credit \nagencies are really good. People do not realize it. They are in almost \nevery city and midsized town in America. Credit counseling agencies are \nreadily available.\n  This bill says before you file bankruptcy we require that you go by \nand\n\n[[Page S10580]]\n\ntalk with a credit counseling agency. But before you commit yourself to \nthe lawyer and filing of the bankruptcy and paying his fee, go talk to \nthat credit counseling agency. You just may find that they have the \nability to help you work through this thing, that they will help you \nget some creditors to withhold demands of payment, allow you to get \ncaught up, help you set up a budget, and help you figure a way to get a \nside job, or to do the kind of things that most families do to work \ntheir way out of debt. When they do that, it can actually strengthen \nthe family.\n  Mr. President, there are some very dramatic numbers on this. But it \nis a major reality that a very large number--in fact, I think the \nhighest number of divorces in this country are caused by financial \ndisputes and arguments over finances. So this can help strengthen \nfamilies and hold families together.\n  I am a real believer in credit counseling. It convinced me. I spent \nseveral hours talking with them about precisely how they do that. We \ngot a number of people from my church together. We met three or four \ntimes. We want to develop a program that helps train people even more \nin depth about how to manage their property and finances as well so \nthat bankruptcy won't be facing them.\n  Some have said that this amendment was opposed by the Federation of \nCredit Counselors, a national federation that has crediting standards, \nand that sort of thing. But that is not true. We have met with them. \nThis amendment has been refined so that it has, I think, broad-based \nsupport by now virtually everyone. I am convinced that it has the \npotential for the first time to reduce the ever-increasing number of \nbankruptcies being filed, and for the first time they will have the \ngovernment move more people from a strictly legal situation into a \nsituation in which people care about them personally, who will be \nworking with them personally, who confront their problems that exist \nwithin their family, and to help them figure a way out of it. I am \nreally excited about that. It does not require a judge to order this to \nhappen. If there are no legitimate or effective credit counseling \nagencies in the local communities, the amendment would not apply. But I \nam confident that in most areas it would apply.\n  Another thing this new bankruptcy bill does that is excellent is it \nrequires that those who file bankruptcy complete a financial management \ncourse prior to receiving their discharge from bankruptcy. This is \ngoing to put a new burden on the bankruptcy courts. But many of them \nhave already moved in this direction and are working in this direction.\n  I believe we owe a responsibility to those who had a circumstance in \nwhich they were unable to meet their debt to give them some training \nand education in how not to come back again. The truth is we have found \na very large number of repeat filers in bankruptcies. Some districts \nhave reported that 40 percent of their consumer bankruptcies are repeat \nfilers. We know that it comprises more than 10 percent nationally. This \nproblem will not go away if we don't do something to confront them in \nthis process when they are seeking this relief. We want to confront \nthem with their difficulties and help them establish a way to avoid \ncoming back to bankruptcy.\n  That is the kind of thing that I think would deal with the \nfundamental problem of debt in America.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the Grassley-Durbin bankruptcy bill is \nan excellent bill. I believe that the 16-to-2 vote that it achieved \ncoming out of committee is a strong testament to its fairness and \nobjectivity and its ability to improve the bankruptcy court system.\n  I believe for the first time we will be reaching out to these \nindividuals and families who are in credit difficulties in helping them \nchange their lifestyle and helping them find ways to deal with the \nproblems--sometimes the fundamental, root causes of their financial \ndifficulties so that they won't have to face this problem again; in \nfact, perhaps to be able to live in a family that is not always \nsquabbling over money, that maybe does not break up because the family \nhas figured out a way to handle its resources in a wise and good manner \nthat would benefit children and the entire family.\n  Mr. President, I believe that we are on the cusp of the opportunity \nof a great bill. I thank the Members of this body who have worked so \nhard to achieve it. I believe that we will pass it, that it will be law \nsoon, and that this Nation will benefit from it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to announce my full support \nfor and co-sponsorship of legislation introduced yesterday by the \nCommerce Committee Chairman, Senator McCain, that will fix a vexing \nproblem that is causing citizens in my state of Vermont and throughout \nthe country to lose their access to television network programming.\n  Mr. President, Vermonters are contacting me saying they are very \nfrustrated to be caught in the middle of a legal battle between \nbroadcast and satellite television providers. In many parts of Vermont, \nand especially in the winter, television is our access to the world. As \na satellite dish owner myself, I know that in many parts of Vermont, it \nis impossible to view television progamming without cable or satellite \ntelevision service. Vermont's many mountains and valleys can enable one \nhomeowner at the top of a hollow to receive a broadcast signal just \nfine, but his neighbor down in the hollow needs a satellite dish to \nreceive anything at all.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation will fix these problems quickly \nand fairly. I believe Senator McCain's bill will both protect the \nrights of local broadcasters while ensuring that Vermonters do not have \ntheir satellite service unfairly cutoff. I urge its quick passage.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, we have spent most of the morning \ntalking primarily about the bankruptcy bill that will be before us. We \nhave done a lot of work on that bill, and there are some complicated \nand difficult issues involved. People have raised many objections and \nquestions. The managers have done an outstanding job in trying to \nconfront those objections and questions and tried to modify the bill, \noften on the spur of the moment, to deal with the potential objections. \nI have supported that. I have supported the managers' amendment that \ndeals with many of these things. But there are a number of issues that \nstill perhaps need more evaluation.\n  I think one of the things we need to discuss is a mandate that we \nhave now in the bill which tells the credit card companies a lot of new \ninformation that they must provide on their financial statements, \nincluding how many months a person would need to pay at the minimum \npayment before the credit card debt would be fully paid off. That may \nbe a good idea, but I wonder, Have we actually asked these private \ncompanies how difficult that is going to be for them? Will we get the \nkind of benefit from it that we hope to get? Will it be worth the \nadditional numbers that are required to be put on the form? Have was \nasked them how much will it cost? That cost, of course, will ultimately \nbe passed on to the consumers.\n  Some of those financial statements have become so complicated that \nyou hardly know how to look at them when you get them. It may be that \nthis is the kind of amendment we want to have. But I did want to \nsuggest that, regarding this requirement that we have added without any \nhearings having taken place, we might need to ask the conferees to look \nat it. There may be a number of other issues of like note that need to \nbe looked at in conference as well.\n  Fundamentally, I believe the managers' amendment is a healthy thing,\n\n[[Page S10581]]\n\nand I certainly support Senator Grassley in his efforts to move this \nbill forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10580-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10581-S10582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LOUISIANA REQUEST FOR DISASTER ASSISTANCE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, over the past several weeks the senior \nSenator from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, and I have expressed grave \nconcerns about the pending economic crisis that Louisiana and other \nSouthern states face as a result of the worst drought in Louisiana and \nthe South's history. Earlier this week, more disturbing information was \nbrought to our attention by Terry Smith, a second generation farmer, \ncotton gin manager and marketing consultant from Jonesville, Louisiana \nwho testified before a hearing called by Senator Daschle on the farm \ncrisis. The plea by Mr. Smith and others in Louisiana is a wake up \ncall. If the Congress fails to respond to the natural disaster crisis \nin the South for this crop year, not only will farmers be forced into \nbankruptcy, but banks, hundreds of small businesses and the rural \neconomy that is supported by the agriculture industry will suffer \ngreatly.\n  Mr. President, Louisiana began the year with record rainfall during \nthe Winter and early Spring followed by the hottest Summer on record. \nJust during the last three months, Louisiana has had 71 days of 97 \ndegree or higher temperatures with 36 days higher than 100 degrees. \nThings are not looking any better and we are told that with the past \nand current extreme weather conditions the current loss estimates of \n$450 million are expected to increase even more during the coming \nweeks. This is not good news especially for Louisiana corn, cotton, \nsoybean and livestock producers in North Louisiana who have been hit \nhardest.\n  To explain the difficulties that Louisiana farmers are experiencing I \nwould like to take a few moments to highlight some of the high points \nof Terry's remarks. His recent statement very clearly tells the story \nof the projected impact this natural disaster has had on thousands of \nfamily farms and the future economy of some of the poorest areas in \nLouisiana. Specifically, his testimony focuses on the economic losses \nprojected for Louisiana's major row crops--corn, cotton and soybeans.\n  Mr. President, corn farmers in Louisiana under normal weather \npatterns are able to produce about 100-200 bushels per acre for non-\nirrigated corn. To date, the best corn yields in Louisiana have been in \nthe 40-50 bushel per acre range. In addition, a large percentage of \nLouisiana's corn crop is infested with aflatoxin, a toxic mold that \nresults from heat stress and is harmful to humans and animals at \ncertain levels. Due to the toxic nature of this mold, corn harvested \nwith aflatoxin in excess of 20 parts per billion can not be sold to \nmost grain elevators. The grain elevators that will except infested \ncorn is only paying $1.00 per bushel--less than half of what is needed \nto cover the farmer's production costs. Therefore, the farmer has two \noptions--(1) sell the crop at discounted price of $1.00 an acre or (2) \nleave it in the field to rot and collect about the same amount, if the \nfarmer has Catastrophic Crop Insurance. Most farmers with aflatoxin in \ntheir corn above 20 billion parts per million are finding it \nunpractical to even harvest. Those farmers who are lucky enough to have \ncorn without aflatoxin will not be able to cover even half of their \nproduction costs due to low yields and low prices. What is the result \nof this situation? The Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service recently \nestimated that corn farmers in one North Louisiana Parish will lose \nabout $154 per acre or about $3.85 million this year.\n  Our cotton farmers just began their harvest last week, but the \noutlook is not much better. Cotton yields in Louisiana generally \naverage about 800 to 1000 pounds per acre. As of last week, cotton \nyields have been averaging 100 to 650 pounds per acre, one third to one \nhalf of normal production yields. Also, the quality has been extremely \npoor due to the hot dry summer and will discount the price the farmer \ngets for his crop by several cents per pound. With production costs of \ncotton in Louisiana ranging from $500 to $600 per acre, it is estimated \nthat the average cotton farmer will lose approximately $131,000 this \nyear.\n  Soybean harvest has also just begun. Yields thus far are less than 10 \nbushels per acre, which is down approximately 65% from normal. Most \nfields in North Louisiana are averaging about 4-5 bushels per acre. \nAlso, because of the hot, dry weather, chemicals have not been \npreforming and weeds have been a tremendous problem. With the extreme \nlow prices of soybeans and low yields, farmers in hardest hit areas can \nexpect to lose approximately $85 per acre or about $42,500 this year.\n  These are just a few examples of how the major row crops will be \nimpacted. In addition, our larger agriculture lending institutions are \nexpecting very low repayments this year. One of the larger banks in the \nstate says that of $18 million in crop loans, they are expecting to be \nrepaid only 30-35% of the outstanding loans. Another bank expects that \n40-50% of the agricultural loans will not be totally paid this year. \nNot only will crop loans not be repaid, but outstanding bills for crop \ninputs such as chemicals, fertilizer and fuel may not be paid in full. \nIn the words of one banker ``spendable income will be down 75% of \nnormal. This is the money used to buy clothing, household goods and for \npaying the utilities.''\n  Mr. President, these are real examples of the economic hardships \nfacing farmers, their families and the rural communities they support. \nMany farm families do not know what they are going to do in order to \nmake it another year. Many may end up in the local unemployment office. \nI hope that this Congress does not let this happen.\n  Farmers in Louisiana and other Southern states need disaster \nassistance, and they need it before the Congress adjourns. They need \nthis assistance delivered in a manner that is fair. Thus, this relief \nshould only be provided to those farmers with demonstrated crop losses. \nI urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support \nof direct disaster payments to the thousands of farmers who provide us \nwith three square meals a day. This source is so often taken for \ngranted every day when we feed our families.\n  Mr. President, before I conclude my remarks, I would like to talk \nabout some specific relief measures needed to address the 1998 crop \nlosses in Louisiana and other Southern states that have lost a large \nportion of their crops due to the drought and associated disease. These \nmeasures include:\n\n       1. The Secretary should deliver direct disaster payments to \n     compensate all farmers for 1998 crop losses through the Farm \n     Service Agency (FSA).\n       2. Payments should be based on actual farm yields using the \n     past five years of actual production history, excluding the \n     crop year with the lowest yields per harvested acre and any \n     crop year in which the crop was not planted on the farm. \n     Actual production losses should be adjusted because of \n     quality losses caused by damaging weather and related \n     conditions, including diseases such as aflatoxin. If no five \n     year history is available, the Secretary should use the \n     average county yields.\n       3. With respect to livestock producers, direct payments \n     should cover the cost of feed, the establishment of \n     supplemental pastures and other losses due to natural \n     disasters, including livestock and poultry weight losses, \n     poultry mortality and livestock milk production losses.\n       4. With respect to tree farmers, direct payments should \n     cover the cost of replanting seedlings and cover production \n     costs of pecan and peach farmers who suffered losses due to a \n     natural disaster during the 1998 crop year.\n       5. Presently, any farmer who collected a Catastrophic Crop \n     Insurance Payment (CAT) or Non-Insured Crop Insurance Payment \n     (NAP) is ineligible for a low-interest Emergency Loan. This \n     should be amended.\n       6. Also, there is presently a seven year limit on the \n     amount of credit that can be extended through the USDA Farm \n     Service Agency (FSA). On an emergency basis, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture should be granted the authority to waive the \n     current limitation.\n       7. Finally, Mr. President, all the farmers that I have \n     spoken with tell me the crop insurance program is not \n     working. I think we do have some serious problems that can \n     not be addressed in three weeks and should be revisited next \n     year. However, one valid problem that can be addressed this \n     year is to require USDA not to exclude from coverage approved \n     existing planting methods. Currently, all broadcast soybeans \n     planted in Louisiana are ineligible for crop insurance \n     coverage due to the fact that they are seeded by broadcasting \n     means such as aerial application. This is wrong and should be \n     amended.\n\n  Mr. President, this concludes my remarks and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the crop damages as reported by the Louisiana State University \nAgricultural Center be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S10582]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n  Louisiana State University (LSU) Agricultural Center's crop damage \n                         estimate for Louisiana\n\n                           [August 14, 1998]\n\nTotal state reduction in farm income for the reporting Louisiana \n    parishes:\n  Corn......................................................$64,355,717\n  Silage......................................................3,026,790\n  Cotton Lint................................................45,402,308\n    Seed......................................................5,090,964\n  Soybeans...................................................72,053,920\n  Rice.......................................................14,053,920\n  Sugar......................................................44,828,210\n  Molasses....................................................1,399,613\n  Sorghum.....................................................4,034,161\n                                                       ________________\n                                                       \n      Total crops...........................................254,231,853\n  Sweet Potatoes..............................................8,054,100\n  Commercial Vegetables.......................................3,995,561\n  Est.

Mr. President, this is a time of serious political turmoil \nin the United States.\n  The House of Representatives is currently considering impeachment \nproceedings. The President of the United States has admitted to serious \nmoral indiscretions.\n  The public is divided on what punishment should be meted out to a \nPresident who has performed such despicable and indefensible actions.\n  While the House of Representatives is considering impeachment the \nSenate is waiting to determine whether it may have to sit in judgment \nwith respect to these actions.\n  Clearly this is a difficult time for the nation domestically.\n  It is a perilous time for the nation internationally.\n  We have four weeks left in this Congress and to date we have failed \nto address some critical foreign policy issues.\n  Notwithstanding that failure and the political disarray on the \ndomestic front, there should be no disagreement as to the need to face \nup to these issues.\n  This challenge, and our unfinished business, is the subject of my \nremarks today.\n  Throughout our nation's history, Americans have understood that no \nmatter what was happening in this country's internal political life, \nAmerica's survival depends on presenting a strong, united front to the \nworld. Now, in the middle of a domestic political crisis, we must \novercome partisan differences to focus on urgent matters in United \nStates foreign policy.\n  Especially now, in the face of major world crises, we must not allow \nourselves to be distracted from our task of protecting America's \nsecurity, leadership, and credibility abroad.\n  With time running short in the Congressional session, the ability to \nreach out to find the necessary consensus which could permit our \ncountry to speak in one voice is threatened by the entire debate over \nthe future of this President.\n  No matter how we feel about the actions of President Clinton and \nwhether impeachment proceedings should begin in the House of \nRepresentatives, Bill Clinton is still President of the United States \nwith constitutional responsibilities for the conduct of our foreign \npolicy and national security.\n  We in the Congress share that constitutional responsibility and I \ncall on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together and \nwork closely with the President and his national security team to \naddress these issues together.\n  The security threats facing us are urgent and complex: international \nterrorism; weapons of mass destruction in Iraq; nuclear weapons \nprograms in India, Pakistan, and North Korea; a fragile Middle East \npeace; drug trafficking and international crime; the financial crises \nin Russia and Asia; and impending humanitarian disasters in Kosovo and \nthe Horn of Africa.\n\n\n                        Russian Economic Crisis\n\n  The unfolding crisis in Russia, for example, could hold serious \nthreats to the national economic and military security of the United \nStates. An even greater danger than the economic meltdown is the threat \nof a total collapse of Russia's political system.\n  With the Yeltsin era about to end, the only thing worse than an \neconomically paralyzed Yeltsin government would be a coup d'etat that \ninstalled an authoritarian government.\n  It takes little imagination to see the dangers of a new, extremist \nRussian regime that would have access to thousands of leftover Cold War \nmissiles armed with nuclear warheads. Because of the deep structural \nproblems in Russia's political and economic system, there is very \nlittle that the United States can do to turn this situation around \nquickly.\n  But with thousands of former Soviet nuclear weapons experts out of \nwork and rogue states such as Libya, Iran, and Iraq eager to offer them \npaychecks, we must keep our eye on the first priority of preventing the \ncollapse of Russian democracy along with the economy if we want to \nprotect our own national security.\n\n\n                                 Kosovo\n\n  In Kosovo, the Serbian special police are continuing their terrorist \npolicy that has driven more than 300,000 Kosovo Albanians from their \nhomes and into the forests and mountains. With the onset of the Balkan \nwinter only one month away, a humanitarian catastrophe of enormous \nproportions looms. The West must compel the Serbs to cease military \noperations at once and provide unrestricted access to international aid \norganizations.\n  The Administration must immediately formulate a policy on Kosovo and \npresent it to the Congress so we can be united in strong action to \naddress yet another Balkan tragedy.\n\n\n                         Iraq Sanctions Policy\n\n  Iraq's decision last month to prevent U.N. inspections reminds us of \nthe continuing threat posed by Saddam Hussein to our national interest. \nAt that time, U.N. weapons inspector Scott Ritter resigned his post \nbecause he believed that the U.N. Security Council and the United \nStates were unwilling to use force against Iraq to compel it to \ncooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors.\n  Ritter's resignation has forced both the Administration and Congress \nto decide on a clear Iraq policy: do we rely on the immediate, \nunilateral use of force to back U.N. inspections?\n  Do we seek to maintain consensus on the Security Council before using \nforce? Do we abandon the threat of the use of force and rely on \nsanctions to contain Iraq? These are tough choices, but we need to make \na decision and be prepared to stick with it. And we need to remember \nthat big nations can't bluff.\n\n\n                            The Middle East\n\n  Another test of United States leadership abroad is our continued \nsupport for the delicate peace process in the Middle East. My recent \nvisit to the Middle East has reconfirmed my belief that both the \nIsraeli and Palestinian leadership are committed to the success of the \npeace talks. It is important that Congress support the President's \nintensive efforts to revive a process that has remained stalled for \nmuch too long.\n  Continued drift in the peace process benefits no one but the \nterrorists and extremists.\n\n\n                             India/Pakistan\n\n  Equally critical is our support of the Administration's continued \ndiplomatic efforts to de-escalate the nuclear tensions between India \nand Pakistan. In the wake of their nuclear tests, the President was \nforced by existing sanctions law to impose sweeping economic penalties \nagainst these countries, even though this made resolution of the crisis \nmore difficult.\n  The Senate quickly moved to repeal part of the sanctions law to make \nexceptions for food and other humanitarian supplies. The Senate \nSanctions Task Force, which I co-chair with Senator McConnell, also \nrecommended changes in the existing sanctions regime to give the \nPresident flexibility in negotiating with India and Pakistan.\n  The Senate adopted these changes as an amendment to the Agricultural \nAppropriations bill. We need to complete\n\n[[Page S10583]]\n\naction on this legislation before we adjourn.\n  These are only some of the foreign policy issues we face together, \nthe Congress and our President, in this dangerous world of borderless \nthreats and transnational security challenges.\n  Our foreign policy initiatives could have tragic consequences--as \nwe've seen in the past--if the President, Congress, and the American \npeople fail to forge a common consensus on our foreign policy goals.\n  As I said at the outset, Bill Clinton is President of the United \nStates. The situation requires a bipartisan effort to address these \nissues.\n  We have failed thus far in meeting that responsibility with respect \nto several very specific issues. Working with the President, we must \nact on these issues before we adjourn.\n\n\n                            Embassy funding\n\n  First among these is consideration of emergency embassy security \nlegislation, which the President is expected to submit to the Congress \nthis week. The embassy bombings in East Africa were tragic reminders of \nthe long-term war against terrorism. They were also a reminder that \nmaintaining a strong diplomatic presence around the globe cannot be \ndone on a shoestring budget.\n  I believe the Congress will act quickly on the Administration's \nrequest for emergency funding to rebuild the destroyed embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania and to meet urgent security needs of our other \ndiplomatic facilities around the world. As the world's leading \nsuperpower, we cannot afford to pinch pennies in countering the new \nbreed of international terrorist.\n  Under the leadership of the Chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Helms, and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \nof the Appropriations Committee, I am confident that this issue will be \nacted upon in an expeditious and bipartisan manner.\n  Engaging in a debate about whether Congress or the Executive had \nfailed to provide adequate security funding would distract us from \nworking together in a bipartisan manner to provide the funds needed to \nprotect our people serving abroad.\n\n\n                              IMF Funding\n\n  America's own economic security may also very well depend on \nCongress's ability to provide strong international leadership at this \ncritical time for the international economy. The Asian financial crisis \nhas sent shock waves as far as Russia and Latin America. To protect our \neconomy and to keep the crisis from spreading, Congress must act \nquickly to help replenish its share of the IMF's resources, which now \nhave reached dangerously low levels.\n  But while the Senate has supported full funding for the IMF in a \nstrong bipartisan manner, the House yesterday voted to provide only a \nfraction of our total share of the IMF's emergency funds.\n  With the outcome of the financial crisis still to be determined, \nCongress must act decisively before we adjourn to maintain both the \nfinancial strength of the IMF and to help end the global economic \ncrisis before our own interests are jeopardized.\n\n\n                                  CWC\n\n  In a world beset with many dangers, the threat posed by weapons of \nmass destruction is also among our greatest concerns. Chemical weapons, \namong the world's oldest weapons of mass destruction, are truly \nhorrific--as we learned when Iraq's Saddam Hussein gassed whole \nvillages of his own people.\n  Partly in response to Saddam Hussein, the world has moved to adopt \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, or CWC, to outlaw chemical weapons and \nto verify compliance with the Treaty. In May of last year, the Senate \npassed bi-partisan legislation necessary to implement the Treaty. But \nthe CWC remains in limbo. Why?\n  Because House Republicans failed to act on the Senate's CWC \nImplementation Act for six months, finally choosing to attach it to \nunrelated, vetoed legislation in a political confrontation with the \nPresident. Failure to act has put our country in violation of this \ntreaty leaving us unable to demand compliance by others.\n  If the CWC implementation bill is not passed by the House in the next \nfour weeks, we will continue to be in violation of the CWC Treaty and \nhave to start all over again in a new Congress. It is time for the \nHouse of Representatives to step forward and put the national interest \nabove political considerations.\n\n\n              U.N. Arrears/State Department Reorganization\n\n  The issue of United States arrears to the United Nations is another \nchallenge we have yet to resolve. Chairman Helms and I worked hard to \ncraft a bipartisan plan to pay $926 million in our arrears if the \nUnited Nations agreed to make reforms. Those plans are contained in the \nState Department Conference Report that has yet to be sent to the \nPresident.\n  Unfortunately, our payment to the UN has been weighed down with an \nunrelated, controversial abortion provision. We need to come to grips \nwith this problem before we adjourn. Our arrears are harming our \ninterests at the United Nations, where other countries are raising the \nissue at every opportunity to curtail U.S. influence on other matters.\n  Our failure to resolve serious differences over the Mexico City \nabortion language--or agree to strip it from this conference report--is \nalso holding back additional legislation in the conference report \nauthorizing the reorganization of the U.S. foreign affairs agencies--a \nlong-awaited plan to help the Department streamline its operations to \nincrease our diplomatic effectiveness.\n  We need to take a fresh look at the continuing impasse over this \nconference report. We in the Congress and the President need to set out \na new road map to get these issues signed into law. As I said, we need, \ntogether, to resolve our differences over the Mexico City language or \nstrip it off and fight that issue again next year.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to say a few words about \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations, where I serve as Ranking Minority \nMember.\n  During this Congress the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Helms, and I have worked together to address serious and \ndifficult issues. We have not always agreed, though I am sure many have \nbeen surprised at the large number of issues the Chairman and I have \ncome to agreement on.\n  Overriding all the issues, however, has been a strong commitment, \nequally shared, to our responsibility to discharge our responsibilities \non the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Consequently it is no surprise that the Chairman, immediately upon \nour return in September, initiated plans for the Committee to act on \nover thirty legal assistance treaties and a large number of nominations \nimportant to the conduct of our foreign policy.\n  I applaud the Chairman for his commitment at this time of political \ncrisis.\n  I regret, however, that the Committee has not been able to consider \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year. The Chairman and I \ndisagree on the importance of this treaty and he has indicated a need \nto address other treaties first.\n  Although we will be unable to act before we adjourn, we do need to \nconsider how and when the Senate will be able to take this treaty up \nnext year.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier, our time is short. We must work \ntogether to resolve these outstanding foreign policy issues.\n  Most important is the need for a bipartisan commitment to work with \nour President at this time of crisis, as he leads our country as \nCommander-in-Chief.\n  If ever there was a time for a President to provide leadership, \noverseas and the Congress to rise above a serious domestic political \ncrisis to support the President, now is that time!\n  Mr. President, John F. Kennedy once remarked that ``our domestic \npolicy can defeat us, but our foreign policy can kill us.''\n  He was right, of course. And in the coming weeks, Congress and the \nPresident have the responsibility to step up to the plate and address \nour unfinished foreign policy business--or risk allowing these \nneglected issues to jeopardize our national security interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10582-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10583-S10585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE IMPORTANCE OF IMF FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout our country's ability to lead at this crucial moment for the \ninternational economy.\n\n[[Page S10584]]\n\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives refused to provide the \nresources that the International Monetary Fund needs to deal with the \nmost serious international financial crisis in years. What makes this \nfailure even more inexcusable is that our participation in a stronger \nIMF would not cost American taxpayers a dime.\n  As the President reminded us earlier this week, this is a time when \nwe alone--with the most important economy in the world--are in a \nposition to lead. And two days ago, Treasury Secretary Rubin and \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told us just how dangerous the \ncurrent situation really is.\n  At this critical juncture, those who weaken our standing in key \ninternational financial institutions are playing a reckless game. By \nfailing to provide the $14.5 billion U.S. ``quota'' increase--our share \nin an expanded capital reserve for the IMF--the House has increased the \nthreat to our economy from the current international financial turmoil.\n  This is just the kind of situation that can get out of control if no \none steps in to steer a course through these troubled times. Right now, \nthe Europeans are turned inward, concerned with the next stage in their \neconomic integration--the introduction of a common currency that puts \nstrict limits on its members' budget and interest rate policies.\n  Japan remains in the grip of a political paralysis that has allowed \nits financial problems--centered in a banking system that is crumbling \nfrom the weight of bad loans--to fester for almost a decade.\n  The Tigers of the Asian financial miracle have been declawed, and \nwith their collapse the world has lost a major engine for growth.\n  And our increasingly important trading partners in Latin America are \ncatching their own version of the Asian flu. They face the threat of a \nchain of devaluations, budget crunches, and slower growth.\n  Quite literally, Mr. President, we are in a world of hurt.\n  The robust American economy of recent years--with strong job growth, \nrising incomes, healthy profits, high levels of investment in new \ntechnologies--has been the wonder and the envy of the rest of the \nworld. And the fundamentals here, as Treasury Secretary Rubin and Fed \nChairman Greenspan have stressed, remain strong.\n  But in recent weeks, we have watched as wild swings in our stock \nmarket reveal profound anxiety and uncertainty about the effects of \ninternational events on our own country.\n  Those international events have their ultimate origins in the \nparticular circumstances of many different nations as they have entered \ntoday's global economy. But they have common threads--chief among them, \na trend in those emerging economies toward excessive borrowing from \nother countries, debt denominated in dollars and other strong \ncurrencies. A lot of this international cash flowed into economies \nwhose banking systems lacked fundamental rules for safety, soundness, \nand just plain honest bookkeeping.\n  As those debt burdens reached unsustainable levels for many important \nemerging economies, investors were convinced that assets they held in \nthe currencies of those countries were no longer as valuable, and that \nthose countries were no longer in a position to prop up their \ncurrencies with shrinking reserves of hard currencies. Once that idea \ntook hold, the flight from those currencies was as swift as it was \ninevitable.\n  As the agonizing reappraisal of international lending grew to \nencompass other emerging economies, the currencies of countries as \nwidely dispersed--and as different--as Russia, Venezuela, Brazil, and \nArgentina have come under increasing pressure. In the case of Russia, \nthat pressure has resulted in the virtual collapse of the ruble and the \nevaporation of the nascent Russian stock market.\n  What does this all have to do with us, Mr. President? A lot.\n  First, as these emerging markets lose steam, they buy fewer finished \ngoods from us and from other advanced economies, taking a bite out of \nour export sector, a major component of our recent growth. Facing \nshrinking markets and low-cost competition from the weakened emerging \neconomies, American firms will no longer enjoy the kind of corporate \nearnings--or the kind of stock prices--that until just recently lifted \nWall Street indexes into the stratosphere.\n  Without those profits and those stock values, our companies will not \nbe able to sustain the level of investment that has been a cornerstone \nof our recent booming economy. Ultimately, this must lead to lower job \ngrowth and thinner pay checks. And the decline in our stock market will \naffect many individual investors' willingness to continue the level of \nspending that has been the real backbone of our economy.\n  Another key feature of this global slump is depressed prices for \nbasic commodities like grain and oil. There is no need for me to remind \nmy colleagues here that our farmers now face a serious crisis because \nof the loss of important export markets. I know I hear from my poultry \nfarmers in Delaware, for whom Russia is a key export market, about \ntheir concerns.\n  The latest numbers show that our trade deficit soared by more than 20 \npercent in the second quarter of this year, and its gives every sign of \ngetting worse before it gets better. Some projections show our exports \ndeclining in ways we haven't seen in more than a decade, while we \ncontinue to pull in cheap imports from the weakened economies around \nthe world.\n  We are in the middle of a major global economic transformation, Mr. \nPresident, and there is much we don't know about the workings of the \nevolving system of increased trade and increased international \ninvestment. But we can see from here that international financial \nproblems--particularly foreign exchange crises--have a strong potential \nto spread, and that our economy, for all its fundamental strengths, \nwill be hurt more the longer those problems persist.\n  As we survey the wreckage from this global crisis, and consider the \nvery real potential for deeper trouble, we cannot hesitate to use every \ntool at our disposal to restore confidence to financial markets. The \nInternational Monetary Fund is the institution that we created, along \nwith the other major economies, at the end of World War II to inject a \nmeasure of stability into the management of international currency \nmarkets.\n  Time and events have overtaken the problems for which the IMF was \noriginally created. And while there are important and useful reforms of \nthe IMF included in both House and Senate legislation this session, I \nam concerned that we are demanding too much of the IMF--expanding its \nresponsibilities instead of focusing its energies where they can do the \nmost good--and too little from such forums as the G-7 and others where \nthe major economies of the world should be seeking a sense of common \nconcern and a coordinated response.\n  But that is a topic for another day, Mr. President.\n  Today, we need look no farther than today's front page to see that \nthe need for an international lender of last resort is essential to the \nstability of today's financial markets. Only such a lender can step in \nto keep a country from complete financial and political meltdown when \nprivate investment retreats. Only such a lender can work to limit the \ncontagion of a currency collapse to more and more countries.\n  But the vastly increased size of international financial markets now \ndwarfs the resources of the IMF relative to the problems it confronts.\n  Last year, even before the meltdown in Asia, the IMF--with our \nagreement--concluded that the size and repercussions of foreign \nexchange crises in today's world justify an increase in the basic \nreserves of the IMF, the ``quota'' paid in by each of its 182 members. \nAnd we have also agreed, with the other senior members of the IMF, to \nmake available a larger emergency fund, the New Arrangements to Borrow, \nfor use when the quota funds get too low.\n  Today, with the funds already committed to Asia and Russia, the IMF's \nresources are now dangerously low--so low that they call into question \nits ability to meet the next major run on an emerging economy's \ncurrency. So the rest of the world is looking to us to take the lead in \nproviding those resources to the IMF. Our share of the quota increase \nwould be $14.5 billion;\n\n[[Page S10585]]\n\nour share of the New Arrangements to Borrow would be $3.5 billion.\n  But while we must go through the appropriations process to make those \nfunds available to the IMF, we get in return an interest bearing asset, \nso the overall budget effect is a wash. Let me repeat that--there is no \nbudget outlay involved when we meet our commitment to increase the \ncapacity of the IMF to meet international financial crises.\n  And yet, Mr. President, we face the very real threat that the United \nStates will simply flub this chance to maintain its leadership. With \nthe failure of the House to act on the quota, providing only the $3.5 \nbillion for the New Arrangements to borrow, we leave the rest of the \nworld to wonder about our commitment to deal with the very serious \nproblems that afflict our global economy.\n  Here in the Senate, we have been fortunate to have the benefit of \nreal leadership on the issue of IMF funding. Senator Stevens has made \nuse of two opportunities to put the Senate on record in support of full \nfunding for our participation in the IMF. My colleagues on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Hagel and Senator Sarbanes, have lent \ntheir considerable energies and reputations to this effort.\n  There are few opportunities left in this session for us to put this \nright, Mr. President. The Congress is already seen by the rest of the \nworld as reluctant to take an easy--and, I repeat, costless--step to \nincrease the resources of the one institution we have that is in a \nposition to intervene in this crisis.

The permanent \nRecord will be corrected to include the following:)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Child \nNutrition Reauthorization, but also to express disappointment with the \nmanner in which it is being considered by the Senate. While I support \nthe reauthorization of the federal nutrition and feeding programs, I \nhad hoped for the opportunity to offer an amendment to the bill.\n  The amendment I had hoped to offer would enable the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture to purchase lower-priced, non-quota peanuts \nfor use in school feeding programs. Adoption of this amendment would \nmake school feeding programs more cost effective and free up funds to \nbuy additional peanuts and other foods for both the school lunch \nprogram and other federal food assistance programs. The amendment would \nsave $14 million for the federal nutrition programs, money that could \nbe put to use feeding more children and families.\n  I want to offer an explanation for why the amendment will not be \nconsidered and also to express my appreciation to those who were \nprepared to support it. Several Senators were ready to debate the \nmerits of the amendment, and I appreciate their support. Other \nsupporters include nutrition advocacy groups who have worked very hard \non behalf of the amendment.\n  After our return from the August break, the Senate tried to clear \nthis bill for action. Several Senators executed holds on the bill as a \nresult of the amendment I intended to offer. Given the inability to \nremove those holds and given the few days that remain in the \nlegislative calendar, I asked my Agriculture Committee Chairman, \nSenator Lugar, to proceed with the bill so that he may get it to \nconference and hopefully enacted before adjournment in October.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues who know my longstanding opposition \nto the peanut program, let me make clear that my amendment would have \ndone nothing to improve the price of peanuts for manufacturers of \npeanut products. Instead, it simply aimed to improve the operation of \nthe school nutrition programs.\n  Generally speaking, peanuts cannot be grown and sold for human \nconsumption in the United States unless the grower has a quota. This \nquota is really a license, and it enables growers to obtain a premium \nprice for their production. Non-quota peanuts grown in America are no \ndifferent than their quota cousins, except for the price. Non-quota \npeanuts that are grown in the U.S. for the export market have an \napproximate price of $350 per ton, whereas quota peanuts run as much as \n$650 per ton.\n  My amendment would simply allow the United States government to buy \nnon-quota peanuts at the same price that we sell American peanuts to \nforeign countries.\n  This step is not without precedent. In fact, the Northeast Interstate \nDairy Compact, which Congress authorized in 1996, has a similar \nprovision to allow schools to be exempt from paying the artificially \nhigher milk prices that are the result of the dairy compact.\n  Additionally, Congress has weighed this step in the past. The House \nCommittee on Appropriations twice called attention to this problem in \nFY 1994 and FY 1995 Agriculture Appropriation Subcommittee Reports. The \nSubcommittee found that USDA would save approximately $14.4 million in \npeanut and peanut product purchases for the food assistance program if \nUSDA purchased non-quota peanuts.\n\n  In these two committee reports for the FY 1994 and FY 1995 \nAgriculture Appropriations' bills, the Committee directed the USDA to \nprepare and submit legislation to the appropriations committees of \nCongress to amend the peanut program. That legislation would require \nUSDA to purchase non-quota peanuts at world prices for use in domestic \nfeeding programs. To this point, I am not aware that the USDA has ever \nresponded to the Committee's direction.\n  Mr. President, passage of this amendment makes sense. Peanut products \nare an extremely popular and nutritious food for millions of people, \nespecially children. High concentrations of important minerals and \nvaluable nutrients make this food an especially important one. If we \nprovide a means for the federal government to buy peanuts for American \nschool children for the same price that we sell American peanuts to \nconsumers in other countries, we can save millions of dollars and \nenable the government to purchase nutritious food to help additional \npeople.\n  Moreover, we can improve the school nutrition programs with a minimal \ncost to growers. Despite the suggestion of doom and gloom from the \ndefenders of the peanut program, the amount of quota peanuts purchased \nfor government food assistance programs is less than 2 percent of the \nnational peanut quota production. Thus, this amendment would have a \nnegligible effect on peanut quota holders--many of whom, I hasten to \nadd, do not grow peanuts themselves.\n  Mr. President, federal feeding programs are very price sensitive. In \ntimes of high prices for specific commodities,\n\n[[Page S10586]]\n\nit is not uncommon for USDA to seek substitutes for even the most \npopular food items. in the early 1990s, for example, USDA temporarily \nsuspended feeding program purchases of peanut butter because peanut \nprices had risen sharply. If the primary goal of the National School \nLunch Program and food assistance programs is to alleviate this \nnation's malnutrition and hunger, it is wrong for the federal \ngovernment to waste limited financial resources on buying quota peanuts \nto further support a small special interest group of peanut quota \nholders who are already subsidized by the American consumer.\n  Again, Mr. President, I support passage of the child nutrition \nreauthorization, but am disappointed in not being able to offer my \namendment. I thank those that have worked so hard on its behalf. While \nthe opportunity is not available today to offer the amendment, I have \nevery intention of offering this proposal to relevant legislation in \nthe future.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2286, the \nChild Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Amendments of 1998. The child \nnutrition programs have been critically important in helping meet the \nnutritional needs of our children. The bill before us, which was \nunanimously reported out of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, is a bipartisan effort to reauthorize and \nimprove these successful programs. Nutrition programs in the Congress \nhave a long history of bipartisan support and cooperation and I am \npleased to report that this bill is no exception.\n  As an Indianapolis school board member and the city's mayor in the \n1960's and 1970's, I saw firsthand the need to provide nutritional \nassistance to children. Since that time, the child nutrition programs \nhave changed in many ways. Although the programs may need some fine \ntuning, today's programs have been successful in ensuring that our \nnation's children have access to nutritious foods, providing a critical \nnutrition safety net.\n  In 1997, approximately 89,000 schools enrolling 46 million children \nparticipated in the National School Lunch program. Although \nparticipation in the school breakfast program is not as large as that \nin the school lunch program, it has continued to grow. Since 1994, \nschool breakfast participation has increased about 13 percent so that \nnow over 70 percent of schools operating a school lunch program also \noperate a school breakfast program.\n  The WIC program, which provides nutritious foods and other support to \nlower-income infants and children (up to age 5), and pregnant, \npostpartum, and breast-feeding women, has been successful at reducing \nthe number of low-birth-weight babies. Its success has led to strong \nsupport over the years. In 1997, average monthly WIC participation was \n7.4 million persons. In many states, the program has reached the long \nsought after goal of full funding.\n  The bill before us makes improvements to the child nutrition \nprograms. Recently we have seen reports on fraud and abuse in the WIC \nand Child and Adult Care Food Programs. S. 2286 strengthens the anti-\nfraud provisions in both programs. The bill requires WIC recipients to \nbe physically present when being certified or recertified for the \nprogram. The bill also requires that recipients provide documentation \nof their income to prove that they are in fact eligible to participate \nin the program. The legislation cracks down on fraudulent vendors \nparticipating in the WIC program. Under most circumstances, WIC vendors \nwho are convicted of trafficking will be permanently disqualified \nunless it can be proven that the disqualification will cause undue \nhardship for WIC recipients. In the Child and Adult Care Food Program, \nState agencies will be required to visit child care sites prior to \napproving participation by a provider.\n  The bill also makes amendments to streamline school food service \noperations. Specifically, S. 2286 allows schools to operate after-\nschool snack programs through the National School Lunch Program rather \nthan separately through the Child and Adult Care Food Program. Without \nthis change, those schools choosing to operate an after-school program, \nalong with the school lunch program, would have to submit paperwork for \ntwo separate programs. Streamlining these operations will free up \nprecious time so that school food service personnel can better serve \nour nation's children. The bill also improves access, for low-income \nchildren up to age 18, to the after-school snack and the summer food \nservice programs.\n  The bill creates a new universal school breakfast pilot program that \nwill evaluate the effect of providing free breakfasts to elementary \nschool children, regardless of income, on school performance and \ndietary intake. The new spending in this bill is fully offset by \nrounding down reimbursement rates to the nearest whole cent for meals \nserved by schools and child care centers.\n  Finally, the bill reauthorizes the child nutrition programs through \nfiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. President, S. 2286 was unanimously reported out of the Senate \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on June 25, 1998. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill, thus ensuring that our \nnation's children continue to have access to these important programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10585-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated by \nMr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10586-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry was discharged \nfrom further consideration of the following measure which was referred \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:\n\n       S. 2402.

A bill to ban certain abortions; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             the late-term abortion limitation act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today the Senate is beginning \nconsideration of a very controversial and contentious issue, the veto \noverride of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.\n  I will vote to sustain the President's veto of this bill, which I \nbelieve is seriously flawed. But to make my position clear and state in \npositive terms what I believe we should do to address this troubling \nissue, I am introducing legislation today known as the Late-Term \nAbortion Limitation Act of 1998.\n  I am pleased to have a bipartisan group of Senators as original \ncosponsors of this legislation, including Senators Snowe, Collins, \nTorricelli, Mikulski, Graham, Landrieu, and Lieberman.\n  We believe that post-viability abortions should be allowed in only \ntwo types of situations--when the life of the mother is in danger or \nwhen she faces a medically certified risk of grievous physical injury.\n  Senators Daschle and Snowe put forward a measure last year that \nreflected this principle. I support them, and our legislation builds on \nwhat they did.\n  Our bill has one significant difference from the Daschle proposal, an \naddition that we believe enhances the Daschle amendment. Our \nlegislation would require a second non-treating doctor's certification \nthat the abortion is medically necessary to protect the life of the \nmother or prevent grievous physical injury. This second certification \ncould be waived only in the case of a medical emergency, and the \nphysician would have to document the nature of the medical emergency.\n  We believe this approach is one that can be passed in the United \nStates Senate. It is backed by a substantial and bipartisan group of \nSenators. It is a compromise approach that can bring to a reasonable \nconclusion the long-running debate over late-term abortion procedures. \nI urge my colleagues to read the language closely and give it careful \nconsideration as a good faith effort to resolve this troubling issue in \na fair and humane manner.\n  Unlike the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, this legislation would \nactually reduce the number of late-term abortions because, instead of \nbanning only one procedure, the measure would ban all post-viability \nabortions except when a continuation of the pregnancy risks grievous \nphysical injury to the mother or poses a threat to her life.\n  At the same time, the legislation holds to the Roe versus Wade \nstandard which makes a clear distinction between abortions occurring \nbefore and after viability. Unlike the partial birth abortion ban, our \nbill preserves this important distinction and is thus more likely to \npass court scrutiny. Before viability, a decision to have an abortion \nmust be made by a woman, her doctor, her family, and her conscience. \nBut in the closing weeks of a pregnancy, the court affirms a role for \naddressing the public concern about late-term abortions and makes it \nclear that the State can draw the line limiting abortions to the most \nserious circumstances.\n  I hope the legislation we are introducing today can help us resolve \nthis debate once and for all, in a manner that is consistent with our \nlaws and the views of most of the American people.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and the text of \nthe measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2297\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Grievous \n     injury is defined, as in last year's Daschle-Snowe \n     alternative to the partial-birth abortion ban bill, as (1) a \n     severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically \n     caused by the pregnancy of (2) an inability to provide \n     necessary treatment for a life-threatening condition, and is \n     limited to conditions for which termination of the pregnancy \n     is medically indicated. The certification requirements could \n     be waived in a medical emergency, but the physician would \n     subsequently have to certify in writing what specific medical \n     condition formed the basis for determining that a medical \n     emergency existed.\n       This legislation provides a more effective and \n     constitutional approach to this difficult issue than the \n     partial-birth abortion ban:\n       This legislation will actually reduce the number of late-\n     term abortions. In contrast, the partial-birth abortion ban \n     will not stop a single abortion at any stage of gestation. \n     The partial-birth abortion ban, by prohibiting only one \n     particular procedure, will merely induce physicians to switch \n     to a different procedure that is not banned. The Late-Term \n     Abortion Limitation Act will stop abortions by any method \n     after a fetus is viable, except when medical necessity \n     indicates otherwise.\n       This legislation fits clearly within the constitutional \n     parameters set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court for government \n     restriction of abortion. In contrast, the partial-birth \n     abortion ban, by prohibiting certain types of abortions \n     before viability, breaches the court's standard that the \n     government does not have a compelling interest in restricting \n     abortions prior to viability.\n       This legislation retains the abortion option for mothers \n     facing extraordinary medical conditions such as breast \n     cancer, preeclampsia, uterine rupture, or non-Hodgkin's \n     lymphoma, for which termination of the pregnancy may be \n     recommended by the woman's physician due to the risk of \n     grievous injury to the mother's physical health or life. In \n     contrast, the partial-birth abortion ban provides no such \n     exception to protect the mother from grievous injury to her \n     physical health.\n       At the same time, by clearly limiting the medical \n     circumstances where post-viability abortions are permitted, \n     this legislation protects fetal life in cases where the \n     mother's health is not at such high risk.\n       The Late-Term Abortion Limitation Act is similar to the \n     legislation proposed by Senators Daschle, Snowe, and others \n     last year as an alternative to the partial-birth abortion ban \n     bill, with one significant change:\n       The legislation requires a second doctor to certify the \n     medical need for a post-viability abortion, to ensure that \n     post-viability abortions take place only when continuing the \n     pregnancy would prevent the woman from receiving treatment \n     for a life-threatening condition related to her physical \n     health or would cause a severely debilitating disease or \n     impairment to her physical health.\n       Enforcement of the legislation is identical to the \n     enforcement mechanism in the Daschle-Snowe alternative. The \n     Justice Department could initiate a civil action against a \n     physician who knowingly violated this law, with penalties of \n     up to $100,000 and/or loss of medical license (up to $250,000 \n     and/or loss of medical license for repeat offenses).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining with my \ncolleagues, Senators Durbin and Snowe, in introducing this bill to ban \nall late-term abortions, including partial birth abortions, that are \nnot necessary to save the mother's life or to protect her from grievous \nphysical harm.\n\n[[Page S10590]]\n\n  Let me be clear from the outset. I am strongly opposed to all late-\nterm abortions, including partial birth abortions. I agree that they \nshould be banned. However, I believe that an exception must be made for \nthose rare cases when it is necessary to save the life of the mother or \nto protect her from grievous physical harm. Fortunately, these \nprocedures are extremely rare in my State, where there were just two \nlate-term abortions between 1984 and 1996.\n  We believe that this debate should not be about one particular method \nof abortion, but rather about the larger question of under what \ncircumstances should late-term, or post-viability, abortions be legally \navailable. We believe that all late-term abortions--regardless of the \nprocedure used--should be banned, except in those rare cases where the \nlife or the physical health of the mother is at serious risk.\n  In my view, Congress is ill-equipped to make judgments on specific \nmedical procedures. As the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists--which represents over 90 percent of ob-gyns and which \nopposes the partial birth abortion ban--has said, ``the intervention of \nlegislative bodies into medical decision-making is inappropriate, ill \nadvised, and dangerous.'' Most politicians have neither the training \nnor the experience to decide which procedure is most appropriate in a \ngiven case. These medically difficult and highly personal decisions \nshould be left for families to make in consultation with their doctors.\n  The Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, has identified ``viability''--the \npoint at which the fetus is capable of sustaining life outside the womb \nwith or without support--as the defining point in determining the \nconstitutionality of restrictions on abortion. While I don't believe \nthat it is appropriate for us to dictate medical practice, I do believe \nthat it is appropriate for Congress to determine the circumstances \nunder which access to late-term abortions--by any procedure--should be \nrestricted.\n  That is what the legislation we are introducing today would do. Our \nbill goes beyond the partial birth abortion ban, which simply prohibits \na specific medical procedure and will not prevent a single abortion. \nLet me emphasize that point. The partial birth legislation would not \nprevent a single late-term abortion. A physician could simply use \nanother, perhaps more dangerous method to end the pregnancy.\n  By contrast, our bill would prohibit the abortion of any viable \nfetus, by any method, unless that abortion is necessary to preserve the \nlife of the mother or to prevent ``grievous injury'' to her physical \nhealth. We have taken great care to tightly limit the health exception \nin this bill to ``grievous injury'' to the mother's physical health. It \nwould not allow late-term abortions to be performed simply because the \nwoman is depressed or feeling stressed or has a minor health problem \nbecause of the pregnancy.\n  ``Grievous injury'' is narrowly and strictly defined by our bill as \neither a ``severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically \ncaused by the\npregnancy,'' or ``an inability to provide necessary treatment for a \nlife-threatening condition.'' Moreover, ``grievous injury'' does not \ninclude any condition that is not medically diagnosable or any \ncondition for which termination of the pregnancy is not medically \nindicated.\n  This bill includes an additional safeguard. The initial opinion of \nthe treating physician that the continuation of the pregnancy would \nthreaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical \nhealth must be confirmed by a ``second opinion.'' This second opinion \nmust come from an independent physician who will not be involved in the \nabortion procedure and who has not been involved in the treatment of \nthe mother. This second physician must also certify--in writing--that, \nin his or her medical judgment, the continuation of the pregnancy would \nthreaten the mother's life or risk grievous injury to her physical \nhealth.\n  What we are talking about are the severe, medically diagnosable \nthreats to a woman's physical health that are sometimes brought on or \naggravated by pregnancy.\n  Let me give you a few examples: primary pulmonary hypertension, which \ncan cause sudden death or intractable congestive heart failure; severe \npregnancy-aggravated hypertension with accompanying kidney or liver \nfailure; complications from aggravated diabetes such as amputation or \nblindness; or an inability to treat aggressive cancers such as \nleukemia, breast cancer, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n  These are all obstetric conditions that are cited in the medical \nliterature as possible indications for pregnancy terminations. In these \nextremely rare cases--where the mother has been certified by two \nphysicians to be at risk of losing her life or suffering grievous \nphysical harm--I believe that we should leave the very difficult \ndecisions about what should be done to the best judgment of the women, \nfamilies and physicians involved.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is a fair and \ncompassionate compromise on this extremely difficult issue. It would \nensure that all late-term abortions--including partial birth \nabortions--are strictly limited to those rare and tragic cases where \nthe life or the physical health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, \nand I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it. This legislation \npresents an unusual opportunity for both ``pro-choice'' and ``pro-\nlife'' advocates to work together on a reasonable approach.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a recent editorial from the Bangor \nDaily News endorsing our approach be included in the Congressional \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Bangor Daily News, Sept. 11, 1998]\n\n                             Abortion Vote\n\n       Back when the subject of abortion was debated on moral and \n     religious grounds, opponents could disagree while \n     understanding how each arrived at a position. Now that \n     abortion is a vehicle for fund raising there is no room for \n     understanding because understanding doesn't bring in the \n     bucks or whip up the membership.\n       With the Senate's vote next week on late-term abortion, the \n     Christian Coalition, according to The Washington Post, has \n     directed at five senators radio advertisements, 300,000 \n     postcards and countless automated telephone calls. Two of the \n     five senators are Maine's Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins. \n     The purpose of this extensive campaign is to harass these \n     senators into dropping their support for a compromise measure \n     that allowed late-term abortions to protect against \n     ``grievous injury'' to the physical health of the mother.\n       But the vote is more about power than pregnancy--Maine had \n     only two third-term abortions between 1984 and 1996, \n     consistent with other states. If abortions were the primary \n     concern, the coalition could with one magazine ad extolling \n     the effectiveness of condoms do more to reduce unwanted \n     pregnancies than this entire Senate campaign. As a bonus, the \n     condom ad might also help reduce sexually transmitted \n     diseases.\n       The coalition's main goal is to remain relevant now that \n     its best-known leader, Ralph Reed, has moved on. The group \n     has two themes, abortion and gay rights, and even Mr. Reed \n     says gay rights is a sure loser. That leaves the coalition \n     trying to override a presidential veto of a ban on so-called \n     partial-birth abortions, but its lack of sincerity is evident \n     in its refusal to accept an exemption for the physical health \n     of the mother.\n       Assuming for a moment that telling doctors what procedures \n     they may use to perform an abortion is constitutionally \n     legal--and the court's 1976 Danforth decision says it isn't--\n     this compromise should be seen as a fair way for opponents to \n     agree. The grievous injury provision is not the large \n     loophole that the coalition claims. It is narrowly defined to \n     cover either a ``severely debilitating disease or impairment \n     specifically caused by the pregnancy'' or an ``inability to \n     provide necessary treatment for a life-threatening \n     condition.'' It does not include any condition that is not \n     medically diagnosable or any condition that can be treated \n     without ending a pregnancy.\n       The grievous injury exemption would allow treatment for \n     such illnesses as leukemia or non-Hodgkins lymphoma, primary \n     pulmonary hypertension, which can cause sudden death or \n     congestive heart failure, and pregnancy-aggravated \n     hypertension, which can cause kidney or liver failure.\n       Instead of recognizing the humanity in allowing for \n     abortions under the threat of these illnesses, the coalition \n     continues to demand an end to the partial-birth procedure, \n     with an exemption only for the near-certain death of the \n     mother. Banning a procedure, of course, doesn't reduce the \n     number of abortions; it forces physicians to use riskier \n     procedures.\n       Sens. Snowe and Collins have supported a fair and \n     compassionate compromise in the extremely difficult issue of \n     abortion. They deserve support from constituents who \n     recognize the coalition's agenda as having little to do with \n     unwanted pregnancies and everything to do with power.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 2498. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe tax\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\ntreatment of agricultural cooperatives and to allow declaratory \njudgment relief for such cooperatives; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2501. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exempt \nsmall issue bonds for agriculture from the State volume cap; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                      Agricultural Tax Legislation\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we introduce two bills that \nwill help farmers. These bills take another step in insuring the \nviability of family farming into the next century.\n  This first bill clarifies the laws regarding both Section 521 and \nSubchapter T agricultural cooperatives. Recent action by the Internal \nRevenue Service hinders farmers' attempts to form value-added \ncooperatives and to use these cooperatives as a source of income and \nstability. Specifically, the IRS changed its position of allowing \ncooperatives, in connection with their marketing functions, to \nmanufacture or otherwise change the basic form of their members' \nproducts without jeopardizing the cooperatives' status.\n  Farmers value-added cooperatives were designed to encourage farmers \nto own the businesses that process their products, and to give them the \nbenefit of the finished product. These cooperatives help create new \nproducts that benefit farmers. The IRS is choosing to differentiate \nbetween using a machine process and using a biological process to \nmanufacture the finished product. There should be no difference--there \nisn't for business, there isn't for farmers, so there shouldn't be for \nthe IRS.\n  The second bill that we are introducing today will take Aggie bonds \nout from under the private activity bond cap. Aggie bonds are an \nimportant tool for first time farmers. Removing them from the existing \ncap will greatly enhance the opportunities for beginning and less \nestablished farmers and ranchers to acquire affordable, low cost credit \nfor agricultural purchases. Most industrial revenue bonds are typically \nissued for millions of dollars, underwritten, rated and sold to \ninvestors. Aggie bonds, which cannot exceed $250,000, are not \nunderwritten, are not rated, and are not sold to investors. Rather, \nthey are sold to local lenders who finance beginning farmers with a \nlower than normal interest rate. Several states would like to start \noffering Aggie bonds but cannot because their volume cap is already \nused for non-agricultural projects. Many other states, including my \nstate of Iowa, cannot meet the demand for Aggie bonds.\n  These are two bills that will help farmers now, and always. These \noffer immediate help, and are part of the tax code restructuring that \nwe must enact to make the playing field fair to America's farmers. I \nwant to thank Senator Moseley-Braun for working with me on these \nimportant pieces of legislation.\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \ntwo bills today with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley, that will benefit farmers in rural America.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, farmer-owned cooperatives play a major \nrole in providing food and fiber to consumers. These cooperatives also \nprovide their farmer-owners with additional market stability and help \nto strengthen farm income.\n  Current tax law states that farmers, fruit growers, or ``like \nassociations'' that are organized and operated on a cooperative basis \nfor the purpose of marketing the products of its members or other \nproducers shall be exempt from federal income tax if those cooperatives \nare developed for the purpose of marketing the products of the members \nor other producers, and turning back to the members proceeds of the \nsales, less marketing expenses.\n  Farmers nationwide are joining together in self-help efforts to \ndevelop cooperatives and to develop new uses for the commodities that \nthey grow, but recently the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that \nin certain instances, some forms of value-added farmer-owned \ncooperatives are not tax exempt. The Grassley/Moseley-Braun bill would \noverturn that IRS ruling and amend the current section of the tax code \nto explicitly cover these types of cooperatives.\n  Another concern that farmers have shared with me is the future of \nagriculture and the ability of their children and other beginning \nfarmers to enter into farming as a way of life. I have worked in the \nSenate to change federal policies that will lower the obstacles for \nyounger farmers who enter into farming as a profession.\n  One such program is the ``Aggie Bonds'' program. In the 103rd \nCongress, I cosponsored the law that granted a permanent tax exemption \nfor these bonds. I also worked to include provisions in the Small \nBusiness Tax Relief Act of 1996 to widen eligibility for the bonds, \nincreasing the amount of land a beginning farmer may own to qualify for \nthe loan.\n  Today my Iowa colleague and I introduce a bill that further improves \nthis successful program by exempting aggie bonds from the volume cap on \nindustrial revenue bonds. Currently, Federal law allows states to issue \ntax exempt industrial revenue bonds that are earmarked for purchases of \nfarmland, equipment, breeding livestock, as well as farm improvements \nby new or beginning farmers. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) also has \nauthorized State chartered, non-profit corporations to make guaranteed \nmortgage and farm operating loans. Unfortunately, the aggie bond \nprogram and the FSA guaranteed farm mortgage programs have size limits \nof $250,000 and $300,000 respectively.\n  Given the rise in property costs, these limits fail to provide \nmeaningful funds for small farm purchase or often time prevent certain \nclasses of farmers from obtaining credit. In addition, aggie bonds are \nsubject to statewide ``caps'' applicable to both small farmers and \nestablished users.\n  Most industrial revenue bonds are typically issued for million of \ndollars, underwritten, rated and sold to investors. Aggie bonds, which \ncannot exceed $250,000, are not underwritten, are not rated, and are \nnot sold to investors; they are sold to local lenders who finance \nbeginning farmers with a lower than normal interest rate. Most of the \nprivate-activity bond volume is used by large corporations for \nmanufacturing or for multi-family housing. Aggie bonds are used by \nbeginning farmers and ranchers.\n\n  Several states, such as Illinois, has discovered that the volume cap \nis already used up by non-agricultural projects, and many states cannot \nmeet the demand for Aggie Bonds.\n  Exempting Aggie Bonds from the volume cap would greatly enhance the \nopportunities for young or beginning, less established farmers and \nranchers to acquire affordable, low cost credit for agricultural \npurchases such as land, livestock, machinery, and farm improvements. \nThe Moseley-Braun/Grassley bill exempts aggie bonds from the volume \ncap.\n  These two bills will help farmers in Illinois, Iowa, and all of rural \nAmerica. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting these bills \nand I urge their swift passage in the United States Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GLENN:\n  S. 2499. A bill to provide for a transition to market-based rates for \npower sold by the Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the \nTennessee Valley Authority, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               Power Marketing Administrations Reform Act\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Power \nMarketing Administration Reform Act, a bill that will require the Power \nMarketing Administrations, or PMAs, to sell power at market rates. The \nTennessee Valley Authority, or TVA, will also be included in the bill's \nrequirements. My bill is a companion to H.R. 3518, introduced by \nRepresentatives Bob Franks (R-NJ) and Marty Meehan (D-MA) in the House.\n  PMAs have failed to recover their operating costs for too long. My \ncolleagues in the Senate are well aware of my activities to rectify \nthis discrepancy that has brought about a fiscal shortfall and \nsignificant environmental damage. I have been joined by many in this \nChamber in requesting reports from the Government Accounting Office, \nthe Congressional Budget Office, and the Inspector General of the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, the federal department that oversees the \noperation of the PMAs. All of the reports on the\n\n[[Page S10592]]\n\nPMAs and the TVA have indicated severe financial problems.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, in a report released in \nMarch, 1997, selling PMA electricity at market rates rather than at the \ncurrently subsidized rates will raise approximately $200 million per \nyear, money that will be returned to the U.S. Treasury. Later in 1997, \nCBO concluded that eliminating this costly subsidy would complement \nsteps already taken by Congress to deregulate energy markets and to \nreduce government interference in market operations.\n  When the PMAs were established during Franklin Roosevelt's \nadministration, they served a useful and necessary purpose. Jobs were \ncreated for a nation that was struggling out of a horrible depression. \nAreas that could not afford the cost of purchasing power lines and \ngenerators for their residents were provided electricity at below \nmarket rates. At that time, below market sales were a good idea that \nallowed many more Americans than could afford electricity to enjoy its \nbenefits. CBO concludes that over the past sixty years, many of the \nconcerns that brought about the federal government's role in supplying \npower have diminished greatly. Nearly 60% of federal sales go to just \nfour states: Tennessee, Alabama, Washington, and Oregon. In fact, \nnonfederal dams produced an average of 20% more electricity per unit of \ncapacity than did dams supplying the PMAs.\n  According to a General Accounting Office report entitled, ``Federal \nElectricity Activities,'' released in October, 1997, in fiscal 1996, \nBonneville, the three other PMAs, and the Rural Utilities Service cost \nthe American taxpayer $2.5 billion. In the four year period from 1992 \nto 1996, the government's net costs were $8.6 billion. In March, 1998, \nthe GAO released an additional study entitled, ``Federal Power: Options \nfor Selected Power Marketing Administrations' Role in a Changing \nElectricity Industry.'' Among the conclusions in this report were that \nfor that same four year period from 1992-1996, the federal government \nincurred a net cost of $1.5 billion from its involvement in the \nelectricity-related activities of Southeastern, Southwestern, and \nWestern. Up to $1.4 billion of nearly $7.2 billion of the federal \ninvestment in assets derived from these activities is at some risk of \nnonrecovery.\n  As for fairness in lending, the GAO found that the interest paid by \nthe PMAs on their outstanding debt (3.5%) is often substantially below \nthe rate that the U.S. Treasury incurred while providing funding to the \nPMAs (9%), resulting in a shortfall on interest alone of 5.5%. And \nrates charged by these PMAs were 40% or more below market rates.\n  Mr. President, it is important to note that my bill does not close \nthe PMAs or the TVA. Rather, it helps them to transition to a market-\nbased operation whereby the vast majority of consumers who do not \nbenefit from PMA below-cost power sales will no longer be penalized so \nthat a few large power companies can purchase cheap, bulk power. My \nbill will provide for full cost recovery rates for power sold by the \nPMAs and the TVA. To accomplish this goal, PMA and TVA rates will be \nrecalculated and resubmitted to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) for approval.\n  In addition, the bill requires that PMA and TVA transmission \nfacilities are subject to open-access regulation by the FERC, and that \nregulation will be strengthened by authorizing FERC to revise such \nrates. Cooperatives and public power entities will be given the right \nof first refusal of PMA and TVA power at market prices. Revenue accrued \nfrom the revisal of these rates will go first to the U.S. Treasury to \ncover all costs. The residual amount will then be disbursed by formula \nto the Treasury to mitigate damage to fish and wildlife and other \nenvironmental damage attributed to the operation of PMAs and the TVA, \nand to support renewable electricity generating resources.\n  Mr. President, these figures speak for themselves. In an era where \nthe Congress has taken great strides toward eliminating the \ngovernment's involvement in private industry, the PMAs are a white \nelephant. Sixty years after its inception, public power is less \nexpensive, more accessible, and more widely available than ever before. \nThere is no reason for the government to continue this wasteful subsidy \nto the fiscal detriment of the American people and the U.S. Treasury. I \nurge my colleagues to join me and my colleagues, Senators Moynihan and \nReed of Rhode Island, in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Power Marketing \n     Administration Reform Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the use of fixed allocations of joint multipurpose \n     project costs and the failure to provide for the recovery of \n     actual interest costs and depreciation have resulted in--\n       (A) substantial failures to recover costs properly \n     recoverable through power rates by the Federal Power \n     Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority; \n     and\n       (B) the imposition of unreasonable burdens on the taxpaying \n     public;\n       (2) existing underallocations and underrecovery of costs \n     have led to inefficiencies in the marketing of Federally \n     generated electric power and to environmental damage; and\n       (3) with the emergence of open access to power transmission \n     and competitive bulk power markets, market prices will \n     provide the lowest reasonable rates consistent with--\n       (A) sound business principles;\n       (B) maximum recovery of costs properly allocated to power \n     production; and\n       (C) encouraging the most widespread use of power marketed \n     by the Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to provide \n     for--\n       (1) full cost recovery rates for power sold by the Federal \n     Power Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority; and\n       (2) a transition to market-based rates for the power.\n\n     SEC. 3. SALE OR DISPOSITION OF FEDERAL POWER BY FEDERAL POWER \n                   MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS AND THE TENNESSEE \n                   VALLEY AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Accounting.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Energy, in consultation with the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall develop and \n     implement procedures to ensure that the Federal Power \n     Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority \n     use the same accounting principles and requirements \n     (including the accounting principles and requirements with \n     respect to the accrual of actual interest costs during \n     construction and pending repayment for any project and \n     recognition of depreciation expenses) as are applied by the \n     Commission to the electric operations of public utilities.\n       (b) Development and Submission of Rates to the \n     Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act and periodically thereafter but not less frequently \n     than once every 5 years, each Federal Power Marketing \n     Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority shall \n     submit to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a \n     description of proposed rates for the sale or disposition of \n     Federal power that will ensure the recovery of all costs \n     incurred by the Federal Power Marketing Administration or the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority, respectively, for the generation \n     and marketing of the Federal power.\n       (2) Costs to be recovered.--The costs to be recovered under \n     paragraph (1)--\n       (A) shall include all fish and wildlife expenditures \n     required under treaty and legal obligations associated with \n     the construction and operation of the facilities from which \n     the Federal power is generated and sold; and\n       (B) shall not include any cost of transmitting the Federal \n     power.\n       (c) Commission Review, Approval, or Modification.--\n       (1) In general.--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     shall review and either approve or modify rates for the sale \n     or disposition of Federal power submitted to the Commission \n     by each Federal Power Marketing Administration and the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority under this section, in a manner \n     that ensures that the rates will recover all costs described \n     in subsection (b)(2).\n       (2) Basis for review.--The review by the Commission under \n     paragraph (1) shall be based on the record of proceedings \n     before the Federal Power Marketing Administration or the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority, except that the Commission shall \n     afford all affected persons an opportunity for an additional \n     hearing in accordance with the procedures established for \n     ratemaking by the Commission under the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 791a et seq.).\n       (d) Application of Rates.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning on the date of approval or \n     modification by the Commission of rates under this section, \n     each Federal\n\n[[Page S10593]]\n\n     Power Marketing Administration and the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority shall apply the rates, as approved or modified by \n     the Commission, to each existing contract for the sale or \n     disposition of Federal power by the Federal Power Marketing \n     Administration or the Tennessee Valley Authority to the \n     maximum extent permitted by the contract.\n       (2) Applicability.--This section shall cease to apply to a \n     Federal Power Marketing Administration or the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority as of the date of termination of all \n     commitments under any contract for the sale or disposition of \n     Federal power that were in existence as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Accounting Principles and Requirements.--In developing \n     or reviewing the rates required by this section, the Federal \n     Power Marketing Administrations, the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority, and the Commission shall rely on the accounting \n     principles and requirements developed under subsection (a).\n       (f) Interim Rates.--Until market pricing for the sale or \n     disposition of Federal power by a Federal Power Marketing \n     Administration or the Tennessee Valley Authority is fully \n     implemented, the full cost recovery rates required by this \n     section shall apply to--\n       (1) a new contract entered into after the date of enactment \n     of this Act for the sale of power by a Federal Power \n     Marketing Administrator or the Tennessee Valley Authority;

A bill to protect the sanctity of contracts and leases \nentered into by surface patent holders with respect to coalbed methane \ngas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         Coalbed Methane Patent Holders Protection Legislation\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues, Senator \nCraig Thomas of Wyoming, and Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, to \nintroduce a very important bill for our western States and for others \nthat have a lot of federally-owned coal. We have been working with \nother members, members of the Energy Committee, and with the Department \nof Interior to put together a good consensus bill.\n  On July 20, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a final en banc \ndecision, ruled that methane gas produced out of coal seams is part of \nthe coal itself, and not actually a gas. That means instead of \nbelonging to the owner of the oil and gas, as it has for the past 80 \nyears, it may now belong to the owner of the coal. In Wyoming, the \nowner of the oil and gas is often different from the owner of the \ncoal--which in most cases is the Federal Government.\n  What does that mean? In my home county, the Federal Government owns \nonly about 55% of the oil and gas, but it owns 95% of the coal. That \nmeans, in many places where these two resources occur together, there \nare separate owners. This decision is poised to strip away a majority \nof the private ownership of gas in Campbell County. It could be an \nimmediate transfer of $250 million over thirty years from private \nowners to the government--a loss of income and economic activity that \nwill destroy the economy in my home town.\n  The effects will be widespread because this decision would overturn a \ndecades-old U.S. Government policy. This Interior policy has acted as \nthe basis for thousands of gas contracts across the west. People have \nbeen using since 1981 to govern the development of their contracts and \nleases. Today, the Circuit Court's decision places all of those \ncontracts in legal limbo. That limbo threatens the livelihood of entire \nregions in the States like Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and New Mexico.\n\n\n                      WHO CURRENTLY OWNS THE GAS?\n\n  For those of my colleagues who haven't been deeply involved in \nwestern public lands energy issues--across the west, oil and gas is \noften owned separately from the coal. It may also be separate from \nhardrock minerals, and over time through sale, can also be separate \nfrom the surface rights. This system of split mineral estates is the \nresult of many layers of Federal statutes that granted varying levels \nof patents to homesteaders.\n  The particular problem before us, arises out of the Coal Land Acts of \n1909 and 1910. Those statutes specified that homesteaders could retain \nsurface rights (including the oil and gas) but reserved the coal to the \nU.S. Government. Now the question about whether methane is a gas, or \ncoal, leads to questions of ownership.\n\n  In Wyoming today, gas producers--through lease agreements with \nfederal, state and private owners in Wyoming--produce over a billion \ncubic feet of methane gas per month. These leases are between the \nproducers and the owners of the gas and many of them have been in \neffect for as long as twenty years and more. In New Mexico and \nColorado, they are producing over 75 billion cubic feet of gas per \nmonth under the same system. This Court decision--which would attach \nthe methane to the coal owner or lessee--jeopardizes all of the gas \nleases that govern these wells--including the federal gas leases.\n\n\n                           how serious is it?\n\n  The effect of this decision will have a profound impact in certain \nregions. Consider some of these effects:\n  1. For the farm families who have secured mortgages with their \nroyalties, this invalidation could deprive them of much needed lease \nincome and force them into bankruptcy.\n  2. For the small community banks who hold those loans, a number of \nbankruptcies could jeopardize their solvency.\n  3. For the producing companies operating--or planning to operate--on \nthose leases, this could delay their production--and all the jobs that \ncome with it--for a year or more. So while the judicial system is \nsorting out the ownership issue, drilling and servicing companies are \ngoing to go belly up. Oil exploration has stalled because of low \nprices, so if they can't drill for cheap gas, there isn't much \nbusiness.\n  I received a letter in my office the other day from a small bank in \nBuffalo, Wyoming. In the letter, they discussed the effects this \ndecision may have on interest owners and various trusts held by their \nbank. The advisory committee for one particular trust voted to suspend \nall further royalty payments to the trust beginning September 1. That \ndecision was made based on the tax consequences and on the potential \nliability of having to repay royalties should any retrospective \ndecisions be made.\n\n[[Page S10595]]\n\n  Another constituent contacted me to tell me that his multi-million \nlease agreement--that he had worked on for more than a year--had just \nfallen apart because this court decision had clouded the title. The \ninvestors had been unwilling to go through with the deal.\n\n  These stories are just the start of a devastating series of \nconsequences that will arise out of this decision. Each breakdown will \nhave a multiplying effect on unemployment and loss of confidence in \nwestern states.\n  This is a very serious situation, Mr. President, but it is one that \ncan be stabilized.\n  Today, we are offering a bill that would grandfather the leases that \nhave been negotiated, in good faith, according to the explicit policies \nof the U.S. Government. The amendment would ensure that existing leases \nto produce methane--or natural gas out of the coalseam, as some of the \nolder leases read--remain valid and that there is no future assertion \nof ownership by the Federal Government on these parcels.\n  The amendment applies only to federally owned coal. It would not have \nany effect on tribally owned or state-owned coal. We have worked this \nout with the Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Campbell \nfrom Colorado.\n  Furthermore, we have worked with the coal companies, who have valid \nconcerns about their existing and future leases to mine federal coal. \nWe have made it clear that nothing in this bill should be construed to \nlimit their ability to mine federal coal under valid leases, nor should \nanything be construed to expand their liabilities to coalbed methane \nowners covered by the bill.\n  The timing of the decision means we will be working to move this bill \nas soon as possible. Next year, we will pursue a more in-depth review \nof the situation. This body will need to conduct hearings and look at \nways to work out problems with future leases and with conflicting \nresource use issues. These are details that demand very careful \nconsideration.\n  For now, however, we should take this opportunity to provide some \ncertainty for people with existing agreements. This is a statement of \nsupport for the sanctity of those contracts--and a statement of support \nfor the economies in our states.\n  In closing, I would like to thank the Republican and Democratic \nmembers of the Senate who have been so important in helping us to work \nout this legislation. A special thanks to the Indian Affairs Committee \nfor helping us craft language to accommodate tribal lands and a special \nthanks to the Department of Interior, who is helping us to protect \neighty years of doing business. They have also helped us remove the \npossibility of devastating private property takings, retroactive \nliabilities, and mountains of litigation.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support this \nlegislation designed to protect contracts and leases of surface patent \nholders for coalbed methane. This legislation, which my colleague \nSenator Enzi and I are jointly introducing along with our House \ncolleague Congresswoman Cubin, is vitally important to coalbed methane \nproducers and lease holders in Wyoming and will address a problem which \narose due to an appellate court decision rendered earlier this summer.\n  On July 20, 1998, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals turned years of \nprecedent and practice on its head by ruling that coalbed methane \nshould be classified as a coal-by-product rather than a form of natural \ngas. That decision was completely contrary to past interpretation, and \nwill severely impact coaled methane lease holders in Wyoming and \nthroughout the nation. The ruling will also delay completion of leases \nand drilling, which will negatively impact our state's economy.\n  The court's decision is particularly troubling for producers because \nthe Office of the Solicitor at the Department of Interior had issued \ntwo earlier opinions regarding ownership of coalbed methane in \nfederally-owned coal, which were directly opposite to the appellate \ncourt's ruling. Both in 1981 and in 1990, the Solicitor's office issued \noptions which stated that coalbed methane was not part of the \nfederally-reserved coal protected under the 1909 and 1910 Coal Lands \nActs. Now, leaseholders and producers, who believed they were acting in \ngood faith and compliance with federal law, are faced with the \ntroubling possibility that their leases may be revoked.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today is designed to remedy \nmany of the problems caused by the appellate court's decision. This \nbill would protect current contracts and leases of surface patent \nholders for coalbed methane gas. The measure does not address future \nleases or contracts and only deals with folks who are already engaged \nin the production of coalbed methane gas or who have leased land for \ndrilling and exploration. It is a fair and reasonable proposal and \nwould simply protect people who acted in compliance with the law as it \nwas interpreted by the Department of Interior.\n  Mr. President, I hope the Senate will take quick action on this \nmeasure and approve it as quickly as possible. Coalbed methane \nproduction is a growing and vibrant part of Wyoming's economy and we \nneed to take action to ensure that the lives of folks who rely on \nstable production of coalbed methane are not completely disrupted. \nProducers acted in good faith and in compliance with the law as they \nknew it. We should not punish them for actions beyond their control and \nshould work to ensure that the blood and sweat which they invested into \ntheir businesses is not swept away by the actions of the court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10588-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"},

Mr. President, I rise to remind everyone that \ntoday is National POW/MIA Recognition Day. On this day, we should \nremember, give tribute to, and stand in solidarity with the loved ones \nand families of the thousands of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen \nwho were or are Prisoners of War and Missing in Action. I am humbled by \nand grateful for their love of country and their sense of duty and \nhonor.\n  Amidst the somber thoughts, the feelings of gratitude and pride that \nthis day brings, as a Nation we must be uneasy. Uneasy because while we \nare a nation at peace and the wars in which these men fought are long \nover, they have not all returned home and we should not rest until \ntheir families have their loved ones back.\n  These Americans swore an oath to support and defend the constitution \nand carried that promise through to the ultimate sacrifice for this \ngreat nation. While thousands died, many others endured years in \nstarved, tortured, isolated misery before regaining the freedoms we \nenjoy. Their persistence, integrity and heroism are shining examples of \nthe core values on which this nation was founded and became great.\n  Mr. President, we need to produce results. Headway is being made, but \nthere is still a long way to go before we have the fullest possible \naccounting of all POW/MIA personnel.\n  Over the past six years, 136 Americans have been accounted for from \nLaos, Vietnam and Cambodia thanks to extensive field work. Earlier this \nmonth, thanks to the US-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAS established \nin 1991, seventeen airmen were at long last identified, returned to \ntheir native soil laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. These \nbrave airmen were shot down over Soviet Armenia in 1958, during the \nheight of the Cold War. For their loved ones and family members, the \nlong wait is over, but by no means will their loss or sacrifices be \nforgotten. For many, however, the anguish continues.\n  While much of the focus on POW/MIAs has rightly been on Southeast \nAsia where 2081 personnel remain unaccounted for, we must also honor \nthose who were held prisoner and who are missing in action in other \nremote parts of the globe. More than 80,000 Americans remain missing \nand unaccounted for from World War I, World War II and the Korean \nconflict, and countless others from the Cold War.\n  These great Americans and their families have the gratitude of a \ngreat and free nation, but we in the Senate shall not rest until all \nare returned or accounted for. I urge you, Mr. President, the \nAdministration, the Departments of Defense and State, the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and the National Security Agency to redouble their efforts to \nbring our boys hone as quickly as possible. Let us all take to heart \nthe motto from the POW/MIA flag, which flies over the Capitol today, \nand which is displayed every day in the Capitol rotunda: ``YOU ARE NOT \nFORGOTTEN.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10606-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION DAY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Friday, September, \n18, 1998 has been designated this year by our Federal and State \nGovernments as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. As we have done for \nnearly 20 years, we reaffirm today our national commitment to obtaining \nthe fullest possible accounting for America's POWs and MIAs. This is \nalso a day to remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifices that \nhave been made by America's finest and bravest service personnel--our \nunaccounted for prisoners of war and missing in action personnel who \nnever returned from wartime enemy territory.\n  It has been an honor and privilege for me, since my election to the \nCongress in 1984, to assist the POW/MIA families, our veterans, and \ntheir friends and supporters, with the many efforts that have been \nundertaken to try to achieve a proper accounting for so many of our \nnation's heroes whose fate remains unknown. It has been a difficult and \nemotional task, complicated by on and off-again cooperation by foreign \ngovernments\n  As many of my colleagues know, I served as Vice-Chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in 1992, and I currently \nserve as the U.S. Chairman of the Vietnam War Working Group of the \nJoint U.S./Russian Commission on POWs and MIAs. I have traveled to \nNorth Korea, Vietnam, Russia, Laos, Cambodia, Poland, and the Czech \nRepublic trying to assist our Government's efforts to open archives and \ninterview people knowledgeable about the fate of our unaccounted for \ncaptured and missing personnel. I have also made efforts over the last \nyear to prod our own U.S. Intelligence Community to provide the \nanalysis and support necessary to help shape our policy toward nations \nthat hold the answers we seek. Finally, I continue to work to ensure \nthat U.S. Government records on this issue are declassified and made \navailable to the public.\n  Mr. President, today, as I have every year in this Chamber, I urge \nthe Administration to take the opportunity National POW/MIA Recognition \nDay provides to rededicate itself to the fullest possible accounting \nmission. I also urge all Americans to continue expressing their \nconcerns on this national issue because public awareness is critical to \nthe accounting effort.\n  In closing, I again want to assure my constituents in New Hampshire, \nmy fellow veterans, the POW/MIA families, and the countless Americans \nwho have contacted me through the years, that I remain absolutely \ncommitted to doing everything I can to learn the truth about our POWs \nand MIAs to whom we pay tribute on this special day. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10606-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10606-S10607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE CHILD NUTRITION REAUTHORIZATION ACT AND THE SCHOOL BREAKFAST \n                           RESEARCH PROPOSAL\n\n Mr. Johnson. Mr. President, I rise today to give my full \nsupport for the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act. This important \nlegislation funds important child nutrition programs for the next five \nyears until the year 2003.\n  I want to commend Agriculture Committee Chairman Lugar and Ranking \nMember Harkin and my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee for \nworking cooperatively, in a bipartisan spirit, to unanimously pass this \nbill out of Committee. Also, I want to thank my Senate colleagues for \npassing this vital legislation unanimously last evening. Clearly, this \ndemonstrates our commitment to feeding our nation's children.\n  The Child Nutrition Reauthorization bill provides funding for the \nNational School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, the Child and Adult Care \nFood Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Women, Infant and \nChildren (WIC) program along with many other nutritious food programs \nto feed our nation's youth.\n  One of the provisions in this legislation that I worked closely on \nduring the creation of this legislation was a $20 million provision \nthat provides for detailed research on how school breakfast impacts a \nchild's academic success.\n  This research provision is a modified version of S. 1396, the Meals \nfor Achievement Act that I introduced last November. The research \nprovision provides for the mandatory funding for a $20 million school \nbreakfast research project to further test the impacts of school \nbreakfast on children's academic and behavioral skills.\n  This provision will require the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a \nfive\n\n[[Page S10607]]\n\nyear school breakfast study in six different school districts \nthroughout the United States--involving approximately 15,000 school \nchildren.\n  As I've stated before, the research on the impacts of children eating \nschool breakfast speaks for itself. Not only do academic scores in \nreading, writing, and math improve, levels of hyperactivity and \ntardiness are greatly reduced.\n  The purpose of this study is to further analyze the existing data and \nto provide additional research and data at the national level and to \nprove the positive impacts of eating a school breakfast. It is \nimportant to note that the funding for the research provision will \nrequire no new additional expenses and maintains our balanced budget \ndiscipline. It is not my intention with this research project to create \na whole new federal bureaucracy that only deals with the implementation \nof school breakfast program. Furthermore, after the researchers have \ncompleted the five-year study and find school breakfast does indeed \nimprove a child's academic success, we, as federal lawmakers, can work \nwith local and state school authorities to create guidelines of how \nschool breakfasts can improve a child's academic success.\n  The rationale for this provision of the Child Nutrition \nReauthorization Act is very simple. In order for the United States to \ncompete effectively in the world, we must have an educated and \nproductive workforce. In order to have an educated and productive \nworkforce, we must prepare our children to learn. In order to prepare \nour children to learn they must be well nourished, and that begins with \na good healthy breakfast.\n  The best teachers in the world, with the best standards, cannot teach \na hungry child. A child who begins his or her school day with their \nstomach growling because they either did not have time to eat breakfast \nor there was no breakfast to be served, is simply too distracted to \nfocus on the lessons being provided by the teacher.\n  In 1994, the Minnesota legislature directed the Minnesota Department \nof Children, Families and Learning to implement a universal breakfast \npilot program integrating breakfast into the education schedule for all \nstudents. The evaluation of the pilot project, performed by the Center \nfor Applied Research and Educational Improvement at the University of \nMinnesota, showed that when all students are involved in school \nbreakfast, there is a general increase in learning and achievement.\n  Researchers at Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital recently \ncompleted a study on the results of universal free breakfast at one \npublic school in Philadelphia and two in Baltimore. The study, \npublished this week in the Archives of Adolescent and Pediatric \nMedicine which is a journal of the American Medical Association, found \nthat students who ate the breakfast showed great improvement in math \ngrades, attendance, and punctuality. The researchers also observed that \nstudents displayed fewer signs of depression, anxiety, hyperactivity, \nand other behavioral problems.\n  If we are serious about improving our education system in America, we \nmust first prepare our children to learn. The time has come, therefore, \nto build upon the pilot program in Minnesota, Philadelphia, Baltimore, \nand other cities, and integrate school breakfast into the education \nday, at least at the elementary school level.\n  I believe that ensuring a nutritious breakfast for our school kids \nwill help close this ``opportunity deficit.'' As America enters the \n21st century, we cannot afford to allow a single child to be left \nbehind. As Robert Kennedy once wrote, ``We need the best of many--not \nof just a few. We must strive for excellence.'' Clearly, the Meals for \nAchievement provision in the Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act is a \nstep in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10606-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10607-S10609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n LET'S ENCOURAGE BROWNFIELDS DEVELOPMENT AND GET THE LITTLE GUY OUT OF \n               SUPERFUND LITIGATION AT CO-DISPOSAL SITES\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Mr. President, yesterday the Majority \nLeader made a long statement on behalf of Senate action on S. 2180, the \n``Superfund Recycling Equity Act,'' which he introduced earlier this \nyear. This legislation would clarify that persons who merely recycle \ncertain specified materials, but did not dispose of those materials, \nare not subject to Superfund liability.\n  Today, Mr. President, I join as a co-sponsor of this legislation. \nAnd, I note for the record, that I was the author of the recycling \nprovision in 1993. I included it in comprehensive Superfund reform \nlegislation, S.1834, which I introduced when I was Chairman of the \nSenate Superfund Subcommittee. As Senator Lott noted yesterday, this \nprovision has reappeared in every major, comprehensive Superfund bill \nsince then, whether authored by Democrat or Republican. And it has been \nintroduced in every Congress, by Democrats and Republicans, as stand-\nalone legislation. There is broad-based, bipartisan support for this \nlegislation which would remove impediments to recycling efforts. It now \nappears that some type of liability relief for recyclers will be \nconsidered by the Environment and Public Works Committee next week, \nalthough it is not clear exactly which of several proposals will be \nconsidered.\n  For this reason, Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention two other very similar provisions which I believe should be \nconsidered in conjunction with S. 1280. They are designed to expedite \nthe revitalization of communities all across this country, and to \nprovide relief to untold numbers of small business owners, small non-\nprofits, and individuals who sent only ordinary household trash to \nlandfills that are now Superfund sites.\n  Mr. President, once it became clear that the Congress would not act \non comprehensive Superfund legislation this year, and the Majority \nLeader expressed his interest in enacting a liability exemption for \ncertain recyclers, I suggested that we also take the very modest step \nof enacting a similar exemption for brownfields development and for \nthose who innocently disposed of municipal solid waste at landfills \nthat later became Superfund sites. I wrote to the Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, asking that the Committee \nconsider exemptions for brownfields and municipal solid waste (MSW) \ndisposal, should it take up any liability exemptions--because \nbrownfields and MSW exemptions also enjoy broad, bi-partisan support \nand have been regarded as non-controversial. The Chairman responded \nthat he opposed so-called piecemeal reform of Superfund, and that the \nCommittee would not be considering such legislation this year. In \ndeference to this judgement, I deferred introducing separate \nlegislation. Now that the Committee apparently will be considering \nliability exemptions for recyclers, I hope we will also have an \nopportunity to consider exemptions for brownfields and MSW.\n  Mr. President, as is the case for recyclers, provisions to clarify \nthe law on liability for brownfields development and MSW have been \nincluded, with bipartisan support, in every comprehensive Superfund \nbill since 1993. In virtually every regard, they meet the same criteria \nthat have been offered to justify enacting exemptions for recyclers. \nThey are simple clarifications of existing law to correct unintended \nconsequences of the Superfund liability scheme. They have gained the \nsupport of all stakeholders, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the national environmental community. The \nbrownfields and MSW ``fixes'' are minor, but are critical for \nsuccessful brownfields development, or to those subjected to unfair and \nunintended litigation. They do not involve cleanup standards or natural \nresource damages. They do not deal with orphan shares or municipal \nliability. And they offer significant economic and environmental \nbenefits.\n  Why, then, should the Senate reject consideration of these ``fixes?'' \nOnly one reason is offered: that they should be held hostage to \ncomprehensive Superfund reform! Mr. President, it is argued they are so \npopular, and enjoy such broad ranging support, and provide such \nsignificant benefits to the nation, that we should hold them hostage to \nsee if they provide a stimulus for action on comprehensive legislation \nin the next Congress. It is argued that they should be held as \n``sweeteners'' to try to sweeten the sour pot of proposed changes to \nthe Superfund program that\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\nhave been rejected by three successive Congresses.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to those making this argument, I \nthink it is wrong to prevent enactment of legislation that enjoys broad \nsupport, and would reap acknowledged benefits, as a tactical matter to \nachieve unrelated goals. I think this disserves the public and adds to \npublic cynicism. For a variety of reasons, efforts to radically change \nSuperfund, the nation's toxic waste cleanup program, have failed for \nsix years running. Toward the end of each of the past two congresses, \nmany Senators, including this Senator, have argued that we should move \nahead with achievable reforms that are non-controversial and permit our \npeople, our communities, and our economy to benefit from their \nenactment. Today, as we head into the final weeks of this Congress, I \nmake the same plea. Just as holding recyclers hostage to comprehensive \nSuperfund reform has not worked, so holding brownfields development and \npersons who disposed of household trash hostage to other legislative \ngoals is a failed strategy. It will not mitigate the controversy \nintrinsic to the broader issues raised by comprehensive legislation. \nYet, it robs communities across the country of the jobs and tax \nratables that flow from revitalized brownfields and imposes severe \npenalties on the individuals and small businesses caught up in a \nlitigation nightmare through no fault of their own.\n  Mr. President, in the last Congress, the Majority party insisted on \nan all or nothing Superfund strategy. But, when that failed, lender \nliability legislation was passed in response to a strong lobbying \neffort by lenders who, understandably, wanted relief from liabilities \nthat were unfair and made no sense. I supported lender liability relief \nbecause I thought it had public benefits and corrected an injustice.\n  In these last weeks of the 105th Congress, a similar game plan is \nunfolding. Thousands of recyclers around the country are asking for \nliability relief--relief they deserve, in legislation I support. They \nhave skilled representatives making their case, and I do not fault them \nfor that. In fact, I support their efforts. But, as a Senator from a \nstate with literally thousands of brownfields sites, as well as \naltogether too many instances of homeowners and small businesses mired \nin litigation at landfill sites, it is my responsibility to lobby for \nthose communities and individuals who don't have lobbyists representing \nthem here in the Congress. We, as their elected representatives, are \ntheir lobbyists. We are their voice. There is no reason in the world \nwhy this Senate, and this Congress, should not move forward to make the \nminor, non-controversial, and eminently sensible changes to Superfund \nlaw that impede brownfields development and rob small businesses of \ntheir hard earned profits.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will consider the plight of \npersons who disposed of household waste, or office trash, such as \ncafeteria waste or paper waste, at the local town dump. I am talking \nabout homeowners, pizza parlor owners, and Girl Scouts who, as \nunbelievable as it may sound, have been dragged into Superfund \nlitigation. They have not been sued by EPA. They have been sued, \nprimarily, by large corporations who disposed of toxic waste, some by \ndark of night, at a dump alongside solid waste from homes and small \nbusinesses and restaurants.\n  Through two Congresses now, the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has heard testimony from Barbara Williams, the owner of Sunny \nRay Restaurant, who was named as a fourth-party defendant in litigation \nconcerning the Keystone Sanitation Company, Inc. Superfund Site, in \nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania. Indeed, the whole country heard her saga, \nwhen she was interviewed on ``60 Minutes.''\n  How did Barbara Williams get ensnared in Superfund litigation? EPA \nsued 11 companies that dumped hazardous waste from industrial processes \nat the Keystone Landfill for a period of years, but did not want to \nclean it up. These 11 companies sued 180 third-party defendants, who in \nturn sued 590 fourth-party defendants, including Barbara Williams. But \nMrs. Williams sent only mashed potatoes and other restaurant waste to \nthe Keystone Site. Those suing her told her she could get out of the \nlawsuit if she would pay them $75,000.\n  Mr. President, a $75,000 assessment is a lot of money for most small \nbusinesses, and Barbara Williams is no exception. Further, Barbara \nWilliams is not a polluter. No one at the Department of Justice, the \nEPA or in the Congress believes she should be liable under Superfund \nfor sending mashed potatoes to the local garbage dump. Nor does anyone \nbelieve she should have to pay staggering lawyers' fees to get herself \nout of this litigation nightmare. Congress could, and should, act now \nto free Mrs. Williams and get all those like her out of the litigation \nweb. Mrs. Williams, her business, and her family should not be held \nhostage to some notion that if we wait to grant her justice another two \nyears, or four years, we will enact highly controversial changes to the \nSuperfund program. Comprehensive Superfund legislation will have to \nrise or fall on its own merits. Barbara Williams should not become a \npawn in this legislative battle.\n  Likewise, Mr. President, this body should ask the same questions \nabout removing obstacles to brownfields development. Brownfields are \noften in cities, but also are located in many, many suburban and even \nrural areas. They are abandoned, or idle, former industrial properties. \nSome of these are contaminated, some are not. But it is the fear that \nthese properties are contaminated that some say deters investors from \nbuying them and redeveloping them.\n  Mr. President, there are more than 500,000 brownfields staining this \ncountry's landscape. The nation's Mayors estimate they lose between \n$200 and $500 million a year in tax revenues from these properties \nsitting idle. Returning these sites to productive use could create some \n236,000 new jobs. Our nation's Mayors, as well as developers and \nbankers, say immediate action is imperative, since new tax laws provide \nincentives for brownfields redevelopment, but expire in 2001.\n  Congress should act before we adjourn to remove the unintended burden \nof Superfund liability that deters investors from buying and developing \nbrownfields properties. Brownfields development results in significant \neconomic benefits. It creates jobs and tax ratables for communities, \nwhich lowers local tax burdens on residents. The cleanup of brownfields \nalso removes contaminants from our environment. These cleanup \ninitiatives are win/win opportunities that make good environmental \nsense and good business sense.\n  Mr. President, if this body takes steps to encourage recycling, which \nI support, I urge my colleagues to also take steps to encourage \nbrownfields development and to free our nation's small business owners \nfrom the unfair and punitive penalties being assessed on them. It is in \nthe interest of good government, and clearly in the interest of \nmillions of Americans, that we do so. Let's act now to revitalize our \ncommunities. And let's act now, and let Mrs. Williams discharge her \nlawyer.\n  Mr. President, the legislative language which would provide relief \nfrom brownfields and MSW liability is well known to all who have \nfollowed this debate. But, for the convenience of my colleagues, I ask \nthat a summary be printed in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n  Summary of Senator Frank R. Lautenberg's ``CERCLA Liability \nExemptions Act of 1998'', containing a total of four exemptions, three \nin the brownfields arena and one in the municipal solid waste (MSW) \narena.\n  The proposed legislation would relieve the following persons from \nSuperfund liability:\n  (1) Brownfields--\n  (a) Bona fide prospective purchasers--persons who seek to buy \ncontaminated properties, and can show that they did not cause the \ncontamination;\n  (b) Innocent landowners--persons who already own property that they \ndid not know was contaminated; and\n  (c) Contiguous landowners--persons who own property that becomes \ncontaminated as a result of contaminants migrating from neighboring \nproperties or areas; and\n  (2) Municipal Solid Waste--\n  individuals; small businesses (less than 100 employees); and small \nnon-profit organizations (less than 100 employees)\n  who disposed only municipal solid waste (ordinary household trash, or \nhouse-hold-like trash, such as cafeteria or office paper waste) at a \nlandfill.\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\n  The exemptions were replicated, almost verbatim, in S.8, except that \nS.8 would have shifted the exempt MSW party's share to the Trust Fund. \nOur Democratic substitute did not assign a share to the exempt MSW \nparty, nor did S. 1834, the consensus bill reported out of EPW on an \n11:4 vote in the 103rd Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10607-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto bring to the attention of my colleagues the generous gift by the \nMailman Foundation to the Columbia University School of Public Health \n(CSPH). This represents the largest single gift ever made to a school \nof public health.\n  CSPH is one of our nation's first schools of public health and is \ncurrently celebrating its 75th anniversary. In its recent history, CSPH \nhas distinguished itself on the local, national, and global levels in a \nvariety of public health areas. The Mailman Foundation endowment will \nhelp to strengthen and expand areas such as: (1) access to and quality \nof health care; (2) prevention of childhood poverty; (3) the \nenhancement of women's reproductive health, including STD prevention \nservices, and reduction in pregnancy-related deaths in developing \ncountries; (4) the identification of environmental factors such as air \nand water quality as a cause of disease; (5) the prevention of \ncommunity and household violence; and (6) AIDS research and treatment.\n  In addition to these important areas of program and research support, \nthe gift will also be used to provide financial aid to students and for \nfaculty support.\n  The family-run Mailman Foundation was created by the late Joseph \nMailman, the founder of Mailman Corporation, one of the earliest \nconglomerates in North America. The Foundation has been an important \nbenefactor to numerous institutions devoted to education, medicine, and \nthe arts.\n  I commend the Mailman Foundation for its remarkable act of \nphilanthropy and for recognizing Columbia's leadership in the field of \npublic health. This gift to Columbia University's internationally known \ngraduate school, now known as the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public \nHealth, will advance the cause of health promotion and disease \nprevention, through education, research, and direct service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10609-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO MAYOR ROBERT L. ALBRITTEN OF DAWSON, GEORGIA THE 1998 \n                  AMERICAN HOMETOWN LEADERSHIP WINNER\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mayor Robert \nL. Albritten of Dawson, Georgia on receiving the 1998 American Hometown \nLeadership Award, which is the only national award that recognizes \nleaders from small communities whose community service exhibits the \nhighest standards of dedication, ability, creativity and leadership.\n  Mayor Albritten was nominated by Dawson's Better Hometown Task Force \nand chosen from a field of 400 national leaders for his pacesetting \nefforts to save jobs at Almark Mills, a local textile plant employing \n250 people that shut its doors last Fall leaving Dawson on the brink of \na major unemployment problem.\n  Faced with a potential devastating blow to the town of 5,000 people \nand following days of feverish brainstorming, late-night phone calls \nand hours-long meetings with community leaders, rural development \nexperts and a local accountant, Mayor Albritten and other community \nleaders emerged with an audacious plan-- the plant would become a \ncooperative, in which each worker would be an owner, and all would have \na say and a financial stake in the running of the plant.\n  However, Mayor Albritten was not satisfied with just creating jobs, \nhe also set out to better the lives of all of those living in Dawson. \nHe changed the city seal to read ``The City of Dawson, Committed to a \nBetter Quality of Life for All.''\n  Mayor Robert Albritten has been an innovator and leader, and his \ndetermination is truly commendable. He has devoted countless hours of \nhis time and energy to improve the town of Dawson and to better the \nlives of all of its citizens, never hesitating to help in any way he \ncould. He has not only led the people of Dawson, but he has inspired \nthem. His efforts have also been recognized by having the Robert L. \nAlbritten Neighborhood Community Center named in his honor.\n  In addition to his endless work on behalf of the citizens of Dawson, \nMayor Albritten continues his work as a funeral service practitioner. \nHe and his wife Arna have three daughters, Andrea, Alisha and Ariana.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you join me and our colleagues in \nrecognizing and honoring Mayor Robert L. Albritten for his remarkable \nachievements and accomplishments as a citizen and as a leader which \nhave culminated with his selection as the 1998 American Hometown \nLeadership recipient. Mayor Albritten is truly a remarkable man and a \nfirst-rate American richly deserving of such an honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10609-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10609-S10610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN SUPPORT OF ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to address a bill \nintroduced earlier this week called the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and \nSecure Borders Act of 1998. This bill takes the best ideas and puts \nthem to work providing Americans with the tools they need to make their \nfamilies safer, their communities healthier, and their schools freer \nfrom violence.\n  I know all of us would like a simple solution to the crime problems \nfacing this great nation. But all of us know, in our hearts, that there \nis no easy solution. We must come together, join with our neighbors, \nour police, our leaders, and our children to tackle the terrifying \nproblems facing us.\n  We must be tough on criminals. We need to continue to send the \nmessage that if you do the crime, you will be doing time--hard time. No \none can accuse the U.S. justice system of coddling criminals. We have \namong the highest percentage of our population in prison, more than \nalmost any other country in the world.\n  In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which I supported, we \nstrengthened penalties for violent, and drug-related crime. We also \nprovided grants to states to build jails and prisons if they required \nserious violent offenders to serve at least 75 percent of their \nsentences. We've hired more than 75,000 new police officers to \nimplement to time-tested program of community policing. Our crime bill \nhas worked.\n  Now we need more of the same. We need to extend the Violent Crime \nReduction Trust fund to pay for these important community-policing and \ngrants to state and local government.\n  We need to extend the Violence Against Women Act. Preventing domestic \nviolence and providing a safe haven for victims of domestic violence \nhas been a top priority for me. I intend to introduce legislation to \nensure victims of domestic violence are not further victimized through \ninsurance, job or social security discrimination. Should this bill be \nconsidered by the Senate, I would seek to amend it by adding provisions \nof my Battered Women Economic Security Act to it.\n  Another top priority for me in this bill is reducing crime in our \nschools. As a parent and former educator, I share America's horror that \nour children are not safe in their schools. We simply must invest time \nand resources into solving this fundamental problem. This bill will \nprovide an additional $10 million for the Safe and Drug Free School \nprogram and establish partnerships between schools and local law \nenforcement. Through my Senate Advisory Youth Involvement team, I am \nlearning from students how they believe we can best solve school \nviolence problems. I will be sharing those ideas with my colleagues \nwhen we debate this bill.\n  In my meetings with law enforcement officers around my state, I \nlearned we have some critical problems in our juvenile justice system. \nWhile I believe juvenile justice is fundamentally an issue for our \nstate legislatures to address, there is a federal role in several \nareas. First, we often should treat those 16 and 17-year-olds who \ncommit violent federal offenses as adults. This bill gives prosecutors \nimportant discretion to prosecute these offenders as adults.\n\n  In addition to getting tough on our most hardened young criminals, we \nmust replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies. There \nare\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\nmany efforts in my state of Washington that bring out the best in kids \nand communities and they are truly making a dent in the juvenile crime \nproblem. Best SELF in Skagit county; Teamchild in King county; \ncommunity justice in Spokane county and on the Colville Indian \nReservation; Safestreets in Seattle; and TOGETHER! in Thurston county \nare several examples of communities joining together to make a \ndifference with their youth. It's amazing how far just a few thousand \ndollars can go in these community-based programs; they need our \ncontinued support.\n  Mr. President, this bill also targets gangs, illegal drugs, and \ndomestic and international terrorism. It extends a recently-passed bill \nI strongly supported, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, and \nprovides other safeguards for our law enforcement officers. It \nreauthorizes the Drug Czar's office, which coordinates the High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area program that is helping establish a \ncoordinated campaign against drug importation and use while also \nfocusing resources of prevention and treatment of abuse.\n  No bill is perfect and I cannot say I agree with every provision \nincluded in this 1220-page bill. However, the Safe Schools, Safe \nStreets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 continues to move this country \nin the right direction. Violent crime must continue to drop. With all \nof us joining together to fight crime and embrace healthy communities \nand schools, America can again become a safe place to raise and educate \nall of our children.\n  I thank Senator Leahy for his fine leadership on this bill and \nencourage all Senators to work to pass comprehensive, bi-partisan \nlegislation to prevent crime and strengthen families and \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10609-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 1998--AMENDMENT NO. 3600\n\n  Amendment No. 3600, sent to the desk by Mr. Hatch on September 17, is \nprinted in today's Record under ``Amendments Submitted--September 17, \n1998.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/18/senate-section/article/S10610-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10610-S10611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSATELLITE COMPULSORY LICENSE REFORM PROCESS AND S. 1720 CHAIRMAN'S MARK\n\n  The Chairman's mark substitute for S. 1720, not available for \nprinting on September 17, 1998, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Further, the household savings rate of the United \n     States lags far behind other industrial nations presenting a \n     barrier to economic growth.\n       ``(3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United \n     States should invest existing resources in high-yield \n     initiatives.
