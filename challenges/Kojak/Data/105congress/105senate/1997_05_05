Mr. President, I rise to speak about the budget \nagreement. Let me start out with a little bit of context. I will just \nread a figure from the fine work of the Center on Budget Priorities. In \nthe last Congress, the 104th Congress, more than 93 percent of the \nbudget reductions in entitlement programs came from programs for low-\nincome people.\n  Mr. President, in the last Congress, we cut about $50 billion in \nassistance for legal immigrants and also in the major food and \nnutrition program in this country, the Food Stamp Program. Please \nremember, Mr. President, that the vast majority of the beneficiaries of \nthe Food Stamp Program are children in working-poor families, on the \naverage, with an income of below $6,500 a year. Those benefits were cut \nby 20 percent over the next 5 years--a 20-percent cut.\n  Mr. President, I give that by way of background because now we have a\n\n[[Page S3934]]\n\nbudget agreement, and I suppose it can be argued that an agreement is \ngood because you have people coming together. But the question is: At \nwhat cost?\n  Mr. President, I don't see much of a standard of fairness in this \nagreement. I suppose, in many ways, my challenge is more to Democrats \nthan to Republicans when I speak here on the floor. I think that when \nwe go through this budget and we look at the cuts in discretionary \nprograms, we will find, again, that, inevitably, the disproportional \nnumber of these cuts will be in programs that are most important to the \nmost vulnerable citizens in this country. Many of them are poor \nchildren in America. I do know, Mr. President, that the discretionary \npart of this budget in relation to GDP is the lowest percentage it has \nbeen in 40 years.\n  Mr. President, if I juxtapose what will be further reductions in \nassistance for some of the most vulnerable citizens in our country on \ntop of what we did in the last Congress, with $85 billion over the \nfirst 5 years and another $165 billion over the next 5 years, $250 \nbillion in tax cuts, and then looking from about 2008 to 2017, about an \nadditional $400 billion as you look at the impact of cuts in capital \ngains tax and estate tax, many of those benefits will flow to the top \n1, 2, 3 percent of the population.\n  I want to just ask my colleagues, and I would like to ask the \nPresident: Where is the standard of fairness? Where is the standard of \nfairness? Where is our soul as a party that has a reputation for being \nwilling to fight for ordinary people, being willing to fight for \nworking people and working families, being willing to fight for \nopportunities for children.\n  Mr. President, I think we have to be very careful about what I would \ncall, for use of a better description, symbolic politics. What do I \nmean by that? I mean, Mr. President, that if you look at this budget \nand you think back to just a few weeks ago, with the conference at the \nWhite House on the development of the brain and the importance of early \nchildhood development and what we must do to make sure that every woman \nexpecting a child has an adequate diet, make sure there is nutrition \nfor children, to make sure that there is health care for children, and \nto make sure that there is intellectual development and good child \ncare, remembering that one out of every four children in our country \nare growing up poor in America and one out of every two children of \ncolor are growing up poor in America. Mr. President, I don't see in \nthis budget anything that advances the cause of these children. I see \nonly a retreat. Where is the investment? Where is the investment in our \nchildren?\n  Mr. President, we have been focusing on the budget deficit. How about \nthe investment deficit? How about the spiritual deficit? I thought that \nnow that the medical evidence is irrefutable and irreducible and so \ncompelling that if we don't get it right for all of God's children in \nour country in their early years, they may never come to school ready \nto learn, and they certainly will not be ready for life. I thought we \nwere going to make investments to make sure they had opportunities.\n\n  This budget still doesn't fully fund the Head Start Program. I could \nexplain that when there was a Republican President, President Reagan or \nPresident Bush. I have a hard time explaining that with a Democrat \nPresident.\n  On the supplemental, in the Senate and House, we are still in a \nbattle to make sure that we get the WIC funding that we need. We are \nstill not there. Mr. President, I read a foundation report. David \nPackard, who used to be Undersecretary of Defense with President \nReagan, points out that whether it is child care at home, or whether it \nis center-based child care, or whether you need to do to have more \nchild care at a place of business, however you look at it--and we are \nnot talking about just poor children or low-income families, we are \ntalking about the vast majority of families in our country who are \nconcerned about how to make a decent living and also how to give their \nchildren the care they know their children deserve. I think of our own \nchildren. Sheila and I have children in their twenties and early \nthirties. They have children, and I think of their incomes and the cost \nof child care and how important this is for families. Where is the \ninvestment? Where is the investment?\n  Mr. President, I just suggest that there is something wrong. There is \nsomething terribly wrong. There is a quiet crisis in a Nation--our \nNation--when we don't do better for our children. We have conferences \nand say we are for children and we love to have our photos taken next \nto children, and we don't make the investment. We now know the \nneuroscience evidence is compelling that children must have good \nnutrition and health care, and there certainly must be affordable, good \nchild care, however delivered, at the local community level, and we \nknow it is going to require some funding and investment. That is not in \nthis budget agreement. Have we now locked ourselves in, over the next \n5, 6 years, to saying we will not make this investment?\n  Mr. President, I say to my own colleagues--Democrats--in the past \nmonth or so, we have beamed back to our homes pictures of dilapidated \nschool buildings. We were going to focus on doing something about too \nmany rotting schools in our Nation. We, as Democrats, were going to \ntake a stand on this, and we should. Mr. President, it is not exactly \nthe right message for children when they go into schools, whether it be \nin Anacostia, 2 miles from here, or in any of our States in some of our \ninner city neighborhoods and the buildings are dilapidated, the toilets \ndon't work, the heating doesn't work. We are saying to these children: \nWe don't care about you. We don't give a damn about you.\n  Mr. President, that is a Federal responsibility. That is \ninfrastructure. And Democrats, we beam these pictures back of these \nbuildings and we are the party of commitment. Well, Mr. President, in \nthis budget agreement, the $5 billion plan for school renovation was \nknocked out. Now, actually, it would cost much more than that. It was \nknocked out. It was abandoned. So, to my colleagues, let's not say that \nwe are concerned about rotting school buildings for too many children \nin America and then sign on to a budget agreement that doesn't invest \none cent --one cent--in making sure that these are safe buildings for \nour children. Let's not do that. That is just symbolic politics. That \nis symbolic politics at its worst.\n  Mr. President, we don't even take a baby step toward investment in \nchildren and opportunities for children. We don't even make a dent at \nall. At the same time, we are going to have $250 billion of tax cuts, a \nlarge percentage of which benefits those at the very top of the income \nladder, at the same time we have done precious little by way of \nreductions in Pentagon budget, and at the same time this other whole \narea that apparently we really don't want to go after in any \nsignificant degree, called corporate welfare, the loopholes and \ndeductions for a variety of interests in the country, remains almost \nuntouched. What kind of standard of fairness is that?\n  Mr. President, we have a quiet crisis in a nation that believes we \ncan go forward as a national community with two Americas. We can't do \nthat. There is another America. Unfortunately, that other America \nincludes many children who will never have a chance to reach their full \npotential if we as a Senate and a House of Representatives do not make \nsome investment in their future. This budget is a budget without a soul \nwhen it comes to the concerns and circumstances of these children.\n\n  So, Mr. President, when it comes to investment in children and \neducation, I do not believe I am articulating a position that is one \nthat people in the country don't support. I believe people believe that \nthis is the goodness of our country. This is the American dream to make \nsure that every child has these opportunities. We have set the bar in \nthis budget agreement right here. I want the bar to be set up here. If \nmy colleague, Paul Simon, from Illinois was here today he would say \nthat we can do better. Mr. President, we can do better.\n  So I am going to come to the floor of the Senate with some \namendments. These amendments are going to call for us to do better. \nThese amendments are going to essentially say to the people in the \ncountry, ``Don't judge us by the words we speak. Judge us by the \nbudgets that we write.'' These amendments\n\n[[Page S3935]]\n\nare going to say to colleagues, ``Please don't separate the legislative \nlives you live from the words you speak.'' And, if you say you are for \nthe children, and you say early childhood development is so important, \nand you say you are for a quality of opportunity for every child, \nregardless of color of skin, regardless of rich, or poor, regardless of \nurban, or rural, then clearly we are going to have to do better. If you \nsay that we should not have these rotting schools in our country--and \nwhat all of the local school districts say to us in their plea to us is \nimportant and please invest some money in infrastructure, then you have \nto invest. That has to be in the budget. And, if you say that you \nunderstand that these early years are so important, you know it as a \nfather or as a mother, you know it as a grandfather, or a grandmother--\nwe have always known intuitively how important these early years are--\nand they are important for all children. And children don't do well in \nschool, if they don't have an adequate diet. And children don't do well \nin school, if they are in pain or discomfort because they haven't been \nable to receive medical care. And children don't do well in school, if \nthey have not had really good child care that nurtures their \ndevelopment, whether they are at home, or one or both parents are \nworking. And, if you say all of that--and almost all of you do--it is \ntime to invest. Time is not neutral for these children. We keep talking \nabout the children.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to introduce a number of amendments to \ntake the bar up here. I might lose, or I might win. But I am going to \nreally fight hard. I would just say to the President ``Mr. \nPresident,''--I am talking now to the President at the White House, \nPresident Clinton--``we can do better.''\n  I don't see the standard of fairness. I don't see an agreement with \nmajor tax cuts, and so much revenue lost over the next 10 years and 20 \nyears to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars benefiting many \npeople who do not even need the assistance, and at the same time a \nbudget agreement that represents a retreat and abandon of too many \nchildren in America.\n  We have had enough conferences. Enough books have been written. \nEnough pleas have been made. There has been enough blitz. It is time \nnow that we match our words with the deeds. And the deed is to make \nthis investment.\n  Mr. President, this will be my major priority over the next month to \ncome in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have \npermission to speak for approximately 5 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3933-7", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3935-S3937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FREEDOM FROM GOVERNMENT COMPETITION ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk \nabout one of my top priorities for the 105th Congress. That is the \nFreedom From Government Competition Act.\n  I am struck by the fact that we are considering now the supplemental \nappropriations bill and debate on it will last, I am sure, all week. \nThen next week we will consider the budget which will take at least \nanother week of debate. During these deliberations, we will talk about \nfunding the essentials of Government which, of course, is one of \nCongress' most important tasks. But, unfortunately, it seems to me that \nwe spend an awful lot of time on the budget and on appropriations and \nfunding the Government in the form it is currently in, and less time \nthan we should talking about the changes that we ought to make in the \nGovernment.\n  So, while I am on the floor today, I want to mention a couple of \nbills I have sponsored to change the role of the Federal Government. \nOne is the biennial budget. I think we really ought to consider going \nto a biennial budget in this Congress as we do in many States so that \nwe can deal with the budget once every 2 years. Agencies would do a \nbetter job with 2 years of funding because they would have some \nstability in their funding levels. Certainly we can look at least 2 \nyears ahead in terms of budget, so that Congress has a whole year to \ntalk about some of the reforms that ought to take place; that ought to \nchange in Government.\n  I am persuaded that without some overt changes, without fundamental \nchanges brought about by the Congress, that Government just continues \nto go on, just continues to grow, just continues to expand. It is the \nnature of government.\n  Quite frankly, according to one of the studies by GAO regarding one \nagency that I just read this weekend, there is no real accountability \nin terms of spending. So that accountability in terms of what you do \nwith the money and the results that you have in the Government agencies \nare largely the responsibilities of the Congress.\n  Congress does not have time to do that. We spend too much of our time \nwith the budget, too much of our time with appropriations. One of the \nother things that we ought to do, in my opinion, is to ensure that the \nGovernment is not competing with the private sector in areas that are \nbasically commercial in nature that could better be done and could more \ncheaply be done through outsourcing.\n  My legislation, the Freedom From Government Competition Act, has the \npotential to open up a $30 billion market for our Nation's businesses, \nmostly small businesses, to have an opportunity, by contract, to \nfulfill the commercial needs of the Federal Government. It would level \nthe playing field for thousands of our Nation's businesses that span \nthe economic spectrum of this whole country, from mundane things to \nvery high tech things, from janitorial services, hospitality and \nrecreation services, to engineering services, laboratories and testing \nservices--those functions that are commercial in nature that are now \ndone by the Government that could better and likely more inexpensively \nbe done in the private sector.\n  The bill is quite simple, as a matter of fact. It simply says that \nOMB would take a look at all the activities and functions of \nGovernment, would identify those that are commercial in nature, and \nthen create a fair and competitive process to outsource those \nactivities to the private sector. Of course, not only does the bill \nanswer the call of the American people to limit the size of Government \nand encourage the private sector--but it has a great deal of value in \nterms of the Federal budget. The taxpayers could save many billions of \ndollars. The interesting part of this concept is that it has been \naround for a very long time. For over 40 years we have been dealing \nwith this issue. It has been the Federal Government's policy to \ncontract out for over 40 years. Unfortunately, it has not worked. The \nevidence is that it has not worked. In fact, I recently ran across an \nexcerpt of a 1954 Congressional Quarterly Almanac that details how the \ncurrent policy came into existence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Congressional Quarterly Almanac, 1954]\n\n                  Business Competition From Government\n\n       HR 9835--Reported by House Government Operations Committee \n     (H. Rept. 241) July 21, 1954.\n       Passed by the House, amended, July 24 by voice vote.\n       Reported by Senate Government Operations Committee, with \n     amendment, Aug. 10 (S. Rept. 2382).\n       Legislation (HR 9835) aimed at putting an end to government \n     operations which were in competition with private enterprise \n     cleared the House, and it was subsequently reported by the \n     Senate Government Operations Committee. No further action was \n     taken on the measure during the 1954 session.\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee of the House \n     Government Operations Committee held hearings in June, 1953, \n     on federal activities in commercial and industrial fields. \n     The hearings, which concentrated on areas where the \n     government\n\n[[Page S3936]]\n\n     might be in competition with private business began June 9 \n     and were concluded June 16.\n       A list compiled by the Subcommittee noted 86 commercial and \n     industrial activities in the federal government. Among them \n     were: 31 manufacturing items (including coffee roasting, \n     dentures, sleeping bags, aluminum and atomic energy); seven \n     fields of transportation; 26 service activities (including \n     commissaries, power plants, insurance and fish hatcheries); \n     six construction; seven maintenance; and nine miscellaneous \n     activities (research and development to fur sealing);\n     Testimony\n       June 9. First witness was Rep. Clarence J. Brown (R. Ohio) \n     who said military commissaries presented a ``real threat to \n     free enterprise'' because of their competition with private \n     business. Rowland Jones, Jr., representing the American \n     Retail Foundation, said post exchanges were like big \n     department stores except their prices were 25 per cent lower.\n       In a discussion of whether the Boston Navy Yard's ropewalk, \n     where Navy rope was made, should be retained, the Cordagee \n     Institute, a trade organization, said the mill was unduly \n     competitive with private industry, costly to taxpayers, and \n     private enterprise was capable of filling government needs at \n     reasonable prices.\n       Rep. Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., (D. Mass.) said he believed \n     the ropewalk operation should continue. David Himmelfarb, \n     representing employees at the ropewalk, supported retention \n     of the operation.\n       June 10, Craig R. Sheaffer, Assistant Secretary of \n     Commerce, said his Department would work with the \n     Subcommittee to minimize instances of unfair government \n     competition.\n       June 11. Witnesses who testified on instances where they \n     said the government was offering unfair completion to private \n     businesses were Robert H. North, International Association of \n     Ice Cream Manufacturers; Hap Holliday, California Retail \n     Grocers; and C.E. Herington, Metal Treating Institute.\n     Liquor sold on Army posts\n       June 16. The group was told by Benjamin Josephs, \n     representing the National Retail Liquor Package Stores, Inc., \n     that illegal liquor sales on military posts were cutting in \n     on private businesses, causing big tax losses, misusing \n     government personnel and disrupting distribution of alcoholic \n     beverages.\n       Clem D. Johnston, a vice president of the Chamber of \n     Commerce of the U.S., called for a complete review and \n     curtailment of the ``Defense Department's vast empire of \n     commercial and industrial enterprise.'' He said that \n     Department was competing with private enterprise ``in nearly \n     very segment of our economy.''\n       Thomas B. Crowley of San Francisco, representing West Coast \n     tugboat and marine salvage operators, urged that the Navy be \n     removed from the salvage business.

Wilson Dec. 15, 1953 \n     ordered the military services to discontinue iron and steel \n     processing and other business activities which could be \n     performed satisfactorily by private firms.\n       Rep. Cecil M. Harden (R. Ind.), chairman of the \n     Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee, said Dec. 23 the \n     National Coffee Association had recommended that the \n     government close its coffee roasting plants and utilize the \n     services of commercial roasters exclusively. Mrs. Harden said \n     that this step would ``save millions of dollars to the \n     government annually.''\n     Defense Department policy\n       Quoting the directive from Secretary of Defense Wilson \n     which stated that it was the policy of the Department of \n     Defense ``not to engage in the operation of industrial or \n     commercial type facilities unless it can be demonstrated that \n     it is necessary for the government itself to perform the \n     required work.'' Mrs. Harden announced that the first step in \n     putting the directive into effect might be the closing of \n     most of the 61 military plants processing scrap iron.\n\n\n                                 house\n\n       Committee, Government Operations.\n       Reports.

The letter declared that S. 3794 or a \n     similar House bill (HR 9835) would ``help identify government \n     products and services which business and industry can provide \n     fully as well.''\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. In 1954, the House of Representatives passed a bill \nnumbered H.R. 9835, legislation to require the executive branch to \nincrease its reliance on the private sector--1954. Among the concerns \naddressed by the bill were manufacturing, construction and service \nactivities of the Federal Government. Final action on the bill was \ndropped only upon assurance from the Executive Branch that it would \nimplement the policy administratively. Bureau of the Budget Bulletin \n55-4 was issued in 1955, prohibiting agencies from\n\n[[Page S3937]]\n\ncarrying on any commercial activities which could be provided by the \nprivate sector. Unfortunately, today we face exactly the same problems \nCongress faced in 1954. The Federal Government continues not only to \ncompete with the private sector by providing its own goods and services \nbut it also competes with the private sector to provide those goods and \nservices for some other unit of Government or to other private sector \nentities. Of course, that unfair competition kills private-sector jobs, \nstifles the economy, erodes the tax base, and hurts small business.\n  One of the top issues the last several times the small business \ncommunity has held their White House conference--in 1980, 1986, and \n1994--was provision for an opportunity to fairly compete. To do that, \nof course, you have to have a process which takes into account all of \nthe costs for the Federal Government and the private sector and \nconsider other issues like past performance in order to have a fair \ncomparison. It also means over time an agency, if it were going to do a \nlot of contracting, would change its structure. Instead of being \ndesigned to perform these functions and contract out, you would pare \nthe agency down to where its real expertise would be in oversight and \nsupervision of functions that were to be done.\n  The bill that we have introduced, which I would like to encourage my \nfellow Senators to consider, codifies the policy that the Government \nshould rely on the private sector for its commercial needs. There are \nexceptions, of course--inherently governmental functions and exemptions \nfor national security concerns. In addition, the Federal Government, if \nit can provide a better value to the taxpayer, should do it. But if the \nprivate sector can provide a better value to American taxpayers, it \nshould have a chance to do it.\n  It also provides for OMB to examine these issues and establishes an \noffice of commercial activities within OMB to implement the bill.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we do consider some of these kinds of \nchanges. The climate is right for action. Congressman Duncan, with whom \nthe Senator from Kansas and I both served in the House, has introduced \na companion bill. The Senate is already on record in support of this \nbill. Last year, the Senate voted 59 to 39 in favor of an amendment to \nthe Treasury, Postal appropriations bill that would have prevented \nunfair Government competition. Unfortunately, it was dropped from the \nomnibus appropriations bill. It should be a high priority. We ought to \nbe doing some of these things that create fundamental change in the \nFederal Government. We are going to seek to balance the budget. We will \nsee in the future the benefit of setting those kinds of priorities. If \nwe could save $30 billion annually through this concept, that is a \nsizable amount of savings which could be transferred to something else \nor help balance the budget.\n  In summary, let me say again I think it is a shame we simply go on \nyear after year talking about the same agenda over time, the same kind \nof Government operation, without taking a look at some of the ways it \ncould be changed. The private sector operates differently, it has to \nevolve over time. If it does not change, it bows out; it goes out of \nbusiness.\n  So there is a compelling reason to make the changes. The Government \nby its nature--and there is nothing wrong with the people; it is the \nnature of the beast--does not change unless there are changes forced \nupon it, and, frankly, programs are developed and they have an advocacy \nin the country and they just do not change. I think that is our \nresponsibility. It is our responsibility to evaluate the effectiveness, \nto evaluate not only what is done or how many dollars are spent but \nresults. We are in the process now of implementing a result-oriented \nlaw that was passed a couple of years ago, and by this spring each \nagency is to have a fundamental, systemic plan that measures results. \nMy bill is consistent with that effort.\n  Mr. President, I urge my fellow Members of the Senate to consider \nsome fundamental changes in the Federal Government which would allow \nfor many of our small businesses to meet its commercial needs and \nprovide a better value to American taxpayers than they are currently \ngetting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3935-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3937-S3938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT AND MARKET ACCESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 646, the Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act, introduced by \nthe senior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Ford. This measure would provide \nthe American textile and apparel industry with clear oversight and \nenforcement of U.S. trade law, and the means to mobilize the industry's \ncapability to compete in the increasingly competitive global market.\n  For years, the U.S. textile and apparel sectors have been struggling \nto overcome the burdens of trade agreements that appear to mercilessly \nalter the textile and apparel quotas and tariffs systems, without \noffering the synergies necessary to compete under the new rules. \nUnfortunately, these burdens are magnified by unfair competition caused \nby overseas producers who seek to exceed and bypass these same \nnegotiated agreements.\n  In West Virginia, 2,900 textile and apparel jobs continue to survive, \nalthough the State has lost 3,000 of such jobs since 1990. Textile and \napparel jobs are predominantly located in the State's more rural \ncounties and are critical to the local economies. Additionally, these \nworkers may not have the assets to relocate or the skills to easily \ntransfer to another manufacturing sector.\n  I believe that even the strongest supporters of laissez-faire \neconomic ideologies must recognize the wisdom of negotiating trade \nagreements that avoid vast costs to, and unfair burdens on, particular \nsegments of our economy. I am not advocating some outmoded retreat to \nprotectionism. The United States must advocate open market and, at the \nsame time, promote an equitable and fair trade system in which the \nAmerican people have faith, in which American industries have a chance \nto compete, and which will curtail the shipping of American jobs \noverseas.\n  In this regard, I believe that the Customs Enforcement and Market \nAccess Act will provide the necessary impetus to remove the current \nobtrusive trade barriers from the textile and apparel industry, and \ninvigorate the industry's ability to effectively compete in the global \nmarket. The bill's market-access provisions provide requirements for \nvigorous enforcement of trade agreements and for aggressive action \nagainst unfair trade practices by establishing a Special 301 authority. \nI have long been an ardent supporter of Section 301 and Super 301, and \nI believe that it is essential that the United States Trade \nRepresentative have the tools to quickly make unfair trade practice \ndeterminations and then diligently monitor and enforce corrective \nmeasures.\n  This measure also allows reasonable federal investment to help the \ntextile and apparel industry modernize and more effectively compete \nagainst overseas competitors. I am aware that there are many who doubt \nthat the U.S. textile and apparel industries can re-establish \nthemselves to be competitive global forces and, thus, will oppose this \nmodest investment. I, however, do not doubt the abilities and spirit of \nthese workers, just as I never doubted the ability of this nation's \nsteel workers, who, against enormous odds, have today reclaimed their \nposition as world class producers, following many years of struggle and \nuncertainty. I ask my colleagues to carefully weigh such a small \ninvestment and its possible returns against the billions we expend \nannually on various corporate welfare schemes for multimillion dollar \nindustries.\n\n  Crafting trade policies that balance domestic and international \neconomic objectives is not easy. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin supporting the Customs Enforcement and Market Access Act, which I \nbelieve accurately assesses the challenges of the global market and \nadequately provides the\n\n[[Page S3938]]\n\ntools necessary to improve the competitive position of the U.S. textile \nand apparel industry.\n  In behalf of the textile and apparel workers in West Virginia, and \nthe nation, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Customs Enforcement and \nMarket Access Act. I thank Senator Ford for his leadership in \nintroducing the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3937-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAMILY PEACE DAY\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the first-annual Family Peace Day in Chicago, IL.\n  The goal of Family Peace Day is to focus attention on domestic abuse \nissues, how to combat domestic violence and build healthy families, to \naddress legal issues and to inform Illinois citizens of the resources \navailable to combat domestic violence.\n  Family Peace Day is a joint project of the Women's Bar Association of \nIllinois and the Black Women Lawyers' Association of Greater Chicago, \nInc. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Justice Mary Ann G. McMorrow of \nthe Illinois Supreme Court, Chief Judge Donald O'Connell of the Circuit \nCourt of Cook County, and Cook County Board President John H. Stroger, \nJr., are serving as honorary cochairs. Additional supporters include \nAttorney General James Ryan, Chicago Metropolitan Battered Women's \nDomestic Violence Network, Chicago Public Schools, Chief Judge Donald \nO'Connell's Domestic Violence Coordinating Council, Cook County State's \nAttorney Richard Devine, the Department of Children and Family \nServices, Illinois Family Violence Coordinating Council, and many \nlegal, judicial, health care, social service and nonprofit \norganizations, including the American Medical Association, the \nArchdiocese of Chicago, the Chicago Police Department, the Council for \nthe Jewish Elderly, the John Marshall Law School, the Mujeres Latinas \nEn Accion, and the Peace Museum. I commend these individuals and \norganizations for working together to help victims of domestic abuse \nand to teach individuals how to combat domestic violence and build \nhealthy families.\n  The Family Peace Day activities will begin with a press conference \nkickoff rally and award presentation to Chicago public school student \nwinners of poetry, prose, and poster contests depicting their vision of \na healthy family. There will be an Expo consisting of booths providing \nthe public free legal and medical advice and counseling or referrals \nfrom social service providers, health care providers, and attorneys \npracticing family law. At noon there will be a luncheon awards ceremony \nat the Palmer House Hilton, sponsored by the Circuit Court of Cook \nCounty, to honor those who have made significant contributions to the \nadministration of justice in the areas of domestic violence and abuse.\n  There can be no more important goal than healthy, safe, and strong \nfamilies. I am proud that Chicago is taking the lead in holding the \nfirst Family Peace Day and I look forward to communities around the \ncountry joining in with their own Family Peace Day activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3938-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this bill covers several subcommittees. \nIt is just easier to do it that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my privilege to present to the \nSenate S. 672, which provides emergency supplemental appropriations for \nnumerous natural disasters and defense overseas contingencies. This is \nmy first opportunity to come before the Senate as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I am very proud that this first bill from \nour committee focuses on assisting our fellow citizens in need. I am \nhumbled to be here with my good friend from West Virginia, the \ndistinguished former majority leader, minority leader, chairman of our \nAppropriations Committee, and now the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee. I can think of no one I have studied under \nlonger than Senator Byrd. It is a privilege to be here to present this \nbill with him today.\n  Our committee reported this bill on Wednesday, and the report has \nbeen available since last Thursday for Members. Many of our colleagues \nwill comment later on the terrible events which precipitated this \ndisaster relief bill. They represent the States involved, and I will \nleave it to them to comment on the specific situations in their own \nStates.\n  Our committee worked to target spending in this bill to the agencies \nand accounts that are responding to these crises now. The $5.5 billion \nprovided for emergency relief exceeds the President's request by $2.5 \nbillion. Some of these funds will not be spent this fiscal year. We \nsought to use the best estimates we could, but in many cases it will be \nweeks or months until a final assessment of damages can be made in \nthese disaster areas.\n  As has been widely reported, there are some controversial measures in \nthis bill. I do thank all my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee \nfor their cooperation during the markup last week. One clear conclusion \nwe reached was that not all the funds in this bill will be directed to \nthe most recent disasters. We have witnessed a steady increase in the \nPresidential disaster recommendations, which have radically increased \ndisaster relief costs. In addition, the President has waived the \nmatching requirement on many of the programs involved, adding to the \nFederal costs for these disasters. We cannot and will not try to solve \nthis problem on this bill, but it is something I believe must be \naddressed by Congress. There ought to be a clear understanding and a \nclear yardstick for disasters, regardless of the area involved.\n  All new spending in this bill is offset by corresponding rescissions \nor budget authority or canceling spending authority. This is sort of \ncomplicated. For budget scoring purposes, the disaster-related spending \nwill be treated as an emergency. Those outlays will not count against \nthis year's budget limits.\n  Part of this difference relates to how CBO scores appropriations \nbills. The Congressional Budget Office has a unique approach. When we \nappropriated funds for military personnel in September, the \nCongressional Budget Office scored those outlays--the money would \nactually be spent under the authorizations that were previously given \nby Congress--they were scored at 98 percent. Yet, when we rescind those \nsame funds in this bill, the Congressional Budget Office process \ncredits the committee with only 25 percent of the outlays as savings to \noffset the money spent. It is the same dollar, but we only get a \nportion of the credit. The moneys have already been spent; that is the \nproblem. The bias of the CBO process makes offsetting outlays a \ndaunting task this late in the fiscal year.\n  Our committee did not recommend general cuts against agencies to \noffset these disaster funds, and I urged Members not to propose \nreductions against the operating accounts of agencies. The disaster \nrelief funds proposed in the bill are not targeted or earmarked for any \nregion of the country. Again, I ask our colleagues to follow the \nsuggestions the Appropriations Committee\n\n[[Page S3939]]\n\nmade and hold to this practice during the consideration of this bill. \nThe needs of all persons and communities impacted by these crises are \nreal and pressing. Mr. President, some of these disasters occurred last \nyear, some this year. I do not believe we should--and I will oppose \nattempts to--tie the funds of agencies responsible for providing relief \nto the impacted regions. There is still much unknown about these \ndisasters, as I said before. I do not believe we should second-guess, \nnor should we micromanage from Congress, relief efforts at this stage. \nOnce more precise recovery plans are developed, we will have an \nopportunity in the fiscal year 1998 bills, which will be presented \nlater this year, to address some additional specific needs.\n  The bill also includes $1.8 billion for defense contingency \noperations. Earlier this year, I went with a delegation of Senators to \nBosnia and to Southwest Asia to review United States military \noperations there. We returned disturbed by the lack of concern about \nthe costs of the operations by our regional commanders. My staff and I \nhave been working since January with the comptroller at the Department \nof Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to establish procedures and \ncontrols to help control and monitor spending for overseas deployments. \nThis committee report before the Senate reduced the funds requested for \noverseas operations by $100 million. Already, to his great credit, \nSecretary Cohen has reduced unneeded units in both Bosnia and southwest \nAsia, and I believe more savings will be achieved during this fiscal \nyear.\n\n  In the case of unforeseen emergencies, our bill includes an \nadditional $100 million in reprogramming authority for the Department \nof Defense. In the past, the administration has increased spending on \nthese overseas operations without any consultation with Congress.\n  The commanders in the field discussed with the Senators I was with \nand myself, in January, in Bosnia, in Kuwait, in Saudi Arabia, and in \nconnection with the Bosnia operation in both Hungary and Italy, \ncommitments of 20 to 30 years for procurement for these overseas \ndeployments. They did so without the slightest concern or hesitation \nabout the costs involved. I believe that is a process that should stop. \nSpending on contingencies does not mean giving military commanders a \nblank check to commit us to expenditures far into the years to come for \ndeployments which have never been approved by Congress.\n  In fiscal year 1998, we will take specific steps to ensure fiscal \nconcerns are addressed on all peacekeeping operations. The Department \nof Defense now refers to missions such as Bosnia and Southwest Asia as, \n``operations other than war.'' Unfortunately, some spending practices \nof the Department, and particularly the regional commanders, assume \nwartime needs and are driven by wartime needs.\n  I want to assure the Senate and the Department that our committee \nwill tirelessly work to ensure that any of our forces deployed in the \nfield have everything they need to fight and win and maintain their \nsafety in any conflict. Their deployment, however, cannot be without \nthe participation of Congress. Ultimately we are called upon to pay the \nbill for such deployments.\n  We have had some disagreements with regard to this bill. I do not \nthink there has been any question, however, that all concerned wanted \nto report this bill to the Senate as quickly as possible to meet the \nneeds that I have spoken about. I hope the bill marks the commencement \nof a long and fruitful partnership among all members of the \nAppropriations Committee serving during this Congress. I do believe \nthat this bill can be completed by tomorrow evening, or Wednesday at \nthe latest. It will, of course, be our practice to await the passage of \nthe bill in the House before we take final action on this bill. And I \ndo hope all Senators will help us work toward the goal of being \nprepared to send the bill to conference as soon as the House has sent \nus their appropriations bill for these disasters.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as every Senator is aware, over the past \nwinter and now into spring, the Nation has been besieged by numerous \nnatural disasters that have wreaked havoc on hundreds of communities \nacross the country and have affected the lives of hundreds of thousands \nof our citizens. The damages from these disasters in terms of financial \nlosses run into the billions of dollars. Many people have lost many, if \nnot all, of their worldly possessions, things that they worked for for \na lifetime. Not only their homes and personal possessions have been \ndestroyed, but in many cases, entire communities have been wiped out, \nleaving many citizens with no means of livelihood.\n  It is only fitting that the President and the Senate should move as \nquickly as is humanly possible to address the financial costs of these \ndisasters and thereby, hopefully, help to lift the spirits of those who \nhave lost so much.\n  The bill now before the Senate contains more than $5.5 billion for \nthe various disaster assistance programs throughout the Federal \nGovernment to provide relief for the communities and the citizens of \nthose communities who have suffered devastation from these historic \nnatural disasters. The largest single amount, $3.5 billion, will go to \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, which has a major \nresponsibility in providing disaster relief. In addition, the bill \nprovides $650 million for emergency highway repairs resulting from \nfloods in the western, midwestern, northern plains and mid-Atlantic \nregions of the Nation between December of 1996 and April of this \nyear. This amount is $359 million more than requested by the \nadministration, but is fully supported by the President since the \ncommittee's recommendation covers the most recent estimates of highway \ndamages.\n\n  For the emergency conservation program, an appropriation of $77 \nmillion is included, together with $161 million for watershed and flood \nprevention operations. For the Economic Development Administration, the \nbill contains an appropriation of $54.7 million for emergency grants.\n  The bill also contains over $500 million for flood control and \noperations and maintenance accounts of the Corps of Engineers, and $187 \nmillion for emergency repairs of national parks, principally at \nYosemite National Park. There is an appropriation of $91 million for \nconstruction activities of the Fish and Wildlife Service for damages to \ntheir resources due to flooding and storms around the country. For the \nU.S. Forest Service, $68 million is provided for repairs, \nreconstruction, and restoration of their roads, facilities, fish and \nwildlife habitats, etc.\n  Finally, as recommended by the President, the bill contains $100 \nmillion for community development block grants, or CDBGs, to assist \ncommunities throughout the Nation with their emergency expenses in \ndealing with the tragic circumstances facing them as a result of these \nnatural disasters.\n  In all, Mr. President, some 33 States, including my own State of West \nVirginia, will qualify for these disaster assistance funds.\n  The bill also contains appropriations totaling over $1.8 billion for \ncontinuing operations by the Department of Defense in Bosnia and \nSouthwest Asia, as well as other non-emergency discretionary \nappropriations, including $58 million for WIC, $31 million for the \nDistrict of Columbia, and $100 million for payments to the United \nNations.\n  It is important to note that all of the fiscal year 1997 \ndiscretionary amounts provided in the bill have been offset by budget \nauthority cuts. The full amounts of emergency appropriations, $5.5 \nbillion, the nearly $1.8 billion in DoD appropriations, and the $273 \nmillion in regular, non-DoD supplementals have all been fully offset.\n  While I do not subscribe to the notion that emergency appropriations \nfor disaster assistance should have to be offset, I congratulate the \nchairman and the various subcommittee chairmen and ranking members who \nsearched for and found offsets sufficient to fully cover the entire \nbudget authority recommended in this bill.\n  I understand the administration is also supportive of these offsets, \nthe principal one being a rescission of $3.6 billion from HUD's Section \n8 housing program. These funds apparently cannot be obligated this \nfiscal year and, consequently, can be rescinded without causing undue \nharm to this program.\n\n[[Page S3940]]\n\n  The bill also contains a mandatory appropriation of $753 million for \nveterans' compensation and pensions. This amount is needed to pay for \nan increased caseload in this area, as well as the cost-of-living \nadjustment enacted last year for compensation benefits.\n  Senators should also be aware that the committee recommends an \nincrease in the 1997 highway obligation limit of $933 million. This is \nsome $615 million more than requested by the administration, but it is \nnecessary to ensure that no State receives less Federal-aid highway \napportionments than it got in 1996. Finally, the bill advances \nappropriations of $198 million for title I education funding for fiscal \nyear 1998.\n  So, in carrying out its responsibilities in providing these \ndesperately needed funds to hundreds of thousands of citizens in a \nfiscally responsible way, the committee has done well and I \ncongratulate the chairman, Senator Stevens, as well as the subcommittee \nchairmen and ranking members, who have primary responsibility over \nvarious portions of the bill.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, the bill reported by the committee \ncontains several non-emergency, controversial provisions which, if not \nremoved prior to the bill's being presented to the President, will \ncause him to veto the bill. There is no question about it, the \nPresident will veto S. 672, the pending measure, unless at least some \nof these objectionable provisions are removed. I have here a letter \naddressed to me from the Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, Franklin D. Raines, which addresses the administration's \nconcerns in a number of areas. Principal among those concerns is the \nso-called ``automatic CR'' language contained in title VII of the \npending measure. That provision was debated during the committee \nmarkup, after which my motion to strike the provision failed on a \nparty-line vote of 13 yeas to 15 nays. I shall have more to say about \nthis title and the reasons why I believe it should be stricken from the \nbill as the debate unfolds on S. 672.\n  A number of the other provisions in this bill to which the \nadministration objects were discussed during the committee markup, with \nseveral Senators indicating their intentions to offer floor amendments \non those provisions. Among those provisions are: one, a provision \nprohibiting the Department of Commerce from developing a plan for the \n2000 decennial census that would use sampling; two, a provision that \nwould waive certain portions of the Endangered Species Act; three, a \nprovision relating to the promulgation of rules on RS2477; and, \nfinally, a provision establishing a block grant to states to assist \nlegal immigrants losing their SSI and Medicaid eligibilities.\n  Additionally, I understand that there are several other possible \ncontroversial floor amendments which may be proposed by various \nSenators on a variety of issues.\n  Mr. President, I close by asking, why is it that the majority has \nchosen this bill, of all bills, to attach certain objectionable \namendments which the majority knows are controversial and which will \ncause a Presidential veto? I am not an advocate of even the \nconstitutional Presidential veto, and, of course, I am adamantly \nopposed to the line-item veto. But in the case of the constitutional \nPresidential veto, I am not an advocate of it but I certainly would \nexpect and would hope that the President would veto this bill if the \nautomatic CR provision remains in it when it reaches his desk. What \njustifiable reason can there be to hold this disaster assistance bill \nhostage to such riders that have nothing to do with the basic purposes \nof the bill?\n  Meanwhile, the hundreds of thousands of victims in 33 States who are \nsuffering from the ravages of the disasters which this bill addresses \nwill possibly have to wait. It suits the political agenda of the \nmajority to have this delay and the confrontation with the President, \nperhaps, and unless these matters are resolved here, or in conference \nwith the House, we may have to go through the veto process before we \nwill be able to get these funds enacted and out to the people who so \ndesperately need this assistance.\n  So, I entreat my colleagues to rethink their positions on such \ncontroversial, unrelated matters which have no business being included \non this bill. It is not too late to resolve these issues in ways that \nwill remove the likelihood that the President will veto this disaster \nassistance bill.\n  I, again, congratulate the chairman of the committee, Mr. Stevens, my \nlong-time friend, the Senator from Alaska, and I congratulate all of \nthe subcommittee chairmen and ranking members. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as you know, over the past several weeks, \ntowns and farms in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota have been \nbattered by the floodwaters of the Red River. It is impossible to \ndescribe the devastation that the flooded Red River is causing in \nMinnesota and North Dakota, because the enormity of the damage, so far, \nis far beyond what anyone has ever put into words.\n  The lives of those who live in the flooded areas have been shattered. \nEntire communities--homes, schools, churches, hospitals, libraries--\nhave literally been washed away. Thousands of residents have no home to \ngo to, so they crowd into shelters, unsure yet of what the river will \nleave behind when it finally releases its hold. Many cannot sleep \nbecause there is so much uncertainty. They cannot bathe because there \nis no running water. They cannot make plans because there are so many \nunanswered questions.\n  Mr. President, I have been working with the Governor of Minnesota and \nmy fellow Senators in the flood area to assess how to address the needs \nof these deserving people. Part of our effort has been to get the funds \nand assistance to rebuild through the supplemental appropriations bill \nthat will, hopefully, pass today or tomorrow or Wednesday at the \nlatest. Part of it has been to listen to the concerns of our \nconstituents and to make sure that they do get speedy assistance from \nthe agencies that are administering the State and Federal relief \nefforts.\n  While I have been involved in many efforts to ease the suffering of \nmy constituents, I am here today to offer as an amendment to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, along with my colleague from South \nDakota, Senator Johnson, the Depository Institution Disaster Relief \nAct. This amendment will complement the other relief efforts by making \nit easier for farmers, homeowners, small businesses and local \ngovernments to rebuild from the devastation that has been brought by \nthe floods.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 54\n\n(Purpose: To facilitate recovery from the recent flooding across North \n Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota by providing greater flexibility \n    for depository institutions and their regulators, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams], for himself and Mr. \n     Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 54.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n           TITLE ____--DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DISASTER RELIEF\n\n     SEC. ____01.

TRUTH IN LENDING ACT; EXPEDITED FUNDS \n                   AVAILABILITY ACT.\n\n       (a) Truth in Lending Act.--During the 180-day period \n     beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the Board may \n     make exceptions to the Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 \n     et seq.) for transactions within an area in which the \n     President, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 \n     et seq.), has determined that a major disaster exists, or \n     within an area determined to be eligible for disaster relief \n     under other Federal law by reason of damage related to the \n     1997 flooding of the Red River of the North and its \n     tributaries, if the Board determines that the exception can \n     reasonably be expected to alleviate hardships to the public \n     resulting from such disaster that outweigh possible adverse \n     effects.\n       (b) Expedited Funds Availability Act.--During the 180-day \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Board may make exceptions to the Expedited\n\n[[Page S3941]]\n\n     Funds Availability Act (12 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.) for \n     depository institution offices located within any area \n     referred to in subsection (a) if the Board determines that \n     the exception can reasonably be expected to alleviate \n     hardships to the public resulting from such disaster that \n     outweigh possible adverse effects.\n       (c) Time Limit on Exceptions.--Any exception made under \n     this section shall expire not later than the earlier of--\n       (1) 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act; or\n       (2) 1 year after the date of any determination referred to \n     in subsection (a).\n       (d) Publication Required.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of a determination under subsection (a), the Board shall \n     publish in the Federal Register a statement that--\n       (1) describes the exception made under this section; and\n       (2) explains how the exception can reasonably be expected \n     to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible \n     adverse effects.\n\n     SEC. ____03. DEPOSIT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.\n\n       The appropriate Federal banking agency may, by order, \n     permit an insured depository institution, during the 18-month \n     period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, to \n     subtract from the institution's total assets, in calculating \n     compliance with the leverage limit prescribed under section \n     38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o), an \n     amount not exceeding the qualifying amount attributable to \n     insurance proceeds, if the agency determines that--\n       (1) the institution--\n       (A) had its principal place of business within an area in \n     which the President, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. \n     Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, has \n     determined that a major disaster exists, or within an area \n     determined to be eligible for disaster relief under other \n     Federal law by reason of damage related to the 1997 flooding \n     of the Red River of the North and its tributaries, on the day \n     before the date of any such determination;\n       (B) derives more than 60 percent of its total deposits from \n     persons who normally reside within, or whose principal place \n     of business is normally within, areas of intense devastation \n     caused by the major disaster;\n       (C) was adequately capitalized (as defined in section 38 of \n     the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o)) before \n     the major disaster; and\n       (D) has an acceptable plan for managing the increase in its \n     total assets and total deposits; and\n       (2) the subtraction is consistent with the purpose of \n     section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1831o).\n\n     SEC. ____04. BANKING AGENCY PUBLICATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the 180-day period beginning on the \n     date of enactment of this Act, a qualifying regulatory agency \n     may take any of the following actions with respect to \n     depository institutions or other regulated entities whose \n     principal place of business is within, or with respect to \n     transactions or activities within, an area in which the \n     President, pursuant to section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford \n     Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, has determined \n     that a major disaster exists, or within an area determined to \n     be eligible for disaster relief under other Federal law by \n     reason of damage related to the 1997 flooding of the Red \n     River of the North and its tributaries, if the agency \n     determines that the action would facilitate recovery from the \n     major disaster:\n       (1) Procedure.--Exercise the agency's authority under \n     provisions of law other than this section without complying \n     with--\n       (A) any requirement of section 553 of title 5, United \n     States Code; or\n       (B) any provision of law that requires notice or \n     opportunity for hearing or sets maximum or minimum time \n     limits with respect to agency action.\n       (2) Publication requirements.--Make exceptions, with \n     respect to institutions or other entities for which the \n     agency is the primary Federal regulator, to--\n       (A) any publication requirement with respect to \n     establishing branches or other deposit-taking facilities; or\n       (B) any similar publication requirement.\n       (b) Publication Required.--Not later than 90 days after the \n     date of an action under this section, a qualifying regulatory \n     agency shall publish in the Federal Register a statement \n     that--\n       (1) describes the action taken under this section; and\n       (2) explains the need for the action.\n       (c) Qualifying Regulatory Agency Defined.--For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``qualifying regulatory agency'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Board;\n       (2) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency;\n       (3) the Office of Thrift Supervision;\n       (4) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;\n       (5) the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council;\n       (6) the National Credit Union Administration; and\n       (7) with respect to chapter 53 of title 31, United States \n     Code, the Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n     SEC. ____05. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that each Federal financial \n     institutions regulatory agency should, by regulation or \n     order, make exceptions to the appraisal standards prescribed \n     by title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, \n     and Enforcement Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3331 et seq.) for \n     transactions involving institutions for which the agency is \n     the primary Federal regulator with respect to real property \n     located within a disaster area pursuant to section 1123 of \n     the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement \n     Act of 1989 (12 U.S.C. 3352), if the agency determines that \n     the exceptions can reasonably be expected to alleviate \n     hardships to the public resulting from such disaster that \n     outweigh possible adverse effects.\n\n     SEC. ____06. OTHER AUTHORITY NOT AFFECTED.\n\n       Nothing in this title limits the authority of any \n     department or agency under any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. ____07. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this title, the following definitions shall \n     apply:\n       (1) Appropriate federal banking agency.--The term \n     ``appropriate Federal banking agency'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 \n     U.S.C. 1813).\n       (2) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Board of Governors \n     of the Federal Reserve System.\n       (3) Federal financial institutions regulatory agency.--The \n     term ``Federal financial institutions regulatory agency'' has \n     the same meaning as in section 1121 of the Financial \n     Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 \n     (12 U.S.C. 3350).\n       (4) Insured depository institution.--The term ``insured \n     depository institution'' has the same meaning as in section 3 \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813).\n       (5) Leverage limit.--The term ``leverage limit'' has the \n     same meaning as in section 38 of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o).\n       (6) Qualifying amount attributable to insurance proceeds.--\n     The term ``qualifying amount attributable to insurance \n     proceeds'' means the amount (if any) by which the \n     institution's total assets exceed the institution's average \n     total assets during the calendar quarter ending before the \n     date of any determination referred to in section \n     ____03(1)(A), because of the deposit of insurance payments or \n     governmental assistance made with respect to damage caused \n     by, or other costs resulting from, the major disaster.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Depository Institution Disaster Relief \nAct will help speed up the pace of recovery for flooded farms and \ntowns. Our amendment will permit homeowners, farmers, and small \nbusinesses to have faster access to a larger pool of credit from the \nbanks and credit unions that serve their communities by ensuring that \nthere will be no regulatory roadblocks to local lending. It will permit \nFederal banking and credit union regulators to make temporary \nexceptions to current laws that act to reduce access to banks and \ncredit unions in disaster areas. It will also permit Federal regulators \nto provide temporary relief from regulations so that it will be easier \nfor flood victims to get loans.\n  The temporary regulatory relief offered by this bill is strictly \nlimited to those counties in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota \nthat have been declared Federal disaster areas. Because of its targeted \nscope and limited duration, it will permit flood victims to rebuild \ntheir homes, farms, and businesses without compromising the integrity \nof our banking system.\n  When I served in the House of Representatives, I authored similar \nlegislation in 1993 during the Mississippi River flooding. My \nlegislation received bipartisan support and was signed into law by \nPresident Clinton as part of the supplemental appropriations bill for \ndisaster relief. Since this legislation worked well to help flooded \ncommunities rebuild in 1993, I am here to urge my colleagues to again \nsupport this amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this \namendment's provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997\n\n                                Purpose\n\n       Over the past several weeks, towns and farms in Minnesota, \n     North Dakota and South Dakota have been demolished by the \n     flood waters of the Red River of the North, its tributaries, \n     and other rivers. Because of the extreme level of flood \n     damage, President Clinton has declared these areas to be \n     eligible for federal disaster relief pursuant to Section 401 \n     of the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.\n       The Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act (``DIDRA'') \n     will significantly speed up the pace of recovery for the \n     flooded farms and towns. DIDRA will permit homeowners, \n     farmers, small-businesses and local governments in the flood \n     disaster areas to have\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\n     faster access to a larger pool of credits from the banks, \n     thrifts and credit unions that serve their communities. DIDRA \n     will do this by permitting federal financial institution \n     regulators to make temporary exceptions to current laws that \n     (1) hamper the ability of banks, thrifts and credit unions to \n     reopen their doors to depositors, (2) slow down the lending \n     process and (3) reduce the availability of credit.\n\n                         Summary of Provisions\n\n     Section 1--Title of statute\n       The bill is called the ``Depository Institution Disaster \n     Relief Act of 1997'' (DIDRA). This bill contains provisions \n     that are substantially identical to temporary emergency \n     relief legislation that was signed into law in 1992 and 1993.\n     Section 2(a)--Exceptions to Truth In Lending Act\n       The Federal Reserve Board may make exceptions to the Truth \n     In Lending Act (TILA) for loans given by a bank, thrift or \n     credit union that is in the disaster area. The exceptions \n     must be made within 180 days of enactment of DIDRA, and may \n     only last a maximum of one year. For example, this permits \n     the Federal Reserve Board to permit consumers to receive the \n     proceeds from their loans 3 days faster by permitting them to \n     sign preprinted forms that waive their 3 day right of \n     rescission period pursuant to Section 125 of TILA (15 U.S.C. \n     1635).\n     Section 2(b)--Exceptions to Expedited Funds Availability Act\n       The Federal Reserve Board may make exceptions to the \n     Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) to any bank, thrift \n     or credit union in the disaster area, so that they may \n     restart their check processing operations sooner. The \n     exceptions must be made within 180 days of enactment of \n     DIDRA, and may only last for a maximum of one year. For \n     example, this permits the Federal Reserve Board to let a \n     bank, thrift or credit union restart serving its customers \n     even though the disruption from the flooding makes it need \n     more than one business day to process cash deposits and \n     government checks as required by Section 603 of EFAA (12 \n     U.S.C. 4002).\n     Section 3--Exception to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to \n         Permit the Deposit of Insurance Proceeds in Bank Accounts\n       Farms, businesses and local governments in the flood \n     disaster areas will be receiving large amounts of insurance \n     proceeds. This money will invariably be deposited in banks, \n     thrifts and credit unions for a short duration until the \n     money is used for rebuilding. Unfortunately, the depositing \n     of large amounts of insurance proceeds may cause banks and \n     thrifts to be deemed undercapitalized pursuant to Section 38 \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance (FDIA) (12 U.S.C. 1831o). \n     This could cause credit to dry up in the disaster areas, as \n     Section 38 would automatically require a depository \n     institution to file a capital restoration plan with the FDIC, \n     even if the insurance proceeds were invested in assets \n     creating little additional risk to the depository \n     institution. Section 38 of the FDIA would compel a depository \n     institution to obtain formal approval from the FDIC in order \n     not to be restricted in its lending policies. Section 3 of \n     DIDRA permits the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC \n     and the OTS to subtract insurance proceeds from the \n     depository institution's assets when they calculate whether \n     the depository institution meets the FDIA's minimum leverage \n     standards (i.e., equity capitalization requirements). Any \n     exception that the regulators make to Section 38 of FDIA will \n     expire after 18 months.\n     Section 4--Authority of Regulators to Act Quickly to \n         Facilitate Recovery in Disaster Areas\n       Within 180 days after the enactment of DIDRA, a qualifying \n     regulatory agency is given the flexibility to take any \n     actions permitted under its existing statutory authority to \n     facilitate recovery in the disaster area without being \n     delayed or impeded by (1) having to provide a general notice \n     of proposed rule-making in the Federal Register, (2) having \n     to hold a hearing, (3) being restricted by time limits with \n     respect to agency action or (4) having to meet certain \n     publication requirements. However, within 90 days of taking \n     an action, the qualifying regulatory agency must publish in \n     the Federal Register a statement that (1) describes what it \n     did and (2) explains the need for the action.\n     Section 5--Sense of Congress re: Exceptions to Appraisal \n         Requirements\n       The Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992 (PL \n     102-485, Oct. 23, 1992) amended the Financial Institutions \n     Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) to give \n     regulators the authority to waive certain appraisal standards \n     in disaster areas. The waiver of certain appraisal standards \n     for real estate loans in disaster areas will (1) permit homes \n     to be rebuilt faster by expediting the lending process and \n     (2) lower the cost of receiving loans to rebuild such homes. \n     Section 1123 of FIRREA (12 U.S.C. 3353) currently permits the \n     OCC, OTS, FDIC, Federal Reserve Board and NCUA to waive such \n     appraisal standards for 3 years in disaster areas.\n       Section 5 of DIDRA states that it is the sense of the \n     Congress that these federal regulators should exercise their \n     authority under Section 1123 of FIRREA to temporarily waive \n     such standards.\n     Section 6--Limitation of DIDRA\n       DIDRA shall not limit the authority of any federal agency \n     under any other provision of law.\n     Section 7--Definitions\n       This section defines certain terms used in DIDRA: (1) \n     appropriate federal banking agency, (2) Board, (3) Federal \n     financial institutions regulatory agency, (4) insured \n     depository institution, (5) leverage limit, and (6) \n     qualifying amount attributable to insurance proceeds.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Depository Institution Disaster Relief \nAct is a carefully crafted amendment. It has been reviewed and approved \nby the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from the Treasury \nDepartment, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: Thank you for requesting the \n     Treasury's views on S. 652, the Depository Institution \n     Disaster Relief Act of 1997, which seeks to speed the \n     recovery of areas flooded by the Red River of the North in \n     Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.\n       In 1992 and 1993, Congress passed similar legislation in \n     response to natural disasters. Like those bills, S. 652 would \n     permit the federal regulators of banks, savings associations, \n     and credit unions to make temporary exceptions to statutes \n     and regulations that may hamper the reopening of these \n     institutions, slow down the lending process, and reduce the \n     availability of credit. This authority is intended to \n     facilitate providing much needed financial services to \n     disaster victims, and would have no adverse effect on the \n     safety and soundness of depository institutions.\n       We share Congress's interest in assisting the victims of \n     natural disasters and support the passage of S. 652.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               John D. Hawke, Jr.,\n     Under Secretary of Domestic Finance.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: Thank you for inviting the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corporation to comment on S. 652, the \n     Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997 (DIDRA), \n     which would allow the FDIC and other federal financial \n     institution regulatory agencies flexibility in enforcing \n     capital and other standards for financial institutions \n     located or doing substantial business within the flood-\n     affected areas of the Red River of the North.\n       The FDIC is sensitive to the special needs that accompany \n     natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and major \n     storms, and we support the intent of DIDRA to facilitate \n     recovery from such disasters. The federal agencies have been \n     granted and have used similar temporary authority during past \n     disasters.\n       Certain laws and regulations that are beneficial and \n     protect public policy interests in normal times may hamper an \n     insured institution's ability to respond quickly in providing \n     financial services during disasters. We have learned in the \n     past, when natural disasters affect communities, granting \n     very limited relief from such laws does not affect the safety \n     and soundness of insured institutions. Insured institutions \n     continue to be subject to active supervision and bank \n     management is always expected to act in a prudent manner. It \n     is unlikely that regulated institutions would purposely harm \n     themselves or their customers, or cause a loss to the \n     insurance fund solely due to the kind of temporary relief \n     called for by the legislation. If any institution were to \n     become involved in unacceptable activities, the federal \n     financial institution regulatory agencies have substantial \n     enforcement powers to compel correction.\n       The FDIC supports S. 652 as a reasonable proposal to assist \n     communities in their recovery from this natural disaster. I \n     appreciate the opportunity to comment on this important \n     issue, and the FDIC stands ready to help in any way it can. \n     Please let me know if you have further questions or concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ricki Helfer,\n     Chairman.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                               Board of Governors,\n\n\n                                       Federal Reserve System,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This letter responds to your request for the \n     Board's views on S. 652, ``The Depository Institution \n     Disaster Relief Act of 1997,'' which you introduced to help \n     speed recovery from the recent flooding of the Red River in \n     Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The bill would \n     allow the Board to make temporary exceptions to the\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\n     requirements of the Truth in Lending and Expedited Funds \n     Availability Acts; would allow the federal banking agencies \n     to permit insured institutions to temporarily exclude certain \n     insurance proceeds from their capital calculations; and would \n     allow the agencies to take actions to facilitate recovery \n     without regard to certain procedural requirements, such as \n     those of the Administrative Procedure Act. S. 652 also \n     contains a ``Sense of the Congress'' resolution calling on \n     the banking agencies to use their existing authority to waive \n     the appraisal requirements of Title XI of FIRREA.\n       As you know, the proposal closely tracks legislation \n     enacted in 1992 and 1993 in the wake of earlier natural \n     disasters. Based on our experience in administering those \n     similar laws, the Board believes that S. 652 would provide \n     the regulators with useful flexibility that would assist in \n     the disaster-recovery process. Accordingly, the Board \n     supports its enactment.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to share the Board's views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan Greenspan,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this amendment has the support of the \nchairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, and \nalso the ranking member of that committee, Senator Paul Sarbanes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators D'Amato and Bennett be added as \ncosponsors to S. 652, the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, we need to assure the people of Minnesota, North \nDakota, and South Dakota that the Senate stands behind them, and the \nentire Congress and the President should stand behind them as well.\n  I urge swift action on my amendment to the emergency supplemental \nappropriations, which I hope will have the overwhelming, bipartisan \nsupport of my colleagues when it comes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I also ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nDepository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997 as a \nnoncontroversial and bipartisan amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill being considered on the floor of the Senate today.\n  I want to particularly extend thanks to Senator Stevens and Senator \nByrd for their assistance on this amendment and support of this \namendment, as well as their very timely action on the underlying \nsupplemental appropriations legislation. And thanks to Senator D'Amato \nand Senator Sarbanes of the Banking Committee for their support as \nwell, and, of course, to Senator Grams, my colleague from Minnesota, \nwho has done extraordinary work on this legislation. I am proud to join \nhim as a cosponsor of S. 652.\n  We have had an incredible series of catastrophic events in the \nNorthern Plains, in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. It is \nabsolutely essential that this body move expeditiously to provide as \nmuch assistance as possible to get individuals, families, businesses, \nand local governments back on their feet.\n  This amendment would give the banking regulators the authority to cut \nthrough red tape to expedite the handling of loans and deposits for \nbanks, credit unions, and savings and loans in order to move along the \nrebuilding of our part of the country as quickly as possible.\n  This legislation has the support of both FDIC and the Federal \nReserve. In our three States we have suffered vitally over these last \nseveral months. Hundreds of thousands of livestock have been lost, \nroads are under water, schools closed, hospitals closed. Family \nbusinesses are in tremendous stress right now. It is absolutely \nessential that we provide every element of assistance we possibly can.\n  I share Senator Grams' belief that this legislation will be one more \npiece of the puzzle necessary to reach that goal. The predecessor of \nthis legislation was a similar amendment enacted in 1992 and 1993. So \nthis is a step that has been taken in the past when our Nation has been \nundergoing stressful disaster circumstances.\n  It is very, very appropriate during this year that we reintroduce \nthis amendment to provide this kind of temporary but very important \nrelief. Again, this amendment is bipartisan. It should be \nnoncontroversial.\n  I again commend Senator Grams for his leadership in bringing this \namendment to the floor.\n  I yield back.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is our understanding that this \namendment that Senator Grams has presented to us continues the \nprecedent that was established by his legislation when he was a Member \nof the other body in 1993.\n  We have examined the proposed amendment and have been informed that \nthe Banking Committee of the Senate is in agreement with it. Under the \ncircumstances, I know of no opposition to the amendment on this side of \nthe aisle, and we are prepared to accept it. I do note the Senator has \nasked for the yeas and nays, but perhaps we can dispose of it today if \nit is possible.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know of no objections on this side of the \naisle. But I do await a response to my call to a Senator so that I can \nascertain whether or not this is indeed the case. Until that time, I \nshall have to withhold my approval.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Very well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \ntemporarily set aside so that the bill will be open for other \namendments.\n  We will await the clearance that Senator Byrd has mentioned. I \nannounce that it will be the policy of the committee to have these \nvotes take place, on any amendments presented today, at a time to be \ndesignated by the majority leader, after consultation with the minority \nleader, tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator asks unanimous consent \nto lay aside this amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \nGrams amendment for the time being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just want to rise today and talk a little \nbit about the supplemental bill and the needs that are awaiting in \nMinnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota as well. As a Senator whose \nstate has been devastated by the flooding of the Red and Minnesota \nRivers, I rise in strong support of the emergency supplemental that is \nbefore us. I have personally assessed the destruction on several \noccasions over the past few weeks. If I had not seen the damage myself, \nit would have been difficult to comprehend the severe impact the snows \nand floods have had on my State of Minnesota.\n\n  My colleagues know of Minnesota's reputation for snow and cold. We \nare a hardy people and we pride ourselves on our ability to endure even \nthe worst winters. But when we receive 3 years' worth of snow in a \nsingle season --that is more than 10 to 12 feet--even Minnesotans can \nreach their limit. To make matters worse, we have had to endure several \nstraight years of above-average rainfall. With the arrival of spring \nthis year, there was no place for the snow to go, other than into \nrivers unable to bear the melt-off.\n  Many Americans watched the television coverage of Grand Forks, ND, \nand sympathized with the displaced residents of that community when the \nflood waters swept into town. They saw the burning buildings which have \ndestroyed nearly a city block, all in a sea of water. But just across \nthe Red River, on the Minnesota side, is East Grand Forks, a town of \nnearly 10,000 people. Their mayor, Lynn Stauss, whom I have talked to \nseveral times over the last few weeks, has had to deal with a town that \nhas no water, has no electricity, and has no sewer system.\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\n  When I was last in East Grand Forks, most of its homes and businesses \nwere under water. Now that the waters are receding, assessment of the \ndamage is continuing and, of course, the expenses are mounting. Willem \nSchrage, a Minnesota Department of Agriculture employee, returned to \nhis home and found his basement backed up with 2 feet of sewage. \nActually, he said he is one of the lucky ones, and says, ``Things could \nbe worse. At least I still have my home.''\n  As you know, about 3 weeks ago, just as the spring thaw began to \nswell the rivers, Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit with another \nblizzard that dumped a couple of additional feet of snow. This \ncontributed greatly to the severe flooding already predicted.\n  At the time of year when farmers should be out in the fields, \nplanting, they were out helping their neighbors sandbag to try to \nminimize the damage. Randy Tufton is an example of that. He is the \ndirector of the Farm Service Agency in Ada, MN, and wanted to spend his \ntime helping farmers get the advice and financial assistance they need \nto cope with the floods. But instead, Randy found himself sandbagging \nhis own home for several days. He had to travel by motorboat just to \nget to his house.\n\n  Jerry Larson, a seed potato grower in the town of Climax, is another \nsuch example. Instead of planting this year, he is helping another \nfarmer to try to save his home. Many of our farmers will be losing \ntheir homes and farm buildings to the floods. While some of them will \nbe able to start planting after the water recedes, many are still \nunable to do so and may lose their income for this year. We had almost \n2 million acres of farmland in our region under water. In the Red River \nValley, one of the most fertile areas of the country, this is a \ncrippling blow to our agricultural economy.\n  Now we are coming to that time of year when high school students \nshould be thinking about their proms and their graduation festivities. \nInstead, Don Vellenga, who is the superintendent of Ada Borup Public \nSchools in Ada is now meeting with FEMA officials to discuss replacing \nthe high school, 67 percent of which has been damaged. There will be no \nprom this year at the high school and there will be no graduation \nceremony either. Don Vellenga, by the way, after meeting with FEMA \nofficials about the school during the day, goes home to a house that \nhas 4 feet of standing water in the basement.\n  In Breckenridge, at Breckenridge Elementary, Jeri Yaggie, president \nof the school board, is meeting with FEMA officials and wondering if \nthe school will be replaced, as parents ask where their first graders \nwill begin school this fall.\n  Hospital administrators normally spend their time providing for the \ncare of their patients. Laura Nelson, who is program director of Bridge \nMedical Services in Ada, is now looking for ways to get the additional \nmoney needed to replace the hospital there.\n  In Moorhead, I was impressed by the dedication of our young people as \nthey worked alongside their parents and their neighbors in filling \nsandbags against the rising waters. In East Grand Forks, there was an \narmy of volunteers to feed the hungry, who found shelter for the \nhomeless, and comforted thousands more as the Red River was swallowing \nan entire community. Their determination repeatedly reminded me of the \nspirit that brought us together as communities and will keep us \ntogether as communities.\n  It was a week ago today, that I spoke about the flooding crisis \nbefore a joint session of our Minnesota State Legislature. I was proud \nto be accompanied by seven Minnesotans who know all too well the \nstruggle it has taken to fight the floods. They were representatives of \nthe towns that have suffered some of the worst damage, and they deserve \nour appreciation for guiding their communities through this nightmare. \nI want to take a moment to mention them by name. They were: Mayor \nRussell Onstad of Ada, Mayor Kal Michels of Breckenridge, Mayor Donald \nOsborne of Crookston, Mayor Lynn Stauss of East Grand Forks, Mayor \nDavid Smiglewski of Granite Falls, Mayor Jim Curtiss of Montevideo, and \nalso City Council President Millie McLeod of Moorhead, who was there \nfor Mayor Lanning at the meeting. They have served their neighbors well \nduring these trying times.\n  FEMA has done an outstanding job in Minnesota, and I would like to \npersonally thank the staff, from the Director Mr. Witt, all the way \ndown, for their yeoman-like efforts to be on the scenes and to help \nprovide assistance to Minnesotans and those in North and South Dakota.\n  When I inspected the flood damage with President Clinton, I was \nassured that the Government would help the people of Minnesota recover \nfrom its devastation. A week ago, the majority leader and our floor \nleader here today, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, made similar pledges during meetings with Minnesota Governor \nArne Carlson and me.\n  I would like to thank Senator Stevens for reporting out the emergency \nsupplemental so rapidly. We all know how difficult it is to determine \nthe exact extent of damage until the cleanup and the rebuilding is \nunderway, but I believe the committee did an outstanding job to address \nthe needs of the 23 States that have suffered disasters over the past \nfew months. The total $5.581 billion for disaster relief is desperately \nneeded.\n  The $100 million for CDBG, the EDA money, and the assistance provided \nby USDA, including the livestock indemnity program in the supplemental, \nare crucial for Minnesota, where losses could add up to more than $1 \nbillion once we have been able to accurately assess our damages.\n  Governor Carlson expressed his support for the President's requests \nof $2.3 billion for FEMA and $100 million for CDBG in the supplemental \nwhen he was here in Washington as well last week. At the same time, he \nrecognized that once we obtain an accurate accounting, additional \nrelief could be pursued through the 1998 appropriations process, and/or \na future supplemental request that would be made by the President.\n  I am also pleased that the committee included language I supported \nthat would provide more flexibility in the granting of CDBG funds. That \nlanguage was useful to the State of Minnesota, as you know, after the \n1993 Mississippi River flooding and was requested by the State for this \nyear's flood as well. Some have raised concerns that it is too early to \nfully estimate the extent of the damage and therefore we may find \nourselves with inadequate funding in this bill. To address those \nconcerns, I am working with my colleagues from North Dakota, South \nDakota, and Minnesota on an amendment that would add additional funding \nfor CDBG and EDA that represents a better estimate of what we believe \nthe damages will be in our three States. The amendment would also \ninclude funding for meeting the education needs of displaced students \nin our States plus several other smaller items that are not covered yet \nin the bill.\n\n  The amendment would be a compromise among the three States and \nhopefully the appropriators, who believe they have addressed our needs \nfor the remainder of this fiscal year and prefer to consider longer-\nterm rebuilding requests through the regular appropriations process. It \nwould be offset with current budget authority.\n  Mr. President, earlier I discussed some of the devastation faced by \nMinnesota farmers, many of whom are still not sure when they can begin \nplanting for this year. I strongly support the efforts by Secretary \nGlickman to help farmers through authorization of CRP grazing, \nincreasing the Emergency Loan Assistance Program, deferring payments \nfor FSA borrowers, and inclusion of more farm losses under FEMA itself.\n  Since it is uncertain whether existing agriculture or FEMA programs \nwill address the needs of all Minnesota farmers, I have also asked \nSecretary Glickman to consider extending the delayed planting deadline \nfor crop insurance, as well. I have requested clarifications on how, or \nwhether, the disaster relief would cover soil erosion and other run-off \nproblems.\n  I have asked the Secretary to consider using existing authority under \nCCC to address the grain storage losses of Minnesota farmers, as well \nas other property losses suffered by farmers who may not currently \nqualify for the Emergency Loan Assistance Program.\n  Mr. President, I want to note again that earlier this afternoon I \noffered my amendment, the Depository Institution\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\nDisaster Relief Act of 1997, or more commonly referred to as DIDRA, \nwhich would facilitate and increase the availability of credit in the \ndisaster areas of all 23 States.\n  It is noncontroversial, costs nothing, and is supported by the \nBanking Committee chairman and ranking member, and my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Johnson. I urge support from all of my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, the funds provided by the emergency supplemental will \nfacilitate the cleanup effort, which has just begun. We know it will \ntake many months and possibly several years. The worst part of a \ndisaster like this is the aftermath, when the extent of the damage \nfinally sinks in to all who have suffered losses. It is a time when we \nneed to reach out to those within the disaster area and let them know \nthey have our full support.\n  It is gestures like that of the California woman who contributed \n$2,000 apiece to thousands of suffering flood victims as one we will \nremember for some time. She is one of many heroes of the floods whose \nefforts will never be fully recognized.\n  To ensure that I am thoroughly appraised of every step in the \ncleanup, I have opened an office in Crookston with FEMA to have staff \non location to provide whatever assistance we can to facilitate \navailable relief. I want to assure my constituents that I will not \nallow them to be forgotten now that the flood waters have receded.\n  Mr. President, I again want to thank the Senate for its efforts to \nfacilitate this needed relief legislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am advised that Senator Mikulski says that \nif Mr. Sarbanes has cleared the Grams-Johnson amendment, she has no \nobjection to it as the ranking member of the VA/HUD subcommittee. \nTherefore, I know of no objection on this side of the bill. I am ready \nand willing to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and \nit is my understanding that the Senator would prefer a vote, and the \nleadership does prefer we have a vote to start the day off at a \nspecific time tomorrow. Therefore, I ask this amendment now be set \naside, to come before the Senate for a rollcall vote at a time \nspecified by the leadership, the majority leader after consultation \nwith the minority leader later today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request of the Senator \nfrom Alaska is ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed as in morning business for the purpose of introducing a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reid pertaining to the introduction of S. 692 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 55\n\n (Purpose: To make a technical correction which adjusts the rescission \n   for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense program to the correct \n   fiscal year of appropriations for Research, Development, Test and \n                       Evaluation, Defense-Wide)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 55.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have several matters to discuss with \nthe Senate this afternoon. The first one I would like to touch upon has \nto do with the budget agreement that was reached over the weekend \nbetween negotiators on behalf of the Congress and the President of the \nUnited States.\n  There has been a lot of conversation over the weekend on the talk \nshows about how terrible this agreement is. I have read where Democrats \nhave attacked the agreement on the grounds that President Clinton has \ncaved in to Republican demands. One Democratic commentator, a former \nstaffer to the President, has said this deal guarantees the reelection \nof a Republican-controlled Congress in 1998. It is just awful.\n  Then another commentator says this deal demonstrates how badly the \nRepublicans have caved in to the President. It means the President can \nno longer be attacked for his failure to step up to the responsibility \nof dealing with taxes in a logical way or of dealing with Medicare in a \nresponsible way. It is just awful.\n  There are some who say, when both sides say it is just awful, that \nmeans it is truly awful. And then there are others who say, no, when \nboth sides agree it is not what they want, it means we have finally \narrived at the logical answer, somewhere down the middle.\n  I think all of this is a little bit shortsighted. I want to stand and \ncommend those who were involved in the negotiations for having \naccomplished something truly worthwhile. Does it do what I would like \nit to do in relation to the Tax Code? The answer is, ``Clearly not.'' \nWe need to do far more about our taxes than this deal will do. Does it \nsolve the Medicare problem in a responsible, long-term way? The answer \nis, ``Clearly not.'' It simply postpones the issue until we will have \nto deal with Medicare again. This, too, I find disappointing. In both \ninstances we will see the details come up in the Finance Committee, and \nI hope the Finance Committee, within the parameters of the deal, can \nfashion resolutions to these problems that are better than the ones \nthat we have seen talked about in the press up until now.\n  But as we complain, one side and the other, about the deal not being \nwhat we would like, we overlook what I think is a truly significant \naccomplishment. For the first time in my watching of this process, \neither as a Member of the Senate or as an observer from the outside, we \nhave a budget deal that does not depend upon smoke and mirrors for its \nbudget figures to be reliable. We have a budget deal that does not say \nwe will postpone all of the hard decisions to the fourth and fifth or \nsixth years. Instead, it says we will start to face the realities of \nwhat is happening around us right now. That is a very significant \nthing.\n  The second thing I would like to comment on with respect to this deal \nwas given reference to in this morning's Wall Street Journal in their \neditorial. They said the real hero of these budget negotiations is \nneither the administration nor the Congress, but the American economy. \nThe reason we were able to finally arrive at a conclusion that seemed \nto satisfy temporarily both sides is because the economy is doing so \nwell that the projections indicate that we will have more tax revenue \nthan the earlier projections would have shown. I want to dwell on that \nfor a moment. I gave a major speech on the floor a week or so ago in \nwhich I tried to get across the importance of the overall growth of the \neconomy in our budget discussions. We talk about the budget as if \neverything is a sum zero game, that is, if we take it away from here, \nyou must give it someplace else, and everything adds up to a single \nsum.\n\n  That is not the case. The economy is like a business, constantly \ngrowing, constantly changing. I made the point in that previous speech \nthat a sound business executive running a $1.7 trillion corporation \nwould not have the simple choice of either raising prices or cutting \nspending. We hear the discussion on the floor so often that those are \nour only two choices in Government. We can either raise tax rates, \nwhich is the same thing as raising prices for a business, or we can cut \nspending, when, in fact, every business executive knows there are times \nwhen you can raise your prices and get away with it, and there are \ntimes when you should cut your prices in order to increase your market \nshare. There are times when you do need to cut spending if it is \nwasteful or improper, but there are other times, when you are investing \nin the future, where you need to increase spending. This budget, for \nthe first time in many years, seems to go down those roads.\n  There are some areas where we are cutting tax rates, as we should--\ncutting prices, if you will--to increase our market share and make the \neconomy healthier. There are other places where we do need to cut some \nspending, and some places where we need to increase some spending. That \nis what upsets so many of my colleagues on the right side of the aisle. \nThey treat all Government spending as if it is, per se, evil, and any \nsingle dollar they can cut out of the budget they assume is good.\n  They remind me a little of an executive I knew in a company who was \nunder heavy pressure to start to produce profits in his division. He \nresponded to that pressure, and pretty soon the profits started to come \nin. His boss thought he was a hero. He said, ``Well, I did it by \ncutting spending.''\n  It was a year or so later that we discovered in that company what \nkind of spending he had cut. He had cut routine maintenance, and the \nphysical plant over which he had responsibility was literally falling \napart because the routine maintenance had not been done. He was a \ntemporary hero by cutting spending, but, long term, he damaged the \nbusiness and did damage to the interests of the shareholders.\n  Our Nation's infrastructure has some significant problems. The air \ntransport problems are very obvious to all. The highway problems are \nfairly significant and obvious. We need to be doing something about \nthat. This budget allows us to have some of that, yes, increased \nspending in areas where it makes some sense. Why? Again, because the \neconomy is doing so well.\n  I have been on this floor when some of my friends have berated Alan \nGreenspan and said what a terrible job he is doing at the Fed because \nhe has controlled the money supply in a way that they do not like. Can \nwe now suggest it may well be that the current growth of the economy \nstems from wise stewardship at the Fed, and that, indeed, the reason we \ncan afford some of these increased spending activities called for in \nthis budget come from an intelligent management of the economy long \nterm. Can we also suggest that this has come from an attitude at the \nFederal Reserve Board that says we must put price stability above all \nelse and it will pay long-term dividends? Maybe it is those dividends \nwe are beginning to cash in on in this budget deal.\n  There is another thought I would like to leave with you, Mr. \nPresident, in terms of the economy and how well it is doing. I have \nspoken on this floor before about my experience as a business executive \nduring what many people\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\ncalled the decade of greed, the 1980's, when we took a small company, \nso small it had four full-time employees, and saw it grow to the point, \nwhen I left prior to my run for the Senate, when it had 700 employees. \nI have commented it was the tax policies that were pursued in those \nyears, pursued primarily by President Ronald Reagan, that made it \npossible for us to grow that company. But we were attacked because it \nwas the decade of greed, and, yes, indeed, we did do well.\n  I would like to point out that that company that grew in that period \nfrom 4 employees to 700, now has over 3,000. The momentum that was set \nin place in the 1980's is carrying forward into the 1990's, and it is \nthat company and others like it that are providing the income taxes \nthat make it possible for us to have this kind of a budget deal.\n\n  So, as we look at the whole thing, let us understand that there are \nmany things about it that I do not like. There are many things about it \nthat many of the rest of us do not like. But the reason we were able to \nget this degree of agreement comes from the strength of the economy, \nand the one lesson we should learn, as we look at this budget \nagreement, is simply this: As important as anything else we do around \nhere are those things that we do that will cause the economy to grow at \na more rapid rate. Whether it is increasing taxes in a certain area or \ndecreasing tax rates in another area, whether it is increasing spending \non things like infrastructure and other investments, or whether it is \ndecreasing spending on areas where there is a degree of waste and \nfraud, all of these things need to be done with the primary goal of \nseeing that the economy will increase in size.\n  As it does, a number of things happen. The demand on our social \nspending goes down. There is no better welfare project in the world \nthan a job, and a booming economy creates more jobs for more people. \nAnd we see it in terms of the impact on Government. We should pay \nattention to those kinds of things.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say on this as the budget process \ngoes forward, but, while the weekend talk shows were still ringing in \nour ears, I wanted to make this general statement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to continue \nas in morning business, on another subject, for up to another 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I want to call the attention of everyone \nin the Senate to a very important article that appeared in yesterday's \nWashington Post Magazine. The article profiles a woman by the name of \nDiane Hendel. Diane Hendel was the foster mother of twins who had been \nabandoned by their natural mother. In telling Diane Hendel's story, \nthis article paints a devastating portrait of the foster care system, \nthe foster care system not just in the District of Columbia, but the \nfoster care system across this country.\n  It is Diane Hendel's story, and it is told from her point of view. \nBut much more important, it is really the story of these two children, \nthese twins, and what our foster care system did and is doing to them. \nIt tells the story of these two children who were abandoned with \nserious physical problems, and it tells the story of the foster mother, \nDiane Hendel, who for 2\\1/2\\ years nurtured them, loved them, kept them \ngoing, became their mother.\n  Then this article tells the story of a foster care system bent on \nfamily reunification, that when these little children were 3\\1/2\\ years \nof age, that system decided the natural mother, who had abandoned them, \nwas now the person that they should go to. It tells the horrifying and \nsad story of these little 3\\1/2\\-year-old children being taken away \nfrom the only mother that they ever really knew, to their new mother. \nAll in the name of family reunification. All in the name of protecting \nthe rights of the natural mother, without, in my opinion, any \nconsideration for the rights not of the foster mother, but for the \nrights of those two little girls.\n  Mr. President, there are 450,000 children in foster care across this \ncountry today. These children are spending far too great a portion of \ntheir lives in a legal limbo. Early childhood years are a crucial time \nin the development of any child. Indeed, there was a recent White House \nconference devoted to this very subject. It seems to me that as we pay \nmore and more attention to what we all intuitively know--and that is \nhow important the early years are in a child's development, and there \nwas a whole magazine, in Newsweek, this past week, a special issue \ndevoted to early childhood development. We realize, more and more, how \nprecious and important those first few months, those first few years \nare, to the development of the child and who we become, and what we are \nis shaped in the first year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years.\n  Is it not time that we reexamined in society how cavalier we are \nabout having children who have been taken away from their parents, then \nsit in sort of a legal limbo, for a year, 2 years, 3 years or 4 years, \nall the while we, in society, we adults, try to reunify these families? \nBut all the while, all the while, these children are growing up.\n  Mr. President, children do not have a second opportunity to have \ntheir childhood. You never have a second chance to be 2, 3, or 4. What \nis happening across this country in too many cases is that children are \ntaken, put in a foster home--sometimes multiple foster homes--all the \nwhile we, as a society, wait until that magical time when the parents \nhave been fixed--the natural parents. They have been cured, they no \nlonger snort cocaine, they no longer drink alcohol all the time, they \nno longer abuse their children, and some day we hopefully will put them \nback, put these children who have been removed, back with these natural \nparents. I think, Mr. President, that we have to start worrying about \nthe children's rights and less about the rights of the natural parents.\n  Every piece of new evidence shows us, Mr. President, that the system, \nthe foster care system, is keeping children in foster care for too \nlong. I think this should spur us to action. If any of the Members of \nthe Senate want to become horrified, want to see what is wrong with our \nfoster care system, let them read this story. I think it would shock \nany American to read it.\n  The Washington Post article that I just referred to outlines how the \nprinciple of making reasonable efforts to reunify troubled families is \ntoo often misinterpreted to mean reunifying families at all costs--even \nabusive families that are really families in name only. Abusive \nparents, abusive birth parents, are, today, Mr. President, given a \nsecond chance, a third chance, a fourth chance, a fifth chance, and on \nand on, to get their lives back together so then they can welcome their \nchildren back home. All the while, while they are trying to get their \nact together, their lives together, their poor little children are \nshuttled from foster home to foster home, spending their most formative \nyears deprived of what all children should have--a safe, stable, \nloving, and permanent home.\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\n  The article that I just talked about describes a case where two \nchildren, twins, were abandoned by their natural mother, a natural \nmother who had serious substance abuse problems. These children were \nthen placed in foster care for 3\\1/2\\ years while efforts were made to \nfix the mother, efforts were made to reunify that family. These \nparticular children happened to be fortunate. They are probably the \nexception, because they spent the majority of that time with one \nperson, Diane Hendel, who wanted to adopt them, Diane Hendel who nursed \nthem back to health, who helped them get through some very, very tough \ntimes.\n  But now, Mr. President, the system says they cannot stay with the \nonly person that they have known as their mother. They have to go back \nto their natural mother, the person who abandoned them in the first \nplace. Mr. President, does that really sound like a good idea? I do not \nthink so.\n  The article quotes child psychiatrist Marilyn Benoit of the Devereux \nChildren's Center in Washington, DC:\n\n       Three and a half years? And then the biological mother gets \n     the children back? You have now disrupted the emotional \n     development of those children. You, the court, have created a \n     new abandonment. You have deliberately interjected separation \n     and loss into their lives. What we know that does is disrupt \n     development. You have depression. You have regression. You \n     undermine a sense of trust. You introduce a sense of \n     powerlessness. Children that age, what they want to develop \n     is a sense of mastery, and you have done everything to thwart \n     that, and you have really compromised that child's ability to \n     move on.\n\n  Mr. President, I think that comment by a child psychiatrist confirms \nwhat all of us know, any of us who know anything about children. \nChildren need a stable and permanent home, a permanent home where they \nwill learn the skills of love, the skills of friendship and survival.\n  Mr. President, I think that Sister Josephine Murphy, who runs a home \nof severely abused children in Hyattsville, MD, is also exactly right. \nShe is quoted in the article as saying the following:\n\n       I know what they say, blood is thicker than water, and it \n     is, but we're adults, and at some point we have to have the \n     guts to say, ``This is it. No more.''\n\n  No more, Mr. President. Enough is enough. Who benefits from the \ncurrent bias toward reunifying abusive families? Certainly not the \nchildren. Whose interests were taken into account when the decision was \nmade to rip these two children away from the only mother that they ever \nknew? Was it the children's? I don't know any rational person who would \nsay that was in the best interest of the child. In conclusion, Mr. \nPresident, let me quote from this article. There is a portion of the \narticle on page 10 that describes the scene when these children were \ntaken away from their foster mother.\n\n       . . . Off they go. Goodbye to the toys. Goodbye to their \n     drawings. Goodbye to their bedroom. Goodbye to the house. \n     Goodbye to everything. Just like that. And then, goodbye to \n     Diane. Who leaves the children, as ordered, so they can say \n     hello a moment later to their new mother, who is the woman \n     who conceived them and abandoned them and was charged with \n     neglecting them and now, 3\\1/2\\ years after they were born \n     and 2\\1/2\\ years after Diane took them in with the hope of \n     adopting them, has been declared legally fit to take them \n     with her to a new place, a strange place, their true home.\n       Just like that.\n       Goodbye.\n       Hello.\n\n  Mr. President, we have before us in this Congress several bills, one \nthat just passed the House, the Camp-Kennelly bill, one that has been \nintroduced in the Senate, which I am a cosponsor of, the Chafee-\nRockefeller bill. Both of these bills, while they will not solve this \nproblem, I think will help because they say quite simply what we all \nknow deep in our hearts the fact should be, which is, yes, whenever \npossible, whenever reasonable, we should try to reunify families; but \nwhile we do that, we should not forget what our ultimate goal should \nbe, which is to be concerned about the safety and welfare of the \nchildren.\n  I think, Mr. President, if we focus on the child and focus on what is \nin the best interest of the child, we will have fewer crazy, ludicrous \ndecisions, such as the one we have seen recounted in the Washington \nPost story of this past Sunday.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3947-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3948-S3949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

On April 2, 1997, Judy Campbell, who \nfor the past 10 years served as the financial clerk of the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, completed 36 years of \ncongressional service. This institution is a better place because of \nher faithful service.\n  I first met Judy Campbell late in 1974, shortly after my election to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. She was one of the first individuals \nI hired on my congressional staff. Judy's ability and exceptional \norganizational skills were first brought to my attention by one of the \nmost able and respected legislators of his generation, the late \nCongressman Richard Bolling of Missouri, for whom Judy had already \nworked for over a decade. Judy served as my office manager, first in \nthe House of Representatives and then in the Senate, for 12 years.\n  In 1987, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, Senator Quentin N. Burdick of North Dakota, hired Judy \nand she soon became the committee's financial clerk. Judy served the \ncommittee and the Senate in that capacity under four chairmen--Senators \nQuentin N. Burdick, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, John Chafee, and myself. \nThe hallmark of Judy's congressional service was always her \nprofessionalism. She worked with Democratic and Republican Members and \nstaff with similar dedication and equal enthusiasm.\n  Judy has also been an invaluable resource to her colleagues on my \npersonal staff, the committee and around the Hill. The process of \nhiring new staffers always involves a certain amount of coaching and \ntraining. Judy was particularly good in this role, and I know she was \nalways willing to provide counseling and support to other committee \nfinancial clerks and office managers around the Hill.\n  Longevity was only one aspect of Judy's career. Through her work she \nepitomized dedication in public service. For 36 years, Judy has been \none of the selfless and nameless individuals who, day in and day out, \nmake the congressional branch of government function effectively, year \nin and year out. Judy's detailed knowledge of congressional operations \nand finances is legendary. She took seriously the public trust for the \nmillions of dollars which were her responsibility over the years. To \nsay Judy was prudent with taxpayer funds would be an understatement. In \nthe mid-1970's, when America's ultimate tightwad--Jack Benny--died, the \njoke in my office was that Judy Campbell took his place.\n  Mr. President, this institution is a better place because Judy \nCampbell toiled here. She made a difference. Her many friends on \nCapitol Hill and I will miss her. I personally wish Judy and her \nhusband Denny nothing but the best in retirement. As they complete \nconstruction of a new home this summer, we wish them many years of good \nhealth and enjoyment. On April 3, 1997, Judy realized a longtime dream. \nOn that day she started a new career--that of a full-time grandmother.\n  Thank you, Judy, and good luck.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The notice publishes amendments to the \nrules governing the procedures for the Office of Compliance under the \nCongressional Accountability Act. The amendments to the procedural \nrules have been approved by the Board of Directors, Office of \nCompliance.\n  Section 304(b) requires this notice to be printed in the \nCongressional Record, therefore I ask unanimous consent that the notice \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                          OFFICE OF COMPLIANCE\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995: Amendments to \n     Procedural Rules\n\n\n          NOTICE OF ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO PROCEDURAL RULES\n\n       Summary: After considering the comments to the Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking published January 7, 1997 in the \n     Congressional Record, the Executive Director has adopted and \n     is publishing amendments to the rules governing the \n     procedures for the Office of Compliance under the \n     Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-1, 109 \n     Stat. 3). The amendments to the procedural rules have been \n     approved by the Board of Directors, Office of Compliance.\n       For Further Information Contact: Executive Director, Office \n     of Compliance, Room LA 200, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999. Telephone No. 202-724-9250. TDD/\n     TTY: 202-426-1912.\n\n\n                       SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\n\n                             I. Background\n\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     ``Act'') was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. In \n     general, the CAA applies the rights and protections of eleven \n     federal labor and employment law statutes to covered \n     employees and employing offices within the Legislative \n     Branch. Section 303 of the CAA directs that the Executive \n     Director of the Office of Compliance (``Office'') shall, \n     subject to the approval of the Board of Directors (``Board'') \n     of the Office, adopt rules governing the procedures for the \n     Office, and may amend those rules in the same manner. The \n     procedural rules currently in effect, approved by the Board \n     and adopted by the Executive Director, were published \n     December 22, 1995 in the Congressional Record (141 Cong. R. \n     S19239 (daily ed., Dec. 22, 1995)). Amendments to these \n     rules, approved by the Board and adopted by the Executive \n     Director, were published September 19, 1996 in the \n     Congressional Record (142 Cong. R. H10672 and S10980 (daily \n     ed., Sept. 19, 1996)). The revisions and additions that \n     follow establish procedures for consideration of matters \n     arising under Parts B and C of title II of the CAA, which \n     became generally effective January 1, 1997.\n       Pursuant to section 303(b) of the CAA, the Executive \n     Director published for comment a Notice of Proposed \n     Rulemaking (``NPR'') in the Congressional Record on January \n     7, 1997 (143 Cong. R. S25-S30 (daily ed., Jan. 7, 1997)) \n     inviting comments regarding the proposed amendments to the \n     procedural rules. Four comments were received in response to \n     the NPR: three from Congressional offices and one from a \n     labor organization. After full consideration of the comments \n     received, the Executive Director has, with the approval of \n     the Board, adopted these amendments to the procedural rules.\n\n II. Consideration of Comments and Conclusions Regarding Amendments to \n                             Existing Rules\n\n       A. Section 1.04(d)--Final Decisions\n       One commenter noted that, although section 1.04(d) provides \n     that the Board will make public final decisions in favor of a \n     complaining covered employee, or charging party under section \n     210 of the CAA, as well as those that reverse a Hearing \n     Officer's decision in favor of a complaining employee or \n     charging party, section 1.04(d) does not specifically provide \n     that decisions in favor of an employing office will be made \n     public. Rather, such decisions may be made public in the \n     discretion of the Board. The commenter suggested that the \n     rules should provide either that all or none of the decisions \n     be made public, asserting that, if section 1.04(d) were not \n     so modified, there would be ``inconsistent access'' to \n     decisions and ``the impression that the Board's procedures \n     are weighted against employing offices.'' Proposed section \n     1.04(d) is identical to section 416(f) of the CAA, and its \n     language, therefore, should not and will not be altered, \n     whatever the Board's ultimate practice with respect to the \n     publication of decisions in favor of employing offices.\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\n       B. Section 1.07(a)\n       One commenter suggested that, if section 1.04(d) were not \n     modified to provide for publication of all decisions, the \n     term ``certain final decisions'' in section 1.07(a) should be \n     defined and procedures should be established to challenge \n     Board determinations regarding the publication of decisions. \n     Section 1.07(a) has been modified to make it clear that the \n     referenced final decisions are those described in section \n     416(f) of the CAA. As section 416(f) of the CAA makes clear \n     which final decisions must be made public and grants the \n     Board complete discretion as to publication of other final \n     decisions, procedures for challenging determinations \n     regarding publication are not warranted.\n       C. Section 5.01--Complaints\n       For the reasons set forth in Section III.C.10., infra, \n     section 5.01(b)(2) will not be modified to require the \n     General Counsel to conduct a follow-up inspection as a \n     prerequisite to filing a complaint under section 215 of the \n     CAA, as requested by a commenter.\n       D. Section 5.04--Confidentiality\n       One commenter suggested that section 5.04 be modified to \n     clarify that proceedings before Hearing Officers and the \n     Board are not confidential. However, with certain exceptions, \n     pursuant to section 416(c) of the CAA, such proceedings are \n     confidential and, therefore, the proposed rule cannot be \n     modified as suggested by the commenter. However, the rule \n     will be clarified to note the statutory exceptions to the \n     confidentiality requirement. In addition, at the suggestion \n     of another commenter, the rule will be modified to cross-\n     reference sections 1.06, 1.07 and 7.12 of the procedural \n     rules, which also relate to confidentiality.\n\n III. Consideration of Comments and Conclusions Regarding Section 215 \n                               Procedures\n\n       A. Promulgation of the proposed amendments as substantive \n           regulations under section 304\n       Two commenters restated objections to the Board's decision \n     in promulgating its substantive section 215 regulations (143 \n     Cong. R. S61, S63 (daily ed., Jan. 7, 1997)) not to adopt the \n     Secretary's rules of practice and procedure for variances \n     under the OSHAct (part 1905, 29 C.F.R.), and the Secretary's \n     regulations relating to the procedure for conducting \n     inspections, and for issuing and contesting citations and \n     proposed penalties under the OSHAct (part 1903, 29 C.F.R.) as \n     regulations under section 215(d)(2) of the CAA. The \n     arguments offered by the commenters are substantially the \n     same as those rejected by the Board in its rulemaking on \n     this issue (143 Cong. R. at S63). The Board has fully \n     explained its decision not to adopt Parts 1903 and 1905, \n     29 C.F.R., as regulations under section 215(d) of the CAA, \n     and for rejecting the arguments made by the commenters. \n     The Board did not consider the Secretary's regulations \n     governing inspections, citations, and variances to be \n     outside the scope of rulemaking under section 304 because \n     they were ``procedural'' as opposed to ``substantive.'' \n     Instead, the Board did not adopt these regulations because \n     they were promulgated to implement sections 8, 9, and 10 \n     of the OSHAct, statutory provisions which are not \n     ``referred to in subsection (a)'' of section 215. \n     Accordingly, these regulations were not within the scope \n     of the Board's rulemaking authority under section \n     215(d)(2). 143 Cong. R. at S63-64. Thus, the question \n     whether the proposed regulations should have been issued \n     under section 304 of the CAA cannot be addressed by the \n     Executive Director in the context of this rulemaking.\n       Because the Board has determined that regulations covering \n     variances, citations, and notices cannot be issued under \n     section 215(d), the question is whether such regulations may \n     be issued by the Executive Director under section 303. The \n     essence of the commenters' argument in this rulemaking is \n     that the Executive Director cannot do so because the \n     procedures affect substantive rights of the parties. The \n     commenters' position is based on the substance-procedure \n     distinction that they believe demarcates the boundary between \n     rulemaking under sections 215(d) and 304 and rulemaking under \n     section 303.\n       As noted above, the Board did not exclude the subjects of \n     variances, citations, and notices from its rulemaking based \n     on a substance/procedure distinction, but because the \n     Secretary's regulations covering these subjects were not \n     within the scope of section 215(d). Similarly, the Executive \n     Director is not barred from promulgating rules governing the \n     procedures of the Office simply because those procedures \n     might affect the substantive rights of the parties.\n       Contrary to the commenters' argument, the Board's earlier \n     statement (in the context of its rulemaking under section \n     220(d) of the CAA) that rules governing procedures can be \n     substantive regulations is not controlling with respect to \n     the present issue. In its rulemaking proceeding under section \n     220(d), the Board determined that the subject matter of the \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority's regulations, including \n     certain regulations purporting to govern procedures of the \n     Authority, were within the plain language setting forth the \n     scope of rulemaking under section 220(d). The question raised \n     by the commenters in that rulemaking was whether regulations \n     falling within the scope of section 220(d) were nevertheless \n     excluded because of their procedural label or character. The \n     Board decided that they were not so excluded, and its \n     statement that procedural rules can be considered substantive \n     regulations was made in that context. See 142 Cong. R. S5070, \n     5072 (daily ed., May 15, 1996). Conversely, in its rulemaking \n     under section 215(d), the Board determined that certain \n     regulations were not within the scope of rulemaking under \n     section 215(d), and it rejected the argument that regulations \n     not falling within the scope of section 215(d) should \n     nevertheless be included because of their substantive label \n     or character. Thus, contrary to the commenters' arguments, \n     there is no inconsistency in the underlying rationale of the \n     Board in these two rulemakings. The Board's preambulatory \n     remarks as part of the section 220(d) rulemaking seized upon \n     by the commenters, when read in context, do not control the \n     question here.\n       The question whether these rules can be promulgated under \n     section 303 must begin and end with the language of the \n     statute. Section 303(a) provides that ``[t]he Executive \n     Director shall, subject to approval of the Board, adopt rules \n     governing the procedures of the Office, including the \n     procedures of hearing officers, which shall be submitted for \n     publication in the Congressional Record.'' 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1383(a). The regulations in issue plainly meet these \n     criteria. So long as the Executive Director's regulations \n     meet these criteria, the regulations may be promulgated under \n     this authority, whether they affect substantive rights or \n     not.\n       Given the Board's decision not to promulgate regulations \n     governing the subject of variances, citations, and notices \n     under section 215(d), if the Executive Director accepted the \n     commenters' arguments and did not issue these rules under \n     section 303, it would mean, for example, that no procedures \n     would exist by which variances may be considered by the \n     Board. The Executive Director believes that such a procedure \n     should be provided employing offices. Because promulgation of \n     such procedures is within the scope of the Executive \n     Director's rulemaking under section 303, there is no basis \n     upon which the Executive Director should refuse to address \n     these matters under section 303.\n       B. References to the General Counsel's designees\n       Two commenters argued that references in the regulations to \n     ``designees of the General Counsel'' are inappropriate on the \n     theory that the CAA does not authorize the General Counsel to \n     delegate his duties. To the extent that the commenters are \n     arguing that the General Counsel is prohibited from assigning \n     or designating others to perform the inspections and other \n     responsibilities under section 215 of the CAA, such an \n     argument is refuted by section 302(c)(4) of the CAA, which \n     expressly authorizes the General Counsel to ``appoint . . . \n     such additional attorneys as may be necessary to enable the \n     General Counsel to perform the General Counsel's duties.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1382(c)(4). Similarly, 215(c) of the CAA provides \n     that the General Counsel exercises the ``authorities granted \n     to the Secretary of Labor'' by subsections (a), (d), (e), and \n     (f) of section 8 of the OSHAct, and sections 9 and 10 of the \n     OSHAct. Those sections in turn recognize that the Secretary \n     may act personally or through an ``authorized \n     representative'' with respect to many of these functions. See \n     29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 657(e), (f), and 658(a). Thus, the \n     proposed regulation is not inconsistent with section 215 or \n     the provisions of the OSHAct incorporated thereunder.\n       One of the commenters also argued that the General Counsel \n     may not utilize detailees or consultants in carrying out his \n     duties, because section 302 of the CAA gives the Executive \n     Director the authority to secure the use of detailees. \n     However, section 302 does not limit the functions to which \n     these detailees may be assigned within the Office. Similarly, \n     although the Executive Director may procure the temporary \n     services of consultants ``[i]n carrying out the functions of \n     the Office,'' nothing in the CAA suggests that the Executive \n     Director is barred from obtaining and approving the services \n     of consultants to assist the General Counsel in performing \n     his duties. Indeed, the comprehensive inspections of \n     Legislative Branch facilities were performed in large part \n     through the use of detailees and consultants assisting the \n     General Counsel. The commenters were aware of this use of \n     consultants for this purpose. No claim was made that such \n     inspections could not be conducted with the assistance of \n     consultants.\n       More to the point, the General Counsel is statutorily \n     responsible for exercising the authorities and performing the \n     duties of the General Counsel as specified in section 215 and \n     is accountable for decisions made therein. The proposed \n     regulatory sections do not purport to delegate the General \n     Counsel's statutory responsibilities to others. The \n     regulations simply recognize that the General Counsel may \n     utilize others to enable him to perform certain functions \n     within those responsibilities (such as assisting in \n     conducting investigations and inspections).\n       The commenters' implicit argument that the CAA requires the \n     General Counsel to solely and personally perform those \n     functions is, quite simply, wrong. It is clear that ``those \n     legally responsible for a decision must in fact make it, but \n     that their method of doing so--their thought processes, their \n     reliance on their staffs--is largely beyond judicial \n     scrutiny.'' (Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Martin, 983 F.2d \n     1195, 1201 (2d Cir. 1993), quoting KFC National Management \n     Corp. v. NLRB, 497 F.2d 298 (2d Cir. 1974), cert. denied,\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\n     423 U.S. 1087 (1976). Thus, the decision to assign or \n     designate others (such as other attorneys in the Office, \n     detailees or others) to perform functions related to the \n     General Counsel's ultimate decisions under section 215 (e.g., \n     whether to issue a citation, a notice and/or a complaint in a \n     particular case) is not prohibited by the CAA or subject to \n     review by individual employing offices, as argued by the \n     commenters.\n       One of the commenters argued that employing offices should \n     have an opportunity to pass upon the qualifications of \n     individuals chosen by the General Counsel to conduct \n     inspections through a specified process. Nothing in the CAA \n     or the OSHAct authorizes adoption of such a procedure, and \n     such a provision would interfere unduly with the General \n     Counsel's enforcement responsibilities. Adoption of \n     procedures to micro-manage the General Counsel's operations \n     in this area would be improper in the absence of any \n     statutory authority.\n       C. Inspections, Citations, and Complaints\n\n   1. Objection to inspection, entry not a waiver, advance notice of \ninspection, requirement of ex parte administrative inspection warrants \n                    (sections 4.04, 4.05, and 4.06)\n\n       Three commenters requested that the Executive Director \n     issue regulations requiring the General Counsel to provide \n     advance notice of an inspection to employing offices or to \n     seek a warrant before conducting a non-consensual search of \n     employing offices. One commenter argued that the Supreme \n     Court's decision in Marshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U.S. 307 \n     (1978), which held that the Fourth Amendment's protection \n     against unreasonable searches and seizures applies to non-\n     consensual inspection of private commercial property, applies \n     to administrative inspections of legislative branch employing \n     offices by another legislative branch entity; the commenter \n     further argued that the rules should require that the General \n     Counsel first notify the employing office of the intent to \n     inspect, obtain written consent prior to inspections, and \n     schedule an appointment with employing offices for such \n     inspections. The other commenter argued that, regardless of \n     whether the Fourth Amendment's protection applies equally to \n     congressional offices, similar privacy interests apply to \n     employing offices to enable them to conduct their legislative \n     business free from unreasonable searches. These commenters \n     asked that the procedural rules include provisions similar to \n     those of section 1903.4 of the Secretary's rules, which were \n     amended to authorize the Secretary to secure an ex parte \n     administrative warrant upon refusal to consent to a search in \n     response to the Barlow's decision. See 45 Fed. Reg. 65916 \n     (Oct. 3, 1980) (Final rule amending section 1903.4, 29 \n     C.F.R.). The third commenter also requested that the final \n     regulations include the compulsory process/ex parte \n     administrative warrants provisions of section 1903.4, but did \n     not explain how inclusion of such a provision would be \n     authorized by section 215 of the CAA.\n       It is not entirely clear that the Fourth Amendment's \n     protections that bar the warrantless search of commercial \n     premises apply (or apply with equal force) to inspections of \n     a legislative branch office by another legislative branch \n     entity, albeit an independent one. The protections of the \n     Fourth Amendment were designed to protect privacy interests \n     against intrusion by the government; it is, therefore, not \n     obvious that they apply to prohibit one legislative branch \n     enforcement entity (the General Counsel) from conducting an \n     investigation of another legislative branch entity (an \n     individual employing office). To be sure, there may be \n     portions of an employing office to which individual persons' \n     expectations of privacy may attach. See, e.g., O'Connor v. \n     Ortega, 480 U.S. 709 (1987) (expectation of privacy in public \n     employee's desk, files, and areas within his exclusive \n     control); Schowengerdt v. General Dynamics Corp., 823 F.2d \n     1328, 1335 (9th Cir. 1987) (reasonable expectation of privacy \n     found to exist in areas of government property given over to \n     an employee's exclusive control). But it is questionable \n     whether an employing office, as a covered entity (as \n     distinguished from the individuals holding positions within \n     the office or working there), would be found to possess a \n     privacy right to be free from administrative inquiries \n     authorized by a statute duly enacted by Congress. Moreover, \n     section 215(f)'s requirement that the General Counsel conduct \n     a comprehensive inspection of all covered employing offices \n     and other covered facilities on a regular basis and at least \n     once each Congress may well defeat an otherwise reasonable \n     expectation of privacy in such offices and other facilities. \n     See, e.g., United States v. Bunkers, 521 F.2d 1217, 1219-20 \n     (9th Cir.) (search of postal worker's locker authorized by \n     regulation), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 989 (1975); United States \n     v. Taketa, 923 F.2d 665, 672 (9th Cir. 1991) (valid \n     regulation may defeat an otherwise reasonable expectation of \n     workplace privacy); see also Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U.S. 593 \n     (1981) (legislative schemes authorizing warrantless \n     administrative searches of commercial property do not \n     necessarily violate the Fourth Amendment).\n       In any event, whether Barlow's and its progeny apply in the \n     context of the CAA is a question that need not be decided \n     here. Section 215 does not provide a mechanism by which \n     warrants may be issued. Section 215 contemplates the \n     assignment of hearing officers, but only after a complaint \n     has been filed by the General Counsel. See 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1341(c)(3). Moreover, there is no provision in the CAA \n     that would allow such applications to be heard by federal \n     judges. Compare 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1405(f)(3) (authorizing federal \n     district court to issue orders requiring persons to appear \n     before the hearing officer to give testimony and produce \n     records). Thus, there is no statutory basis upon which such a \n     procedure could be adopted by the Executive Director.\n       The commenters incorrectly assume that, absent a warrant \n     procedure, the General Counsel would nevertheless enter a \n     workspace over the objection of the employing office/s with \n     jurisdiction over the area or control of the space involved. \n     Just as it would be improper to assume that employing offices \n     would engage in a wholesale refusal to allow inspections, it \n     cannot be assumed that the General Counsel will attempt to \n     force inspectors into work areas over the employing office's \n     objection. See 29 U.S.C. Sec. 657(a)(2) (Secretary authorized \n     ``to inspect and investigate during regular working hours and \n     at other reasonable times, and within reasonable limits and \n     in a reasonable manner . . .''). In the typical case, the \n     General Counsel can be expected to ascertain the reason for \n     the refusal and attempt to secure voluntary consent to \n     conduct the inspection. If the employing office continues to \n     refuse an inspection, there are options presently available \n     to the General Counsel to secure access to the space. \n     These options would include, among others, seeking such \n     consent from the relevant committee(s) of the Congress \n     that have responsibilities for the office space or work \n     area involved, and seeking consent from the Architect of \n     the Capitol and/or other entities that have \n     superintendence or other responsibility for and authority \n     over the facility and access to and/or control of the \n     space involved. If such options are unavailing, the \n     General Counsel could simply note the refusal of the \n     employing office to allow the inspection in, for example, \n     the inspection report submitted to the Congress. Of \n     course, the Office assumes that employing offices will not \n     withhold their consent.\n       The commenters also argued that advance notice should be \n     given by the General Counsel to conform to protections \n     recognized in the private sector context. One of the \n     commenters specifically requested that the rules require the \n     General Counsel to first schedule an appointment with an \n     employing office prior to an inspection. Although the \n     commenters argued that such notice is consistent with \n     practice under the OSHAct, advance notice of inspections is \n     the exception, not the rule, at OSHA. See 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1903.6; OSHAct section 17(f). Moreover, in enacting the \n     CAA, the Congress understood that its incorporation of the \n     rights and protections of the OSHAct included the standard \n     practice and procedure at OSHA that advance notice would not \n     be given. See 142 Cong. R. S 625 (daily ed., Jan. 9, 1995) \n     (section-by-section analysis of the CAA submitted by Senator \n     Grassley) (``[T]he act does not provide that employing \n     offices are to receive notice of the inspections.''). Thus, \n     the commenters' argument that advance notice of inspections \n     is required by OSHA regulations and practice, or by the CAA, \n     is not supported by the statute. Indeed, as one of the \n     commenters acknowledged, its proposal requiring advance \n     notice would require a re-writing of the inspection authority \n     of section 8(a) of the OSHAct, applied by section 215, to \n     read that the General Counsel is authorized ``upon the notice \n     and consent of the employing office to enter [without delay \n     and] at reasonable times . . .'' Adoption of a such a rule, \n     which is plainly at odds with the underlying statute, would \n     be improper.\n       One of the commenters argued alternatively that proposed \n     section 4.06 be modified to include the provisions of section \n     1903.6, which authorizes advance notice in certain specified \n     circumstances. The provisions of section 1903.6, with \n     appropriate modifications, will be included as part of the \n     final regulations, since such an enforcement policy is not \n     deemed to add to or alter any substantive provision in the \n     underlying statute.\n       This commenter also requested that section 4.06 be modified \n     to require the General Counsel to issue a written statement \n     explaining why advance notice was not provided to the \n     employing office. Nothing under the CAA or the OSHAct \n     authorizes or suggests such a requirement, nor would any \n     purpose of the CAA be served. Thus, no such modification will \n     be made.\n       Finally, section 4.05 (Entry not a waiver) will be modified \n     to specifically refer to section 215 of the CAA, as requested \n     by a commenter.\n\n  2. References to recordkeeping requirements (sections 4.02 and 4.07)\n\n       Two commenters objected to references in proposed section \n     4.02 of the regulations to ``records required by the CAA and \n     regulations promulgated thereunder,'' and a similar reference \n     in section 4.07, on the theory that no recordkeeping \n     requirements, even those that are inextricably intertwined \n     with the substantive health and safety standards of Parts \n     1910 and 1926, 29 C.F.R., may be imposed on employing offices \n     under the CAA. The commenters presented no different \n     arguments than those fully considered and rejected by the \n     Board in promulgating its substantive section 215 \n     regulations. See 142 Cong. R. at S63. Because the Board \n     has adopted substantive health and safety standards which \n     impose limited recordkeeping requirements on employing \n     offices (e.g., rules relating to employee exposure \n     records), such records are subject to review during an \n     inspection. The Executive Director thus has no basis for \n     the proposed deletion.\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\n                 3. Security clearances (section 4.02)\n\n       Two commenters suggested that section 4.02 of the proposed \n     regulation be amended to provide that the General Counsel or \n     other person conducting a work site inspection obtain an \n     appropriate security clearance before inspecting areas that \n     contain classified information. The General Counsel reports \n     that he is in the process of obtaining, through the \n     appropriate security division of the United States Capitol \n     Police, security clearances for the General Counsel and the \n     General Counsel's inspection personnel to enable them to have \n     access to such areas, if access is required as part of a \n     section 215 inspection. Section 4.02, and other sections as \n     appropriate, will be amended to state that the General \n     Counsel and/or any inspection personnel will be required to \n     either have or obtain appropriate security clearance, if such \n     clearance is required for access to the workspaces inspected.\n\n     4. Requests for inspections by employing office (section 4.03)\n\n       One commenter noted that, although section 4.03(b) provides \n     that employing office requests for inspections must be \n     reduced to writing on a form provided by the Office, there is \n     no requirement in section 4.03(a) that employee requests be \n     submitted on an Office-provided form. Section 4.03(a) will be \n     modified to provide that employee requests be reduced in \n     writing on an Office-provided form. The commenter has asked \n     that any form developed be submitted for review and comment \n     from employing offices prior to its approval. Since the form \n     is merely an investigative tool of the General Counsel, there \n     is no reason to require that it be ``approved'' by the Board \n     prior to issuance. Inspection forms and other similar \n     documents relating to the General Counsel's enforcement \n     procedures are available from the General Counsel.\n\n       5. Scope and nature of inspection (sections 4.03 and 4.08)\n\n       One commenter has asked that section 4.03(2) be modified to \n     provide that inspections will be limited to matters included \n     in the notice of violation. Section 4.03(2) is based on \n     virtually identical provisions of the Secretary's \n     regulations, 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.11. Nothing in section 215 \n     or the provisions of the OSHAct incorporated thereunder would \n     authorize placing a limitation on the General Counsel's \n     inspection authority, as proposed by the commenter.\n       Similarly, section 8(e) of the OSHAct, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 657(e), and proposed section 4.08 provide that a \n     representative of the employer and a representative \n     authorized by the employees shall be given an opportunity to \n     accompany the inspector, and section 4.08 will not be \n     modified to provide that parties be given the opportunity to \n     seek immediate review of the General Counsel's determinations \n     regarding authorized representatives, or to provide specific \n     standards by which the General Counsel may deny the right of \n     accompaniment, or that parties have a ``fair'' opportunity to \n     accompany the General Counsel's designee during the \n     inspection, as suggested by two commenters. As with the \n     proposed modifications of section 4.03, nothing in section \n     215, the OSHAct, or the Secretary's rules and practice under \n     the OSHAct, would authorize placing these limitations on the \n     General Counsel's enforcement authorities. On the contrary, \n     such a modification provides parties with a tool for delay, \n     allowing an office to forestall prompt inspection and \n     abatement of hazards while the parties litigate the issue of \n     whether an employing office was denied a ``fair'' opportunity \n     for accompaniment or whether a representative of employees is \n     an appropriately authorized representative. Nothing in the \n     OSHAct, as applied by section 215 of the CAA, would \n     sanction such a rule.\n\n 6. Inspector compliance with health and safety requirements (section \n                                 4.07)\n\n       Two commenters requested that section 4.07 of the proposed \n     regulations add the provisions of 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.7(c), \n     which provide that health and safety inspectors take \n     reasonable safety precautions to ensure that their inspection \n     practices are not hazardous and comply with the employer's \n     safety and health rules at the work site. This enforcement \n     policy will be included within the final regulations.\n\n             7. Consultation with employees (section 4.09)\n\n       Section 4.09 tracks the provisions of section 1903.10 of \n     the Secretary's regulations, which provide that inspectors \n     may consult with employees concerning health and safety and \n     other matters deemed necessary for an effective and thorough \n     inspection, and that afford employees an opportunity to bring \n     violations to the attention of the inspectors during the \n     course of an inspection. A commenter has requested that \n     section 4.09 be modified to require specific limits on the \n     time, place, and manner of such consultations, and that \n     employees be required to first put in writing violations that \n     they intend to bring to the attention of inspectors during \n     the course of an inspection. Nothing in section 215 of the \n     CAA or the provisions of the OSHAct incorporated thereunder \n     requires or permits the modifications requested by the \n     commenter.\n\n      8. Inspection not warranted; informal review (section 4.10)\n\n       A commenter requested that proposed section 4.10(a) be \n     revised to state that, after conducting informal conferences \n     to review a decision not to conduct an inspection of a work \n     site, the General Counsel ``shall'' (rather than ``may'') \n     affirm, modify or reverse the decision. The final regulations \n     will include the change suggested by the commenter.\n       A second commenter requested that the final regulations \n     include the provisions of 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.12(a), which \n     permit parties to make written submissions as part of the \n     informal conference. The final regulations will include these \n     provisions, as suggested by the commenter.\n\n                      9. Citations (section 4.11)\n\n       Two commenters requested that section 4.11 of the final \n     regulations include the language of 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.14(a) \n     that ``No citation may be issued under this section after the \n     expiration of six months following the occurrence of any \n     violation.'' The commenters argued that the proposed \n     regulations ``omit this important substantive right'' under \n     section 9(c) of the OSHAct. Section 9(c) of the OSHAct is a \n     temporal limitation on the ability of the Secretary to issue \n     a citation and thus is included within the scope of section \n     215(c). It applies regardless of whether or not a procedural \n     regulation ``implements'' it. Nevertheless, because the \n     proposed provision simply tracks the clear and unambiguous \n     statutory provision of section 9(c) of the OSHAct and does \n     not purport to create or modify any substantive right, it \n     will be included in section 4.11 of the final regulations.\n       One commenter requested that section 4.11(a), which \n     authorizes the General Counsel to issue citations or notices \n     even if the employing office immediately abates, or initiates \n     steps to abate the violation, be deleted. However, this \n     provision tracks the language of section 1903.14(a) and is \n     consistent with section 215 of the CAA. Thus, it will not be \n     modified as requested by the commenter.\n\n           10. De minimis violations (sections 4.11 and 4.13)\n\n       Two commenters argued that the Executive Director should \n     adopt provisions regarding ``de minimis'' violations, \n     consistent with section 9(a) of the OSHAct and 29 C.F.R. \n     Sec. Sec. 1903.14 and 1903.16. Section 9(a) of the OSHAct \n     provides, in relevant part, that ``[t]he Secretary may \n     prescribe procedures for the issuance of a notice in lieu of \n     a citation with respect to de minimis violations which have \n     no direct or immediate relationship to safety or health.'' \n     Although OSHA formerly required inspectors to issue citations \n     on de minimis violations under this provision, the practice \n     has been abandoned. OSHA Field Inspection Reference Manual \n     ch. III.C.2.g. (1994) (``De Minimis violations . . . shall \n     not be included in citations. . . . The employer should be \n     verbally notified of the violation and the [Compliance Safety \n     and Health Officer] should note it in the inspection case \n     file.''). Thus, a provision enabling the General Counsel to \n     issue notices for de minimis violations is of little \n     practical utility under section 215. However, the text of \n     section 215(c)(2)(A) authorizes the General Counsel to issue \n     a ``citation or notice,'' which reasonably would include a \n     notice of de minimis violations. Including such a provision \n     in these regulations is consistent with the CAA, and does not \n     create a substantive requirement. Thus, sections 4.11 and \n     4.13 will be modified to provide that the General Counsel may \n     issue notices of de minimis violations in appropriate cases, \n     as requested by the commenters.\n\n   11. Failure to correct a violation for which a citation has been \n issued; notice of failure to correct a violation; complaint (section \n                                 4.14)\n\n       Section 4.14(a) of the proposed regulations provide that, \n     ``if the General Counsel determines'' that an employing \n     office has failed to correct timely an alleged violation, he \n     or she ``may'' issue a notification of such failure before \n     filing a complaint against the office. Two commenters argued \n     that the proposed regulations are contrary to section \n     215(c)(2)(B) of the CAA because they do not require the \n     General Counsel to issue a notification before filing a \n     complaint. Similarly, these commenters argued that section \n     5.01 be modified to require the General Counsel to conduct a \n     follow-up inspection as a prerequisite to filing a complaint \n     under section 215. Nothing in section 215(c)(2)(B) requires \n     the General Counsel to issue a notification or to conduct a \n     follow-up inspection prior to filing a complaint. Instead, \n     section 215 grants the General Counsel the authority to file \n     a complaint after issuing ``a citation or notification,'' if \n     the General Counsel determines that a violation has not been \n     corrected. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341(c)(3).\n       The section-by-section analysis of the CAA explains the \n     basis for section 215(c)(2)'s language authorizing the \n     General Counsel to issue a citation or a notice. It makes \n     clear that section 215 does not require the General Counsel \n     to issue a notification prior to filing a complaint where an \n     employing office has failed to abate a hazard outlined in the \n     citation: [Under section 215] the general counsel can issue a \n     citation and proceed to file a complaint if the violation \n     remains unabated. Or the general counsel may file a \n     notification after the citation is not complied with, and \n     then file a complaint. The general counsel may not file a \n     notification without having first filed a citation which has \n     not been honored. The choice whether to follow a citation \n     with a complaint once it is evident that there has not been \n     compliance, or to file a notification before the filing of \n     the complaint, will normally turn on whether the general \n     counsel believes that good faith efforts are being undertaken \n     to comply with\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\n     the citation, but the time period for complete remediation of \n     the citation period has expired.'' 141 Cong. R. S621, S625 \n     (daily ed. Jan. 9, 1995) (section-by-section analysis). \n     Therefore, because the commenters' requested change is \n     contrary to the statutory procedure outlined in section 215, \n     it may not be adopted as a procedure of the Office under \n     section 303.\n\n                 2. Informal conferences (section 4.15)\n\n       One commenter requested that section 4.15 be modified to \n     require the General Counsel to allow participation in an \n     informal conference by persons other than the requesting \n     party (complaining employee or employing office). Section \n     4.15, which states that such participation is ``at the \n     discretion of the General Counsel,'' tracks section 1903.19 \n     of the Secretary's regulations and is consistent with section \n     215 of the CAA. Thus, it will not be modified as requested by \n     the commenter. However, as requested by the commenter, \n     section 4.15 will be revised to clarify that any settlement \n     entered into between the parties to such a conference shall \n     be subject to the approval of the Executive Director, to \n     conform to section 414 of the CAA.\n\n                         13. Notice of contest\n\n       A commenter argued that the procedural regulations should \n     provide a procedure for filing notices of contest, as \n     outlined in 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.17 and consistent with \n     section 9(a) of the OSHAct. However, the changes proposed by \n     the commenter would flatly contradict the statutory \n     procedures outlined in section 215. As the Board noted in its \n     rulemaking under section 215, the statutory enforcement \n     scheme under section 215 differs significantly from the \n     comparable statutory provisions of the OSHAct.\n       The enforcement procedures of the OSHAct are set forth in \n     sections 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the OSHAct, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 657-660. Section 8(a) of the OSHAct authorizes the \n     Secretary's inspectors to conduct reasonable safety and \n     health inspections at places of employment. 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 657(a). If a violation is discovered, the inspector may \n     issue a citation to the employer under section 9(a) of the \n     OSHAct, specifically describing the violation, fixing a \n     reasonable time for its abatement and, in his or her \n     discretion, proposing a civil monetary penalty. 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 658, 659. Section 8(c) permits an employer to \n     notify the Secretary that it intends to contest the citation. \n     29 U.S.C. Sec. 659(c). If the employer does not contest the \n     citation within 15 working days, it becomes a final abatement \n     order and is ``not subject to review by any court or \n     agency.'' 29 U.S.C. Sec. 659(b). Section 10(c) of the OSHAct \n     also gives an employee or representative of employees a right \n     to contest the period of time fixed in the citation for \n     abatement of the violation. In either event, the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Review Commission must afford the employer \n     and/or the employee ``an opportunity for a hearing.'' 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 659(c). Section 10(c) also requires the \n     Commission to provide affected employees or their \n     representatives ``an opportunity to participate as parties to \n     hearings under this subsection.'' Id.\n       Rather than either incorporating by reference the statutory \n     enforcement procedures of the OSHAct described above or \n     adopting them in haec verba in section 215, the CAA provides \n     a detailed statutory enforcement scheme which departs from \n     the OSHAct in several significant respects. Section 215(c) \n     makes reference to sections 8(a), 8(d), 8(e), 8(f), 9, and 10 \n     of the OSHAct, but only to the extent of granting the General \n     Counsel the ``authorities of the Secretary'' contained in \n     those sections to ``inspect and investigate places of \n     employment'' and to ``issue a citation or notice . . . or a \n     notification'' to employing offices. Section 215(c)(1), (2). \n     Other portions of sections 8, 9, and 10 of the OSHAct that do \n     not relate to the Secretary's authority to conduct \n     inspections or to issue citations or notices are not \n     incorporated into sections 215(c). Instead, section 215(c) \n     provides a detailed procedure regarding inspections and \n     citations which, although modeled on sections 8, 9, and 10 of \n     the OSHAct, differs in several significant respects from the \n     OSHAct enforcement scheme.\n       For example, under section 10 of the OSHAct, the employer \n     must initiate a contest within 15 days of receipt to prevent \n     the citation from becoming final; under section 215(c), the \n     General Counsel must initiate a complaint to obtain a final \n     order against an employing office that fails or refuses to \n     abate a hazard outlined in the citation. Section 10(c) of the \n     OSHAct gives employees and representatives of employees a \n     right to participate as parties before the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Appeals Review Board; section 215(c)(5) \n     does not provide such party participation rights to employees \n     and suggests that only the General Counsel and the employing \n     office may participate in any review of decisions issued \n     under section 215.\n       Section 215(c) of the CAA outlines the specific procedures \n     regarding variances, citations, notifications and hearings \n     under section 215. Any procedural regulations adopted by the \n     Executive Director under section 303 of the CAA cannot \n     conflict with these statutorily-mandated procedures. See \n     United States v. Fausto, 108 S.Ct. 668, 677 (1988) (the \n     provision of detailed review procedures provides strong \n     evidence that Congress intended such procedures to be \n     exclusive); Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U.S. \n     340, 345-48 (1984) (omission of review procedures for \n     consumers affected by milk market orders, coupled with the \n     provision of such procedures for milk handlers so affected, \n     was strong evidence that Congress intended to preclude \n     consumers from obtaining judicial review); Whitney Nat. Bank \n     v. Bank of New Orleans & Tr. Co., 85 S.Ct. 551, 557 (1965) \n     (where Congress has provided statutory review procedures, \n     such procedures are to be exclusive).\n       Given the fact that section 215(c) sets forth a detailed \n     enforcement procedure which is significantly different than \n     the procedures of the OSHAct, it is reasonable to conclude \n     that Congress did not intend the Board to presume that the \n     regulations regarding such procedures would be ``the same'' \n     as the Secretary's procedures, as they generally must be if \n     they fall within the Board's substantive rulemaking authority \n     under section 215(d)(2). See Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575 \n     (1978) (manner in which Congress employed incorporation by \n     reference evidenced an intent on the part of Congress to \n     assimilate the remedies and procedures of the FLSA into \n     the ADEA, except in those cases where, in the ADEA itself, \n     Congress made plain its decision to follow a different \n     course than that provided for in the FLSA). Thus, the \n     commenters' interpretation is not supported by section \n     215.\n       Here, there is no statutory authority for the filing and \n     determination of notices of contest by employing offices. The \n     only way in which a safety and health issue can be presented \n     to a hearing officer is in connection with a complaint filed \n     by the General Counsel. These procedural regulations cannot \n     be used to engraft provisions not provided for in the statute \n     and, more importantly, which conflict with the procedures \n     expressly set forth therein. For the same reasons, there is \n     no statutory basis upon which to create a procedure allowing \n     an employing office to petition for modification of abatement \n     dates (29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.14a), as requested by this \n     commenter.\n\n                           14. Trade secrets\n\n       A commenter requested that the regulations include the \n     provisions of section 1903.7, 29 C.F.R., relating to \n     protection of trade secrets information. Section 1903.7 \n     implements section 15 of the OSHAct, which provides that \n     information obtained by the Secretary in connection with any \n     inspection or proceeding under the OSHAct ``which might \n     reveal a trade secret referred to in section 1905 of title 18 \n     of the United States Code'' shall be considered confidential. \n     It is not clear that section 15 of the OSHAct applies to \n     proceedings under section 215 of the CAA. However, the \n     current procedural rules attempt to protect privileged or \n     otherwise confidential information from disclosure in CAA \n     proceedings. If any employing office possessed information \n     that constituted a ``trade secret'' within the meaning of \n     section 15, the Office's procedures recognize that \n     confidential or privileged materials or other information \n     should be protected from disclosure in appropriate \n     circumstances. See section 6.01 (c)(3) and (d) of the \n     Procedural Rules (authorizing hearing officers to issue any \n     order to prevent discovery or disclosure of confidential or \n     privileged materials or information, and dealing with claims \n     of privilege). If employing offices maintain information that \n     would constitute ``trade secrets'' within the meaning of \n     section 15 of the OSHAct, protection against disclosure of \n     such information should be extended to inspections and other \n     information gathering under section 215. Accordingly, the \n     final rules will include, with appropriate modification, the \n     provisions of section 1903.7 as section 4.07(g).\n       D. Variances\n\n 1. Publication of variance determinations and notices (sections 4.23, \n                         4.25, 4.26, and 4.28)\n\n       Two commenters requested that sections 4.23, 4.25, 4.26, \n     and 4.28 specify the manner in which the Board's final \n     determinations and other notices will be made public, either \n     by publication in the Congressional Record or its equivalent. \n     The regulations will be amended to provide that the Board \n     shall transmit a copy of the final decision to the Speaker of \n     the House and President pro tempore of the Senate with a \n     request that the order be published in the Congressional \n     Record. Since the CAA does not require publication of such \n     orders in the Congressional Record, the decision to publish \n     in the Congressional Record is solely within the discretion \n     of Congress.\n\n                   Hearings (sections 4.25 and 4.26)\n\n       Two commenters have suggested that the provisions regarding \n     referral of matters appropriate for hearing to hearing \n     officers in sections 4.25 and 4.26 of the proposed \n     regulations be revised to replace ``may'' with ``shall'' to \n     conform to the language of section 215. They further suggest \n     that the references in section 4.25 and 4.26 requiring \n     applicants to include a request for a hearing be deleted as \n     unnecessary. After considering these comments and the \n     statutory language, the regulations will be amended to \n     provide for referral to hearing officers.\n       E. Enforcement policy regarding employee rescue activities\n       Two commenters argued that the regulations should include \n     the provisions of subsection (f) of 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.14, \n     which provides that, with certain exceptions, no citations \n     may be issued to an employer because of rescue activity \n     undertaken by an employee. However, this provision was \n     adopted by the Secretary as ``a general statement of agency \n     policy'' and is ``an exercise of OSHA's prosecutorial \n     discretion in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities'' \n     under the OSHAct. See ``Policy on Employee Rescue Efforts,'' \n     59 Fed. Reg. 66612 (Dec. 27, 1994)\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\n     (amending 29 C.F.R. pt. 1903 to add section 1903.7; noting \n     that rule is effective immediately upon publication because \n     ``the rescue policy simply states OSHA's enforcement policy'' \n     regarding citations involving employee rescue activities). \n     Because it is an enforcement policy, the Secretary reserves \n     the right to modify it ``in specific circumstances where the \n     Secretary or his designee determines that an alternative \n     course of action would better serve the objectives of the \n     Act.'' 29 C.F.R. Sec. 1903.1. The General Counsel has stated \n     his intention to follow, where not inconsistent with the CAA, \n     the enforcement policies of the Secretary, which would \n     include the policy on employee rescue activities. Thus, this \n     policy will be expressly stated as part of the final \n     procedural regulations at section 4.11(f), as requested by \n     the commenters. However, so that such policies are consistent \n     with the Secretary's part 1903 regulations, the final \n     regulations will add the proviso of section 1903.1, 29 \n     C.F.R., that, to the extent statements in these regulations \n     at section 4.01 set forth general enforcement policies they \n     may be modified in specific circumstances by the General \n     Counsel on the same terms as similar enforcement policies of \n     the Secretary.\n       F. Regulations governing inspections, citations, and \n           notices in the case of Member retirement, defeat, and \n           office moves\n       A commenter has requested regulations that would specify \n     the employing office to whom the General Counsel should issue \n     citations and notices in cases where circumstances have \n     changed since the time of the alleged violation, such as when \n     a Member dies, retires, or is not reelected, or when an \n     employing office moves from one office to another. After \n     considering the matter, the Executive Director has determined \n     that it would be inappropriate to issue procedural rules \n     governing these issues. The hypothetical situations posited \n     by the commenter are better addressed by the General Counsel \n     and ultimately, the Board, in the context of actual cases. \n     When and if the situations hypothesized by the commenter \n     occur, the General Counsel and the Board are better \n     positioned to make determinations based on the facts \n     presented. See NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 294-\n     95 (1974) (use of adjudication rather than rulemaking within \n     agency discretion).\n       G. Technical and nomenclature changes\n       Commenters have suggested a number of technical and \n     nomenclature corrections in the language of the proposed \n     regulations. The Executive Director has considered all of \n     these suggestions and, as appropriate, has adopted them.\n       H. Additional comments\n       One of the commenters requested that the Executive Director \n     review several proposed changes in procedural rules suggested \n     by commenters in response to the earlier July 11, 1996 Notice \n     of Proposed Rulemaking and either promulgate regulations to \n     address these issues or supply a written response as to why \n     such regulations are not necessary. These suggestions \n     included: (1) changes in the special procedures for the \n     Architect of the Capitol and Capitol Police; (2) a rule \n     allowing parties to negotiate changes to the Agreement to \n     Mediate; (3) a procedure by which the parties, instead of the \n     Executive Director, would select Hearing Officers; (4) \n     procedures by which the Office would notify employing offices \n     of various matters; (5) additional requirements for the \n     filing of a complaint; (6) changes in counseling procedures; \n     and (7) a procedure which would allow parties to petition for \n     the recusal of individual Board members.\n       As stated in the preamble of the Notice of Adoption of \n     Amendments to Procedural Rules, such comments and suggestions \n     were not the subject of or germane to the proposals made in \n     that rulemaking. 142 Cong. R. H10672, H10674 and S10980, \n     S10981 (daily ed., Sept. 19, 1996). Nor are they here. The \n     Notice of this rulemaking clearly stated that the proposed \n     revisions and additions to the procedural rules were intended \n     to provide for the implementation of Parts B and C of title \n     II of the CAA, which were generally effective on January 1, \n     1997, and to establish procedures for consideration of \n     matters arising under those parts.\n       As stated in the September 19, 1996 Notice of Adoption of \n     Amendments, the Office, like most agencies, reviews its \n     policies and procedures on an ongoing basis. Where its \n     experience suggests that additional or amended procedures are \n     needed, it will modify its policies and propose amendments to \n     its procedures, to the extent appropriate under the CAA.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C. on this 18th day of April, 1997.\n\n                                              Ricky Silberman,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                             Office of Compliance.\n\n          IV. Text of adopted amendments to procedural rules.\n\n     Sec. 1.01 Scope and Policy\n       These rules of the Office of Compliance govern the \n     procedures for consideration and resolution of alleged \n     violations of the laws made applicable under Parts A, B, C, \n     and D of title II of the Congressional Accountability Act of \n     1995. The rules include procedures for counseling, mediation, \n     and for electing between filing a complaint with the Office \n     of Compliance and filing a civil action in a district court \n     of the United States. The rules also address the procedures \n     for variances and compliance, investigation and enforcement \n     under Part C of title II and procedures for the conduct of \n     hearings held as a result of the filing of a complaint and \n     for appeals to the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance from Hearing Officer decisions, as well as other \n     matters of general applicability to the dispute resolution \n     process and to the operations of the Office of Compliance. It \n     is the policy of the Office that these rules shall be applied \n     with due regard to the rights of all parties and in a manner \n     that expedites the resolution of disputes.\n     Sec. 1.02(i)\n       (i) Party. The term ``party'' means: (1) an employee or \n     employing office in a proceeding under Part A of title II of \n     the Act; (2) a charging individual, an entity alleged to be \n     responsible for correcting a violation, or the General \n     Counsel in a proceeding under Part B of title II of the Act; \n     (3) an employee, employing office, or as appropriate, the \n     General Counsel in a proceeding under Part C of title II of \n     the Act; or (4) a labor organization, individual employing \n     office or employing activity, or, as appropriate, the General \n     Counsel in a proceeding under Part D of title II of the Act.\n     Sec. 1.03(a)(3)\n       (3) Faxing documents. Documents transmitted by FAX machine \n     will be deemed filed on the date received at the Office at \n     202-426-1913, or, in the case of any document to be filed or \n     submitted to the General Counsel, on the date received at the \n     Office of the General Counsel at 202-426-1663. A FAX filing \n     will be timely only if the document is received no later than \n     5:00 PM Eastern Time on the last day of the applicable filing \n     period. Any party using a FAX machine to file a document \n     bears the responsibility for ensuring both that the document \n     is timely and accurately transmitted and confirming that the \n     Office has received a facsimile of the document. The party or \n     individual filing the document may rely on its FAX status \n     report sheet to show that it filed the document in a timely \n     manner, provided that the status report indicates the date of \n     the FAX, the receiver's FAX number, the number of pages \n     included in the FAX, and that transmission was completed.\n     Sec. 1.04(d)\n       (d) Final decisions. Pursuant to section 416(f) of the Act, \n     a final decision entered by a Hearing Officer or by the Board \n     under section 405(g) or 406(e) of the Act, which is in favor \n     of the complaining covered employee, or in favor of the \n     charging party under section 210 of the Act, or reverses a \n     Hearing Officer's decision in favor of a complaining covered \n     employee or charging party, shall be made public, except as \n     otherwise ordered by the Board. The Board may make public any \n     other decision at its discretion.\n     Sec. 1.05(a)\n       (a) An employee, other charging individual or party, a \n     witness, a labor organization, an employing office, or an \n     entity alleged to be responsible for correcting a violation \n     wishing to be represented by another individual must file \n     with the Office a written notice of designation of \n     representative. The representative may be, but is not \n     required to be, an attorney.\n     Sec. 1.07(a)\n       (a) In General. Section 416(a) of the CAA provides that \n     counseling under section 402 shall be strictly confidential, \n     except that the Office and a covered employee may agree to \n     notify the employing office of the allegations. Section \n     416(b) provides that all mediation shall be strictly \n     confidential. Section 416(c) provides that all proceedings \n     and deliberations of hearing officers and the Board, \n     including any related records shall be confidential, except \n     for release of records necessary for judicial actions, access \n     by certain committees of Congress, and, in accordance with \n     section 416(f), publication of certain final decisions. \n     Section 416(c) does not apply to proceedings under section \n     215 of the Act, but does apply to the deliberations of \n     hearing officers and the Board under section 215.

In \n     situations where sections 4.01 through 4.15 set forth general \n     enforcement policies rather than substantive or procedural \n     rules, such policies may be modified in specific \n     circumstances where the General Counsel or the General \n     Counsel's designee determines that an alternative course of \n     action would better serve the objectives of section 215 of \n     the CAA.\n     Sec. 4.02 Authority for Inspection\n       (a) Under section 215(c)(1) of the CAA, upon written \n     request of any employing office or covered employee, the \n     General Counsel is authorized to enter without delay and at \n     reasonable times any place of employment under the \n     jurisdiction of an employing office; to inspect and \n     investigate during regular working hours and at other \n     reasonable times, and within reasonable limits and in a \n     reasonable manner, any such place of employment, and all \n     pertinent conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, \n     devices, equipment and materials therein; to question \n     privately any employing office, operator, agent or employee; \n     and to review records required by the CAA and regulations \n     promulgated thereunder, and other records which are directly \n     related to the purpose of the inspection.\n       (b) Prior to inspecting areas containing information which \n     is classified by an agency of the United States Government \n     (and/or by any congressional committee or other authorized \n     entity within the Legislative Branch) in the interest of \n     national security, and for which security clearance is \n     required as a condition for access to the area(s) to be \n     inspected, the individual(s) conducting the inspection shall \n     have obtained the appropriate security clearance.\n     Sec. 4.03 Requests for inspections by employees and covered \n         employing offices\n       (a) By covered employees and representatives.\n       (1) Any covered employee or representative of covered \n     employees who believes that a violation of section 215 of the \n     CAA exists in any place of employment under the jurisdiction \n     of employing offices may request an inspection of such place \n     of employment by giving notice of the alleged violation to \n     the General Counsel. Any such notice shall be reduced to \n     writing on a form available from the Office, shall set forth \n     with reasonable particularity the grounds for the notice, and \n     shall be signed by the employee or the representative of the \n     employees. A copy shall be provided to the employing office \n     or its agent by the General Counsel or the General Counsel's \n     designee no later than at the time of inspection, except \n     that, upon the written request of the person giving such \n     notice, his or her name and the names of individual employees \n     referred to therein shall not appear in such copy or on any \n     record published, released, or made available by the General \n     Counsel.\n       (2) If upon receipt of such notification the General \n     Counsel's designee determines that the notice meets the \n     requirements set forth in subparagraph (1) of this section, \n     and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the \n     alleged violation exists, he or she shall cause an inspection \n     to be made as soon as practicable, to determine if such \n     alleged violation exists. Inspections under this section \n     shall not be limited to matters referred to in the notice.\n       (3) Prior to or during any inspection of a place of \n     employment, any covered employee or representative of \n     employees may notify the General Counsel's designee, in \n     writing, of any violation of section 215 of the CAA which he \n     or she has reason to believe exists in such place of \n     employment. Any such notice shall comply with the \n     requirements of subparagraph (1) of this section.\n       (b) By employing offices. Upon written request of any \n     employing office, the General Counsel or the General \n     Counsel's designee shall inspect and investigate places of \n     employment under the jurisdiction of employing offices under \n     section 215(c)(1) of the CAA. Any such requests shall be \n     reduced to writing on a form available from the Office.\n     Sec. 4.04 Objection to inspection\n       Upon a refusal to permit the General Counsel's designee, in \n     exercise of his or her official duties, to enter without \n     delay and at reasonable times any place of employment or any \n     place therein, to inspect, to review records, or to question \n     any employing office, operator, agent, or employee, in \n     accordance with section 4.02 or to permit a representative of \n     employees to accompany the General Counsel's designee during \n     the physical inspection of any workplace in accordance with \n     section 4.07, the General Counsel's designee shall terminate \n     the inspection or confine the inspection to other areas, \n     conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices, \n     equipment, materials, records, or interviews concerning which \n     no objection is raised. The General Counsel's designee shall \n     endeavor to ascertain the reason for such refusal, and shall \n     immediately report the refusal and the reason therefor to the \n     General Counsel, who shall take appropriate action.\n     Sec. 4.05 Entry not a waiver\n       Any permission to enter, inspect, review records, or \n     question any person, shall not imply or be conditioned upon a \n     waiver of any cause of action or citation under section 215 \n     of the CAA.\n     Sec. 4.06 Advance notice of inspections\n       (a) Advance notice of inspections may not be given, except \n     in the following situations: (1) in cases of apparent \n     imminent danger, to enable the employing office to abate the \n     danger as quickly as possible; (2) in circumstances where the \n     inspection can most effectively be conducted after regular \n     business hours or where special preparations are necessary \n     for an inspection; (3) where necessary to assure the presence \n     of representatives of the employing office and employees or \n     the appropriate personnel needed to aid in the inspection; \n     and (4) in other circumstances where the General Counsel \n     determines that the giving of advance notice would enhance \n     the probability of an effective and thorough inspection.\n       (b) In the situations described in paragraph (a) of this \n     section, advance notice of inspections may be given only if \n     authorized by the General Counsel, except that in cases of \n     apparent imminent danger, advance notice may be given by the \n     General Counsel's designee without such authorization if the \n     General Counsel is not immediately available. When advance \n     notice is given, it shall be the employing office's \n     responsibility promptly to notify the authorized \n     representative of employees, if the identity of such \n     representative is known to the employing office. (See section \n     4.08(b) as to situations where there is no authorized \n     representative of employees.) Upon the request of the \n     employing office, the General Counsel will inform the \n     authorized representative of employees of the inspection, \n     provided that the employing office furnishes the General \n     Counsel's designee with the identity of such representative \n     and with such other information as is necessary to enable him \n     promptly to inform such representative of the inspection. \n     Advance notice in any of the situations described in \n     paragraph (a) of this section shall not be given more than 24 \n     hours before the inspection is scheduled to be conducted, \n     except in apparent imminent danger situations and in other \n     unusual circumstances.\n     Sec. 4.07 Conduct of inspections\n       (a) Subject to the provisions of section 4.02, inspections \n     shall take place at such times and in such places of \n     employment as the General Counsel may direct. At the \n     beginning of an inspection, the General Counsel's designee \n     shall present his or her credentials to the operator of the \n     facility or the management employee in charge at the place \n     of employment to be inspected; explain the nature and \n     purpose of the inspection; and indicate generally the \n     scope of the inspection and the records specified in \n     section 4.02 which he or she wishes to review. However, \n     such designation of records shall not preclude access to \n     additional records specified in section 4.02.\n       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have authority to \n     take environmental samples and to take or obtain photographs \n     related to the purpose of the inspection, employ other \n     reasonable investigative techniques, and question privately, \n     any employing office, operator, agent or employee of a \n     covered facility. As used herein, the term ``employ other \n     reasonable investigative techniques'' includes, but is not \n     limited to, the use of devices to measure employee exposures \n     and the attachment of personal sampling equipment such as \n     dosimeters, pumps, badges and other similar devices to \n     employees in order to monitor their exposures.\n       (c) In taking photographs and samples, the General \n     Counsel's designees shall take reasonable precautions to \n     insure that such actions with flash, spark-producing, or \n     other equipment would not be hazardous. The General Counsel's \n     designees shall comply with all employing office safety and \n     health rules and practices at the workplace or location being \n     inspected, and they shall wear and use appropriate protective \n     clothing and equipment.\n       (d) The conduct of inspections shall be such as to preclude \n     unreasonable disruption of the operations of the employing \n     office.\n       (e) At the conclusion of an inspection, the General \n     Counsel's designee shall confer with the employing office or \n     its representative and informally advise it of any apparent \n     safety or health violations disclosed by the inspection. \n     During such conference, the employing office shall be \n     afforded an opportunity to bring to the attention of the \n     General Counsel's designee any pertinent information \n     regarding conditions in the workplace.\n       (f) Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subpart.\n       (g) Trade Secrets.\n       (1) At the commencement of an inspection, the employing \n     office may identify areas in the establishment which contain \n     or which might reveal a trade secret as referred to in \n     section 15 of the OSHAct and section 1905 of title 18 of the \n     United States Code. If the General Counsel's designee has no \n     clear reason to question such identification, information \n     contained in such areas, including all negatives and prints \n     of photographs, and environmental samples, shall be labeled \n     ``confidential--trade secret'' and shall not be disclosed\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\n     by the General Counsel and/or his designees, except that such \n     information may be disclosed to other officers or employees \n     concerned with carrying out section 215 of the CAA or when \n     relevant in any proceeding under section 215. In any such \n     proceeding the hearing officer or the Board shall issue such \n     orders as may be appropriate to protect the confidentiality \n     of trade secrets.\n       (2) Upon the request of an employing office, any authorized \n     representative of employees under section 4.08 in an area \n     containing trade secrets shall be an employee in that area or \n     an employee authorized by the employing office to enter that \n     area. Where there is no such representative or employee, the \n     General Counsel's designee shall consult with a reasonable \n     number of employees who work in that area concerning matters \n     of safety and health.\n     Sec. 4.08 Representatives of employing offices and employees\n       (a) The General Counsel's designee shall be in charge of \n     inspections and questioning of persons. A representative of \n     the employing office and a representative authorized by its \n     employees shall be given an opportunity to accompany the \n     General Counsel's designee during the physical inspection of \n     any workplace for the purpose of aiding such inspection. The \n     General Counsel's designee may permit additional employing \n     office representatives and additional representatives \n     authorized by employees to accompany the designee where he or \n     she determines that such additional representatives will \n     further aid the inspection. A different employing office and \n     employee representative may accompany the General Counsel's \n     designee during each different phase of an inspection if this \n     will not interfere with the conduct of the inspection.\n       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have authority to \n     resolve all disputes as to who is the representative \n     authorized by the employing office and employees for the \n     purpose of this section. If there is no authorized \n     representative of employees, or if the General Counsel's \n     designee is unable to determine with reasonable certainty who \n     is such representative, he or she shall consult with a \n     reasonable number of employees concerning matters of safety \n     and health in the workplace.\n       (c) The representative(s) authorized by employees shall be \n     an employee(s) of the employing office. However, if in the \n     judgment of the General Counsel's designee, good cause has \n     been shown why accompaniment by a third party who is not an \n     employee of the employing office (such as an industrial \n     hygienist or a safety engineer) is reasonably necessary to \n     the conduct of an effective and thorough physical inspection \n     of the workplace, such third party may accompany the General \n     Counsel's designee during the inspection.\n       (d) The General Counsel's designee may deny the right of \n     accompaniment under this section to any person whose conduct \n     interferes with a fair and orderly inspection. With regard to \n     information classified by an agency of the U.S. Government \n     (and/or by any congressional committee or other authorized \n     entity within the Legislative Branch) in the interest of \n     national security, only persons authorized to have access to \n     such information may accompany the General Counsel's designee \n     in areas containing such information.\n     Sec. 4.09 Consultation with employees\n       The General Counsel's designee may consult with employees \n     concerning matters of occupational safety and health to the \n     extent he or she deems necessary for the conduct of an \n     effective and thorough inspection. During the course of an \n     inspection, any employee shall be afforded an opportunity to \n     bring any violation of section 215 of the CAA which he or she \n     has reason to believe exists in the workplace to the \n     attention of the General Counsel's designee.\n     Sec. 4.10 Inspection not warranted; informal review\n       (a) If the General Counsel's designee determines that an \n     inspection is not warranted because there are no reasonable \n     grounds to believe that a violation or danger exists with \n     respect to a notice of violation under section 4.03(a), he or \n     she shall notify the party giving the notice in writing of \n     such determination. The complaining party may obtain review \n     of such determination by submitting a written statement of \n     position with the General Counsel and, at the same time, \n     providing the employing office with a copy of such statement \n     by certified mail. The employing office may submit an \n     opposing written statement of position with the \n     General Counsel and, at the same time, providing the \n     complaining party with a copy of such statement by \n     certified mail. Upon the request of the complaining party \n     or the employing office, the General Counsel, at his or \n     her discretion, may hold an informal conference in which \n     the complaining party and the employing office may orally \n     present their views. After considering all written and \n     oral views presented, the General Counsel shall affirm, \n     modify, or reverse the designee's determination and \n     furnish the complaining party and the employing office \n     with written notification of this decision and the reasons \n     therefor. The decision of the General Counsel shall be \n     final and not reviewable.\n       (b) If the General Counsel's designee determines that an \n     inspection is not warranted because the requirements of \n     section 4.03(a)(1) have not been met, he or she shall notify \n     the complaining party in writing of such determination. Such \n     determination shall be without prejudice to the filing of a \n     new notice of alleged violation meeting the requirements of \n     section 4.03(a)(1).\n     Sec. 4.11 Citations\n       (a) If, on the basis of the inspection, the General Counsel \n     believes that a violation of any requirement of section 215 \n     of the CAA, or of any standard, rule or order promulgated \n     pursuant to section 215 of the CAA, has occurred, he or she \n     shall issue a citation to the employing office responsible \n     for correction of the violation, as determined under section \n     1.106 of the Board's regulations implementing section 215 of \n     the CAA, either a citation or a notice of de minimis \n     violations that have no direct or immediate relationship to \n     safety or health. An appropriate citation or notice of de \n     minimis violations shall be issued even though after being \n     informed of an alleged violation by the General Counsel, the \n     employing office immediately abates, or initiates steps to \n     abate, such alleged violation. Any citation shall be issued \n     with reasonable promptness after termination of the \n     inspection. No citation may be issued under this section \n     after the expiration of 6 months following the occurrence of \n     any alleged violation.\n       (b) Any citation shall describe with particularity the \n     nature of the alleged violation, including a reference to the \n     provision(s) of the CAA, standard, rule, regulation, or order \n     alleged to have been violated. Any citation shall also fix a \n     reasonable time or times for the abatement of the alleged \n     violation.\n       (c) If a citation or notice of de minimis violations is \n     issued for a violation alleged in a request for inspection \n     under section 4.03(a)(1), or a notification of violation \n     under section 4.03(a)(3), a copy of the citation or notice of \n     de minimis violations shall also be sent to the employee or \n     representative of employees who made such request or \n     notification.\n       (d) After an inspection, if the General Counsel determines \n     that a citation is not warranted with respect to a danger or \n     violation alleged to exist in a request for inspection under \n     section 4.03(a)(1) or a notification of violation under \n     section 4.03(a)(3), the informal review procedures prescribed \n     in 4.15 shall be applicable. After considering all views \n     presented, the General Counsel shall affirm the previous \n     determination, order a reinspection, or issue a citation if \n     he or she believes that the inspection disclosed a violation. \n     The General Counsel shall furnish the party that submitted \n     the notice and the employing office with written notification \n     of the determination and the reasons therefor. The \n     determination of the General Counsel shall be final and not \n     reviewable.\n       (e) Every citation shall state that the issuance of a \n     citation does not constitute a finding that a violation of \n     section 215 has occurred.\n       (f) No citation may be issued to an employing office \n     because of a rescue activity undertaken by an employee of \n     that employing office with respect to an individual in \n     imminent danger unless:\n       (1)(i) Such employee is designated or assigned by the \n     employing office to have responsibility to perform or assist \n     in rescue operations, and\n       (ii) The employing office fails to provide protection of \n     the safety and health of such employee, including failing to \n     provide appropriate training and rescue equipment; or\n       (2)(i) Such employee is directed by the employing office to \n     perform rescue activities in the course of carrying out the \n     employee's job duties, and\n       (ii) The employing office fails to provide protection of \n     the safety and health of such employee, including failing to \n     provide appropriate training and rescue equipment; or\n       (3)(i) Such employee is employed in a workplace that \n     requires the employee to carry out duties that are directly \n     related to a workplace operation where the likelihood of \n     life-threatening accidents is foreseeable, such as a \n     workplace operation where employees are located in confined \n     spaces or trenches, handle hazardous waste, respond to \n     emergency situations, perform excavations, or perform \n     construction over water; and\n       (ii) Such employee has not been designated or assigned to \n     perform or assist in rescue operations and voluntarily elects \n     to rescue such an individual; and\n       (iii) The employing office has failed to instruct employees \n     not designated or assigned to perform or assist in rescue \n     operations of the arrangements for rescue, not to attempt \n     rescue, and of the hazards of attempting rescue without \n     adequate training or equipment.\n       (4) For the purpose of this policy, the term ``imminent \n     danger'' means the existence of any condition or practice \n     that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious \n     physical harm before such condition or practice can be \n     abated.\n     Sec. 4.12 Imminent danger\n       (a) Whenever and as soon as a designee of the General \n     Counsel concludes on the basis of an inspection that \n     conditions or practices exist in any place of employment \n     which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious \n     physical harm immediately or before the imminence of such \n     danger can be eliminated through the enforcement procedures \n     otherwise provided for by section 215(c), he or she shall \n     inform the affected employees and employing offices of the \n     danger and that he or she is recommending the filing of a \n     petition to restrain such conditions or practices and for \n     other appropriate relief in accordance with section 13(a) of \n     the OSHAct, as applied by section 215(b) of the CAA. \n     Appropriate citations may be issued\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\n     with respect to an imminent danger even though, after being \n     informed of such danger by the General Counsel's designee, \n     the employing office immediately eliminates the imminence of \n     the danger and initiates steps to abate such danger.\n     Sec. 4.13 Posting of citations\n       (a) Upon receipt of any citation under section 215 of the \n     CAA, the employing office shall immediately post such \n     citation, or a copy thereof, unedited, at or near each place \n     an alleged violation referred to in the citation occurred, \n     except as provided below. Where, because of the nature of the \n     employing office's operations, it is not practicable to post \n     the citation at or near each place of alleged violation, such \n     citation shall be posted, unedited, in a prominent place \n     where it will be readily observable by all affected \n     employees. For example, where employing offices are engaged \n     in activities which are physically dispersed, the citation \n     may be posted at the location to which employees report \n     each day. Where employees do not primarily work at or \n     report to a single location, the citation may be posted at \n     the location from which the employees operate to carry out \n     their activities. The employing office shall take steps to \n     ensure that the citation is not altered, defaced, or \n     covered by other material. Notices of de minimis \n     violations need not be posted.\n       (b) Each citation, or a copy thereof, shall remain posted \n     until the violation has been abated, or for 3 working days, \n     whichever is later. The pendency of any proceedings regarding \n     the citation shall not affect its posting responsibility \n     under this section unless and until the Board issues a final \n     order vacating the citation.\n       (c) An employing office to whom a citation has been issued \n     may post a notice in the same location where such citation is \n     posted indicating that the citation is being contested before \n     the Board, and such notice may explain the reasons for such \n     contest.

A bill entitled the ``Public Land Management Participation \nAct of 1997''; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          THE PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT PARTICIPATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to rise \nthis afternoon to introduce a very important piece of legislation that \nI know the occupant of the chair will find interesting. It is called \nthe Public Land Management Participation Act of 1997.\n  This legislation is intended to put the word ``public'' and the \npopulace back into public land management and the word ``environment,'' \nback into environmental protection.\n  Passage of this act will ensure that all the gains that we made over \nthe past quarter of a century in creating an open, participatory \nGovernment which affords strong environmental protection for our public \nlands are really protected.\n  For those who thought that those battles were fought and won with the \npassage of the National Environmental Protection Act in 1969 and the \nFederal Land Policy Management Act in 1976, I have some bad news. There \nis one last battle to be fought.\n  Standing in this very Chamber on January 20, 1975, Mr. President, \nSenator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson of Washington State spoke to the \npassion Americans feel for their public lands. He said:\n\n       The public lands of the United States have always provided \n     the arena in which we Americans have struggled to fulfill our \n     dreams. Even today dreams of wealth, adventure, and escape \n     are still being acted out on those far-flung public lands. \n     These lands and the dreams--fulfilled and unfulfilled--which \n     they foster are part of our national destiny. They belong to \n     all Americans.\n\n  I quote and emphasize, Mr. President, ``They belong to all \nAmericans.''\n  Amazingly--there exist today legal authorities by which the \nPresident, without the public process or congressional approval, can \ncreate vast land management units called national monuments, world \nheritage sites, and biospheric reserves.\n  Special management units which affect how millions of acres of our \npublic lands are managed. What people can do on those lands is also \naffected, what the future will be for surrounding communities.\n  That is a powerful trust to bestow on anyone, even a President.\n  On September 12, 1996, the good people of Utah woke up to find \nthemselves the most recent recipient of a philosophy that says, ``Trust \nus. We are from the Government, and we know what is best for you.'' On \nthat day, standing not in Utah but in the State of Arizona, our \nPresident invoked the 1906 Antiquities Act to create 1.7 million acres \nof national monument in southern Utah.\n  Notice, Mr. President, he did not do this in Utah. He did it in \nArizona. One can only assume he might have had some protests if he had \ndone it in Utah. The withdrawal, however, took place in Utah. It \ncreated a 1.7 million acre national monument in the southern part of \nthe State. By utilizing this antiquated law, the President was able to \navoid--that's right, avoid--Nation's environmental laws and ignore \npublic participation laws as well. With one swipe of the pen, every \nshred of public input and environmental law promulgated in this country \nover the past quarter of a century was shoved into the trash heap of \npolitical expediency.\n  What happened in Utah last fall is but the latest example of a small \ncadre of administration officials deciding for all Americans how our \npublic lands should be used. It is by no means the only one, Mr. \nPresident. As the Senator from Alaska, I have had a great deal of \npersonal experience in this area.\n  In 1978, President Jimmy Carter created 17 national monuments in \nAlaska covering more than 55 million acres of lands. That is an area \nabout the size of South Carolina. He withdrew these lands, with the \nstroke of his pen--no public process, no hearing, no participation from \nthe State. This was then followed in short order by Secretary of the \nInterior Cecil Andrus, who withdrew an additional 50 million. A total \nof 105 million acres, Mr. President. All this land was withdrawn for \nmultiple use without any input from the people of my State, the public, \nor the Congress of the United States. With over 100 million acres of \nwithdrawn land held over Alaska's head, like the sword of Damocles; we \nwere forced to cut the best deal we could. Twenty years later, the \npeople of my State are still struggling to cope with the weight of \nthese decisions.\n\n  I would not be here this afternoon if the public, the people of Utah \nand Congress, had not been denied a voice in the creation of the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument. I would not be here if \nenvironmental protection procedures had not been ignored.\n  But the people were denied the opportunity to speak. Mr. President, \nCongress was denied its opportunity to participate, and environmental \nprocedure was simply ignored. The only voice we have heard was the \nPresident's. Without bothering to ask us what we thought about it, he \ntold the citizens of Utah and the rest of the country that he knew \nbetter than we did what was good for us.\n  Now, this is an administration that prides itself in a public \nprocess. There was no public process here, Mr. President. We had been \ndebating for some time the issue of Utah wilderness. It was ongoing, \nbut the President, for political expediency, took it upon himself to \ninvoke the Antiquities Act. It has been a long time since anyone has \nhad the right to make those kind of unilateral public land decisions \nfor the American public. Since the passages of the Federal Land Policy \nand Management Act in 1976, we have had a system of law underpinning \npublic land use decisions. Embodied with this law is public \nparticipation. Agencies propose an action, they present the action to \nthe public, the public debates the issue. The public can then appeal \nbad decisions, the courts resolve the disputes, and the management unit \nis then created.\n  Where was this public process, Mr. President, in the special use \ndesignation of 1.7 million acres of Federal land in southern Utah? The \nanswer is clear: There wasn't any. Since the passage of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nof 1969, activities which affect the environment are subject to strict \nenvironmental laws. Does anyone believe there was no environmental \nthreat posed by the creation of a national monument?\n  Imagine how the sensitive natural features of the high desert \nenvironment would respond to the rhythmic pounding of unlimited hiking \nboots worn by legions of adoring visitors as they tromp through the \narea. Where is the NEPA compliance documentation associated with this \naction? There is not any.\n  The creation of specialized public use designations such as national \nparks and wilderness areas are debated within the Halls of Congress, \nright here. These debates provide for the financial and legal \nresponsibilities which come with the creation of special management \nunits.\n  Where are the proceedings from those debates? There aren't any, Mr. \nPresident. They simply don't exist because, in the heat of an election \nyear, the administration determined that the public process, \nenvironmental analyses and congressional deliberations were simply a \nwaste of time.\n  Mr. President, either you believe in a public process or you do not; \nyou can't have it both ways. If we can no longer trust the \nadministration to involve the public in major land use decisions, then \nwhere does it fall? It falls right here to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, the legislation which I offer today will require any \nfuture designations of national monuments, world heritage sites, or \nbiospheric reserves to follow the public participation principles laid \ndown under existing law over the past 25 years. No poetic images, no \nflowery words, no smoke and mirrors, just good old-fashioned public \nland management process.\n  Before these special land management units can be created, my \nlegislation will require that the agencies gather and analyze resource \ndata affected by the land use decisions; full public participation in \nthe creation of these units with all appeal rights protected; \ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act; congressional \nreview and ratification, and Presidential signature.\n  No longer will an administration be able to sidestep public \nparticipation and environmental reviews to further political agendas. \nNobody--not even the President of the United States --should be above \nthe law.\n  The Public Land Management Participation Act will make all future \nland use decisions a joint responsibility of the public, the Congress, \nand the President--no more loopholes.\n  I don't question the need for national monuments, world heritage \nsites, or biospheric reserves. Sometimes they are needed to protect \nhistoric treasures, natural resources, et cetera. But if they are to \nserve the common good, they must be created under the same system of \nland management law that has governed the use of the public domain for \nthe past 25 years.\n  There has always been a sacred bond between the American people and \nthe lands they hold in common ownership. No one, regardless of high \nstation or political influence, has the right to impose his will over \nthe means by which the destiny of those lands is decided. This \nlegislation reestablishes that bond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 691\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Land Management \n     Participation Act of 1997.''\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the public and \n     the Congress have both the right and a reasonable opportunity \n     to participate in decisions that affect the use and \n     management of all public lands owned or controlled by the \n     Government of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. CLARIFICATION OF PUBLIC AND CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN \n                   DECLARATION OF NATIONAL MONUMENTS.\n\n       The Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431a) is amended by adding \n     the following new section:\n       ``431b. Public and Congressional Roles in National Monument \n     Declarations.--(a) The Secretaries of the Interior and \n     Agriculture shall provide an opportunity for public \n     involvement and by regulation shall establish procedures, \n     including public hearings where appropriate, to give Federal, \n     State, and local governments and the public, adequate notice \n     and opportunity to comment upon and participate in the \n     formulation of plans relating to the declaration of national \n     monuments upon the lands owned or controlled by the \n     Government of the United States pursuant to the authority of \n     the Antiquities Act (16 U.S.C. 431).\n       ``(b) In addition, the Secretary of the Interior and \n     Agriculture shall, prior to any recommendations for \n     declaration of an area,\n       ``(i) ensure compliance with all applicable federal land \n     management and environmental statutes, including the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (40 U.S.C. 4321-4370d);\n       ``(ii) cause mineral surveys to be conducted by the \n     Geological Survey to determine the mineral values, if any, \n     that may be present in such areas;\n       ``(iii) identify all existing rights held on federal lands \n     contained within such areas by type and acreage; and\n       ``(iv) identify all State lands contained within such \n     areas.\n       ``(c) After such reviews and mineral surveys, the Secretary \n     of the Interior or Agriculture shall report to the President \n     his recommendations as to what lands owned or controlled by \n     the Government of the United States warrant declaration as a \n     national monument.\n       ``(d) The President shall advise the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of his \n     recommendations with respect to declaration as national \n     monuments of each such area, together with a map thereof and \n     a definition of its boundaries. Such advice by the President \n     shall be given within two years of the receipt of each report \n     from the Secretary. After the effective date of Public Land \n     Management Participation Act, a recommendation of the \n     President for declaration of a national monument shall become \n     effective only if so provided by an Act of Congress.''\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to require that applications for passports for minors \nhave parental signatures; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                          PASSPORT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation which \nwill help resolve a serious problem that plagues this Nation. Last \nyear, and unless we do something this year, 1,000 young boys and girls \nwill be abducted from their home and taken to foreign countries. Most \nof them will never come back to this country. These are young people \nwho have every right to be in this country, but one of their parents \ngets a passport and takes them someplace.\n  This legislation I am introducing involves a young boy by the name of \nMikey Kale. His father was Croatian. His father got a passport signed--\nnot notifying the mother--and went to Croatia. This is one of the happy \nendings of these stories. This young boy was allowed to come home with \nhis mother--not allowed to come home. She went through a lot of time \nand effort and spent a lot of money to get him so she could bring him \nhome.\n  Most of the time the children never return. For example, Mr. \nPresident, this last week on ABC's ``Prime Time,'' they featured a case \nvery similar to the Mikey Kale case, a case that involved a mother who \ntook a daughter to Costa Rica. She did not have custody of the child. \nSole custody was awarded to the father. A warrant was issued for her \narrest. For more than 3 years this father has searched, and suffered, \ntrying to get back his daughter. He has been unable to do so. It \nappears, even pursuant to that television program, that they know where \nthe child is, but because of the complexity of the law in Costa Rica, \nthe child has not been allowed to return.\n  Extradition law, generally, does not include child abduction. So most \nparents are stymied. I repeat, 1,000 young boys and girls each year are \nabducted in this manner. Usually, these abductions take place during or \nafter a contentious divorce, sometimes even by an abusive parent, many \ntimes by an abusive parent. At a time when these children are most \nvulnerable and most uncertain about their future, they are snatched and \ntaken to a foreign country.\n  The tragedy of this wrong is best illustrated by an ordeal forced \nupon people from the State of Nevada. No family should have to go \nthrough what\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\nFred and Barbara Spierer went through in 1993. Barbara's ex-husband \nobtained a passport for 6-year-old Mikey without Barbara's knowledge, \nconsent or approval. On Valentine's Day, 1993, he abducted Mikey, \nboarded an airplane, and left for his country of Croatia, his native \ncountry. At that time, that country was, for lack of a better \ndescription, in a state of war. After tremendous emotional and \nfinancial efforts, the Spierers were able to get Mikey to come home.\n  I stress, this problem is more common than we would like to think. It \nhas been suggested that we do something about it. This legislation will \ndo that. What, in effect, this legislation would do is say if you are \ngoing to take a child outside the United States, you must have the \nsignatures of both parents. If one parent has custody, then only that \nsignature is required. If there is joint custody, it would take both \nsignatures. It is not difficult to get the signatures of both parents \nto take a child outside the country. Thousands of parents throughout \nthe United States are currently undergoing the same emotional and \nfinancial stress that the Spierers experienced. This simple change in \nthe law would prevent future agony and distress.\n  As I indicated, Mr. President, few parents are as fortunate as the \nSpierers. Few will ever see their children again. Recovery rates for \nchildren, once they are in a foreign country, are extremely low. It is \na sad fact that once a child leaves the United States, it is nearly \nimpossible to get the child returned as most nations do not recognize \ncustody orders from the U.S. courts.\n  As I said, most extradition treaties do not cover international \nparental abductions. Experience shows that foreign governments are \ngenerally reluctant to extradite parental abductors. Often when facing \nextradition, the abducting parents will hide the child with a friend or \nrelative in a foreign country or even go to another foreign country, \ncomplicating things even more. This action prevents the child from ever \nbeing returned.\n  At any rate, getting a child returned in the United States is \nextremely expensive, far beyond the resources of most families. Many \nfamilies have to spend in excess of $50,000 just in lawyers trying to \nretrieve their children, often, to no avail. Prevention is the only \nfeasible way of dealing with international parental abductions. The \nbest way to prevent international parental abductions is to make it \nmore difficult for parental abductors to obtain passports for the minor \nchildren.\n  The aim of the Mikey Kale Passport Notification Act is prevention. It \nprevents parental abductors from obtaining U.S. passports for their \nminor children. This, Mr. President, seems the least we could do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 693. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the value of qualified historic property shall not be included in \ndetermining the taxable estate of a decedent; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                THE ESTATE TAX HISTORY PRESERVATION ACT\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nprovide a new tax incentive for qualifying owners of national historic \nlandmark houses that will encourage the preservation and public \naccessibility to these houses. It is designed to prevent private owners \nof historical properties from being forced to sell because of concern \nover the financial burden of Federal estate taxes.\n  Under current law, the value of historical property is included in \ndetermining the taxable estate of a decedent. This raises serious \nconcerns to families that are maintaining and opening to the public \nthese architectural historical homes. They are sharing these treasures \nwith our Nation. To force the operation of these privately funded \nmuseum properties to end, due to fear over future estate tax burdens \nthat will be thrust on their descendants is depriving our citizens the \nopportunity to enjoy the architectural wonders of these homes. Tourists \nin many States will be denied the opportunity to visit these homes and \nexperience the heritage of these historical sites.\n  Mr. President, I propose that an estate tax exemption be provided for \nqualified historical properties. The number of historical homes that \nwill qualify is modest since this legislation requires private, taxable \nownership and national historical landmark status, as well as a \nwillingness on the part of the owner to operate the premises as a \nmuseum subject to strict requirements. While the legislation has \nminimal effects on Federal revenues it plays a major role in preserving \nextraordinarily important properties.\n  This bill is an opportunity for the Government to encourage \npreservation of history. Historical homes help preserve the themes of \nour common heritage and highlight the unique pattern of each community. \nThey contribute to the perpetuation of the historical fabric of our \nnational life. They are a source of a community's pride in \naccomplishment and beauty.\n  Section 1(b)(7) of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 \nstates that:\n\n       Although the major burdens of historic preservation have \n     been borne and major efforts initiated by private agencies \n     and individuals, and both should continue to play a vital \n     role, it is nevertheless necessary and appropriate for the \n     Federal Government to accelerate its historic preservation \n     programs and activities to get maximum encouragement to \n     agencies and individuals undertaking preservation by private \n     means, and to assist State and local governments and the \n     National Trust Historic Preservation in the United States to \n     expand and accelerate their historical preservation programs \n     and activities.\n\n  That is what this legislation does. It encourages private citizens to \npreserve historical properties rather than sell or develop them despite \ntheir desire to do so. Winston Churchill recognized the importance of \npreserving historical properties when in 1943 he said ``We shape our \nbuildings, and afterwards our buildings shape us''.\n  Mr President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join \nme in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the \nbill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 693\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish limitations on the use of funds for U.N. \npeacekeeping activities; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                   UNITED NATIONS REFORM LEGISLATION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a package of three \nbills which address the most critical issues affecting our relations \nwith the United Nations. These are the U.S. arrearage in financial \ncontributions to the United Nations, the sharing of U.S. intelligence \nwith the United Nations, and U.S. contributions to U.N. peacekeeping \nactivities.\n\n  The United Nations Reform Act of 1997 is a bill that I have been \nworking on for over a year in my former capacity as chair of the \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on International Operations. With the \nUnited Nations now entering its second half-century, the question being \nraised is not whether the United Nations can continue its growth for \nanother 50 years, but whether it can survive as an important \ninternational institution for the next 5.\n  With a new Secretary of State who formerly served as U.N. Ambassador, \nwith a new U.N. Ambassador who formerly served as a respected Member of \nCongress, and with a new U.N. Secretary General, I believe that we have \na unique opportunity over the next 2 years to genuinely restore a \nbipartisan consensus on the United Nations within Congress and among \nthe American people. That is the intent of this legislation, which sets \nreasonable and achievable reform criteria for the United Nations, \nlinked to a 5-year repayment plan for the nearly $1 billion in\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\narrearages that have built up in the U.N. system over the past few \nyears.\n  The plan would set up a five-step annual process under which the \nPresident would each year have to certify that specific reform \nguideposts have been met at the United Nations, permitting the payment \neach year of one-fifth of outstanding U.S. arrearages.\n  In the first year, the President would have to certify that a hard \nfreeze zero nominal growth budget at the United Nations had been \nmaintained and that budgetary transparency at the world body had been \nenhanced through opening up the United Nations to member State auditing \nand fully funding the new U.N. inspector general office.\n  In the second year, the President would have to certify that U.S. \nrepresentation had been restored to a key U.N. budgetary oversight \nbody, the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions \n[ACABQ].\n  In the third year, the President would have to certify that a long-\nstanding U.N. peacekeeping reform goal had been achieved. This reform \nwould ensure that the United States receives full credit or \nreimbursement for the very substantial logistical and in-kind support \nour military provides to assessed U.N. peacekeeping missions.\n  In the fourth year, the President would have to certify that a \nsignificant reform in the United Nations' budget process had been \nachieved. This reform would be to divide the U.N. regular budget into \nan assessed core budget and a voluntary program budget. The source of \nmuch of the United Nations' problems stems from the fact that the \nUnited Nations' assessed budget is increasingly used for development \nprograms and other activities that should not be included in our \nmandatory dues for membership. This reform can be achieved without a \nrevision in the U.N. Charter.\n  Finally, in the fifth year the President would have to certify that a \nmajor U.N. consolidation plan has been approved and implemented. This \nplan must entail a significant reduction in staff and an elimination of \nthe rampant duplication, overlap, and lack of coordination that exists \nthroughout the U.N. system.\n  Clearly, there is an urgent need to turn around the United Nations' \ndangerous slide into constant crisis, which could ultimately threaten \nthe organization's usefulness as an important tool for addressing world \nproblems. I am convinced that this can only be achieved through the \nkind of bold reform agenda that is set forth in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is useful for us to look back on the \noriginal purpose of the United Nations, as it was envisioned 51 years \nago. The United Nations was created from the ashes of World War II, \nwith the hope of avoiding future world-wide conflagrations through \ninternational cooperation. The main focus for this mission was the \nSecurity Council, the only entity empowered under the U.N. Charter to \nact on the great questions of world peace. The General Assembly was \nintended to be a forum for debate on any issue that any nation wanted \nto bring before the assembled nations of the world. The U.N. \nSecretariat was to be a small professional staff needed to support the \nactivities of the Security Council and General Assembly.\n  The U.N. system was also to conduct specific activities in technical \ncooperation, such as those undertaken by the International Civil \nAviation Organization and the International Telecommunications Union. \nFinally, the United Nations was to have an important role in responding \nto international humanitarian crises. Most critical is the work of the \nU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, who today protects over 40 million \nof the world's most vulnerable men, women, and children--particularly \nwomen and children, who comprise 80 percent of the world's refugees.\n  Regrettably, the United Nations system that exists today falls short \nof the intentions of its founders. There are two interrelated, \nfundamental problems with U.N. system. One is that there are those who \nattempted to use the world organization to advance agendas that frankly \ndo not reflect world realities. The more the United Nations is used to \ntranscend what some see as the harsh realities of the world and its \nNation-State system, the less relevant the United Nations becomes to \nthe real world in which we all live.\n  Closely related has been the massive and uncoordinated growth of the \nUnited Nations and its specialized agencies. The U.N. General Assembly \nand its related bodies in the specialized agencies have used the tool \nof the budget to grow the U.N. bureaucracy far beyond what is needed to \nrespond to real world problems. The small professional staff of the \nU.N. Secretariat now approaches 18,000--counting the proliferation of \nconsultants and contract employees--and the staff of the U.N. system \nworldwide now exceeds 53,000.\n  Too many nations simply do not find a compelling need for efficiency \nand budgetary restraint in the U.N. system. Of the U.N.'s 185 member \nnations, a near-majority 91 countries are assessed at the minimum .01 \npercent rate, paying essentially nothing toward U.N. budget. The top \nten assessed countries--United States, Japan, Germany, France, Russia, \nBritain, Italy, Canada, Spain and Brazil--are billed for 78 percent of \nthe U.N. budget, with the United States, at 25 percent, paying nearly \ntwice that of any other country. In just 10 years of supposed zero-\ngrowth budgets, the U.N.'s budget has doubled. In the last 18 years the \nU.N.'s budget has tripled.\n\n  There are those who argue that all of the U.N.'s problems come from \nthe United States. But the United Nation's difficulties with the United \nStates arise from these deeply rooted problems within the U.N. \nstructure itself. Even many supporters of the United Nations have \ncharacterized today's U.N. system as bloated, inefficient, duplicative, \nand disorganized. For instance, Canadian businessman and six-time U.N. \nUnder-Secretary-General Maurice Strong has stated that the United \nNations ``could work better than it does today with less than half as \nmany people.'' I believe it is significant, and encouraging, that the \nnew Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, has appointed Mr. Strong to be \nhis top adviser on reform issues.\n  The surprising thing is that among serious analysts of the United \nNations there is remarkable agreement on what needs to be done. The \nU.N. system needs to be significantly reduced in size and needs true \nconsolidation among its far-flung, duplicative elements. The budget \nprocess needs similarly dramatic reform. The United Nations needs to \nconcentrate on a few key achievable missions--security, humanitarian \nrelief, purely technical cooperation--and refrain from its \nproliferating exercises in internal nation-building and grandiose \nmissions of global norm-setting. All of these basic reform needs have \nbeen addressed in the U.N. reform legislation I am introducing today.\n  As complements to my U.N. reform bill, I am also introducing two \nU.N.-related bills which I sponsored in the last Congress. The first \nwould protect U.S. intelligence information which is shared with the \nUnited Nations or any of its affiliated organizations by requiring that \nprocedures for protecting intelligence sources and methods are in place \nat the United Nations that are at least as stringent as those \nmaintained by countries with which the United States regularly shares \nsimilar types of information. This requirement may be waived by the \nPresident for national security purposes but only on a case by case \nbasis and only when all possible measures for protecting the \ninformation have been taken.\n  This legislation grew out of my concern about reports of breaches of \nU.S. classified material by the United Nations in 1993, 1994, and in \n1995 when the United Nations pulled out of Somalia. I am pleased to \nnote that more attention is being paid by this body to the problems \nthat can result when U.S. intelligence information is shared with \ninternational bodies. Condition 5 of the recently approved resolution \nof ratification for the Chemical Weapons Convention, which protects \nU.S. intelligence shared with the Organization for the Protection of \nChemical Weapons, was based on my intelligence-sharing legislation.\n  To complete the package of three bills, I am introducing today the \nInternational Peacekeeping Reform Act of 1997 which I also sponsored in \nthe 104th Congress. Before any funds can be made available for U.N. \npeacekeeping activities, this legislation requires the President to \ncertify to Congress that hostilities have ceased and all parties agree \nto a U.N. peacekeeping role, that\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nthe percentage of the U.S. assessed share of the total cost of the \noperation does not exceed the percentage of the U.S. assessed share for \nthe regular U.N. budget, and that adequate measures have been taken to \nprotect U.S. intelligence information provided in support of the \noperation.\n  Furthermore, my bill would require that, if the operation is to \ninclude units of the U.S. Armed Forces to carry out combat missions, \nthe President must certify that the operation advances U.S. security \ninterests, that U.S. participation is critical to the operation's \nsuccess, that the units will be under the operational command and \ncontrol of the U.S. armed forces, and that the U.S. military personnel \nwill be fully protected by the Geneva Convention of 1949 governing the \ntreatment of prisoners of war. This legislation requires the President \nto notify Congress of the intent to support an international \npeacekeeping operation at least 15 days before any vote of the United \nNations Security Council to establish, expand or modify such an \noperation. If the President determines that an emergency exists which \nprevents him from meeting the 15-day advance notice requirement, the \nnotice is to be provided in a timely manner, but no later than 48 hours \nafter the Security Council vote.\n\n  The three measures I am introducing today will, I believe, go a long \nway toward setting a new course in our relations with the United \nNations. If we in Congress fail to rise to the challenge; if the U.N. \nattempts to defend an unsustainable status quo; if the Administration's \nnew foreign policy team does not reach out to Congress to achieve a \ngenuine bipartisan consensus on the need for U.N. reform; if the U.N.'s \ndangerous slide to expensive irrelevance continues, then we will have \nlost a unique opportunity for reform. If this should happen, it is not \nat all clear to me whether such an opportunity will soon return.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to consider the legislation I am \nintroducing today as the best course for restoring the bipartisan \nconsensus in this country on the United Nations.\n  Mr. Prsident, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 694\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PAYMENT OF UNITED STATES ARREARAGES IN ASSESSED \n                   CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNITED NATIONS.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002, no funds \n     shall be available for obligation or expenditure to the \n     United Nations for the payment except under procedures of \n     United States assessed contributions to the United Nations \n     more than one year in arrears at the time of passage of this \n     Act under United States Government accounting except under \n     procedures under subsection (b);\n       (b) Procedures for the Release of United States Arrearages \n     to the United Nations.--In accordance with procedures \n     applicable to reprogramming notifications under section 34 of \n     the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956, for each \n     fiscal year 1998 through 2002, the President may make \n     available for obligation or expenditure to the United Nations \n     an amount not to exceed 20% of United States assessed \n     contributions to the United Nations more than one year in \n     arrears at the time of passage of this Act under United \n     States Government accounting if on January 31 of each fiscal \n     year 1998 through 2002 the President determines and certifies \n     to the relevant committees of the Congress that the \n     applicable reform criteria for each fiscal year has been met.\n       (c) Definitions.--As used in this section:\n       (1) Relevant committees of the congress .--The term \n     ``relevant committees of the Congress'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of \n     the Senate and the Committee on International Relations and \n     the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) Applicable reform criteria.--The term ``applicable \n     reform criteria'' means--\n       (A) for fiscal year 1998 that the United Nations has \n     maintained a zero nominal growth budget in United States \n     dollar terms and has made all of its programs, offices and \n     activities open to auditing by the national auditing and \n     inspecting agencies of its member states to include, but not \n     be limited to the United States General Accounting Office and \n     the State Department Office of Inspector General, that the \n     United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services has been \n     fully funded at its request level, and that all products of \n     the Office of Internal Oversight Services relevant to United \n     Nations budgetary and administrative matters are available to \n     all United Nations member states;\n       (B) for fiscal year 1999 that all criteria for fiscal year \n     1998 continue to be met and that United States representation \n     on the United Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative \n     and Budgetary Questions has been restored;\n       (C) for fiscal year 2000 that all criteria for fiscal years \n     1998 and 1999 continue to be met and that procedures for \n     assessing contributions for United Nations peacekeeping \n     activities have been reformed to ensure that for all \n     logistical, in-kind, and non-cash aid provided by the United \n     States to support United Nations assessed peacekeeping \n     activities that the United States either receives from the \n     United Nations cash reimbursement for the full value of such \n     aid or credit toward the payment of assessed contributions \n     for peacekeeping operations;\n       (D) for fiscal year 2001 that all criteria for fiscal years \n     1998 through 2000 continue to be met and that the United \n     Nations has divided its regular budget into a small ``core'' \n     assessed budget representing only those activities determined \n     by the General Accounting Office to be necessary for the \n     United Nations to maintain its existence under the terms of \n     the United Nations Charter and a voluntary ``program'' budget \n     that would include all United Nations programs, developmental \n     activities, regional activities, economic and social \n     activities, and related staff; and\n       (E) for fiscal year 2002 that all criteria for fiscal years \n     1998 through 2001 continue to be met and that the United \n     Nations has approved and implemented systemwide structural \n     reform, entailing a significant reduction in staff, that \n     would eliminate all outdated activities and program \n     duplication and would encompass all relevant United Nations \n     specialized agencies.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                                 S. 695\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am submitting today a resolution to \naddress a matter that I consider vital to our national security. I have \nhere a picture of the U.S.S. Stark that was disabled 10 years ago by an \nExocet missile fired by the Iranians. Thirty-seven American sailors \nwere killed in this disaster.\n  I call your attention to a new missile patterned after the Exocet, \nonly it is described by its sales brochures as having a ``mighty attack \ncapability with great firepower.'' This is the C-802, an antishipping \ncruise missile. The sales group that is touting the mighty power of the \nC-802 is the Chinese. The Chinese have taken the Exocet and increased \nits power and increased its deadliness.\n  The C-802 is being shipped. This picture shows a Chinese vessel, on \nthe deck of which there are five smaller vessels, each one of which is \nequipped with four C-802's. You can see them on the back of the ships. \nThese are the smaller ships on the back deck of this larger cargo \nvessel.\n  Those ships are en route to Iran. The Chinese have now sold to Iran \nsome 60 C-802's for their use in the Persian Gulf. Some 60 are mounted \non 15 patrol boats. These patrol boats, again, have four missiles each.\n  If one missile could damage the Stark as badly as we saw in the first \npicture, you see what 15 missiles could do. But the Chinese are not \nstopping with shipboard missiles. Here is an example of a land-based C-\n802, and the Chinese are now in the process of selling these to the \nIranians.\n  Why should we be concerned about the land-based C-802? Here is a map \nof the Persian Gulf. This land mass is Iran. There are 500 miles of \nIranian coastal waters facing the Persian Gulf. This is the Strait of \nHormuz through which a very large percentage of the world's oil must go \nevery day, something in excess of 25 percent. The Iranians have \nrepeatedly threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz if the rest of the \nworld does not do what Iran wishes it to do in a variety of ways. We \nheard such a threat, again, over the weekend with the Iranians saying \nthat if the Americans were to try to take any kind of retaliatory \naction against Iranian terrorism, they would close this Strait of \nHormuz.\n  With land-based C-802's, they could hide them in caves or put them in \nother locations all along this 500-mile area, so that any shipping \ncoming out of Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, or Saudi Arabia into \nthe Persian Gulf would be vulnerable to an attack from a land-based C-\n802. With 15 patrol boats, each one having 4 missiles, or 60 sea-based \nmissiles, the Iranians could actually attack from either side, having \nthe patrol boats out here on one side of the shipping lanes, with the \nland-based missiles on the other, and effectively seal off the world's \nsupply of oil from the Middle East without too much difficulty.\n  In personal human terms, there are about 15,000 U.S. servicemen and \nservicewomen within the range of the C-802 missiles in the gulf.\n  Mr. President, there is a law known as the Gore-McCain Act passed in \n1992 which says that foreign companies that deliver cruise missiles to \nIran are subject to sanctions. I raised this issue with Secretary \nAlbright, and I have raised it since in subsequent hearings. In \nJanuary, Secretary Albright informed me that the administration will\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nnot enforce the terms of the Gore-McCain Act on the grounds that the \nmissiles are not ``destabilizing.''\n  I am not quite sure what the word ``destabilizing'' means in this \nkind of a circumstance, but that is where the administration has chosen \nto come down.\n  I believe that a nondestabilizing missile can be just as deadly to a \nship as a destabilizing missile. Once a missile is fired, it knows no \nsemantic definition, as it goes on its course for a kill. Ask the \nsailors on the Stark whether the presence of the Exocet missiles were \ndestabilizing in the circumstance in the Middle East or not. Thirty-\nseven of them are dead.\n  Given our obligation to those that we would place in harm's way in \nthe name of this country, I believe the time has come to put this issue \non the front burner. I have asked the administration about it. I have \nused the congressional oversight circumstance to bring it to their \nattention. Now, Mr. President, today, I submit a resolution outlining \nthe sense of the Senate that the administration either enforce the \nGore-McCain Act in this circumstance or take some other appropriate \naction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter which I sent \nto Madeleine Albright on the 17th of April and a fact sheet relating to \nthe C-802 missile be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Madeleine K. Albright,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: During 1996 Chinese defense \n     companies delivered a number of missile boats to the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard Navy. Each missile boat was armed with \n     four C-802 cruise missiles. Recently, Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of State Robert Einhorn told the Senate, ``These \n     cruise missiles pose new, direct threats to deployed U.S. \n     forces.''\n       It is now my understanding that China is about to deliver \n     the land variant of the C-802 to Iran. When the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard acquires C-802s in quantity, it will have \n     a weapon with greater range, reliability, accuracy, and \n     mobility than anything currently in its inventory.\n       The delivery of advanced cruise missiles to Iran is a \n     violation of the Gore-McCain Act. However, in answer to my \n     query on this issue in January, you answered, ``The \n     Administration has concluded at present that the known \n     transfers (of C-802s) are not of a destabilizing number and \n     type.''\n       However, I believe that the arrival of additional C-802s in \n     Iran is a matter of grave concern to the United States, and \n     the Administration has an obligation either to sanction the \n     perpetrators or put in motion an alternative policy of \n     equivalent strength.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert F.

Stark: American Navy escort vessel struck by two \n     Exocet type cruise missiles in May 1987 killing 37 sailors \n     and disabling the ship for sixteen months.\n       C-802: Chinese cruise missile similar to the Exocet and \n     marketed for use against naval escort vessels. According to \n     its manufacturer, the China National Precision Instrument \n     Import-Export Corporation, the C-802 is characterized by \n     ``mighty attack capability, great firepower.'' It has a range \n     of 120 km [75 miles] and a high explosive warhead of 165 kg \n     [363 lbs.].\n       Iranian Revolutionary Guard Navy: Iran is believed to \n     possess sixty C-802 missiles aboard 15 Chinese and French \n     missile boats.\n       Land-based Variant: Iran is believed to be acquiring an \n     undetermined number of C-802 missiles which will be mounted \n     on Transporter-Erector-Launchers [TELs]. For over a year Iran \n     has been constructing tunnels and other fortifications along \n     its Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman coastlines which could \n     accommodate these TELs.\n       Threat to U.S. forces: 15,000 U.S. servicemen and women are \n     potentially within range of these missiles. On April 11, \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Robert Einhorn told the \n     Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, ``These cruise \n     missiles pose new and direct threats to deployed U.S. \n     Forces.'' During 1996 Admiral Scott Redd, Commander-in-Chief \n     of the U.S. Fifth Fleet declared the missiles to be a ``360 \n     degree threat which can come at you from basically anywhere \n     at sea in the gulf or out in the Gulf of Oman.''\n       U.S. Law: The Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of 1992 \n     (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) prohibits foreign persons from \n     delivering advanced conventional weapons, including cruise \n     missiles, to Iran.\n       Administration Position: The Administration ``has concluded \n     at present that the known types [of C-802 missiles] are not \n     of a destabilizing number and type.''\n       [Sources: New York Times, various Jane's publications]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3968-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3969-S3970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  GRAMS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 54\n\n  Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Daschle) proposed an \namendment to the bill (S. 672) making supplemental appropriations and \nrescissions for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1997, and for \nother purposes; from the Committee on Appropriations; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new title:\n           TITLE ____--DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DISASTER RELIEF\n\n     SEC. ____01.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the \nefforts of those individuals involved with the Outlook Elementary \nSchool project in Outlook, WA. Their tremendous generosity will provide \nthe technology our students need to succeed in school and in life.\n  The importance of keeping our children abreast of technology is hard \nto exaggerate. The National Science Foundation reports that over \n700,000 new technicians, scientists, mathematicians, and engineers must \nbe found by the year 2010 simply to keep up with technological demands.\n  Business and political leaders from around the country have called \nfor increased emphasis on technology in education. Some fear, however, \nthat rural\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nand small-town America could be overlooked in this effort. Seeing this \npotential problem, Astronaut Bonnie Dunbar enlisted the support of MCI \nin providing free computers and Internet access to the students of \nOutlook Elementary School in Outlook, WA. Bonnie Dunbar is a graduate \nof Outlook Elementary, and is a model and inspiration to many. In the \nhallway of this small school is the phrase ``From Outlook to NASA.'' \nWith the generosity of MCI, and the efforts of Bonnie Dunbar, more \nstudents will have the benefits of state-of-the-art technology, and \nalso have the stars within their reach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3970-4", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SEAN J.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nHarrison Eiteljorg, a dear friend and longtime patron of the arts, who \npassed away last week at the age of 93. This afternoon, friends and \nfamily will gather in Indianapolis to remember Harrison and to \ncelebrate his remarkable life.\n  Harrison Eiteljorg was the founder and chief benefactor of the \nEiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art. This museum, \nlocated in downtown Indianapolis, houses his extensive collection of \npaintings and sculptures of the American West, with works by Frederic \nRemington, Georgia O'Keefe, Albert Bierstadt, and Thomas Hart Benton. \nIt also contains his collection of Indian artifacts, with costumes, \nweapons, ceremonial objects and masks representing tribes of the \nMidwest, Plains, and Northwest coast. The Eiteljorg collection is \nperhaps the finest of its type anywhere in the world.\n  Harrison Eiteljorg found absolute joy in the pursuit, discovery and \nacquisition of paintings and sculptures of the American West. Early in \nhis life, business interests took Eiteljorg on frequent and extended \ntrips to the West and Southwest. His interest in Indian artifacts and \ncrafts developed at this time, together with his attraction to Western \npainting and sculpture.\n  Eiteljorg began assembling his collections in the late 1940's. His \nfirst piece was Olaf Weighorst's Cutting Horse, which depicts a cowboy \nabout to rope a steer. As his collection grew, Eiteljorg tried to meet \nmany of the artists whose works he purchased, in an effort to share a \nfew moments of their lives. And, he gave his encouragement and \nfinancial support to several young artists, enabling them to devote \nfull time and attention to their art.\n  Harrison Eiteljorg was also a supporter and active member of the \nIndianapolis Museum of Art.

Mr President, I rise today in strong support \nof Senator Kempthorne's effort to provide Medal of Honor recipient \nVernon Joseph Baker, and the heirs of Medal of Honor recipients Edward \nCarter and Charles Thomas, with retroactive compensation for their \nawards.\n  During World War II Mr. Baker was an Army 2d lieutenant serving with \nthe 92d Infantry Division in Europe. During a 2-day action near \nViareggio, Italy he single-handedly wiped out two German machinegun \nnests, led successful attacks on two others, drew fire on himself to \npermit the evacuation of his wounded comrades, and then led a battalion \nadvance through enemy minefields. Mr. Baker is the only one of these \nthree men still alive today, and he currently resides in St. Maries, \nID.\n  Edward Carter, of Los Angeles, was a staff sergeant with the 12th \nArmored Division when his tank was destroyed in action near Speyer, \nGermany, in March of 1945. Mr. Carter led three men through \nextraordinary gunfire that left two of them dead, the third wounded, \nand himself wounded five times. When eight enemy riflemen attempted to \ncapture him, he killed six of them, captured the remaining two and, \nusing his prisoners as a shield, recrossed an exposed field to safety. \nThe prisoners yielded valuable information. Mr Carter died in 1963.\n  Charles Thomas, of Detroit, was a major with the 103d Infantry \nDivision serving near Climbach, France, in December of 1944. When his \nscout car was hit by intense artillery fire, Mr. Thomas assisted the \ncrew to cover and, despite severe wounds, managed to signal the column \nsome distance behind him to halt. Despite additional multiple wounds in \nthe chest, legs, and left arm, he ordered and directed the dispersion \nand emplacement of two antitank guns that effectively returned enemy \nfire. He refused evacuation until certain his junior officer was in \ncontrol of the situation. Mr. Thomas died in 1980.\n  I commend Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas for their bravery and \nSenator Kempthorne for leading this effort.\n  As a result of their heroics, these men had clearly met the criteria \nfor being awarded a Medal of Honor, the Nation's highest award for \nvalor. This medal is only awarded to a member of the U.S. armed \nservices who ``distinguishes themselves conspicuously by gallantry and \nintrepidity at the risk of their life and beyond the call of duty,'' \nwith an act ``so conspicuous as to clearly distinguish the individual \nabove their comrades.'' However, because of the racial climate of the \ntime and the segregated nature of the Army in 1945, African-Americans \nwere denied the Medal of Honor. It is a sad testament to America's \nlegacy of discrimination that although 1.2 million African-Americans \nserved in the military during the Second World War, including Mr. \nBaker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, none received 1 of the 433 Medals of \nHonor awarded during the conflict.\n\n  This past January our Nation took an important step in correcting \nthis injustice by awarding Mr. Vernon Joseph Baker, and six of his dead \ncomrades, the Medal of Honor during a long-overdue ceremony at the \nWhite House. This recognition of these men's extraordinary courage was \na vindication for all African-American heroes of World War II. In order \nto further demonstrate our profound thanks to these brave men, I \nsupport Senator Kempthorne's effort to retroactively compensate Mr. \nBaker, and the heirs of Mr. Carter and Mr. Thomas for the money that \nthey would have received from the Army for receiving the Medal of \nHonor. The other three heros died as a result of the brave deeds which \nqualified them to receive the Medal, and thus would not have received \nany compensation by the military.\n  Each recipient of this Medal is entitled to receive a token monthly \nstipend from their respective branch of the military after they leave \nactive duty service. In 1945 the stipend was $10 and today it has risen \nto $400. Since he was denied the Medal more than a half century ago, \nMr. Baker and the survivors of Mr. Carter and Mr. Thomas, deserve to \nreceive the same amount of money that they would have received had they \nbeen awarded the Medal at the close of World War II. America is \nprofoundly thankful for the patriotism of these\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nmen, and awarding retroactive compensation to them is a simple way to \nexpress our gratitude for their service. For these reasons I stand \ntoday to recognize Mr. Baker, Mr. Carter, and Mr. Thomas, and support \nretroactively compensating them for their accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3971-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JUVENILE CRIME\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, a few weeks ago in Nashville, three \narmed teenage thugs struck the youngest member of my staff with a \npistol, robbed, and terrorized him. All three have lengthy juvenile \nrecords. Two were convicted of armed robbery at age 14 and served time \nin a juvenile facility. Last month, over the vehement objection of the \nprosecutor, both were released early for good behavior. It took these \njuveniles less than a month to rearm and commit another violent crime.\n  In Tennessee over the past 4 months, we have had a string of \nsenseless murders which have left Tennesseans in a state of shock, \nfear, and confusion. One incident, for which arrests have been made, is \nthe tragic story of the four members of the Lillelid family of east \nTennessee. They were car-jacked at a rest stop on Interstate 81 and \nlater found executed in a ditch, with multiple gunshot wounds to the \nhead and chest. The mother, father, and 6-year-old daughter all died, \nwhile the 2-year-old son was shot twice, but survived. The police have \narrested six people in connection to the murders--four adults and two \njuveniles--all are under 20 years of age.\n  This pointless tragedy is just one of many recent stories which have \nriveted the attention of people across Tennessee. The death of Charlie \nThoet as he was closing a restaurant just outside of Nashville in \nJanuary; the murder of Steve Hampton and Sarah Jackson as they were \nopening another establishment in February; the triple homicide of \nRobert Santiago, Robert Allen Sewell, and Andrea Brown and the \nattempted murder of Jose Alfredo Romirez Gonzalez at a fast food \nrestaurant in March; and the most recent incident, the murders of \nMichelle Mace and Angela Holmes at an ice cream shop just last week, \nhave left many across Tennessee questioning our society and its lack of \nrespect for human life. All of these victims were hard working people \nwith families and friends, hopes and dreams whose lives were brought to \nan end in a brutal, violent, senseless fashion.\n  Mr. President, I want to be very clear that in no way do I mean to \nsuggest that all of these unsolved murders were caused by juveniles. \nHowever, the two cases first mentioned were cases with juvenile and \nvery young adult offenders. And violent juvenile crime is growing \nacross this country. From 1985 to 1994 arrest of juveniles for all \nserious violent offenses increased 75 percent; arrest for homicides \nincreased 150 percent; and arrests of juveniles for weapon possession \nincreased 103 percent. These statistics coupled with the fact that \nthere will be a large increase in the number of juveniles early in the \nnext century--by 2005 the number of males 14-17 will increase 25 \npercent--means that we are about to face a crime epidemic the likes of \nwhich this country has never experienced. The Justice Department \nestimates that in the next 13 years juvenile arrests for violence \ncrimes will more than double and juvenile arrests for murder will \nincrease by 45 percent.\n\n  So what do we do? Currently, less than 10 percent of juvenile \noffenders commit far greater than half of all juvenile crimes. Rather \nthan adopt a shotgun approach, we need to focus our efforts to make it \nharder for this small portion of the population to continually commit \ncrimes. In addition, it has been proven time and time again that adult \nrepeat offenders often begin as juvenile repeat offenders and that the \nseverity of the crimes only increase. We must interrupt the cycle of \nviolence while the offender is still a juvenile.\n  I believe that the most important step we can take is make sure that \nthese young people understand that there are consequences for their \nactions. In Tennessee, usually a juvenile will have been convicted of \nthree crimes before he or she is considered for juvenile detection. I \nthink we all realize that if these kids are caught doing something 3 \ntimes then that means they have probably done it closer to 20 times. I \nbelieve that a vital element in deterring crime is the certainty of \npunishment for first and second offenses. Juvenile offenders must know \nfor certain that they are responsible and will be held accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  Criminals must also serve their entire sentence. If the teenagers, \nwho attacked my staffer a few weeks ago, had served their full \nsentences, then that crime would never have happened. We do not have \nenough resources to capture and arrest every criminal several times. \nOnce our police officers have put their lives on the line to catch a \ncriminal, and our overworked, underpaid prosecutors have obtained a \nconviction, it is inexcusable for that criminal not to serve his or her \nfull sentence.\n  There are other steps we can take to make sure it is easier for law \nenforcement and the courts to send a strong message to juvenile \noffenders. Most Americans would probably be surprised to learn that in \nmost areas juveniles are not fingerprinted and their record of violent \ncrimes are not weighed at all in adult criminal proceedings. They may \nalso not be aware that in most States there is a minimum age for a \njuvenile to be bound over to adult court.\n  Crime, especially juvenile crime, is a problem for which our entire \ncommunity must find the solution. Parents, teachers, law enforcement, \njudges, social services, and, yes, the business community as well, must \nplay integral roles. I am very interested in a new project just getting \nunderway in Memphis, TN, which will do just that. The Shelby County \nTennessee Juvenile Offender Transition Program is an innovative new \nplan for a supervised, independent living center for juvenile offenders \naimed at reducing recidivism and assisting youth to obtain the skills \nnecessary to break the cycle of crime and to make the transition into a \nproductive adulthood. The program includes education and vocational \ntraining requirements tailored to each participant, coupled with a \nhighly structured mentoring program with area universities and a \nbusiness sponsorship which includes part-time employment during the \nprogram with the prospect of employment after completion of the program \nor tuition reimbursement for continued education. The juveniles have to \nserve their entire sentence, but this program will give the juvenile \ncourt an alternative to sending these young people back to the \nneighborhoods and the problems where we know they will only get in \ntrouble again and end up back in our courts and our prisons. It is not \nthe solution to all of the problems we face with juvenile crime, but \nthis is an innovative, new approach to assist some of our young people, \nthose who we might be able to help, in making a positive change. The \nprogram calls on all aspects of our communities to find solutions and I \nbelieve that these efforts deserve our support.\n\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is time to take a long hard look at \nthe areas I have highlighted and consider long overdue reforms to the \njuvenile justice system. There is consensus on several issues from both \nRepublican and Democrats, and therefore, I think it is time for the \nU.S. Senate to address this most pressing concern of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3972-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3972-S3973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ADAM J.

Almost immediately following \nhis arrival he was elected by his classmates to the Student Government \nas a case representative. He was appointed by the Student Government \npresident to the position of direction of Student Government \nDevelopment. He was also appointed chairman of the Constitution \nCommittee. In these posts he not only raised money but he also \nsupervised the formation of, and coauthored the new Student \nGovernment's constitution.

In the middle of \nApril 1994, Mr. Platzner among other things, founded and was elected \nchairman of the Political Union. He was also elected vice president of \nthe Student Body and chairman of the Student Council. Adam Platzner\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nwas chosen to represent the school as the ambassador to the Hugh \nO'Brien Youth Foundation's annual conference.\n  The following year--junior year--Mr. Platzner raised funds and \nchaired the Student Council. He was also selected to sit on the board \nof trustees' education committee--2-year term--and elected president of \nthe Model United Nations Organization. Adam Platzner won the \nOutstanding Delegate Award at the Ivy League Model United Nations \nConference, as well as the class prize for his hard work, leadership, \nand dedication In the city of New Rochelle, NY, Mr. Platzner was \nappointed to the Youth Court.\n  During his senior year he continued to lead the KLHT Political Union \nforward.

Mr. President, I join today with my friend and \ncolleague from Hawaii, Senator Akaka, to congratulate Ambassador \nCharlene Barshefsky and her staff at the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative on their outstanding work to date in the World Trade \nOrganization [WTO] action involving the European Union [EU] banana \npolicy. On March 18, 1997, a neutral WTO panel charged with reviewing \nthe banana case issued a detailed interim report finding the EU regime \nto be in violation of over 20 WTO principles. This represents more \nviolations in a single case than has ever before been found in the \nhistory of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and WTO dispute \nsettlement.\n  Although narrow in scope, the one implication I am obliged to mention \nfirst relates to U.S. banana production. Hawaii has produced bananas \ncommercially for almost 160 years. Bananas are Hawaii's seventh leading \nagricultural crop by value and show considerable promise for expansion \nand export. This growth potential is extremely important as Hawaii \nmakes a critical transition from a large plantation style agricultural \nbase in sugar and pineapple to a diversified crop base featuring a very \nwide range of tropical and subtropical products. While Hawaii is a \nsmall producer of bananas by global standards, the distortions to \nglobal banana trade caused by the EU banana import regime have taken a \ndecisive toll on Hawaiian producers in the form of depressed producer \nprices. If the EU's panel report is adopted as expected, it will have a \nleveling effect on the prices received by Hawaii banana growers.\n  Other U.S. agricultural interests far beyond the banana sector also \nstand to benefit if the banana panel ruling is adopted in its present \nform. Farming interests throughout our country, including in Hawaii, \nshare a widespread concern that international agreements do not \nadequately protect them against unfair foreign trading practices, \nparticularly against repeat offenders like the EU. With the banana \nreport now out in preliminary form, we are close to having in hand the \nmost favorable, comprehensive findings ever rendered against a single \nEU agricultural policy. The Journal of Commerce properly described the \nruling as ``a welcome signal that the WTO will not simply acquiesce \nwhen Brussels requires all member nations to raise their trade barriers \nto the highest level imposed elsewhere in the union.'' I request that \nthe Journal of Commerce editorial in which that quote appears, entitled \n``Ending banana inanity,'' be included in the Record immediately \nfollowing our remarks today.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Inouye in \nencouraging the U.S. Trade Representative's continued pursuit of this \ncase. The consequences of this interim WTO report are significant--not \njust for Hawaii, but for the U.S. agricultural community and for U.S. \ntrading interests generally. Ambassador Barshefsky wisely recognized \nthose implications when she joined with numerous other WTO members in \ncalling for a WTO dispute settlement panel to condemn the EU banana \nimport regime.\n  The WTO panel acknowledged that in an increasingly interdependent \nglobal economy, governments will be held accountable for the adverse \nconsequences their trade policies may have on foreign producing \nsectors, however large or small they might be. Hence, if the banana \npanel's interim report is adopted, as we expect it to be, small \nproducing interests, such as the banana producers of Hawaii will be \nentitled under the long arm of the WTO to all rights and interests \nguaranteed by that treaty. Since the success of small producing \ninterests is a critical aspect of Hawaii's agricultural future, this \nlong arm protection is of great reassurance to us.\n  Under the new WTO rules, if the banana report is adopted, the EU will \nface a stark choice: it will either have to dismantle this unlawful \nregime or face legal WTO trade retaliation. After decades of EU \ndisregard of U.S. agricultural interests, a strict enforcement of that \nchoice should establish an effective model for resolving future \ndisputes with the EU and, equally important, should deter the EU from \neven engaging in unlawful agricultural policies in the first instance. \nRestored confidence in international dispute settlement should, in \nturn, help broaden the general view that trade agreements are a \npositive force in the promotion of U.S. agricultural trading interests.\n  The banana report promises to be helpful to U.S. agriculture in still \nanother way. By clarifying the conditions under which agricultural \ntariff rate quotas [TRQ's] can be administered, the report should \nprevent countries from using TRQ's to accomplish the sort of \nnontransparent, discriminatory and restrictive non-tariff barriers that \nthe Uruguay Round sought to eliminate.\n  In addition to the favorable precedent being set for American \nagriculture, the banana report also gives expansive life and coverage \nto the new WTO agreement governing services. The report found that U.S. \nservice suppliers engaged in the wholesale distribution of fresh fruit \nhave had their conditions of trade adversely affected by the EU regime \nin numerous ways, always to the direct benefit of EU corporate \ninterests. The measure of U.S. harm as a result of these services \nviolations may exceed $1 billion, a level well in excess of the harm \nnormally implicated in international dispute settlement actions. By \nstrictly upholding U.S. service supplier interests in this case, the \npanel has helped ensure meaningful, lasting protection of all U.S. \nsectors covered by the new international services accord.\n  In short, if adopted, the WTO banana report will represent an \nunambiguous win for multiple trading interests throughout our country. \nWe accordingly ask our Senate colleagues to lend all necessary support \nto Ambassador Barshefsky and her staff to secure adoption and full \nimplementation of this important WTO report.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n             [From the Journal of Commerce, Apr. 11, 1997]\n\n                         Ending Banana Inanity\n\n       An interim ruling last month by a World Trade Organization \n     dispute panel, calling on the European Union to overhaul its \n     system of banana trade preferences, was a big achievement for \n     the 40 countries--one-third of the WTO's membership--involved \n     in the case. It showed that a rules-based trading system can \n     yield just decisions even in complex and politically charged \n     cases.\n       The banana case involved a decades-old system of trade \n     preferences that European nations granted their banana \n     producing former colonies in Africa, the Caribbean and the \n     Pacific. For six of those countries, that preferential access \n     left relatively slim quotas for Latin American producers, \n     many of whom market their fruit through U.S.-based Chiquita \n     Brands.\n       That difficulty was compounded when, in 1993, the EU sought \n     to transform the voluntary preference program adopted by some \n     of its member states into a uniform regime for the entire \n     union. That meant forcing Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands \n     and other EU states to impose caps on banana imports, driving \n     up the price and limiting the supply of the Latin American \n     bananas their consumers prefer.\n       In principle, the EU could have handled this change in a \n     way that did not discriminate against third countries and \n     break WTO rules. But Brussels took the opportunity to set up \n     a whole new system that favored European banana marketing \n     companies and put Chiquita Brands at a disadvantage. The \n     mechanism was a Byzantine system of import and export \n     licenses, which were made available to European marketers and \n     to the foreign governments willing to cooperate with them.\n       Four countries--Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela and \n     Nicaragua--were made an\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\n     offer by the EU that they couldn't refuse: Agree to supply \n     bananas under the EU regime or be punished with less access \n     to the world's largest banana market. The EU also enlisted \n     Caribbean politicians to defend the system it had set up to \n     benefit European marketers. The result was that Chiquita saw \n     its market share in Europe plunge by nearly 50%, costing it \n     hundreds of millions of dollars.\n       The United States has fought this system in world trade \n     bodies for years. Dispute panels of General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, forerunner of the WTO, twice ruled that \n     Europe's banana regime violates trade law, but the EU refused \n     to honor those rulings. Washington's persistence may pay off \n     yet, however, since the WTO's rules prevent a single nation \n     from blocking a panel ruling.\n       To its credit, the three-member WTO panel withstood \n     overheated lobbying by the EU and its allies in the \n     Caribbean, who falsely charged that the United States was out \n     to wreck the original preference program for former colonies. \n     Instead, the panel identified the real issue: the right of \n     investors in services--in this case, marketing and \n     distributing bananas--to have a fair shot at a big market.\n       Moreover, the EU's claims notwithstanding the panel's \n     interim ruling will not threaten Caribbean exports to Europe, \n     which amount to 8% of Europe's banana imports. The only \n     losers will be the big European banana trading firms, which \n     will not longer be able to charge monopoly prices.\n       The ruling also is a welcome signal that the WTO will not \n     simply acquiesce when Brussels requires all member nations to \n     raise their trade barriers to the highest level imposed \n     elsewhere in the union. The WTO allows this ``leveling up,'' \n     but also requires that exporters in third countries be \n     compensated for their losses. The panel decision, if \n     finalized, would require the EU to offer such compensation.\n       The decision is a victory for European consumers, who have \n     been paying high prices as a result of the EU banana regime. \n     If the interim ruling is finalized--as is expected--and the \n     EU implements it as it should, Europe's long chapter of \n     banana inanity may finally draw to a close.\n\n\n                  WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PANEL REPORT\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise to bring my colleagues' attention to \na recent and very significant decision by a dispute settlement panel of \nthe new World Trade Organization [WTO]. The case is extraordinarily \ncomplex and I congratulate Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky and her staff \nat USTR on their skillful handling of this matter on behalf of the \nUnited States.\n  To summarize the issue, the United States, Mexico, Ecuador, Honduras, \nand Guatemala went to WTO dispute settlement seeking an end to an EU \nbanana trade regime which discriminates against banana exports from \ncertain Latin American countries and against certain United States and \nLatin American banana marketing companies. The EU regime has deprived \nLatin American countries of market share and export growth in the EU \nand has taken business away from United States and Latin American \nbanana marketers, giving that business over to European marketing \nfirms.\n  The WTO panel's decision is a major victory for the United States and \nour Latin American partners in the case. The panel found that the EU \nbanana regime is founded on over 20 violations of international trade \nagreements, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n[GATT], the General Agreement on Trade in Services [GATS], and the \nAgreement on Import Licensing Procedures.\n  This case has implications much broader than simply the banana trade. \nThe United States has many, very contentious, on-going agricultural \ntrade disputes with the EU, and for that reason U.S. agricultural \ninterests have been watching the banana case with great interest. \nFirst, this case is an example of the successful use of WTO dispute \nsettlement to resolve these agricultural trade issues. Further, \naccording to the American Farm Bureau, the panel's report ``helps \nestablish clear parameters for the implementation of agricultural \ntariff rate quotas [TRQ's]. These parameters will help prevent TRQ's \nfrom becoming the very type of nontariff barrier the Uruguay Round \nsought to eliminate.''\n  In addition, this case is the first test of the General Agreement on \nTrade in Services. The United States was instrumental in ensuring that \nGATS was included in the final Uruguay Round Agreement. It is in our \ninterest to see the MFN and ``national treatment'' obligations, \ntraditionally applied to goods in trade agreements, now extend to \nservices, an increasingly important portion of U.S. foreign commerce. \nThe panel decision in the banana case interprets broadly the GATS \nprotections against government policies which discriminate against \nforeign service suppliers. This is an important precedent and a \nsignificant victory for U.S. interests.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I complement USTR on a job well done and \nurge the administration to persevere through the inevitable appeal \nprocess, doing everything necessary to ensure that this important \nruling is not undermined. I sincerely hope that, with the panel's \ndecision in hand, a negotiated solution to end the discriminatory \nbanana regime can be found. However, if not, the United States has a \nWTO-sanctioned right to retaliate, which we should not hesitate to \ninvoke, if necessary, to achieve full EU conformity with the panel \nruling in this case.\n\n\n                  A Hopeful Step for America's Farmers\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleagues from Hawaii, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaha, \nto congratulate Ambassador Charlene Barshesfsky and her team at the \nOffice of the U.S. Trade Representative for the efforts they have taken \nin their case against the European Union [EU] banana regime, which is \npending before the World Trade Organization [WTO]. I know this is an \nissue of interest not just for the three of us, but also my Ohio \ncolleague, Senator Glenn, my distinguished friend from Utah, Senator \nHatch, and the majority leader, Senator Lott. Last week, the six of us \njoined together in a letter to Ambassador Barshefsky, expressing our \nappreciation for her office's great work to date.\n  The case in question was brought before the WTO by the United States, \nMexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and Ecuador. Last March, a panel of the \nWTO made public an interim report, which found the EU banana regime to \nbe in violation of more than 20 WTO principles. As the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii pointed out, this one case has produced more violations \nthan any other in the history of the WTO dispute settlement process.\n  I am sure one could ask why a Senator from Ohio would be interested \nin a trade dispute involving bananas. It's easy to answer: I am a \nSenator who represents a large number of farmers in Ohio. Ohio farmers \nproduce agricultural goods for both domestic and international markets. \nIndeed, if American agriculture is to remain a growth industry, we need \nto increase our presence in world markets. It's that simple.\n  The hard fact for many farmers is that free and fair trade on the \nworld stage hasn't always been simple, particularly when they have to \ngo up against the EU. It is our job in Washington to achieve and \nadvance trade agreements that protect and advance our agricultural \ninterests. That can be easier said than done. It took years of \nnegotiations before Congress finally ratified the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade and supported the creation of the WTO. Despite this \nprogress in our trade laws and agreements, I still hear from farmers \nwho believe that international trade agreements don't do the job, or \nexpress a lack of confidence in the WTO system.\n  That's why I followed with great interest the case against the EU \nbanana regime. The ultimate outcome of this case stands to shape both \nthe real and perceived effectiveness of our U.S. trade team, and the \nWTO as a means to achieve those goals.\n  Last month's interim report represents the most significant and \nhopeful sign that our Nation's interests can be voiced effectively in \nthe WTO. It's important to emphasize the interim report is a first \nstep. The report still must be adopted by the WTO and the EU be \ncompelled to achieve full conformity with its findings. If the WTO \nadopts the report, it will be the first time the United States has won \na case brought against the EU in the WTO. If adopted, U.S. agricultural \ntrade policy will stand at a vital crossroads. America's farmers have \nbattled the EU's tough and predatory trade practices for decades. Now, \nit appears that the WTO is in a position to shift the balance toward \nfairness and respect for U.S. agricultural interests in two ways: \nFirst, by offering an impartial forum to hear and resolve trade \ndisputes; and second, by serving notice to the EU that its past \npractices will not be tolerated.\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\n  Again, I congratulate Ambassador Barshefsky and her team for their \npersistent efforts to stand up for America's farmers before the WTO. I \nurge my colleagues to express their support as well. I hope we will see \ncontinued success as this report proceeds through the adoption process, \nand as other cases are brought before the WTO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/05/senate-section/article/S3973-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 6, 1997\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
