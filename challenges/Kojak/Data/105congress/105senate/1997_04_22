Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business to accommodate a number of Senators who wish to speak \non a variety of subjects. There will be no rollcall votes, however, \nduring today's session due to the observance of Passover. I remind my \ncolleagues that the weekly party luncheons normally held today will be \nheld tomorrow, Wednesday.\n  By the unanimous consent agreed to on Thursday of last week, the \nSenate will begin consideration of the Chemical Weapons Convention \nTreaty tomorrow with, I believe, 10 hours of debate allowed. Then on \nThursday there will be five motions to strike with 1 hour of debate on \neach of those and, presumably, votes on each one of the five, with the \nexpectation of a final vote around 6 o'clock on Thursday.\n  Under the previously agreed time agreement, Senators can anticipate \nvotes on the treaty as early as Wednesday afternoon--I want to \nemphasize that--as well as a variety of votes on Thursday morning and \nthroughout Thursday. As always, we will notify Senators of any \nscheduled votes or changes as soon as possible, or actions we wish to \ntake on the Executive Calendar.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, noting that nobody has been seeking to be \nrecognized for about a half-hour, I ask unanimous consent that I may \nproceed for not to exceed 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3391-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3391-S3392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE CRISIS IN OUR FEDERAL JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have noted on the floor of the Senate a \nnumber of times, the crisis in our Federal judiciary that Chief Justice \nRehnquist has spoken of. The Chief Justice and others have spoken about \nthe nearly 100 vacancies in our Federal judiciary at the district court \nlevel, at the court of appeals level, and at the Federal court of \nappeals level. So far in this Congress--we have been in session now for \n4 months--we have confirmed only two Federal judges. It is a form of \nzero population growth, as far as the Federal judiciary is concerned. \nWe seem to have this idea that if we do not get Federal judges we can, \nsomehow--I am not sure what we think we are going to do.\n  I will tell you one of the things we have not done. In a number of \njurisdictions we are reaching a crisis situation where, instead of \nbeing able to have criminal cases tried, instead of prosecutors being \nable to seek tough penalties, they have to plea bargain because they \nknow they must keep up with speedy trial mandates, yet there\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nare not enough judges to have a speedy trial, so they end up having to \nplea bargain. We do know that in many, many jurisdictions it is clearly \nimpossible to have a civil case heard. If you are a business person \nwith a just claim against somebody and you want to bring a suit, bring \nthe suit, but they can just wait you out. If you are a litigant who has \nbeen damaged by somebody, you want to bring a suit, they can just wait \nyou out because the judges are not there to try the cases.\n  I think it is irresponsible for the leadership in this body to \ncontinue to block Federal judges. This is something that I have never \nseen in 22 years here. During times when the Democrats were in control \nof the Senate when there was a Republican President, we have never done \nit to them. During times when Republicans have been in control of the \nSenate, they have not done this. But this time it is being done. It \nshows a lack of responsibility on the part of the Senate. It shows a \nlack of responsibility on the part of individual Senators that they \nallow this to continue. It also shows a demeaning of the Senate. It \nviolates the traditions of the Senate.\n  There are some who do not care for traditions in this body. Sometimes \nit is in things that the public does not see, like confining the \nreporters of debates to something that looks like a subterranean, \nmedieval torture chamber because we want to expand the perks and \nprivileges of some of the officers of the Senate.\n  I would hate to think that the Senate is willing to toss aside \ndecades, generations of tradition for momentary perks and privileges. I \nhope Senators will start thinking that none of us owns the seat in the \nU.S. Senate. None of us owns a piece of the U.S. Senate. We are merely \n1 of 100 who serve here and we serve here for all Americans, not just \nfor our partisan interests, not just for our political party's \ninterests, not just for our own personal aggrandizement. We serve here \nfor the whole country. We are not serving the country well on the \nquestion of judges.\n  This is something where judges, both Republican and Democrat \nappointed, are united in saying it is not responsible the way we have \nmaintained this. Mr. President, I will continue to speak out on this, \nbut I hope we will wake up to the fact that the country needs to have \nthese Federal judges. We should be ready to move forward. We have about \n25 in the pipeline. Let us start having hearings and start going \nforward on them. Let us stop playing political games. We have a woman, \none of the most qualified members of the California bar, who has found \nher appointment blocked. Contrary to the normal tradition of hearing \nnominees for the circuit court first, she was made to wait behind \neverybody else here recently. As did not escape notice, she was also \nthe only woman nominee and was treated like a second-class citizen on \nthe hearing schedule. She has now been asked by a Member of the Senate, \nbasically, to tell how she voted on over 100 items in California.\n\n  Are we stooping so low as a body that we are asking people how they \nvoted? If they are up for confirmation, how they cast a secret ballot? \nWould you, Mr. President, want to have somebody go back for the last 20 \nyears and ask how you voted every time you went to the voting booth in \nKansas? I certainly would not want anybody to be able to ask that. I am \nvery proud of all the votes I cast, but it is my business. It is not \nanybody else's business. One of the great hallmarks of this democracy \nis the secret ballot, and we should not start asking people that, when \nactually it appears the real reason is just to keep the stall in.\n  We have followed, in the past, the so-called Thurmond rule of \nstalling a President's appointments to the judiciary in about the last \nfew months of their term in office. I have never seen the stall start \nin the first few hours of a President's 4-year term.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3391-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3392-S3393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  EARTH DAY 1997: THERE IS NO STATUS QUO IN PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. On another issue, Mr. President, since the first Earth Day \nin 1970, Americans have gathered to celebrate the steps we have taken \nto clean up our environment and to call attention to what still needs \nto be done. The early Earth Day events helped create the modern \nenvironmental movement. They led directly to enactment of the first \nmajor environmental legislation, the Clean Air Act. I remember with \npride serving here with Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, knowing \nwhat he had done to help spark that movement.\n  But I ask Senators and the administration to look back at the debate \nthat took place when we drafted this remarkable piece of legislation. \nAt the time of that first Earth Day, the laws to limit air pollution \nwere disjointed, they were limited in scope. But since passage of the \nClean Air Act, we have made considerable strides in reducing some \npollutants. The level of lead pollution we and our children breathe \ntoday is one-tenth what it was a decade ago--one-tenth. We have \nhealthier children as a result. In fact, just using that figure itself \nis a tribute to the success of the original Clean Air Act.\n  One thing we do know is Americans do not want to stop the progress we \nmade and say, look what we did back then, 10 years ago; it is what we \ndo today to keep moving forward in cleaning up our environment. I have \nheard some of the debate here in the Congress now, on the Clean Air \nAct, that it is not to strengthen it, not to make it better based on \nwhat we learned, but rather to weaken it. It is almost like saying we \ntook care of those children, but tomorrow's children we are unwilling \nto help.\n  We also learned the ecosystem is not static and that environmental \nprogress should not be either. There is no status quo and never should \nbe a status quo when it comes to a healthy environment. New pollution \nsources appear, and none of us can predict today what the new pollution \nsources might be a decade from now. We know populations grow and they \nshift and pollutants accumulate. So, if you are not always moving \ntoward a safer and cleaner environment, then you are slipping \nbackwards.\n  The EPA conducted a 5-year review of existing standards and compared \nthese with new scientific research about the tiny particulates and \nozone that we breathe. When EPA issued new goals to lower the level of \nthese particulates coming into our lungs and the ozone levels, the \nbacklash was remarkable. Opponents instantly attacked the goals rather \nthan sitting down to work with the Congress and administration to \nachieve these goals in a reasonable and cost-effective timeframe. \nInstead of saying, ``What do we do to make air and water safer for our \nchildren?'' it was, rather, ``We cannot possibly do this.'' These are \nthe same people who would do anything to save a child, but not to save \nthe Nation's children.\n  We ought to listen to the voices of more than 130 million Americans \nin 170 major cities who continue to breathe unhealthy air, including \nthe city we are in today. When the Clean Air Act was drafted, we were \nunwilling to accept the argument that the present cost of environment \nregulation should define the future of our environment. Our late \ncolleague, Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine said, ``The first \nresponsibility of Congress is not the making of technological or \neconomic judgments. Our responsibility is to establish what the public \ninterest requires to protect the health of persons.''\n  So, on this Earth Day I ask Senators to go back to the original \npremise of the Clean Air Act and ask ourselves what do we do to carry \nforward the torch of environmental progress, not only for ourselves but \nfor the next generations of Americans? I hope we might look at the \nbiggest loophole in the Clean Air Act, allowing the dirtiest \npowerplants to continue to operate with vastly inadequate pollution \ncontrols. We ought to go back and close this loophole now, in this \nsession of Congress.\n\n  One of the reasons it is so urgent is because of the deregulation of \nthe electric utility industry. We have the benefits of competition in \nthe utility industry. Some say it is going to be as much as $50 \nbillion. Surely, with this we ought to be able to offset the \nenvironmental costs of utility deregulation and have some ability to \nhave cleaner air.\n  We ought to look at some of the coal-fired production plants that \nwere grandfathered under the Clean Air Act. One study says an annual \nincrease of emissions of 349,000 tons of nitrogen oxide, a component of \nozone pollution, comes from them.\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\n  Let us look at what happens here. We have plants that have been \ngrandfathered in. That means they are allowed to spew whatever they \nwant. These plants are out here. You see the pictures of them. But \nwhere do the pollutants go from these 25 grandfathered plants? They \nmove, of course, east. Many of the plants are in the Midwest or toward \nthe West, but the pollutants move east.\n  If we are going to talk about what we do with the Clean Air Act, let \nus think of our children. My children are going to live most of their \nlives in the next century. But if we allow this to go on with no \nchanges, those who live in this part of our country are going to be \nseverely damaged and those children who are going to live most of their \nlives in the next century are going to feel the results of it.\n  I have talked about the high environmental standards we have in \nVermont. Each State and community should take responsibility for \ncontrolling pollution within their borders. We have done this in \nVermont, implementing some of the toughest environmental laws in the \nNation. But, even though we have imposed high environmental standards \non ourselves, we Vermonters are faced with an uphill battle when the \npollution we are striving to control silently creeps into our State \neach night with the wind. We Vermonters are deeply concerned about what \nis being transported by air currents.\n  We Vermonters are deeply concerned about what comes with the wind at \nnight when we are sleeping from other parts of this country. Acid rain \ntaught us that our tough environmental standards were not enough to \nprotect us. We saw some of our healthiest forests die off from \npollution borne from outside our region. This is an experience from \nwhich everybody can learn. Increased power generation at these 25 \ndirtiest plants is going to affect air quality across the country. We \nlearned from the acid rain debate that emissions from these plants \ncould be transported more than 500 miles.\n  Let us look here. Here are the 25 top polluters. This is where the \npollution is going. If you look at this, you can see from the 25 top \npolluters, our part of the country is being hit especially hard. My own \nState of Vermont, with the toughest environmental laws you are going to \nfind anywhere, cannot protect ourselves by our own laws because these \npollutants come across by every wind that comes over Vermont from the \nwest, carrying those pollutants.\n  There is no fence, there is no law that we Vermonters can set up to \nprotect us, but we in the Congress can protect all the people in this \nregion.\n  I will also say, Mr. President, if we do not look at these \ngrandfathered plans, it is not only the Northeast that is going to be \naffected, all parts of the country are going to see their air quality \ndiminished.\n  In the case of acid rain, some areas are more vulnerable to damage \nthan others because of their geology. The rocky soils of Canada and \nmuch of the Northeast means that we have less ability to buffer the \nacids, so our lakes will die sooner. But in the case of ozone, we are \ndealing with children, not lakes or forests. As I said, my children \nwill live most of their lives in the next century, and I think about \nthat all the time. I also think children are the same, whether they are \nCanadians, Vermonters, or Ohioans. Children in Ohio, Missouri, West \nVirginia, and other States are just as vulnerable as those in Canada \nand Vermont.\n  I called on the administration a year ago to develop a mitigation \nprogram to address increased air pollution associated with utility \nrestructuring. To date, nothing has been proposed. I do not think we \ncan wait any longer. This train is leaving the station and, \nunfortunately, it is a polluting train.\n  More than 10 States are already developing restructuring legislation. \nTwo States are implementing open competition. With more than $50 \nbillion in expected benefits from competition, we should be able to \nafford the costs of ensuring clean air for our children. A number of \nproposals have been addressed in the House, but none addresses this \nproblem. The administration has not proposed a solution to it. I hope \nthat proposal will come. I will see what provisions it makes.\n  Earth Day reminds us that we share the air, the water and our planet. \nThere can be no greater legacy that we leave behind for our children \nand our grandchildren than a society that is secure in its commitment \nto a healthy and environmentally sound future.\n  On this Earth Day, I want all of us in Congress to stop thinking only \nin regional terms of the Clean Air Act and the potential benefits and \ncosts from utility restructuring. We all share in the responsibility to \nleave behind for the next generations a healthy environment. The only \nway we are going to be successful is to look at the quality of our air, \nwater, and ecosystems in wider terms. We have to address the loopholes \nthat allow these dirty plants to churn out tons of pollutants for the \nlast 20 years. We cannot afford them a free ride into the next century.\n  Let me point out once more, we are not in this alone. The plants are \nhere, but the pollutants go across our country. I say this today \nbecause the President is going to North Dakota, actually a place where \ntwo of these plants are. He will go representing our whole country and \ngrant aid to the people who have been badly hurt. Any one of us, from \nwhatever State we come from, when we look at the pictures on television \nand read the news accounts of what those people in North Dakota have \ngone through, our hearts have to ache for them.\n  When a town is hit with both flood and fire, it is almost like a \nBiblical reference to devastation. We will, as a great nation, as we \nalways do in matters of major disasters, come together and we will \nhelp. Vermonters will help the people in North Dakota, as will Kansans \nand Californians and everybody else. But it is one thing when you see a \ndisaster that happens all at once. Unfortunately, there is a disaster \nin air pollution that happens drip by drip, day by day, and if we allow \nthese pollutants to continue to drift across our Nation, those of us \nwho are in the East and Northeast also face a disaster, a disaster not \nof our making but a disaster of our Nation's making, a disaster that \nmay not have a great effect on me, as I stand here in my fifties, but \nit will on the children of Vermont and it will on their children's \nchildren.\n  This country can be justifiably proud of the steps it has taken in \nenvironmental quality. When I look at the newly democratic nations of \nEastern Europe and I see how they struggle with health costs and \ndevelopment costs based on their own ignoring of the environment for \nthe last several generations, I think how fortunate we are that we have \nbeen way ahead of that in this country, but also know that we have a \nlong, long way to go.\n  Let us look at this, not for those in my generation, necessarily, but \nthose in my children's generation. Let us look for those who are going \nto live most of their lives in the next century. That is something this \nCongress can do. Democrats and Republicans alike should join together \nand that is a legacy we can leave.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3392-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues of \nlegislation that I introduced on April 10 called the Child Care \nExpansion Act.\n  This legislation--the first legislation I have had the privilege of \nintroducing in this body--does address one of the greatest challenges \nthat faces families today, and that is finding dependable and \naffordable child care.\n  The demand for quality child care is rising. We have changes in \nfamily structure, more working mothers, and significant changes in \nsocial policy, which all have helped--all have helped--drive this \nincrease. In fact, only 2 years ago 60 percent of children under the \nage of 5 were cared for by someone other than a parent while their \nmother or father was working.\n  We have had numerous studies that indicate the availability of child \ncare has failed to keep up with this demand. Three out of four parents \nresponding to a national poll indicate that there is an insufficient \nsupply of child care, Mr. President, especially for infants.\n  Child care keeps America working.\n  In 1994, three out of five women with children under the age of 6 \nwere in the work force. A lack of dependable child care causes these \nworkers to lose time and to be less productive. Child care benefits \nprovided by employers help to recruit and retain quality employees. It \npays off with lower costs in regard to the businesses that have a good \nchild-care program. And child-care providers are also small business \nowners who contribute to the economy while keeping our children safe.\n  Child care provides access to high-quality learning environments for \nchildren in their critical learning years.\n  Just last week--I think it was last Wednesday--in the Wall Street \nJournal there was an article entitled ``Good, Early Care Has a Huge \nImpact on Kids, Studies Say.'' And that article pointed out the \nmonumental importance of quality child care in the first 3 years of the \ninfant's life. And according to the National Institute of Child Health \nand Human Development, a study cited in the article, high-quality child \ncare provided by nurturing, stimulating care givers improves the \ncognitive learning and language skills. These are skills a child \ndepends on for the rest of his or her life.\n  So child care is central to the implementation of successful welfare \nreform.\n  I might add, that the concept of this child-care bill, as far as I \nwas concerned, became very evident as we went through welfare reform \nlegislation in the past session of the Congress when I had the \nprivilege of being the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and \nwe were approaching food stamp reform.\n  It became obvious to me, if we were going to provide self-reliance, \nindependence, and the tools with which about 2,000 people in Kansas \nneeded to get off the welfare rolls and become self-reliant--these \npeople had been on welfare for over 5 years--they did two things, job \ntraining, that is obvious, and the second thing was child care.\n  Stringent new work requirements will move more welfare parents into \nthe work force and create an even greater demand for quality child \ncare. I think this legislation simply addresses these issues through a \nresponsible four-pronged approach. There are no new entitlements, no \nnew mandates on businesses. This legislation fills a pressing need \nwithout creating more bureaucracy or more government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 548 be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXPANSION OF CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Increase in Credit Percentage for Low and Middle Income \n     Workers.--Section 21(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to credit for expenses for household and \n     dependent care services necessary for gainful employment) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) Applicable percentage defined.--For purposes of \n     paragraph (1), the term `applicable percentage' means 30 \n     percent reduced (but not below 20 percent) by 1 percentage \n     point for each $2,000 (or fraction thereof) by which the \n     taxpayer's adjusted gross income exceeds $20,000.''\n       (b) Increase in Maximum Amount Creditable.--Section 21(c) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to dollar \n     limit on amount creditable) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``$2,400'' in paragraph (1) and inserting \n     ``$3,600'', and\n       (2) by striking ``$4,800'' in paragraph (2) and inserting \n     ``$5,400''.\n       (c) Phase-Out of Credit for Higher Income Taxpayers.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 21(c) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to dollar limit on amount creditable) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(2) Phaseout of credit.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The amount of the credit allowed under \n     subsection (a) shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the \n     amount determined under subparagraph (B).\n       ``(B) Amount of reduction.--The amount determined under \n     this paragraph equals the amount which bears the same ratio \n     to the credit (determined without regard to this subsection) \n     as--\n       ``(i) the excess of--\n\n       ``(I) the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for such taxable \n     year, over\n       ``(II) the threshold amount, bears to\n\n       ``(ii) $10,000.\n\n     Any amount determined under this subparagraph which is not a \n     multiple of $10 shall be rounded to the next lowest $10.\n       ``(C) Threshold amount.--For purposes of this paragraph, \n     the term `threshold amount' means--\n       ``(i) $90,000 in the case of a joint return,\n       ``(ii) $65,000 in the case of an individual who is not \n     married, and\n       ``(iii) $45,000 in the case of a married individual filing \n     a separate return.\n\n     For purposes of this subparagraph, marital status shall be \n     determined under section 7703.\n       ``(D) Adjusted gross income.--For purposes of this \n     paragraph, adjusted gross income of any taxpayer shall be \n     increased by any amount excluded from gross income under \n     section 911, 931, or 933.''\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--Section 21(c) of such Code is \n     amended--\n       (A) by striking ``(c) Dollar Limit on Amount Creditable.--\n     The'' and inserting:\n       ``(c) Limitations.--\n       ``(1) Dollar limit.--The'',\n       (B) by redesignating paragraphs (1) and (2) as \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B), respectively, and\n       (C) by striking ``paragraph (1) or (2)'' in the last \n     sentence and inserting ``subparagraph (A) or (B)''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997.\n\n     SEC. 202. EXPANSION OF HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION TO INCLUDE USE \n                   OF OFFICE FOR DEPENDENT CARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 280A(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to certain business use) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following: ``A portion of a dwelling \n     unit and the exclusive use of such portion otherwise \n     described in this paragraph shall not fail to be so described \n     if such portion is also used by the taxpayer during such \n     exclusive use to care for a dependent of the taxpayer.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, first, the Child Care Expansion Act \nincludes funding for a short-term, flexible grant program to encourage \nsmall businesses to work together to provide day care services for \nemployees. This program is a demonstration project that will sunset at \nthe end of 3 years. In the meantime, small businesses will be eligible \nfor grants up to $50,000 for startup costs, training, scholarships or \nother related activities. Businesses will be required to match Federal \nfunds to encourage self-sustaining facilities well into the future.\n  The idea behind this 3-year grant is for the small communities and \nsmall businesses in that community to get together to provide the child \ncare facility. The $50,000 grant over 3 years will provide startup \nmoney for our smaller communities, for the major businesses in that \ncommunity to come together and provide a facility that otherwise would \nnot be achieved.\n  Second, this legislation includes an expansion of the child and \ndependent care tax credit, targeting the credit to working parents who \nneed it the most, not only the people who are trying to be self-reliant \nin regard to welfare reform but the low- and middle-income family. It \nwill increase from $720 for one child, up to $1,080, and from the \ncurrent $1,140 for two or more children to $1,620 for families with \nmore than one dependent. In addition, the credit is phased out for \nhigher income wage earners, which means that the deficit exposure or \nthe expenditure side is very, very limited.\n  This legislation also addresses the needs of parents who choose to \nwork from the home. In this case, the Internal Revenue Service rules \nare expanded to allow taxpayers who need to use the family room or some \nother room for home-based business while caring for dependents. The \ncurrent IRS rules are much too strict and simply do not make sense for \npeople who want to work at home but have to take care of the youngsters \nas well.\n  Finally, this legislation encourages our Nation's most experienced \ncare givers, our older Americans, who are already participating in \nfederally supported work programs, to provide child care services in \ncommunities where it is feasible to do so. Obviously, there is a \nbonding that goes on, Mr. President, in regard to grandkids and also \ngrandparents. This bill certainly encourages that bonding.\n  This legislation includes no new entitlements or mandates on the \nbusiness community. It fills a pressing need without creating more \nbureaucracy or Government. Child care is an issue that impacts each and \nevery one of us. While parents continue to struggle to meet the \nconstant demand of work and family, it seems to me we must continue to \ndo our part to expand the child care options and protect our Nation's \nmost valuable resource--our children. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin support of America's kids and cosponsor the Child Care Expansion \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto speak for such time as is necessary for the nomination of Alexis \nHerman.\n\n[[Page S3396]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this part of the hour that is under the \nDemocrat leader's control?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3394-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3396-S3397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ALEXIS HERMAN TO BE SECRETARY OF LABOR\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, once again I am deeply disturbed that \nAlexis Herman's confirmation to be Secretary of Labor has been held up. \nMiss Herman is being subjected to a level of scrutiny that is not \ndeserving of her nor this institution. Miss Herman is being held \nhostage for political reasons.\n  What is the real reason for the delay? Well, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle say it is because of an Executive order that \nwould encourage Federal agencies to consider the use of something \ncalled ``project labor agreements'' on any construction contract sent \nout for bid. How ironic that it is my colleagues that would hold up the \nnomination of the next Secretary of Labor because of an Executive order \nthat asks contractors and subcontractors who bid on a Federal project \nto consider paying union wages, provide union-scale benefits, and use \nunion hiring halls for labor--projects that are financed with taxpayers \ndollars.\n\n  This order does not require the contractor to sign a collective \nbargaining agreement. It just makes sure that we help our workers \nmaintain a decent wage and living standard. My Republican colleagues \nwould hold up the nomination of the Secretary of Labor, whose \nresponsibility it is to enforce our Nation's labor laws, because we \nwant to ensure that contractors working on Federal projects abide by \nFederal laws.\n  I want the nomination of Alexis Herman and the debate about her to \nfocus on her qualifications and her competency to lead the Department \nof Labor. This should not be a debate on President Clinton's Executive \norder. I call upon the leadership of the other side of the aisle to let \nthis nomination go forward, let there be debate on the Senate floor \nabout Miss Herman's competency. Is she a coalition builder? Can she \nprovide leadership? And does she provide a framework for the future? \nThat is what the debate should be all about.\n  My constituents are deeply concerned that Miss Herman, who brings so \nmany credentials and competency, has been waiting month after month, \nsubjected to character assassination, leaks in the press that distort \nher record, and now, just when she thought she was going to come to the \nSenate floor, not have that opportunity because some people are cranky \nabout an Executive order issued by President Clinton. Be cranky with \nPresident Clinton. Do not be cranky with Alexis Herman or hold up her \nnomination.\n  We cannot have this held up because of crankpots. I know Alexis \nHerman and I have known her for 20 years, when she worked in the Carter \nadministration and I was a Congresswoman. Alexis Herman comes to us \nhaving graduated from a Catholic college in New Orleans, Xavier \nUniversity. She was a social worker, working at Catholic Charities in \nfoster care. Then she wanted to make sure she prevented family \nbreakups, and she began working in job training and placement. In 1974, \nshe headed up a black woman's employment program that then, because of \nits innovation and her management skill, went to nine other cities.\n  Miss Herman brings to us a background where, at age 27, she was \nrunning a 10-city program to help minority women break into the work \nforce. Is that not a Secretary of Labor we want to move people from \nwelfare to work? At 29, she was the youngest person ever named to head \nthe Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor. Following that first \nGovernment service, she then went on to run her own business and help \nmanage the 1992 Democratic convention. She is a coalition builder. \nThroughout her career, she has worked with parties on all sides to find \ngood solutions. If you go back and talk with the people who have worked \nfor her over the years, advocacy groups believe she will speak up for \nthose who are left out and left behind.\n  The community that provides the jobs, the business community, feels \nthat she is a coalition builder and helps them solve issues from \nregulatory reform to how to do outreach in the minority communities.\n  She will bring to the Labor Department a lifelong commitment to \nmaking sure that we create an opportunity ladder in this century. She \nhas said publicly and to me privately that she wants to accept the \nchallenge of moving people from welfare to work in a new era of time \nlimit on welfare. She wants enhanced health and pension security for \nworking people. She wants to ensure a safe and equal opportunity \nworkplace, and she wants to work with the President in this on \nextending the lifelong education and training opportunities for our \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, we need a Secretary of Labor. We need someone who is a \nleader, who is effective, and who has a vision for the future. I really \nencourage that the nomination of Alexis Herman be brought up after we \nfinish our discussion on the chemical weapons treaty.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want just to commend the Senator from \nMaryland for an excellent presentation and one which I hope our friends \nand colleagues on the other side of the aisle would hear and heed. I \nsee my good friend from Nevada on the floor, who will address the \nSenate in a few moments as well about the labor nominee.\n  I want to just underscore two different items, Mr. President. First, \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee had the opportunity to go \nthrough the hearings. These were extensive background hearings on the \nqualifications of Ms. Herman. I will have an opportunity, when the \nSenate finally comes to consider the nomination, to review the record \non her background and experience, but Senator Mikulski has done so this \nafternoon in a very, very thorough way. This is really an extraordinary \nindividual.\n  In spite of many allegations and charges which have been responded \nto, we are in a situation where the one Cabinet office which is there \nto hold the spokesperson for working families is vacant--vacant--and \nthe nomination is being held hostage because of a difference with the \nPresident of the United States signing an Executive Order regarding \nproject labor agreements, or what they call PLA's. Those are \narrangements and agreements that can be done voluntarily within States, \nthat more often than not result in the saving of taxpayers' money and \nthe reduction of accidents on the construction site. PLA's also allow \nfor the relationships between workers and management to be worked out \nin a very constructive and positive way to make sure we have ontime \nresults and achieve high quality outcomes.\n  PLA's have been done under Republican Governors and Democratic \nGovernors, in New York, New Jersey, and Nevada, among others. Now the \nPresident of the United States wishes to exercise his power to issue an \nExecutive order. That is differed with by Members. But they have the \nright to go into court and challenge that at a later time.\n  The point that Senator Mikulski, Senator Reid, others, and I will \nmake is that if our Republican friends have a difference with the \nPresident on the issue of the PLA's, why hold up Alexis Herman, who is \nthe spokesperson for working families in this country, from being able \nto assume the responsibilities of that particular position?\n  It is a very important position. We have several pieces of \nlegislation that are on the calendar which relate to the conditions of \nworking families in this country, including the so-called TEAM Act, the \nso-called comptime bill, and others, which we will have an opportunity \nto debate at some time. These are pieces of legislation that will have \na direct impact on working conditions and wages of working families. \nStill, we do not have a Secretary of Labor in place, who will speak for \nworkers, and that is because there is a small group of Senators who are \neffectively holding her hostage.\n  We understand today is the Passover holiday, which is a period of \ncelebration and a very special time of contemplation and thought and \nprayer by many Americans, and therefore we are not doing the Senate's \nbusiness, and we do not ask the Senate to consider the\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\nnomination today. We understand tomorrow we are considering the \nchemical weapons treaty. That is extremely important.\n  Mr. President, this issue was allegedly agreed to be considered on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate last week. But Members on the other side \nof the aise reneged on that agreement, so that we were unable to come \nto completion on this nomination. Now, Mr. President, we are calling on \nthe leadership on the other side to give us an opportunity to have \nSenate consideration of this nominee and to stop this attempt to play \nhostage with the President's nominee. She is someone who was reported \nout favorably by all the members of the committee.\n  It is time to end these kinds of games. The American people want us \nto find ways of working together, not to be blocking the consideration \nof a nominee who has the support of Republicans and Democrats alike.\n  Mr. President, I hope at the time that we are back into full session, \nthat we will be able to set a time in the next very few days, on the \ncompletion, perhaps, of the chemical weapons convention, or perhaps \neven during the consideration of that there can be time found for a \nshort discussion of the merits of this nominee. She is an outstanding \nnominee. She will perform her work well. It is wrong to hold up the \nPresident's nominee. The President, after all, won the election. When \nyou win the election, you have the time-honored privilege of selecting \nyour own advisers. There is one standard that is used for the \nPresident's advisers who come and go at the time the President is \nelected. There is a different set of criteria when we talk about those \nwho have more extended terms, such as the Federal Reserve Board and \nsome of the other agencies; those continue at the time of a particular \nadministration and can lapse on to another administration. We have even \na higher standard when we are talking about lifetime appointments, like \nFederal district judges and circuit court judges, and the highest \nstandard for the Supreme Court. That is something we all understand.\n\n  But we are at the point now where the President, who won the \nelection, has indicated that he wants Alexis Herman as his adviser on \nlabor for the country's working families. It is wrong to continue to \nhold her hostage, and I hope we move ahead with consideration of her \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, the Republican leadership is holding the nomination of \nAlexis Herman hostage to an unrelated policy dispute. Ms. Herman was \nreported out of the Labor Committee unanimously 2 weeks ago. \nRepublicans and Democrats alike voted in her favor.\n  The Republican leadership had scheduled a floor vote on her \nconfirmation last week, but in an abrupt about-face they reneged on \nthat commitment. The reason was the leadership's disagreement with a \nproposed Executive order under consideration within the administration.\n  That order would direct Federal agencies to consider--not mandate--\nthe use of so-called project labor agreements on Federal construction \nprojects.\n  Such agreements have been used on large-scale construction projects, \nin the public and private sectors, for decades. Examples of Federal \nprojects built under PLA's include the Grand Coulee Dam in the 1930's; \natomic energy plants in the 1940's; Cape Kennedy in the 1960's; and \ntoday, on the Boston Harbor cleanup. Such agreements are also being \nused in the present decommissioning and decontamination of nuclear \nfacilities at Oak Ridge, TN; Savannah River, SC; Fernald, OH; Hanford, \nWA; Idaho National Engineering Labs, ID; and Lawrence Livermore, CA, \namong others.\n  In the private sector, too, PLA's have been used on many projects \nacross the Nation, including the construction of Disney World in \nFlorida, the Toyota plant in Georgetown, KY, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline \nSystem in Alaska, and the Saturn auto plan in Tennessee.\n  State governments use PLA's as well. Governor Pataki of New York \nissued an Executive order strikingly similar to the Clinton proposal in \nJanuary 1997. The Nevada and New Jersey Governors recently issued \nsimilar orders. State projects constructed under PLA's include the \nBoston Harbor cleanup; modifications to the Tappan Zee Bridge in New \nYork; the Southern Nevada Water System improvements project outside Las \nVegas; and many others.\n  What PLA's do is require contractors to comply with the terms of \nlabor agreements for the duration of the project. The advantages of \nsuch PLA's are many. Projects are more often completed on time, because \na skilled labor supply is always available. There are fewer cost \noverruns, because workplace disputes are resolved through grievance-\narbitration procedures, instead of by strikes or lockouts, which cost \nvaluable work time for employers and employees alike. Projects built \nunder PLA's have lower accident rates, because contractors can hire \nhighly skilled and trained employees. Productivity increases as well, \nbecause of the higher skill level of workers.\n  Opponents of PLA's claim that such agreement unfairly deny contracts \nand jobs to nonunion firms and individuals. This is simply not true.\n  Nonunion contractors can and do bid on jobs where PLA's are in \neffect. For example, in the Boston Harbor project, fully 40 percent of \nthe subcontractors--over 100 firms--are nonunion. Similarly, on the \nIdaho National Engineering Labs PLA with the Department of Energy, 30 \npercent of the subcontractors were nonunion.\n  Similarly, nonunion workers can and do work on sites where PLAs are \nin place. Unions are required by law to refer nonmembers to jobs on the \nsame basis as union members. The NLRB vigorously enforces this \nprovision of the labor laws, and unions know how to and do comply. \nFurthermore, in the 21 so-called ``right-to-work'' States, no worker \ncan ever be required to give financial support to a union. In the other \n29 States, if the particular contract provides it, workers can be \nrequired to pay a fee to the union while workers are employed on the \njob site. However, no employee can ever be forced to join the union, or \nto pay for union activities that are not related to collective \nbargaining.\n  PLA's thus are beneficial to project owners and workers alike. \nFurther, it's clear that the President has the authority to issue an \nExecutive order dealing with Federal procurement practices. President \nBush did just that, when, in October 1992, he issued an Executive order \nforbidding Federal agencies to require PLA's on Federal construction \nprojects. Republican attacks on President Clinton's power to issue an \norder directing the consideration of such agreements thus are \ndisingenuous at best.\n  It's particularly unconscionable to hold up Alexis Herman's \nnomination on this basis. The country's working families deserve a \nrepresentative, and the Republicans know it. It's time for the \npolitical extortion to stop, and for the Republicans to give up their \nhostage. Free Alexis Herman, and free her now.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, I want to raise a couple of points here as \nwe move through the budget negotiations. There are ongoing negotiations \nwith the White House relative to trying to\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\nreach a budget agreement. But those negotiations deal with a budget \nthat will run through the year 2002. My concern is that, as we look at \na budget in that short timeframe, action which we take to address a \nbudget that would reach balance by 2002 would have impact beyond that \nperiod, obviously, because we will put in place decisions that are not \ngoing to end at the time that budget concludes in 2002, but it will \naffect spending beyond that time.\n\n  In two major accounts, the President's budget, as proposed, is \nbasically a budget that has a low initial cost but has a dramatic, \nexplosive cost in the outyears when you get past the year 2002. Both in \nthe Medicare account and the Medicaid account, the President's budget, \nas sent up here, has significant increases in spending, but those \nincreases in spending that are for the 5-year timeframe running through \n2002 are really minuscule compared to the spending that will occur in \nthe period after 2002. I believe this needs to be highlighted because, \nif it is not, I am afraid we will adopt initiatives in the President's \nbudget that come out of it as part of this process of building our own \nbudget and reaching a bipartisan budget.\n  I am concerned that we will adopt initiatives that will cost us \ndramatic amounts of money outside the budget window and, once again, \naggravate the real problem that confronts the country. We would be \npassing on to our children a country with huge debts of obligation that \nour children will never be able to pay.\n  Let me highlight this in specifics. Under the President's proposal \nfor Medicare, there is $33 billion in new spending during the budget \nwindow, through the year 2002. When you go beyond the year 2002 to the \nperiod of the next 4 years--this is a 4-year period, and it would run \npast that, obviously--there will be an explosion in the cost of those \nnew programs. Those new programs, which cost $33 billion in the next 4 \nyears, in the 4 years after that will cost $93 billion in new spending. \nThat represents a 182-percent increase over the 5-year period. That is \nin the Medicare accounts.\n  Some of these new programs involve the following--and I agree they \nare probably programs which we all feel would be nice. But the question \nis: Can we afford them? Can we afford to pass them on to our children? \nCan we afford to pass $93 billion in new spending on to our children, \nwhich is outside the budget window? Some of the new programs include: A \nnew initiative in the area of cancer screening, for $2.5 billion; a \ndirect payment to hospitals, outside of AAPCC, $26 billion; changing \nthe way the Medicare accounts for the part B, 20-percent charge, which \naccounts for $42 billion; and a whole list of other new initiatives, \nall of which add up to $93 billion in spending that is outside the \nbudget window, and is new spending for new programs and which will have \nto be paid by the taxpayers of this country, and, if not, borrowed from \nour children. In either event, it will aggravate the balance in the \nMedicare trust fund and continue to drive the Medicare trust fund \ntoward insolvency.\n  The second area the President has taken the same course of action on \nis in the area of Medicaid. In the Medicaid accounts, he has proposed \n$16 billion of new spending during the budget period between 1998 and \nthe year 2002. But that $16 billion in new programmatic spending that \noccurs in the first 5 years explodes in the next 4 years to $34 \nbillion, for a 113-percent increase. That is a 113-percent increase \nover the initial spending period--another explosive expansion of an \nentitlement program through the process of adding new benefits. In this \narea, we are talking about new benefits for disabled, illegal \nimmigrants, and new benefits for children of illegal immigrants. And so \nyou have this dramatic increase in spending. When you combine these two \nproposals--the President's proposal in Medicare and the proposal in \nMedicaid--the new spending accounts aggravate and compound the problem \neven more dramatically.\n  You see here that in the next 5 years, which is the budget period the \nPresident sent us on this, there is $49 billion in new spending in \nMedicare and Medicaid accounts. As you move into the outyears, that $49 \nbillion translates into $127 billion in new spending, or a 159-percent \nincrease because of new programmatic activity. Now, what we are talking \nabout here--and this needs to be stressed--is new programmatic \nactivity. We are not talking about maintaining the Medicare trust fund \nor Medicaid trust funds; we are talking about adding to that program.\n\n  Mr. President, we are talking about increased spending as a result of \nbrandnew programs. So as we move down this road of trying to reach \nagreement on this budget, I think we have to be very sensitive that we \nnot add a lot of new programs that may look affordable over the next 4 \nor 5 years, but which, in the outyears, becomes totally unaffordable \nand further aggravates what is already a very serious situation, \nbecause we know the Medicare trust fund is going bankrupt in 2000 and \nthis will only aggravate that. All of these costs, if passed on to our \nchildren, may end up making their capacity to have a prosperous and \nproductive country much less. This must be focused on as we go down the \nroad to reaching a budget agreement.\n  I yield back such time as I may have left. I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Nevada allowing me to speak at this point, during the time of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3397-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3398-S3399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, since I have been here in the Senate, we \nhave been under a majority controlled by the Republicans and the \nDemocrats. When I first came here, the Democrats had the majority, and \nnow the Republicans have the majority.\n  During the times that the Democrats had the majority, there were some \nvery controversial nominees that came forward, but they always came \nforward and there was a vote. My concern is that we are now entering \ninto a new era, where the majority is using nominees of the President--\nand there is no question about their capabilities and their credentials \nto hold the job, and there is nothing relating to their moral \nqualifications. They are simply holding up the President's appointees \nbecause they don't want them to be selected, or they have some other \nissue and they are trying to hold the nominee hostage.\n  As an example, Alexis Herman has been nominated to be the Secretary \nof Labor. We were initially told we are not going to get her out of \ncommittee until there is comptime legislation marked up in the Labor \nCommittee. That hurdle has gone over. The legislation is marked up. Now \nthere is another hurdle this woman must find herself facing. Now we are \ntold that there is an issue that deals with an opposed Executive order \nthat would permit Federal agencies to consider requiring contractors on \ncertain large Federal construction projects to comply with labor \ncontracts for the duration of the project. Governor Miller of Nevada \nissues a similar order and a project labor agreement is now in use on a \nvery large construction project outside of Las Vegas to bring water \ninto Las Vegas.\n  Mr. President, I respectfully submit that holding Alexis Herman's \nnomination hostage to this is wrong. To hold her nomination hostage \nover an Executive order is wrong. She is qualified morally and \neducationally and is experienced. Therefore, she should be working for \nthe taxpayers of this country in the job she was selected to do by the \nPresident. What is happening is not right.\n  We can get into the merits of the issue of the majority holding \nAlexis Herman hostage, but should that really be the case? If we looked \nat it closely, we would find that in the State of Nevada, as an \nexample, of the seven contracts awarded, three went to nonunion \ncontractors. I assume that is what the majority is concerned about. \nThey have this problem with unions. Well, in Nevada, even though the \nGovernor entered this order, three of the contracts went to nonunion \ncontractors, and four went to traditional union contractors. Of the 36 \ncontractors who bid on the seven contracts, 16 were nonunion, 20 were \nunion.\n  The point I am making, Mr. President, is that this issue, this \nproposed Executive order, is just that--an issue. We should debate it. \nIt is wrong and there is legislation to hold hearings or try to get the \nExecutive order overturned, but we should not hold up this woman's \nnomination.\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\n  Are we going to continue without a Secretary of Labor until the \nmajority leadership gets their way on every labor issue? I hope not. I \ndon't think that hostage holding is a proper way to pass good \nlegislation. It is not the way to have the President's nominees chosen. \nThe President has a right to select who he wants to work in these very \nsensitive Cabinet positions. He has chosen a woman that is certainly \nqualified.\n  Mr. President, this woman is a graduate, as is my colleague, the \njunior Senator from Maryland, from Xavier University in New Orleans, \nLA. In 1977, she was the youngest director ever of the Woman's Bureau \nat the Department of Labor. She is certainly entitled to this job by \nvirtue of her qualifications.\n  We are willing to debate these issues and work for compromises if, in \nfact, that is necessary. But the majority is saying that it is their \nway or no way. This tactic is becoming a way of business under this \nmajority. Also, I don't believe there has ever been judicial \nnominations put on hold by a Congress as we have seen with this one. \nOne must wonder about the pattern of the recent majority attacks--\nAlexis Herman, Senator Landrieu, Congresswoman Sanchez, and judicial \nnominee Margaret Morrow. For example, take Margaret Morrow; she has \nbeen found very qualified by the American Bar Association.\n  She was first nominated almost a year ago, and we still have not had \nthe opportunity to vote on this woman. This is wrong. The rules of the \nSenate allow leadership to delay a nomination if there are questions \nabout the nominee's qualifications. But there are no questions about \nthis nominee's qualifications.\n  There is no reason that we don't have a vote on Alexis Herman. And we \nshould have it this week. I think that it is wrong that we go forward \nwith legislation--the majority feels important, and the minority goes \nalong with that--but I think we are going to have to arrive at a point \nwhere we have to take a look at how the majority is handling what takes \nplace on this Senate floor. Maybe what we should do is nothing until \nthese people who are qualified, like Alexis Herman and like Margaret \nMorrow, until we have votes on them.\n  If they want to vote against Alexis Herman, then the majority should \nvote against Alexis Herman. But to hold this woman hostage--it is now \napproaching the 1st of May, and this woman has not been able to go to \nwork as Secretary of Labor. That is wrong. I think the American public \ndeserve more, and I hope that majority leadership will allow her \nnomination to go forward along with some of other nominees that are \nbeing held up for reasons unknown to most of us.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today on the occasion of National \nOrgan and Tissue Donor Awareness Week. I rise to challenge all of us to \ntake actions that will eliminate the chronic shortage of organs \navailable for transplant in the United States.\n  Mr. President, this Nation faces a severe organ shortage. I have \ntalked about this issue several times on the Senate floor. Last year at \nthis time when I talked about it, at least eight people in America \nevery day were dying while waiting for organ transplants. One year \nlater, tragically, the figures are even worse. Today, 10 people now die \nevery day while waiting for organs.\n  Mr. President, these numbers are certainly very distressing. They are \ndevastating because the technology to save these men, women, and \nchildren is available. It is there. If you ask our expert on this \nissue, and the Senate's expert, Dr. Frist from Tennessee, he will tell \nus that these people can be saved. These 10 people who die every day \ncould have been saved. The technology is there. Medical science has \nadvanced that far. But they die because there are simply not enough \navailable organs. That is a tragedy, Mr. President,\n  In January 1996, there were almost 44,000 patients in this country \nwaiting for an organ transplant. One year later, the figure is up to \n51,000 individuals who are today waiting--up 7,000 from just a year \nago.\n  The need for transplantable organs has increased in all categories. \nThese aren't just statistics, not just numbers, not just longer and \nlonger lists. These are people. These are children, friends, and \nfamilies that love them, and that pray every day that there will be a \nchance for that loved one to live--that there will be an organ that is \navailable for that child, that parent, that husband, or that mother.\n  I think that we have to ask ourselves what we can do about this. What \ncan we do about this as individuals and as elected officials?\n  As private citizens, when we go to get our driver's license for the \nfirst time, or when we go to get it renewed, we are asked sometimes \nvery quickly, ``Do you want to donate your organs in case of an \naccident, in the case of your death?'' We all need to say yes when that \nquestion is asked. We can also, and should, encourage our relatives and \nfriends to do the same thing. As Americans, we need to talk about this \nissue. As families we need to talk about this issue before tragedy \nstrikes.\n  This is not a subject that anyone of us likes to discuss. But it is \nvery important that we do so because our willingness to discuss it now, \nour willingness as a people to be open and to organize a donation is \nreally a matter of life and death.\n  My wife, Fran, and I faced this issue when our daughter, Becky, was \nkilled almost 4 years ago. This was not something that we had thought \nabout really. It was not something that we had talked about as a \nfamily. When we were asked the question whether we would do this or \nnot, my wife, Fran, turned to me, and said, ``You know that is what \nBecky would have wanted us to do.'' So we did it.\n  I think, Mr. President, that most people would want their loved ones \nto do the same thing. Too often the survivors--people who are faced \nwith life's most horrible tragedy--just do not want to do it. They do \nnot know that the loved one would have wanted them to do it.\n\n  So I think by talking about this we will increase the number of \norgans that are available, and we will, in fact, save lives.\n  I think too often that the No. 1 obstacle to life-saving organ \ndonation is simply that lack of awareness. People simply aren't aware \nof the huge difference--the life-saving difference that they can make \nin someone else's life. They don't think about it. They don't talk \nabout it. And that is natural. But that is why the decision to donate \nthe organs of a loved one sometimes is a very difficult decision. But I \nthink when people talk about it that it will be made much easier.\n  As elected officials, we in this Chamber have another responsibility. \nI believe that we must take this message to the American people. \nEducational efforts have, of course, already begun.\n  Thanks to the leadership of our colleague, Senator Dorgan, \ninformation about organ donations is being enclosed with Federal income \ntax refunds that are going out this year. It is estimated that 70 \nmillion individuals will receive these refunds. So information \ncontained in those envelopes is going out.\n  Further, today I sent a letter to Postmaster General Runyon asking \nhim to approve a ``Gift of Life'' postage stamp as soon as possible. \nMr. President, I have been talking to the Postmaster General's office \nfor more than a year now about this issue because I am firmly convinced \nthat this stamp will remind people of the vital importance of organ \ndonation. It will save lives. It will bring about more awareness. Mr. \nPresident, anything that we can do to encourage families to discuss \nthis issue will, in fact, better prepare them to make this life-saving \ndecision.\n  Further, Mr. President, as you and other Members of the Chamber may \nknow, Senator Kennedy and Representative Moakley held a field hearing \nin Massachusetts on this very issue. I will hold a similar field \nhearing in Ohio this fall, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do \nthe same in their\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\nhome States, to bring this issue closer to home.\n  Recently, there has been a lot of publicity about organ donation--\npublicity specifically about controversial protocols that have been \nconsidered to enhance the viability of transplanted organs. I support \nan informed public dialog on this, or any other medical issue. As this \ndebate continues, however, Mr. President, we have to make sure that we \nkeep our eye on the ball, that we stay focused, and not lose sight of \nthe fact that organ donations save many thousands of lives each year in \nthis country, and that thousands of other Americans are still waiting \nfor this precious gift of life.\n  Mr. President, together we can build a national consensus to increase \nthe rate of organ donations. Seriously ill Americans who are on these \nwaiting lists should not have to wait so long for a second chance. They \nshould have a second chance. And I look forward to working with all of \nmy colleagues in the Senate and with people across this country to \nachieve this goal in the months ahead.\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, on this past Sunday, the Outlook section \nof the Washington Post published articles regarding Uncle Sam's red \nink. The unfortunate part is that these stories highlight is that debt \nis nothing new for the United States. While it is making us poor, one \narticle claims that is has made us prosperous.\n  I rise today to make the point that our debt is not only making us \nvery poor, it is making us totally inadequate at the governmental level \nin Washington, DC. All our moneys are being expended for interest costs \non the debt rather than active Government.\n  Specifically, I want to talk about the here and now rather than the \nnext millennium. Dick Morris detailed in his book, Mr. President, that \nhe had counseled President Clinton, running for reelection last year, \nthat the budget deficit was a boring subject. He claimed that nobody \nwas really interested in it and that the President should instead focus \non school uniforms and child curfews, family values and everything \nelse.\n  Mr. President, people are interested in the crushing burden of our \nfederal debt, and to show specifically what concerns them, I have a \nchart that I would refer to. It is in enlarged fashion. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we have printed in the Record at this particular point \nthis one budget document ``Hollings' Budget Realities.''\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           HOLLINGS' BUDGET REALITIES                                           \n

CBO's 1997 Economic and Budget      \n  Outlook--April 15, 1997.                                                                                      \n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the matter of the budget realities, I \nhave listed here beside the different Presidents from 1945 right on \nthrough President Clinton's first term including estimates for 1997--\nthe different years of the U.S. budget, the actual budget.\n  Incidentally, these are Congressional Budget Office figures. These \nare not tricky figures. They are the ones that we all rely upon.\n  Then I have listed the borrowed trust funds. That is all the trust \nfunds that are borrowed--not just Social Security but the military \nretirees trust funds, the civil service retirees trust funds--there is \nstill a surplus in the Medicare account--Medicare trust fund, the \nFederal finance bank, the moneys we have been using from the airport \nand airways improvement fund, the highway trust fund. You can go right \non down the different trust funds that are borrowed.\n  And then the unified deficit which is the real culprit here in this \nparticular budget fraud. I refer directly to the fraud that occurs when \nwe cannot get the truth out. That is the purpose of my rising again \ntoday, to somehow, somewhere, sometime talk the truth because it is not \nan accurate figure when you say unified. They say, well, that is the \nnet amount in and out. It is not net amount in and out. It is the \namount you borrow and you have to replace.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, being a certified public \naccountant, knows exactly what I am speaking about. If you were trying \nto use that unified deficit on your return, the borrowed moneys on \nApril 15, they would cart you off to jail. You are not allowed to do \nthat. But we do that in Washington, and then the media, the market, the \nGovernment and everyone else continue to cite the unified deficit as a \nsort of net figure as to what the real deficit is.\n  On the contrary, the real or actual deficit is listed in the next \ncolumn with the national debt going up and the annual increase in the \namount of spending in order to take care of the interest costs.\n  So I will be glad to show this particular chart in an enlarged \nmanner. What we have here, Mr. President, is again the Presidents. You \nhave the years. You have the United States budget, the actual budget, \nthe borrowed trust funds, the unified deficit with trust funds. Then \nthe actual deficit without trust funds. That is without the borrowings, \nwhat the actual deficit is.\n  Those are the terms upon which we must speak. If we are going to \ncontinue to talk of a unified net kind of deficit, which is not net, \nthe fraud will continue. There is not any question in my mind that \ntaxes are too high. But taxes are too high because of the interest cost \non the national debt.\n  All you need do is go to look at our actual interest costs, let us \nsay, before President Reagan came in, just a few short years ago. The \ninterest costs in 1980, going straight across, are $74.8 billion. Well, \nthat is $74.8 or $75 billion. You now in 1997 have listed $360 billion. \nWe have increased spending $285 billion for nothing. You are not \ngetting a road paved. You are not getting a library built. You are not \ngetting research over at the National Cancer Institute. You are not \nproviding for a stronger defense. You are not engaging more in foreign \nassistance or anything else of that kind. You are getting absolutely \nnothing for the past profligacy and waste.\n  Bottom line. The crowd that came to town in 1981, against taxes and \nagainst waste, has taxes on automatic pilot, waste on automatic pilot \nof $1 billion a day.\n  Now, let me say that one more time. At $360 billion--this figure, of \ncourse, is the January figure from the Congressional Budget Office, and \nit does not take into account the recent increase in interest rates by \nAlan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve. So that is bound to be at least \n365.\n  So we have interest payments, that is, annual increases in spending \non interest that total $1 billion a day. And it has to be paid just \nlike taxes. It is not like increases in other spending which we could \nforego, but it has to be paid. So that is why I categorically say the \ncrowd that said they were going to come to town in the early 1980's and \ndo away with taxes have put taxes on an automatic pilot of $1 billion a \nday.\n\n  The crowd that came in town in 1981 and said they were going to be \nagainst waste, fraud and abuse--and I was appointed on the Grace \nCommission, got an award for it and recognition. It was a wonderful \ninstrumentality that went through the Government and tried to cut out \nall the waste. But we have really increased the waste because we get \nabsolutely nothing for it.\n  Now, we increased spending since 1980 by $285 billion. If we had not \ndone that, we would have $285 billion here for us to sit around in the \nSenate Chamber and spend or give back to the American people. It would \nbe a wonderful thing. We could get all the highways. We wouldn't have \nany ISTEA bill. We could take care of all the demonstration projects \nyou could possibly imagine. We could go ahead with star wars \nimmediately. We could have all these things that they want for \neducation, student loans and everything else. But instead, we are \nspending the money and not getting anything for it.\n  That is the cancer that we have in the fiscal affairs of the U.S. \nGovernment that is totally obscured by news articles like those that \nclaim to show how debt has made us prosperous, like all we have to do \nis borrow again and that debt has always been with us.\n  Well, Mr. President, it has not been with us all the time for the \nsimple reason you can see that when President Reagan came to town--we \nhave it here--the national debt was $994.8 billion. When President \nReagan came to town, after 204 years of history, after 38 Presidents, \nRepublican and Democrat, after the cost of all the wars, the \nRevolutionary, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Mexican War, the \nSpanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the \ncost of all the wars never gave a national debt of $1 trillion. It was \nless than $1 trillion after 204 years of history. But in 16 years \nwithout a war, because the cost of the war in Desert Storm was paid for \nby the Saudis and others, so in 16 years without the cost of a war, we \nhave gone from less than $1 trillion to almost $5.5 trillion. Up, up, \nand away with the interest costs, interest spending, interest taxes \ngoing up, up and away and added to the debt to the tune of $1 billion a \nday and we never want to seem to recognize that.\n  Right to the point, Mr. President. If you take all the deficits from \nPresident Truman, the actual deficits and average them out right on \ndown to President Reagan, 25 years, if you took all those deficits, the \naverage would be about $20 billion a year.\n  Now, in contrast, take the deficits for the last 16 years without the \ncost of a war, without the so-called guns and butter, as they say; but \nrather, with spending cuts of President Reagan for 8 years, spending \ncuts of President Bush for 4 years, spending cuts of President Clinton, \nbecause he brought the deficit down--his 1993 plan included $500 \nbillion in deficit reduction. Even with all the cuts, we have been \ngiving an average deficit each year to the American people of $277 \nbillion more in Government than we are willing to pay for. Let us not \njust talk abstractly about a deficit. We are actually giving away $277 \nbillion more in Government than we are actually willing to pay for.\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n  Let us go to just last year and the campaign, when both Senator Dole \nand President Clinton used $107 billion, the unified deficit figure, \nlike it was net. That was not the case at all. In order to get to a \n$107 billion deficit, they had to borrow from all the pension funds. \nWhy not borrow another $107 billion and call it balanced? The actual \ndeficit was $261 billion. You could not get that cited or printed in \nthe press. We gave it to them time and time again. We will give it to \nthem again this morning. I defy you to find it in the morning paper or \ncited in the evening news on TV. They do not want to say what the \nactual deficit is. They want to use this obscure figure of unified, \ntrying to act like we ought to be encouraged. That is why they are \ngetting together on a budget deal. They will get together on a deal \nthat will obscure truth in budgeting.\n  This fraud has to stop somehow, somewhere, because it is not a bridge \nto the next millennium. We are going over a cliff by the year 2000. Our \ndomestic budget is $266 billion. Our defense budget is $267 billion. \nThose two budgets together are slightly over $500 billion. But you will \nsoon have interest costs exceeding the combined cost of both the \ndomestic and defense budgets. We are not building a bridge, we are \ndigging a hole.\n  The first order of business, they say, when you are in a hole and you \nare trying to get out, is stop digging. We continue to dig, and we do \nit in a dignified fashion around here and praise each other. The \nPresident and the Congress have gotten together on a budget agreement \nand all of that kind of stuff. But watch for the gimmicks in it.\n  The biggest gimmick that is never talked about is the fact people \nconsistently obscure the actual size of the deficit. To get it down to \n$254 billion, we still have to find $110 billion, that is without any \ncuts, just continuing what we call current policy. I sat at the budget \ntable today to try to get to a budget now of $1.632 trillion. That is \ncurrent policy. That is domestic of $266 billion, defense of $267 \nbillion, entitlements of $859 billion. That is $1.382 trillion. Just \nput in the minimal figure $360 billion, that is $1.742 trillion. To \nbring it down, then, to the $1.632 trillion, I have to find $110 \nbillion. I have to cut entitlements, domestic, defense combined $110 \nbillion.\n  That is my job, conscientiously going to the budget table to sit as a \nmember of the Budget Committee, where I have been since we instituted \nthe budget process in 1974. But, instead of discussing the cuts and how \nare we going to get on top of this downward spiral of interest costs or \ninterest taxes being increased $1 billion a day, instead of that, we \nare getting letters now to do away with the inheritance tax. We are \ngetting letters now to do away with the capital gains tax. We are \ngetting letters now from Steve Forbes and that other crowd: Let's just \nget a flat tax and do away with the IRS, the Internal Revenue System, \nand everything else of that kind.\n  Mr. President, we ought to understand once and for all that we are \nengaged in a fraud that continues to be obscured, due to the fourth \nestate. The fourth estate has taken it on as a religion, almost, of \nreciting the unified deficit as if it were the actual deficit. The \ntruth of the matter is, the actual deficit is substantially more. It \nhas averaged $277 billion last year, the year before, and the last 16 \nyears. We have been giving out some $277 billion in Government that we \nare not willing to pay for.\n  We had that Reaganomics. Yes, there is even talk about that--cut \ntaxes and we will get growth, we will grow out of deficits. No mayor in \nhis right mind of a city tries that. No Governor in her right mind has \ntried that. There was an exception up in New Jersey. Governor Whitman \nup there said, ``Whoa, tax cuts work.'' But look at the papers last \nweek. She is now doing two things. She is borrowing, raiding the \npension funds, just like we are doing in Washington. She has learned \nfrom Washington. And she is calling for a bond issue to cover her \nfinancial situation. It does not work.\n  There is no free lunch. Long since, we should have understood it. If \nI have to come every day and point this out, I will because these facts \nand figures are not disputable. They are not political. They are not \nDemocratic figures or Republican figures. These are Congressional \nBudget Office figures. That is the actual debt that has gone to exceed \n$5 trillion.\n  I see from the Presiding Officer that my time is just about up. Let \nme just say one word. I thank the distinguished Chair and the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia for indulging me just one second \nmore.\n  What we have is a fraud on the American public. We have to expose \nthis fraud. We have to speak to truth in budgeting. We have to come up \nwith an actual plan that will eliminate this deficit financing by \nraiding the trust funds in America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3400-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3402-S3408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LABOR LAW CHANGES BY EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as many of us in the Congress and in \nthe country began to realize last week, the President and the \nadministration are endeavoring to change 60 years of labor law by edict \nor decree. I spoke on the floor and reminded the administration we do \nnot govern by decree in America. We have three branches. A major and \nfundamental change in labor law must be legislated. The President can \nsign or veto it, but he cannot write law. That is not a function of the \nPresidency.\n  I will probably visit some of these documents in a bit, but published \nreports show that labor leaders and the administration wrote the law \nthat would essentially squeeze out all nonunion subcontractors and \nemployees from doing work on Federal contracts. It is a lot more \ncomplicated than that, but that is the bottom line. So this law was \nwritten somewhere in the offices of these labor leaders. It is the \nfundamental construction of what the administration purports will be an \nExecutive order, bypassing the legislative branch and writing law in a \nvery narrow confine.\n\n  You know, our forefathers were very careful in the construction of \nthis Government to assure proper airing, thorough venting, debate on \nall sides. It is not easy to pass laws in America. It is not meant to \nbe easy. The very thing for which this system was constructed was to \nprevent the very thing we are seeing from the administration.\n  I would like to begin our discussion on this by sharing with the \nSenate several letters that I have received from folks back home with \nregard to this.\n  Here is a letter dated March 13, 1997, from Large & Gilbert, \ncertified public accountants. They are located in Macon, GA. It says:\n\n       Dear President Clinton: I am writing this letter to express \n     my outrage regarding comments made by Vice President Gore in \n     a speech to the AFL-CIO in Los Angeles on February 18, 1997. \n     Vice President Gore announced the Administration's plans to \n     change the nation's federal procurement policy through an \n     Executive Order that would encourage union-only project labor \n     agreements.\n       An Executive Order encouraging union-only PLAs would \n     immediately implement an anti-competitive, protectionist, and \n     discriminatory policy that goes against the basic principles \n     of free market, open competition, and equal opportunity upon \n     which the country was founded.\n       Greater use of union-only PLAs will threaten job \n     opportunities for the vast majority of America's workers. \n     Union-only agreements discourage bidding by open shop, or \n     merit shop, contractors and limit employment opportunities \n     for workers who do not wish to be represented by a union. \n     Union workers are less than 15 percent of America's work \n     force. This kind of union-favoring tactic discriminates \n     against the majority of American workers who choose not to \n     join a union.\n       PLAs add significantly to the cost of construction \n     projects, because union labor costs are generally 10 to 20 \n     percent higher than merit shop. Competitive bidding on public \n     projects is in the best interest of all taxpayers because it \n     ensures contracts are awarded based on who will do the best \n     work at the best price, regardless of labor affiliation.\n\n  And I might add that Georgia is one of about half the States that is \na right-to-work State.\n\n       At a time of strict budgetary constraints, PLAs are \n     certainly a step in the wrong direction.\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\n       Vice President Gore stated, ``If you want to do business \n     with the federal government, you'd better. . .respect civil, \n     [no one would take offense with that] human [no one would be \n     offended by that] and [here is the kicker] union rights.''\n\n  In other words, if you want to do business with the Federal \nGovernment, the Vice President said, you better be in a union, you \nbetter point your direction toward a union or union membership or a \nunion contract.\n\n       Unions do not have the basic right to preferential \n     treatment.\n\n  That is what this gentlemen said. The union does not have the basic \nright to preferential treatment. They have equal access, but they do \nnot have preferential access.\n\n       Every American has the right to make a living and have \n     equal access to federal work, regardless of organizational \n     membership.\n\n  How right he is.\n\n       No one's tax dollars should be spent to support \n     discriminatory federal policies [or Federal policies that \n     select who among the bidders would have the most opportunity \n     to get the work].\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Americans should at a minimum be guaranteed federal \n     policies that support equal opportunity and free enterprises \n     at the most basic level. Every American deserves the \n     opportunity to compete, win and execute work based on merit--\n     not because of race, gender, union affiliation, or any other \n     discriminatory factor. It is not the role of the federal \n     government to put our taxpayer dollars toward guaranteeing \n     work for the unions or to help them increase their market \n     share and membership.\n       Vice President Gore's blanket statement promising a \n     presidential veto of any legislation the unions find \n     objectionable, without any consideration of improvements to \n     workplace opportunities, is an outrage. Americans would be \n     better served by an Administration that supports efforts to \n     improve fair, flexible and equal workplace opportunities that \n     will help make companies and workers more competitive.\n       America has always been a leader for the rest of the world \n     in the areas of a free market and equal opportunity, and this \n     has always been a point of pride for our country. Please take \n     the contents of this letter into account before making any \n     Executive Order that would jeopardize the American peoples \n     belief in our country, and the principles upon which it \n     stands.\n\n  That is Thomas K. Savage of Large & Gilbert, an accounting firm in \nMacon, GA.\n  Some of these letters are very interesting and deserve a standing in \nthe Record.\n\n  This is a letter from W.S. Nielsen Co., Inc. Skylight Systems, \nAlpharetta, GA, writing to the President. He says:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: Our small family owned business has \n     grown over the last sixteen years to where it directly \n     supports over 15 families.\n\n  That is not a big company. It is awful big to the 15 families, I \nmight point out, though.\n\n       We have worked hard to train all our staff to be the best \n     and safest in our field. Ours is a dangerous business. Our \n     staff has earned an excellent reputation with our customers, \n     many of whom work on federal and state construction projects.\n       Your signing an executive order to use union-only project \n     labor agreements is not fair to the families associated with \n     our company. You are depriving them of work that their tax \n     dollars are paying for and depriving fellow taxpayers of \n     highly skilled craftsmen.\n       Our employees believe that Americans should be guaranteed \n     federal policy that support equal opportunity and free \n     enterprise. They have earned the right to compete on a level \n     field for any work they are qualified for. A union-only \n     agreement has been earned in all the cheap ways to the \n     detriment of all involved.\n       All of us strongly urge you to cease your plans to issue \n     the proposed executive order.\n\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by the chairman of the Labor \nCommittee, Senator Jeffords of Vermont. I would like to yield up to 10 \nminutes to the Senator for comment on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to raise my concerns also as \nexpressed by the Senator from Georgia. I rise to express my continuing \nand growing concerns regarding the efforts of President Clinton and his \nadministration to bypass Congress and impose the ultimate in top-down \nunion organizing--union organizing by the President of the United \nStates--on Federal construction projects. I am speaking, of course, of \nthe widely circulated draft of a proposed Executive order that would \nresult in most, if not all, federally funded construction being \nperformed under a union project labor agreement.\n  A project labor agreement would deter a major portion of the \ncontractor universe--open shop or nonunion contractors--from bidding on \nconstruction work paid for by American taxpayers. Because the project \nlabor agreement adopted pursuant to the proposed Executive order would \nrequire a contractor to enter into an agreement with a labor union as a \ncondition of bidding on the Federal project, most open shop \ncontractors, unwilling to impose a union on themselves and their \nemployees, simply would not submit a bid. Thus, the union-only project \nlabor agreement not only eliminates open competition for Federal \ncontracts, an anticompetitive effect that would result in increased \ncosts of Federal construction to the taxpayers, but also discourages \nopen shop contractors from bidding on work that they are paying for \nwith their own tax dollars.\n  In addition to its anticompetitive impact, the proposed Executive \norder also would deprive nonunion workers of jobs in Federal \nconstruction, again jobs paid for out of those workers' wallets. Union \nagreements invariably require job seekers to obtain work through a \nunion hiring hall. Hiring hall referral traditions favor longstanding \nunion members. Others, such as the nonunion workers of the open shop \ncontractor, would find themselves at the end of the referral line. This \nExecutive order would penalize the overwhelming majority--majority--of \nconstruction workers in this country, who have not chosen to be union \nmembers.\n\n  The proposed Executive order clearly is an effort by the \nadministration to set national labor policy, a job that is delegated to \nthe Congress by the Constitution--by the Constitution--of the United \nStates and not to the President. The wisdom of this delegation of \npolicymaking to the legislative process by the drafters of the \nConstitution is proven in the matter before us. The proposed Executive \norder raises many more questions than it answers, questions, I note, \nthat, if subjected to the debate and factfinding of the legislative \nprocess, could be resolved.\n  For example, what is the effect of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, the ERISA, on a project labor agreement's provision that \nwould require an open shop contractor to participate in a union pension \nplan? The contractor likely covers its employees in another plan, and \nthe contractor's employees probably would receive no benefits from the \nunion pension plan because they would not be vested before the \ncompletion of the federally funded project.\n  Another example of a question best addressed by congressional review \nis whether the anticompetitive and overly restrictive provisions of the \nproposed order violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the Federal \nAcquisition Reform Act of 1996, just recently passed.\n  The proposed Executive order, however, raises even more fundamental \nquestions regarding the continued vitality of our national labor policy \nthat provides for Federal Government neutrality in matters of labor-\nmanagement relations, a longstanding policy. This neutrality has been \nat the core of the national policy since the passage of the Wagner Act \nback in 1935. The administration, without the benefit of studied review \nand debate inherent in the legislative process, would reverse this \npolicy and ignore the over 60 years--over 60 years--of its fine tuning \nby Congress and the courts. The administration's approach, that of \nlawmaking by Executive fiat, would answer these, and other questions \nposed by the Executive order, by litigation, not legislation.\n  I expressed my strong support for S. 606, a bill introduced by \nSenator Hutchinson, that would prevent the exclusion of nonunion \ncontractors from federally funded construction. I note that I am a \ncosponsor of this bill and look forward to its deliberation in the \nmanner established by the Constitution.\n  I urge my colleagues to take note of what is going on. This is a \ngross example of the abuse of the authority of the President through \nthe Executive order. He tried this before. The courts knocked it down \nwith respect to striker replacement. Here they come again with another \nproposal.\n\n  This is extremely important for contractors, for the Nation, and for \nthe taxpayer. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for his \ncomments and extensive work in this\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\narena. I want to compliment him on the statement he made last week, a \nvery thorough description and outline of this circumstance. I think the \nSenator has done the debate a great service. The letter of you and your \ncolleagues on the Labor and Human Resources Committee that was sent to \nthe President was a noteworthy contribution to the debate.\n  I will read one more letter for the Record, Peachtree Interior \nBuilders, another letter dated March 27, to the President:\n\n       The purpose of this letter is to voice my opposition to \n     your proposed Executive order to require Federal agencies to \n     use union-only project labor agreements on Federal \n     construction projects. This order would eliminate the \n     possibility of thousands of contractors like myself from \n     bidding on Federal projects. As a contractor and a taxpayer I \n     would expect a level playing field on government contracts so \n     everyone would have the opportunity to compete, win, and \n     execute work based on merit. The 50 families that derive all \n     or part of their livelihood from this company should be given \n     the opportunity to compete on any government project, \n     regardless of their union affiliation, race, gender, or any \n     other discriminatory factor.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is somewhat useful to try to put this \ndebate in context. I go back to Tuesday, February 18, of this year, \nwhen the Office of the Vice President issued a press release. It says: \n``For immediate release, Tuesday, February 18, 1997.''\n  Vice President Gore Sends Message to Businesses.\n  ``Record of Labor Relations and Employment Practice Counts in \nContracting.\n  ``In remarks to the AFL-CIO Executive Council, Vice President Gore \ntoday pledged that the Federal Government will change its rules''--now \nthat is a key sentence--``will change its rules on Federal contracting \nto take into account businesses' record of labor relations on \nemployment practices and policies.''\n  So, the Vice President, speaking to the AFL-CIO Council says, ``The \nFederal Government is going to change its rules.'' What he did not say \nwas the President is going to change the rules arbitrarily, by decree, \nby edict, by fiat, as the Senator from Vermont said. To change the \nlabor rules, which have been a condition of law for the last 60 years, \nrequires a legislative act and not a decree.\n  He goes on to say, ``How you treat your employees and how you treat \nunions counts with us. If you want to do business with the Federal \nGovernment you'd better maintain a safe workplace,''--everyone would \nagree with that--``respect civil, human''--everybody agrees with \nthat,--``and union rights.''\n  Well, that is not the law. You are not obligated to join a union in \nthe United States.\n  ``The Vice President said the old rules,'' what he means is the old \nlaw ``allowed Federal contractors to get reimbursed for the costs of \ntrying to persuade employees not to join unions and fighting unfair \nlabor practices allegations. `But today we are going to start changing \nthe rules because they're just plain wrong.' ''\n  They may be, they may not be. But the way you change the law is in \nthe legislative branch. You do not do it because of your own opinion.\n  Shortly thereafter, on March 10, about 4 weeks later, lo and behold, \nJohn Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, issues a press statement that \nsays ``Sweeney Blasts Avondale''--that is a shipbuilding company.\n\n       In the four years since Avondale Shipyard workers won a \n     union election, management has waged a . . . campaign of \n     firings, discriminatory layoffs and legal challenges.\n\n  In other words, they have been in a battle.\n\n       Today, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney met with the workers \n     at the New Orleans shipyard and calls on Avondale management \n     to end its attack. He will remind Avondale, which receives \n     Federal funds, that two weeks ago Vice President Gore said \n     companies doing business with the government must respect . . \n     . union rights.\n\n  So the Vice President makes his statement. They have said they will \nchange the rules. I am here to tell you, ``You better pay attention to \nme'' is what John Sweeney is saying.\n  We have been joined by the senior Senator from Texas who wants to \nspeak on this matter. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first congratulate our distinguished \ncolleague from Georgia for his leadership on this issue. I came over \ntoday to speak on this subject because I think this is a very serious \nmatter. It behooves us, and it is in the interests of the American \npeople on issues like this, to speak before the President acts, rather \nthan to wait for the action to occur and then complain about it.\n  I want to be very emphatic today on this issue because I think this \nis a fundamentally important issue. First of all, the Constitution is \nvery clear in article 1 that Congress shall have the power to make law. \nNow, granted, within the parameters prescribed by law, the President \nhas the ability, through Executive power, to implement those laws, and \nhas from time to time used Executive orders to implement the laws \npassed by Congress and enacted by the President's signature.\n  Many of you will recall that 2 years ago the President attempted to \nput into operation by Executive order a provision that had already been \nrejected by Congress. Though it is a very important issue, the \nprinciple is what I want to deal with today.\n  Basically, Congress had refused to pass a law that said that if \nworkers refuse to work, the employer could not hire other workers to \ntake their place. I never viewed that issue as a labor-management \nissue. I always viewed it as a freedom issue, as I believe most \nAmericans do. Simply stated, I have a right, if I do not want to work \nfor you, to quit. If I want to stop supplying my labor, or in concert \nwith others, stop supplying my labor, I have a right to strike. But you \nhave rights, too. One of those rights is hiring somebody else who is \nwilling to work.\n  After an extended debate, the Congress refused to enact a law denying \nemployers the right to hire other people when their current workers \nrefuse to work and a strike drags on and on. The President, by \nExecutive order, tried to do what Congress had refused to do, by \nmandating that companies not be permitted to replace striking workers. \nThe courts properly stepped in and said that the President had \noverstepped his bounds and had no authority to make such law by \nExecutive order. In fact, Congress had already refused on exactly that \nsame subject to take legislative action.\n  If we can believe what the Vice President has said in a speech before \nthe AFL-CIO, it appears that the President is about to do the same \nthing again. Now, he is going to try to do it a little bit differently. \nHe is going to allow the individual Federal departments and agencies to \ntake action if they choose. The net result is that through Executive \norder, the President is going to be violating the constitutional powers \nof Congress. This Executive order has been alluded to before, but what \nit boils down to is this: If the President goes ahead with his \nExecutive order, he is going to be saying that in order to bid on a \ncontract, a company is going to have to hire union workers.\n  Now, 89.1 percent of all private workers in America are not members \nof unions. So what this Executive order would do is say to almost 90 \npercent of American workers in the private sector of the economy, ``You \ncan't work on a Federal Government contract. You are precluded because \nyou are not part of a privileged group empowered by the President to \nhave rights beyond anybody else's rights. That is, you are not a member \nof a labor union.''\n  Now, Mr. President, if the President's Executive order and \nnew regulations went forward we would mandate union representation of \nall workers on all Government projects. We would mandate that all \nworkers on all Government construction projects be hired out of union \nhalls. We would require that all workers on Government construction \nprojects pay union dues. We would eliminate competition. Mr. President, \n89.1 percent of all American workers would be precluded from working on \ncontracts funded by their tax dollars. Finally, we would impose on \ncontractors doing work for the Federal Government union rules, \nincluding restrictive rules that limit the ability of workers to carry \nout their functions officially. So the first thing the President's \norder would do is say to 89 percent of all workers in America, ``You \ncan't do work for the Federal Government on contracts.''\n\n  Second, if the current contractors switched and required mandatory \nunion membership by their workers, the President's proposed Executive\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\norder, in one swoop, would increase the number of people who are \nmembers of unions by at least 13 million members. Let me repeat that: \nIf the President's Executive order is put into place and it stands, and \nif existing contractors, rather than lose their livelihoods and \nbusinesses, employers would be forced to say OK, we will pay tribute \nand force our workers to join unions whether they want to join and pay \ndues for services they do not want or not. That one action alone would \nmandate at least 13 million people to pay tribute and earnings to \norganizations they have chosen not to join.\n  That does not sound like America to me. I have a right to join a \nunion. I have always supported that right. But I also have a right not \nto join a union. And I ought to have a right not to join a union and \nstill do contract work for the Federal Government, which is run in \nsmall part by my taxes.\n  As my final point, if the President puts this Executive order and new \nregulations into effect, and we are then forced to pay union scale on \nevery construction project undertaken on behalf of the taxpayers, it \nwill add 17 to 21 percent to the cost of Federal projects, according to \nthe General Accounting Office, which is the accounting arm of the \nCongress and the Federal Government. The President's Executive order \nand new regulations would add $42 billion of additional expenses on the \nbacks of the American taxpayers.\n  So what the President proposes to do by Executive order, in summary, \nis deem 89.8 percent of Americans ineligible to work on Government \ncontracts. And at least 13 million Americans, if they choose to work on \nGovernment contracts, would be forced into involuntary union \nmembership. Finally, the taxpayer would be forced to pay union wage \nlevels higher than the level typically paid in the private sector and \noften above the level paid to many people who are paying the taxes that \nfund the project.\n  Now, I wanted to make two points today, and then I will yield the \nfloor. First, this is a terrible Executive order. This seems to be \nlittle more than political payoff. Those are strong words to say on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate, but it is hard to find any other \njustification or any other rationalization for barring almost 90 \npercent of American workers from working on contracts for their \nGovernment, mandating that at least 13 million people join a union they \ndo no want to join, and paying an additional $42 billion per year in \nnew labor costs. If that does not give the appearance of a political \npayoff, I would like to know what does. It is hard to think of any \nother explanation.\n  Second, and probably the most important point that I want to make, is \nthat sometimes things occur between branches of Government that create \nill feeling and hinder the ability to engage in bipartisanship. They \nmake it more difficult for us to do our job. If the President follows \nthrough with his Executive order, it will seriously jeopardize \nbipartisanship cooperation in this Congress. There is no way we could \nlet this stand and little possibility that we could act as if nothing \nhad changed when our very powers prescribed in article I of the \nConstitution are being usurped by the President. It difficult to \nimagine us acting as though we simply disagree with each other and then \ngo on working together hand-in-hand doing whatever we might be doing. \nThere is little chance of that happening.\n  Our message today is a warning to the President: Mr. President, don't \ndo this. This is wrong for America. If you do this, it is going to be \nvery difficult for us to work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nPresident. I am going to yield to the Senator from North Carolina for \nup to 10 minutes. I thank him personally for his extended work and \ncontributions in the formulation of the Right to Work Act, which has \nnow been introduced. He has a long, long record in this arena. I \nwelcome him to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am here today to join the Senator \nfrom Georgia in letting the American people know what a costly and \ndangerous paragraph the President of this country has proposed on \nbehalf of the labor unions, its bosses. What I am referring to is the \nPresident's Executive order, first announced to great applause by Vice \nPresident Gore before a recent gathering of union bosses. It would \nforce all contractors doing business with the Federal Government to be \nunionized. To be specific, Clinton has issued an Executive order in \ndraft form--he hasn't issued the order--which would require that \nanybody that sells goods to the Federal Government become a party to a \nlabor agreement--in plain language, become a unionized closed-shop \ncompany. These agreements are nothing more than a clever device \nproposed and written by the union bosses that all contractors would \nhave to be unionized if you do business with the Federal Government.\n  Now, this is a union-only mandate for anyone who sells to the Federal \nGovernment. But that isn't as far as it goes--not by a long way. These \nagreements would force the contractor to have a union, but, in turn, it \nwould force anybody he buys from to have a union. Anybody that sold him \na pencil would have to be a union contractor, if it were going to be \nused in Government business. So 13 million people, as Senator Gramm \nsaid, would be forced to join unions. But I think it would run a lot \nmore than that because this thing goes to the ultimate end of who would \nhave to join the union. Big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to \nbite them, and little fleas have lesser fleas. So this would go down to \nthe ultimate end of who would have to join a union to comply with this \nproposed order.\n  Now, Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said, ``In any given year, \nFederal contracts total as much as $200 billion, and Federal \ncontractors employ one-fifth of the Nation's work force.'' And with \ngreat glee, he says, ``If properly implemented . . .''--referring to \nPresident Clinton's order--``. . . it would affect hundreds of billions \nof dollars every year.'' What he could have said and didn't say, but \nwas thinking, is: Think of the money that it will bring into the unions \nand how much more money we will have to play with.\n  What we are talking about is the President, by the stroke of a pen, \nchanging the laws of this country. Government contracts have always \nbeen awarded on the basis of the low bidder and the company that was \ncapable of doing the job. Unions have never held a special claim to \nGovernment contracts. But, under this, everybody else would be excluded \nand the unions would be totally in charge.\n  What we are saying is that all of the $200 billion the Federal \nGovernment spends would go to 20 percent of the work force, or probably \na much smaller percentage than that; probably closer to 10 percent of \nthe work force in this country is unionized. And to the other 85 to 90 \npercent, we would say: Tough luck, you simply don't qualify. You pay \nthe taxes and keep working, but any Government contracts will go to \nunion members only.\n  Now, the General Accounting Office has said that union labor will run \nthe price of a contract up 20 percent or more. I think they, very \nsimply, underestimated the amount. That is certainly a low figure, that \n20 percent of the cost will be added to every Federal contract because \nof this requirement.\n  I am troubled by the fact that no committee of Congress has had the \nopportunity to review proposed language. There have been no hearings. \nNone of the millions and millions--13 million-plus--of American workers \nwho are going to be affected by this mandate have had an opportunity--\nor their representatives--to be heard on it. The President has shown no \ninterest in the American people or in what they think. He is simply \nputting a proposal up as a payback to the unions. It is just simply \nthat. He has not submitted it to Congress, and from what it would \nappear, he doesn't plan to. If he wants to do it, this is the place he \nneeds to do it--bring it before the Congress and then see what happens \nto it. It would pass through the normal checks and balances between the \nCongress and the administration. The Congress is bypassed and this \nwould impose unions on businesses across the country, without the \nAmerican people or the Congress having anything to say about it.\n  As the Senator from Georgia has so eloquently stated, in America, we \ndidn't elect a President to rule by decree. My State of North Carolina \nis a right-to-work State. I am sure that nonunion employees in North \nCarolina would be forced to become unionized\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nbecause of what the President has done. They would have to join a \nunion. I understand that the checks and balances may be inconvenient to \nthe President. He would rather do it by decree. But that system has \nserved us well--the system of checks and balances--for over 200 years. \nThe proposed Executive order is a payback to the labor union bosses, \nwho spent hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of the President in \nlast year's election, and who do not want to subject their plans for \nAmerican workers and employers to congressional scrutiny. They know it \nwould lose in the Congress.\n\n  I am opposed to compulsory unionism. No worker should be forced to \njoin a union, and no employer should be forced by the Federal \nGovernment to be unionized as a condition of doing business with the \nFederal Government--particularly, not by an Executive decree that has \nnever seen the light of day in the Congress of the United States, or \ngiven the Members of the Congress an opportunity to oppose it or to \nspeak on it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from the time \ncontrolled by the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of the Senator \nfrom Georgia in bringing to light an important issue that this Congress \nclearly needs to examine and examine quickly.\n  Two basic problems exist with the President's attempt to unilaterally \noverturn a 50-year-old law. The first is that it usurps the very \nfunction of the legislative branch, and appears to be a payoff, a \npayoff to a special interest group--big labor.\n  The President, knowing that he can't secure the support of a majority \nof the Congress, simply decides to bypass the Congress. I think it is a \npure usurpation of the role of the legislative branch. Second, it will \ncost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions, in \nadditional expenses. To mandate that each agency seeking to contract \nwith the Government needs to get big labor's seal of approval before \nmaking a contract award clearly is going to add substantial cost to \nFederal construction and to Federal contracting.\n  If the Clinton administration wants to change the laws governing the \nawards of Federal contracts, it ought to have the courage to send the \nlegislative changes to this Congress for consideration. If then it can \nmake the case to the American people that the changes are justified, so \nbe it. But it is simply unacceptable for the President to cut a deal \nwith a special interest group that has been supportive of him \npolitically, with such a deal having tremendous ramifications for the \nAmerican economy and, arguably, circumventing the law. We simply cannot \nallow this kind of power grab to go unchecked.\n\n                            inheritance tax\n\n  Mr. President, I also want to bring to the attention of the Senate an \nitem that I found this morning in the Washington Post. I got up \nthinking it was going to be a good morning, poured myself a cup of \ncoffee, got out the Post and the Washington Times, and was thumbing \nthrough and happened to come across a headline that certainly grabbed \nmy attention. The Post article, written by Clay Chandler says, \n``Treasury Official Slams Estate Tax Rollback Effort. Changes Sought as \nPart of Budget Pact.'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, senior \nmember of the Clinton administration, and someone whom the Post says is \nclearly becoming one of the key players in the President's economic \nagenda, and certainly in the budget discussions, has indicated that the \nefforts to roll back the inheritance tax as part of this year's budget \nagreement is ``motivated by selfishness.'' He goes on to say, ``When it \ncomes to the estate tax, there is no case other than selfishness'' for \nproviding relief to families from this death tax. Further, he asserts \nthat the evidence put forth in support of repealing the burdensome tax \n``is about as bad as it gets.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to review for the Senate the evidence \nthat currently exists about the effect of this so-called inheritance or \ndeath tax and let the Members of the Senate and the public decide \nwhether or not this is ``as bad as it gets'' or is ``selfishness'' on \nthe part of the American people.\n  Currently the death tax would take as much as 55 to 60 percent of a \nsmall business owner's assets at death. Whether you are a farmer who \nhas worked for years to build an estate, a small businessman, or an \nindividual who has worked successfully and achieved some success and \nself-reliance and prudence in terms of how you use your money, or are \nsomeone who has planned for the future, upon death the family will find \nitself in a very unseemly situation, one that requires, immediately \nafter the funeral, that the family move right on down to the IRS office \nto try to figure out how to deal with the extraordinarily difficult \nproblem; that is, the Federal inheritance tax, or the so-called death \ntax.\n  It is particularly difficult for those who have run a farm, those who \nhave run a small business, those individuals who have paid a great \nprice, and at great sacrifice, to accumulate some degree of wealth, to \npass it on to the family. Clearly, the situation that exists today is \nthat in many cases the farm or the business has to be sold instead of \npassed on through the family from generation after generation just to \ngarner the funds necessary to pay the estate tax. When you are paying a \n55 percent to 60 percent rate, it usually forces the sale of a \nparticular business.\n  The White House Conference on Small Business indicated that 70 \npercent of all family businesses do not survive through the second \ngeneration, and 87 percent do not make it to a third generation. The \nreason for this is pretty simple. The primary cause of the demise of \nfamily farms and businesses after the death of a founder and the \nfounder's spouse is the death tax.\n  When a tax can take more than half of the current valuation of the \nassets--many of these assets are invested in machinery, in buildings, \nin land, and in farm equipment, and the tax is more than half of that \ntotal valuation--very few families have the liquid assets available to \npay the immediate tax and, therefore, have to liquidate the farm, have \nto sell off acreage, sell the entire farm, sell off the business, or \nsell ownership in the business, and it can't be passed on to the \nfamily.\n  Recently the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that between \nthe years 1992 and 2002, more than 500,000 farmers will retire and that \n95 percent of these farms are sole proprietorships, or family \npartnerships, and that every one of these estates, unless they are \nunder a very low threshold, are subject to death taxes.\n  On average, 75 percent of the farms in America today consist of \nnonliquid assets, such as I mentioned--real estate and farm equipment--\nmaking payment of the death tax extraordinarily difficult to achieve \nwithout liquidating capital.\n\n  For small business owners, 33 percent report that they expect all or \npart of their businesses will be liquidated when death taxes come due.\n  Among a survey of black-owner enterprises, nearly one-third say their \nheirs will have to sell the business to pay the death tax, and more \nthan 80 percent report that they do not have sufficient assets to pay \nthe death tax.\n  If that wasn't bad enough, look at the average cost of just paying \nthose taxes. The average family business spends nearly $20,000 in legal \nfees, $12,000 in accounting fees, and $11,000 for other advisers in \norder to do the paperwork and the processing to compute the tax and to \nsell the necessary assets to pay the death tax.\n  Mr. President, the point here is not how many examples we can give of \n``bad and selfish'' evidence that Mr. Summers cited. I don't think any \nof this could be categorized as ``bad and selfish'' evidence. That \ndoesn't serve the point to castigate Mr. Summers. The bottom line is \nthat the Congress owes it to all Americans, and particularly the \nAmerican farmer and the American small business men and women and their \nfamilies, to get relief from the current estate tax, which is a \nperverse tax that goes against the very things that we want Americans \nto strive for. We want Americans to be self-reliant. We want them to \nsave and to invest. We want them to build up their businesses and their \nfarms. We want them to be prudent. We want\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\nthem to be self-reliant. And we want them to have the ability to pass \nthat farm on to the next generation and the next generation.\n  I have a very close friend who runs a farm in western Kansas. It is a \ntypical farm that you find in the West with thousands and thousands of \nacres because of the sparse amount of rainfall--raising hogs and \ncattle, a great investment in equipment and land, barely making it from \nyear to year, depending on the weather. Some years are better than \nothers. When this individual dies--and their farm has been in the \nfamily now for two generations--his son's dream has been to continue \nthe farm within the family. Yet, my friend is faced with what farmers \nand business men and women all across this country are faced with: The \nreality that, upon the death of he and his spouse, most of the farm \nwill have to be sold or liquidated in order to pay the taxes. It is a \ndouble form of taxation because the earnings from that farm have been \ntaxed on a year-to-year basis.\n  So it is a governmental grab.\n  Is it selfish to want hard-working Americans to be able to keep the \nassets they have accumulated through their ability or good fortune, \nhard work and dedication? Is it selfish to say that they can't pass \nthat on to their family but they are better off giving it to the \nGovernment so that Government can make better use of that money than \nthe family to continue the business or continue the farm?\n  I think we have all heard the horror stories about how $1 comes into \nWashington, comes into the Government, and suddenly disappears. We \ncan't trace where it goes. Of the money which goes into fighting \npoverty, 65 percent never makes it to the people who are the \nrecipients, who are at or below the poverty line. It gets eaten up in \nbureaucracy. It gets eaten up in other special designations.\n  So, Mr. President, the American dream is not to die and pass \neverything you have worked so hard--Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 3 additional minutes to the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the American dream has been to be prudent, \nto save, to try to make life better for your children and your \ngrandchildren than it has been for you. The current inheritance tax \nsystem takes away that American dream--the dream that one generation \ncan build upon the success of another to build a better life for \nthemselves and their children.\n\n  The current tax sends a message that the Government will take away \nwhat you have earned and not allow you to pass it on. That is a \ndisincentive to work hard. It is a disincentive to be successful, a \ndisincentive to pursue the American dream because when you die the \nfruits of your labors will be taken away from you and away from your \nfamily and given to the Government. This is selfish?\n  Mr. Summers, who speaks for the President and the Vice President, \nsays this ``is about as bad as it gets;'' that it is about as selfish \nas it gets; that it is selfish to want to retain the fruits of your \nlabors; that it is unselfish to give it to the Government, which in \nmany instances wastes the money that you have worked so hard for.\n  The President campaigned on repeal of the exemption for the estate \ntax, and Senator Dole when he was running for President on his proposal \nto lower the estate tax. Now that we are debating this in the budget, \nMr. Summers comes along and says it is a selfish thing to want to do. I \ndon't think it selfish, Mr. President, to allow the American taxpayers \nto keep the fruits of their hard-earned labors and not to have it taxed \naway to the point where they have to sell their farms, to sell their \nbusinesses, or to sell their assets just to pay the tax to the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, I am a proud a cosponsor of legislation--in fact, four \npieces of legislation--that call for repeal or at least reduction in \nthe amount of estate tax to counter the efforts that are currently \nunderway to eliminate even the exemption. I am pleased, and I hope that \nthe Congress will hold firm on this issue as we go through our budget \nnegotiations.\n  I would like to, in closing, invite Mr. Summers to visit some mom and \npop businesses in Indiana that are hard hit by this devastating tax. I \nwould like them to visit some farms of some friends of mine who want to \npass it on to their children and grandchildren but have to liquidate \nthe farm in order to pay the estate tax. Come out to Indiana and tell \nthe family that is forced to sell the farm or the business that has \nbeen in the family for more than 100 years that they are being selfish \nfor wanting to keep that farm in the family and not to turn that money \nover to the Government.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Tax Code is the only part of this debate \nthat can truly be labeled selfish. The Government has no right to take \nunjustly the fruits of its citizens' labors.\n  I hope the President and the Vice President will quickly disavow the \nstatement made today, or reported today in the Washington Post, by Mr. \nSummers when he calls it selfish on the part of the American people to \ntry to retain the business of a farm that they have worked so hard to \nacquire.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague from \nGeorgia for his managing this past hour. I hope that my colleagues have \nhad a chance to listen very clearly.\n  I would also like to compliment my colleague from Indiana on his very \nforceful statement denouncing the statement that was in the paper \ntoday, reported to be made by Mr. Summers, Deputy Assistant Secretary \nof the Treasury, when he said that those who want to cut inheritance \ntaxes are wanting to do so for greedy individuals. I just totally \ndisagree. I am one of those individuals who wants to reduce the \ninheritance tax, and I don't think I am trying to do it for greedy \nindividuals. I think the tax is unfair. It is too high.\n  The Senator from Indiana mentioned the fact that farmers and ranchers \nworked hard in their lifetime to build up a ranch, farm, or estate, and \nfind that Uncle Sam is taking 39 percent, maybe 45 percent, or 55 \npercent of that estate. I think it is too high. It is higher even than \nthe income tax.\n  If you have a taxable estate of $1 million and you are at the 39 \npercent tax bracket, that is too much. Why should the Government be \nentitled to take 39 percent of a farm or ranch that has a value of $1.6 \nmillion--there is a $600,000 exemption and a $1 million estate--why \nshould Uncle Sam be entitled to take 40 percent, or, if you have a \ntaxable estate of $3 million, maybe two or three restaurants or \nbusinesses that you put together and the taxable estate is $3 million, \nwhy should Uncle Sam be entitled to take over half?\n  Mr. Summers may think you are being greedy because you don't want to \nlose half of what you have built and worked all your life to \naccumulate, and you want to pass it on to your children. He thinks \nmaybe you are trying to be greedy because you want to keep it in the \nfamily. Mr. Summers is wrong.\n  I concur with my colleague from Indiana. I hope that the \nadministration will denounce, renounce, or disassociate themselves from \nhis remarks because trying to reduce the inheritance tax is not being \ngreedy.\n  I tell my colleagues that this is one Senator who is going to be very \nenergetic in trying to make sure, when that tax bill comes up this \nyear, that we are going to have estate tax relief.\n  I hope we will cut estate taxes for everybody. I hope we will \nincrease the exemption because I do not think the Federal Government \nshould be entitled to take part of the property that people have worked \ntheir lifetime to pass on to their children. I do not think Uncle Sam \nshould be entitled to take 40 or 50 or 55 percent.\n  Mr. President, I am not sure what time remains of Senator Coverdell's \ntime, but I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Is there objection? The Chair\n\n[[Page S3408]]\n\nhears none, and it is so ordered. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized to speak as if in morning business for 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3402-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3408-S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LEGISLATING BY EXECUTIVE ORDER\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to follow up on some of the statements that \nhave been made by our colleagues concerning the executive branch's \ncurrent willingness to legislate by Executive order. I have talked to \nthe White House two or three times now. I have let it be known that I \nwant to use whatever tools are available to get their attention and \nmake sure they quit attempting to legislate by Executive order.\n  Some of our colleagues may not be aware of what we are talking about, \nbut we have had two or three disputes--maybe we should have had more--\nwith the administration over the last few years about executive actions \nthat clearly should be implemented through legislation by Congress, the \nbody elected by the people for legislative purposes. This \nadministration, the Clinton administration, has tried to bypass \nCongress and legislate by Executive order. I think they have done so \nknowing full well in many cases they could not get their desired \nobjective through Congress so they just decided to do it by fiat.\n  I am here to say all of us, Democrats and Republicans, should reject \nthat approach. We should uphold this institution, the legislative \nbranch, the branch of the people, and say this is why our forefathers \nhad separation of powers. The Constitution is very clear. If you read \nthe Constitution, it states in article I, ``All legislative powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States which \nshall consist of the Senate and the House of Representatives.'' ``All \nlegislative powers.'' It does not say some. It does not say that if the \nadministration cannot accomplish its objectives through the Congress it \ncan go ahead and pass them by Executive order.\n  In the 10th amendment it says all other powers are reserved to the \nStates and to the people. So the executive branch has the power to \nenforce the law but not to write it. That is the responsibility of the \nlegislative branch. And then if people do not like the laws we pass, \nthey can vote for someone else. They have a chance to do that through \nthe election process.\n  There are a couple of cases where the administration has overstepped \nits bounds, and I think where Congress has spoken up, or should have \nspoken up. One example was a case where the administration tried to \ngive organized labor a gift and issued an Executive order to prohibit \nhiring replacement workers during a strike. They tried to get Congress \nto pass a bill that would do that in 1993 and 1994--and actually passed \nlegislation through the House but could not get it passed through the \nSenate. So after the 1994 elections, the administration tried to change \nthe law by Executive order in March 1995. That was contested in the \ncourts.\n  I might make note that in the November elections of 1994, Republicans \ntook control of the Senate and it was obvious that this legislation \ncould not pass Congress. So President Clinton, in my opinion, \noverstepped his bounds and issued an Executive order in 1995 barring \nmanagement from hiring replacement workers during a strike--a perfectly \nlegal practice under the National Labor Relations Act. He issued this \norder knowing that Congress had twice rejected legislation that would \nhave done the same thing. The courts didn't let him get away with it.\n  On February 2, 1996, the U.S. court of appeals threw out President \nClinton's Executive order ruling that the President's action was \nclearly unlawful and was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. \nClearly, the court's message was a reminder that the President does not \nhave a blank check to adopt policies in direct conflict with Federal \nlaws established by Congress.\n\n  The President does not have legislative authority. I think that is \nwhat we are finding in a couple of his other Executive actions. Another \nexample deals with the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument \nwhere the President in September 1996 unilaterally took a 2 million \nacre coal-rich block of land in Utah and made it a national monument. \nHe did it without talking to Congress. He did it without consulting the \nUtah delegation. He did it without consulting the people who live and \nwork in that area. He did it without consulting the Governor of Utah. \nHe basically said we are going to take that 2 million acres and declare \nit a national monument.\n  Maybe I would support such a thing, but again we have a committee, \nthe Energy And Natural Resources Committee, that considers such bills. \nWe should have had a hearing on that legislation. There has never been \na hearing. There has never been a chance for the Utah delegation to \nspeak out on that legislation. Is it good or not? I am not sure how I \nwould vote. Maybe I would vote with the President.\n  My point is he usurped congressional responsibility and basically \nsaid we are going to declare this a national monument by Federal fiat.\n  I might mention that when he did this--it was in September 1996, \nduring a campaign--he had a press conference around the Grand Canyon in \nArizona. He did not do it at a press conference in Utah because his \ndecision was quite unpopular.\n  My point is not whether his decision is popular or not. He did it \nclearly for political purposes. But he did not allow the people to \nspeak. The President is not king. He cannot do that. And maybe this \nwill be contested. Probably we did not speak out enough on it.\n  Another example where I seriously think he has exceeded his Executive \nauthority and I think legislation is required, is the President's \nExecutive action requiring that if you are under age 27, if you buy \ncigarettes, you are required to show an ID wherever you are buying \nthem. And if retailers are found selling to minors or anybody under the \nage of 27, they face civil penalties of $250 or more and could be \nsubject to other sanctions. Retailers reported to have sold cigarettes \nor smokeless tobacco to someone under 27, without checking their photo \nID, risk compliance checks being conducted in the future.\n  Maybe we should do that. I will tell my colleagues, I do not want \nkids smoking. I have four kids. I absolutely do not want them to smoke. \nThis is hazardous to their health. I have a mother who has emphysema, \nlung cancer, which is very serious. I absolutely do not want anybody to \nsmoke. But if the President wants to have ID checks for anybody under \nage 27, or age 40 for that matter, he can introduce it in Congress and \nmaybe we can pass it. I think that is a proper prerogative of the \nStates. But at least it should go through the legislative route. He did \nnot do that.\n  He has advocated other Executive rules dealing with advertising. I \nsupported banning smoking on airplanes. I may support banning various \ntypes of advertising. But we should go through the legislative process. \nWe should have hearings. We should let elected people make a decision. \nI think the President's Executive action goes so far as to ban outdoor \nbillboards or baseball caps that say Marlboro, and so on. I think the \nPresident's actions and the FDA's rules have exceeded the \nconstitutional authority of the executive branch. I think that is \nwrong.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me bring up the latest proposed Executive \norder, and I say proposed because it has been announced by the \nPresident that he is going to issue an Executive order that deals with \nFederal construction projects which will in practice screen out \nnonunion businesses from participating in Federal construction projects \nor force their employees to join a union, the so-called project labor \nagreements.\n\n  Mr. President, this is an egregious power grab by organized labor. If \nthey want to try to do this they should do it through the legislative \nbranch. They should see if they have the votes. We have $239 billion of \nFederal construction spending available between now and 2002, and to \ncome up with an Executive order and say you need not apply unless you \nhave a union is totally wrong. Totally wrong. More than 80 percent of \nthe workers that are doing Federal work on construction projects now, \naccording to this proposal, need not apply; or if you are going to \napply you need to join a union. What about free competition? What about \ncompetitive bidding? What about the taxpayers?\n  For the administration to try to make this kind of behind-the-scenes\n\n[[Page S3409]]\n\ndeal with organized labor--and we have reports that organized labor was \nwriting this regulation, that they were involved in formulating this \nregulation--to come up with this type of a power grab I think is \nabsolutely wrong. If they want to do it, they should do it through the \nlegislative branch. Have somebody who supports this legislation \nintroduce it. Let us debate it. Let us find out where the votes are. \nLet us go the legislative route. Let us go the constitutional route.\n  And so I have contacted the White House and tried to let them know \nthat I am very sincere about trying to protect the constitutional \nprerogatives of Congress. This is the legislative body and I am very \nsincere about making sure that the White House does not become the \nlegislative body by Executive action.\n  And so, Mr. President, I have told the White House we are willing to \nuse what actions we have at our disposal to try to get their attention. \nWe have the confirmation process. We also have the appropriations \nprocess. We have the judicial process. We have other tools available to \ntry to convince the administration they cannot legislate by Executive \norder. That's very much my intention.\n  I just noticed an article in the Thursday, April 17th Roll Call where \nMr. Reed Hunt, the Federal Communications Commission Chairman, is \ntalking about drafting a notice of proposed rulemaking to examine the \nidea of free broadcast time for Federal candidates and predicted that \nfree time for candidates could be implemented in time for the 1998 \nelections.\n  Mr. President, we have campaign reform before this body, and there is \ncertainly legitimate debate and we have talked about having free time \nfor political candidates. Some people call it food stamps for \npoliticians. That is a legitimate legislative item we should discuss. \nBut the FCC Chairman does not have the authority to say by fiat, by \ndirection from the administration, that we are going to give candidates \nfree time and mandate that or dictate it or bribe the broadcasting \nauthorities to enforce it.\n  That is a serious mistake. If we are going to say politicians are \nentitled to free time, let us have that as part of a bill. Let us \ndebate it. But Mr. Hunt cannot do it.\n  We as a legislative body, Democrats and Republicans, need to reassert \nour legislative authority, our legislative responsibility, and we need \nto object. If we find the administration, the executive branch, trying \nto legislate, we need to object. At a different time I will speak about \nthe need to object when the Supreme Court or courts are legislating as \nwell, because we find that branch of Government is involved in the \nlegislative process. Right now they are considering two cases \nlegalizing assisted suicide. The Supreme Court does not have the \nauthority to legalize anything. That is the responsibility of this \nbody. That is called legislation. And that is a subject for a speech at \nanother time. I am strongly opposed to the executive branch legislating \nas well as the judicial branch legislating. Both are wrong. This is the \nlegislative branch. I as one Senator, whether I agree with the \ndirection of the Executive order or the judicial decision, I am going \nto speak out loudly and strongly and use tools available to make sure \nthe Congress remains the legislative branch of Government.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I thank my colleague from \nConnecticut for his patience.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are, with Senators allowed to speak for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that I may be able to proceed for \n10 minutes as in morning business, and I may need a couple minutes \nbeyond that, but I will try to move through the material fairly \nquickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3408-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ALEXIS HERMAN NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, let me address if I can--and \nthere are a couple matters I want to speak on--the issue of Alexis \nHerman. I have listened here to my colleagues address their concern \nabout the Executive order regarding project labor agreements. My hope \nis that we would not be holding Alexis Herman hostage over a particular \nmatter that Members have some concern about. And I respect that. I note \nmy good friend and colleague from Oklahoma is still on the floor. It \nwas back in I think 1991 when President Bush issued an Executive order \nto prohibit project labor agreements. I do not recall a similar outcry \nthat this was acting without legislative authority.\n  I do not disagree, I say to my colleague, by the way, with his \nconcern where executive branches, regardless of party, try to exceed \ntheir authority here. But nonetheless, I hope that despite the \nlegitimacy or illegitimacy, whatever one's point of view is, on project \nlabor agreements, Alexis Herman's nomination can go forward. She was \nproposed in December. The election was in November. This is almost May. \nWe are missing a Secretary of Labor. And whether it is organized labor, \nunions, management, it is important there be someone at that table to \nrepresent the interests of management and labor. And the Secretary of \nLabor needs to be there.\n\n  My colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, I think addressed \nthis issue appropriately back, as the Presiding Officer will recall, \nwhen there was some question of whether or not the nomination was going \nto move through the committee which the Presiding Officer and I sit on \ntogether, the Labor and Human Resources Committee. There, the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania noted we ought to vote on these people up or down, \nbut we ought to at least vote.\n  The committee voted unanimously to send Alexis Herman's name to the \nfull Senate for consideration. As I said a moment ago, now it is \ngetting to be late April. I am told her nomination will not be \nconsidered until something is worked out on these project labor \nagreements. I think that is regrettable. Again, I will discuss in a \nmoment the project labor agreement issue. Six months after an election, \nto be missing yet a meaningful and important member of the President's \nCabinet, I think is an unfortunate use of our power here, to deny the \nSenate even a vote on this nomination. So I hope we would have that \nnomination come sooner rather than later, so we could have that \nindividual sitting at the Cabinet table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3409-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3409-S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me briefly address these project labor \nagreements. Again, this is maybe confusing to some people because it \nsounds rather esoteric: Project labor agreement. There is nothing new \nabout project labor agreements. They go back to the 1930's. They have \nbeen a very effective means by which governing bodies, States, cities \nand the Federal Government, where there have been major public works \nprojects, have been able to bring people together to try to work out \narrangements, in terms of wages, benefits, hours and so forth, in \nreturn for which there would be no work stoppages, strikes and the \nlike.\n  I note Governor Pataki of New York has very effectively used project \nlabor agreements on projects in the State of New York. Christine Todd \nWhitman, the Governor of New Jersey, has used project labor agreements \non major public works projects in the State of New Jersey. There are \nnumerous projects around the country, Federal projects--the Boston \nHarbor is the one I am most familiar with in New England--where there \nis a project labor agreement there.\n  I might point out it was noted by our colleague from Texas that these \nproject labor agreements result in tremendous cost overruns. It is \nestimated right now, and the project is not complete--the estimated \ncost of the Boston Harbor project was $6.1 or $6.3 billion. It is \nestimated now, in no small measure because of the project labor \nagreement, that project may be completed for about $3.4 billion, \nsubstantially under the original estimates. So there is nothing \ninherent in this that says it is going to increase costs. In fact, it \nhas worked very, very well.\n  The suggestion was also that nonunion businesses would be prohibited \nfrom bidding. Nothing could be further\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\nfrom the truth. That would be against the law. In fact, I think, as \nsomeone pointed out, in one of the Boston projects--102 of the 257 \nsubcontractors were nonunion firms; 102 of the 257. So the notion that \nnonunion firms would be prohibited from being a part of these projects \nis unfounded.\n  As I noted earlier, in October of 1992, President Bush issued an \nExecutive order which prohibited Federal agencies and Federal \ncontractors from entering into these project labor agreements. So the \noutrage that is being expressed because an Executive order has been \nissued to reinstate them--as I said, I would be sympathetic if the \noutrage had been focused equally vociferously when President Bush \nbanned these project labor agreements--as we now hear with this \nPresident's decision to issue or allow these project labor agreements \nto be used on Federal projects.\n  So, again on the Alexis Herman issue I hope she will go forward.\n  On these project labor agreements, I think it is important we utilize \nwhat has been a very effective tool for being able to complete very, \nvery important public works projects. As I said earlier, these are not \njust used by the executive branch at the national level, they have been \nused by Governors all across the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3409-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            L'AMBIANCE PLAZA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, tomorrow, the 23d of April, will mark the \n10th anniversary of a major tragedy in the State of Connecticut. It was \nApril 23, 1987, that 28 workers in Bridgeport, CT, lost their lives at \na place called L'Ambiance Plaza, a construction site. My colleague from \nIndiana may recall that it was the largest industrial accident we had \never had in the State of Connecticut. It occurred during the \nconstruction of an apartment building using a technique called lift-\nslab construction. You would actually construct the floors and then, by \nhydraulic lift, lift the floors up. Within a matter of seconds, these \nfloors collapsed and took the lives of 28 of my constituents from \nConnecticut.\n  It was a dreadful day, one that people still talk about in our State. \nIn fact, early next week there will be a memorial service, with the \nfamilies and others who are still feeling the pain of the loss of their \nloved ones.\n  We ended up banning, in the State of Connecticut, lift-slab \nconstruction. There were Federal regulations put out on that \nconstruction as well. As a result of that accident, in fact, my \ncolleague from Connecticut, Congressman Christopher Shays, who \nrepresents that congressional district, he and I introduced legislation \nto create some new requirements to monitor health and safety on \nconstruction sites. That legislation would have created an office of \nconstruction safety. It would have created a 15-member advisory \ncommittee on construction safety.\n  I should back up and point out that of all trades, the construction \ntrades suffer the most injuries and death. Even with a lot of \nimprovements, it is highly dangerous work. So, even with the \nimprovements that have been made in occupational safety and health, \nconstruction work, just by its nature, as one would well imagine, is \nvery dangerous. What we were looking for was to create some specific \nemphasis and focus on the construction trades. So that bill required \nthose two points and further required increased civil and criminal \npenalties when there were knowing violations of occupational safety and \nhealth standards, and it would require employers to develop specific \nprocedures to ensure health and safety on building sites. The bill was \nnever approved. We offered it and had hearings on it, but it was never \napproved.\n  If you, Mr. President, and my colleagues had seen L'Ambiance Plaza, \nthe devastation there, I think most would have come to the same \nconclusion that I did, that we need to do a better job in monitoring \nthese construction sites. I pointed out, it was the single largest \nconstruction tragedy in the State of Connecticut. The problem is that \nlift-slab construction had caused hundreds of injuries around the \ncountry, yet in most instances, on the specific site, the injury, \nalthough it was bad, had not resulted in a death, so reporting was not \nrequired.\n  So there was no warning ahead of time about the dangers of this type \nof construction. As a result of our efforts, you would have been \nrequired to report those incidents when they happened so the collective \ninformation would be gathered and better decisions could be made about \nthis kind of construction.\n  So, next week we will again gather to commemorate the lives of the 28 \nmen whose lives were lost on that date 10 years ago. Like all of my \ncolleagues, I hope never to have to attend another such ceremony. My \nhope is still that we will do a better job in improving the enforcement \nand the penalties involved, because that seems to be the only way we \nget the kind of compliance that is necessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3410-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3410-S3412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a subject about which I \nknow the Presiding Officer has a great deal of interest, and that is \nthe attention that has most recently been focused on the breakthroughs \nin our understanding of the human brain and in the early development of \nchildren. In fact, Newsweek just released a special edition: ``From \nBirth to Three. What you need to know, how speech begins, a baby's \nbrain, genes, emotions, what is normal, what is not.'' I commend \nNewsweek for dedicating a special issue to this subject matter. I think \nit is extremely worthwhile.\n\n  Time magazine earlier did an issue on education, which I think was \nextremely helpful to millions and millions of Americans. I encourage \neveryone in this country to read this edition, particularly young \nfamilies. It is very valuable information for people to have. We are \ngathering new information, almost on a daily basis, about the \nremarkable events that occur in the earliest days of a child's \ndevelopment, about how important it is that we do everything we can to \nmaximize parental understanding and to provide whatever support we can \nso these earliest days turn out to be productive days in the \ndevelopment of a child's life.\n  As we all know, last week the President and the First Lady hosted an \nimportant White House conference on this very topic, bringing together \nleading voices from around the country to discuss the early development \nof children and how we could better support that development. \nScientists have now presented us with hard evidence of what many \nparents have long held true--have known, I think instinctively--that \nchildren whose lives are stimulated from birth by words, by affection, \nand by playful interactions with their parents and other devoted \ncaregivers are far more likely to develop to their full intellectual \nand emotional potential than those who are not.\n  All that we already knew about giving children a good start in life \nstill holds true. Genetics, nutrition, whether a mother drinks or \nsmokes--all these factors still play a role in a child's development. \nNow we also know that the environment that we provide to children, \nstarting at the moment of birth and into their earliest years, has an \nastonishing impact on their potential to learn and to grow.\n  I do not pretend to understand all of the scientific studies. In \nfact, just the language of it, the jargon of it, can be dazzling for \nthose of us who are lay people in this area. But I am trying to gain a \nbasic grasp of the facts. Scientists have now discovered, for instance, \nthat the brain of a baby is wired to learn. Starting at the very first \ndays, each time a parent holds, rocks, or talks to her child, \nconnections are formed between the neurons of the child's brain. These \nconnections, the building blocks of a child's cognitive and emotional \ndevelopment, grow exponentially in the earliest years.\n  Just consider this. By the time a child is 3 years old, that child's \nbrain has formed 1,000 trillion synapses, or connections between brain \ncells. Just to give some idea of the magnitude of this, this evening if \nyou have a starry night and you look up at the stars, you should know \nthat 1,000 trillion synapses is more than all the stars in the Milky \nWay. So, as you gaze at the heavens tonight and you look at the Milky \nWay with all its stars, know that just in 36 months of a child's life \nthere are more synapses and more connections formed than all those \nstars. That will give you some idea of what is occurring in these \nearliest days of a child's life.\n\n[[Page S3411]]\n\n  Scientists have found that these connections in a child's brain only \nsurvive if they are reinforced, a sort of ``use-it-or-lose-it'' \nphenomenon. As an example, and I am very familiar with the one I am \nabout to give you, studies have found that children who develop \ncataracts at an early age lose their ability to see, even after those \ncataracts are removed because the brain pathways for sight were not \nallowed to develop during the critical period for achieving sight. Why \ndo I know about this? My oldest sister, Carolyn, a teacher in \nConnecticut, was born with cataracts many years ago. She is blind \ntoday. Had we known, had we had the information we have today, my \nparents might have been able to do something differently. She has been \na wonderful teacher and an independent individual, but I was struck \nwhen I read of this particular fact by what we know now that we did not \nknow then.\n\n  So this particular discovery came racing home to me in relation to my \noldest sister--what a difference the current advances of knowledge and \ninformation might have made in her life. Although she has been \ntremendously successful with her physical handicap, it struck me life \nmight have been a little different for her had the information we know \nnow about the development of the brain been available then.\n  Other information shows that a baby who is not read to--the simple \nact of reading, even before a child can understand the words--that \nchild may later struggle with language skills. Similarly, a child who \ndoes not get the chance to play may later have difficulty interacting \nwith peers.\n  As the Carnegie Corporation's seminal publication, ``Starting \nPoints'' so succinctly states:\n\n       How individuals function from preschool years all the way \n     through adolescence and even adulthood hinges, to a \n     significant extent, on the experiences children have in their \n     first three years.\n\n  What does this exciting research mean to us as policymakers? I think \nit means that what we thought of as ``early interventions'' to help \nchildren learn may not have been early enough. It means that programs \nfor school-age children and even for preschool children miss a window \nof opportunity, the extraordinary potential for learning that exists in \na child's brain before the age of 3.\n  It means we need to start even earlier, at the first day of a child's \nlife with guaranteed parental leave, for instance, which the Chair was \nso instrumental in helping us pass a few years ago. Providing even \nthose few months for parents who have to work to be with their children \nis a lot better than they used to have. As the Chair knows, I would \nlike to lower the threshold from 50 employees to 25, so we can include \n13 million additional people in the country who today cannot take \nadvantage of family leave. I am still going to try to persuade him to \nsupport this. I hope we will lower the threshold so more families can \ntake advantage, even for 12 weeks, of the opportunity to stimulate a \nchild's early development.\n  In short, I think it means for us as policymakers that we need to \nthink carefully and critically about what we are doing for children in \ntheir earliest years. I believe we in the Senate have an extraordinary \nopportunity to help families, to ensure that our Nation's children are \nable to grasp and reach the highest rungs of their potential.\n  I have also joined with several of my colleagues to introduce the \nWorking Family Child Care Act of 1997. Given these scientific findings, \nquality child care can no longer be considered a luxury. This bill will \nprovide $500 million to meet supply shortages, including the acute \nshortage of high-quality infant care. Let's talk about the families who \nhave no choice--not the families who have the choice of working or not. \nI have my own feelings about that issue--but, let's talk about the \nfamilies who have no choice, they have to work. Or let's talk about the \nparent who is raising children on her own. The best thing is a caring \nparent, but if for whatever reason that caring parent cannot be with \nthat child all the time, then we have to make sure that in child-care \nsettings there are quality caregivers so these infants, in the earliest \ndays, get the next best thing to a mom and dad.\n  I am hopeful, as a result of this new information, we can develop \nbroad-based, bipartisan support for quality child care. We have done a \nlot on the availability of child care, but the quality of the care has \nto be good as well. If a parent cannot be there with that child, then \nthe child care provider has to know what they are doing. Hopefully, we \nwill get support on this issue.\n  Our chairman, Senator Jeffords of Vermont, is taking a leadership \nrole in this area, and I commend him for it. I am soon going to \nintroduce a bill that will put us on a path to fully funding Head \nStart. Again, this has been a controversial matter. We have authorized \nfull funding, but we have never come up with the money. We know Head \nStart works and makes a difference in the lives of children. Hopefully, \nwe can get broad-based support. It is expensive, I know it. But, we \nhave to come up with a means to do it.\n  We have to look at our priorities in light of this new information. \nWhether it is 5 years, 7 years, or 8 years, we need to say that at the \nend of that time, we will fully fund Head Start. I am willing to talk \nwith anyone about the fastest possible way to do this.\n  Recently, our colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, with Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts, introduced legislation to insure our children \nand to thereby ensure that untreated injuries or illnesses do not \nimpede a child's development in the most critical years. I commend them \nfor their work.\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of good things going on that our \ncolleagues are working on. I urge, in light of some of these studies--I \nmentioned a moment ago this Newsweek article which I think will be very \nhelpful--that we try to pull together here to figure out how we can \nsupport these families, these children, recognizing the economic \npressures, all the things that make it more difficult today than in \nearlier days to raise families the way the Presiding Officer and I may \nhave been raised. That is not possible for many people today. So we \nneed to try to come up with support structures that will allow families \nto at least approximate that world that existed for many of us--not for \nala--in a time when one parent worked and another stayed home and \nraised the family.\n\n  I know the Presiding Officer cares about this very much. I have had \nthe privilege of working with him on these issues. I look forward to \nbeing involved with him on this one as well. There are a lot of good \nthings we can do to assist families. With this new information coming \nto us, not only is it desirous, but I think we have no other choice but \nto act and to see to it that these children get the best start they \npossibly can.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's indulgence in allowing me \na little more time than I otherwise would have taken.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, what is the question \nbefore the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are currently in morning business.

Mr. President, today we celebrate the 27th anniversary of \nthe first Earth Day. In the spirit of that celebration, it behooves us \nto remember how the first Earth Day came about, and what brought it \nabout. I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair participates in \nEarth Day activities and is deeply interested and involved in \nenvironmental matters. Perhaps he also will be interested in a little \nhistory of what happened.\n  In the 1960's, a series of events occurred that shocked the Nation \ninto an awareness of the need to protect the environment. Rachel Carson \nwrote her famous book, ``Silent Spring,'' in 1962. The country was \nappalled by her revelations of the destruction caused to our \nenvironment by widespread pesticide use--DDT and others, for example. \nThen, in 1969, another extraordinary event occurred--the Cuyahoga River \nin Cleveland caught fire. When a river catches fire, it certainly is an \neye catcher. Why did it catch fire? It was so polluted with oils and \nother substances that it suddenly burst into flames. That is, somebody \nthrew a match into the river and it caught fire. Extraordinary.\n  So in the early 1960's, a Democratic President, President Lyndon \nJohnson, laid the foundation for the major environmental laws that came \nlater. He signed antipollution and open space legislation into law, \nincluding the creation of the Redwood National Park, the Wilderness \nAct, and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I might say, Mr. \nPresident, it was moneys from that Land and Water Conservation Fund \nthat enabled me, as Governor of our State of Rhode Island, to purchase \nland for open space, wetlands, and parks. The improvements we made \ncontinue to give pleasure to thousands of Rhode Islanders in the past \nand will do so for literally millions of individuals in the future. \nThat is a wonderful law, the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  When Senator Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin proposed the idea of Earth \nDay in 1970, even he didn't know how it would galvanize Americans into \naction, how it would catch the imagination of Americans. The first \nEarth Day was a phenomenal success, a reflection of America's strong \nconviction for cleaning up the environment. I can remember some of the \nactivities that took place on Earth Day where I was--cleaning up the \nriverbeds where there were old tires and dishwashers and refrigerators \nand many other things thrown over the bank and down into the stream. We \ntook time to clean our nearby streams, as countless others did. Ours \nwas one small activity in one small section of the country, but it made \na difference.\n  The years that immediately followed the first Earth Day were a \nvibrant period for environmental legislation. The key players in that \nlegislation, Mr. President, were on the very committee on which you \nserve so ably, the Environment and Public Works Committee. We remember \nthat Democrats like Jennings Randolph from West Virginia and Ed Muskie \nfrom Maine worked closely with several Republicans, including Howard \nBaker from Tennessee and Bob Stafford from Vermont. Indeed, their \nsuccess was the result of a nonpartisan, bipartisan cooperation. \nMagnificent progress was made.\n  It is hard to think that, before 1970, none of the laws or \ninstitutions that I am going to rattle off existed; but then they \npassed in 1970, 1971, and 1972. Indeed, under President Richard Nixon, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency was created. We never had an \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The President's Council on \nEnvironmental Quality was born; the National Environmental Policy Act, \nor NEPA, the guiding law upon which so many of our acts depend; the \nClean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Endangered Species Act. I \nwasn't here at the time, but the Endangered Species Act passed on the \nfloor of the Senate 92 to 0. That is the way the Senate felt about \nenvironmental laws.\n  Then another Republican President, Ronald Reagan, had the United \nStates take the lead internationally in environmental matters, and we \nsigned the Montreal Protocol in 1987, to eliminate the production of \nchlorofluorocarbons, the gaseous culprit responsible for the \ndestruction of the ozone layer. It was under still another Republican \nPresident, George Bush, that the 1990 Clean Air Amendments were passed. \nIn addition, President Bush personally went to the Earth Summit at Rio \nde Janeiro and signed the International Treaty on Global Climate. So we \nhave seen Republicans and Democrats in the White House exhibit strong \nleadership. This was a bipartisan effort.\n\n  This bipartisanship has brought about tremendous, tangible change. \nLet us review the bidding to see what has taken place in the past 27 \nyears. Have these acts done a good job--the Clean Water Act, the Clean \nAir Act, and the Endangered Species Act? It is a remarkable story.\n  Before the EPA, before all of the laws now on the books, there was \nlead in our air and sewage in our rivers. I can remember at the time \nwhen I was Secretary of the Navy, we took a trip on the Sequoia, the \nPresidential yacht, down the Potomac River here in Washington. I \ninvited my British counterpart, the equivalent of our Navy Secretary, \nto join us. It was a lovely July evening, calm and quiet, not a ripple \non the water. As we started down the river, the propeller churned up \nthe water and it was like going for a ride down the sewer. The smells \nwere so overpowering from the polluted river water that we all had to \nretreat inboard to have our dinner. That is not the way it is now, \nthough. In those days, two-thirds of the rivers, lakes, and streams of \nthe United States were considered nonfishable and nonswimmable. Now the \nreverse is true. Two-thirds of the rivers and lakes and streams in \nAmerica are considered fishable and swimmable. Every year that \npercentage rises.\n  What have we done on auto emissions? Well, from 1970 to 1994, the \nnumber of vehicle miles traveled in the United States increased by 111 \npercent, more than a doubling of VMT. Yet, in that same period, the \ncombined emissions of the 6 principal air pollutants dropped by 24 \npercent. In other words, we had dramatic emissions reductions while \nvehicle miles traveled shot up. Lead in the air--which everybody knows \nhas a terrible effect on the mental development of children, \nparticularly in congested inner cities--was reduced by 98 percent--a \n98-percent reduction of lead in the air.\n  How did that come about? Because we mandated the use of unleaded \ngasoline in the mid-1970s. What an achievement.\n  The Montreal Protocol, as I mentioned before, has been a tremendous \nsuccess. Let's look at this chart. The Montreal Protocol was signed in \n1985. Since then, because of the restrictions on the production of \nchlorofluorocarbons--it is now projected that the ozone layer will \ngradually recover, and return to pre-ozone-hole levels by the year \n2050. What are chlorofluorocarbons? They are cooling agents found in \nrefrigerators and air conditioners in our homes, offices and \nautomobiles. Because of the leadership shown by President Reagan and \nlater President Bush, we have made great progress. This red line shows \nwhat would have happened without the controls of the Montreal Protocol.\n  Instead, we have been able not only to stabilize chlorine loadings, \nbut actually reduce them. That line will go down and down. All of this \nhas tremendous effects on what comes through this protective shield, \nthe upper atmosphere.\n  Now, what about the Endangered Species Act? That is something the \nPresiding Officer has worked so hard on. The endangered species are--\nperhaps--the proverbial ``canaries in the coal mine''; that is, when a \ncanary keels over, it shows there is dangerous gas. It gives you a hint \nthat something is wrong.\n  The best way to judge how successful we have been in preserving the \nhabitat is to look at how the plant and animal species are doing. If \nthe plant and animal life around us is in trouble, that means trouble \nfor us in the future.\n\n  The Endangered Species Act is geared toward preserving the habitat. \nHow do you save the animals? You preserve the habitat and thus bring \nthem back from the brink of extinction. Since its enactment in 1973, by \na vote of 92 to 0 in this Chamber--not a single Senator in 1973 voted \nagainst that law--the populations of whooping\n\n[[Page S3413]]\n\ncranes, brown pelicans, and the peregrine falcon have come back from \nnear extinction.\n  The bald eagle has increased from a low of 400 nesting pairs in 1963 \nto just over 4,700 pairs in 1995. Think of it. In the Continental \nUnited States, the lower 48 States, as they say, there were only 400 \nnesting pairs of bald eagles in 1963. Thirty-two years later--in 1995--\nthere are now 4,700 nesting pairs. Remarkable.\n  The grizzly bear has been saved from extinction and brought back from \nthe endangered list to the threatened list. The California gray whale \nand American alligator have recovered to the point where they have been \nremoved from the endangered list.\n  Of the 960 species currently listed on the endangered species list, \nmore than 40 percent are stable and gaining ground. And for many others \nthe rate of decline has been reduced.\n  The recovery of the striped bass is another success story. The \nstriped bass is a magnificent fighting fish, one that has been valued \nup and down the Atlantic coast for centuries.\n  It is interesting to hear what the original settlers said, and what \nCapt. John Smith said in 1614, over 350 years ago. This is what he said \nabout the striped bass. ``I myself, at the turning of the tide, have \nseen such multitudes pass out of a pond that it seemed to me that one \nmight go over their backs dryshod.'' There were so many it seemed you \ncould walk across on their backs.\n  So it was with great alarm that we learned of the precipitous decline \nof the striped bass in the late 1970's. And, by 1983, commercial \nharvest had dropped by 77 percent as compared to the previous year. By \n1983, the sports harvest of striped bass had declined by 85 percent \nfrom 4 years earlier. So we inaugurated an Emergency Striped Bass Study \nby the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries \nService. I am proud to say that this legislation came out of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  And fewer than 20 years later, through the cooperative efforts of \nState fish and wildlife agencies and the Federal agencies, most \nAtlantic striped bass stocks have recovered to healthy pre-1979 levels. \nThis dramatic turnaround is proof that, if we act quickly to reduce the \nthreats and preserve habitat, we can recover imperiled species.\n  Wetlands loss has slowed dramatically. When it comes to wetlands \nconservation, perhaps no program has been as successful as the North \nAmerican Waterfowl Management Plan--signed 11 years ago, in 1986, by \nthe United States and Canada, and later, Mexico. Under this plan, the \nNorth American Waterfowl Management Plan, partnerships are established \nbringing together Federal and local governments, and nonprofit groups \nsuch as Ducks Unlimited, and private donors, as well as landowners--to \nwork on the conservation of wetlands, and there are Federal dollars to \nmatch private contributions.\n  To date, well over 4 million acres have been protected, restored, or \nenhanced--some of it through easement, and some of it through purchases \nby the United States and Canada. And 20 million additional acres are \nprotected in Mexico.\n  Has it done any good? Listen to this: In 1996, there was the largest \nmigration of waterfowl in the previous 40 years--89.5 million ducks, \nwhich is 7 million more than 2 years before, and 18 million more than \nthe year before that migrated south for the winter; 90 million ducks, \nthe largest migration in the past 41 years. That came about because of \nthe North American Waterfowl Plan, which I mentioned before.\n  So it seems that the way that the plan operates, involving \npartnership between the States, the Federal Government, and private \nentities, it represents the wave of the future, which all of us ought \nto think about as we ponder how fast we can save these wetlands and \nwildlife habitat areas.\n  We are not done. We should not rest on our laurels. Some of the \ntrickiest and most difficult environmental problems lie ahead, and we \nhave to address these with purpose and ingenuity. We took on the \nformidable environmental challenges of the past and were successful. \nNow we look to the future. We shouldn't just rest on our laurels, as I \nsaid. We have to remember that these efforts can never succeed without \nstrong and sincere bipartisan cooperation--Republicans and Democrats \nworking together; Congress and the administration, likewise.\n\n  In conclusion, I just want to quote probably the greatest \nenvironmental President of them all, Teddy Roosevelt. This is what he \nsaid 86 years ago. ``Of all the questions which can come before this \nNation, short of the actual preservation of its existence in a great \nwar, there is none which compares in importance with the central task \nof leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is \nfor us.''\n  Those are pretty good words for us to remember as we celebrate Earth \nDay in 1997--words to be considered while thinking of the future and \npreserving the environment for our children and grandchildren and those \nwho come after us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3412-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3413-S3414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ``HUMMON'' TALMADGE HIGHWAY BEING DEDICATED TOMORROW IN HAMPTON, GA\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, tomorrow, down in Hampton, GA, a highway \nwill be dedicated to one of our former colleagues, the distinguished \nformer Senator Herman Talmadge. It would be fun to be there tomorrow \nand see Herman's reaction when the honor is announced at a luncheon in \nthe ballroom of the Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n  Fewer than one-fourth (23) of today's Members of the Senate were here \nwhen Senator Talmadge was. Because of that, I have decided to include \nin the Record an extensive interview with former Senator Talmadge \npublished by The Macon, GA, Telegraph. That newspaper's Randall Savage \nconducted the interview.\n  Mr. Savage asked good questions and Herman Talmadge gave great \nanswers. His assessment of many things about America reflect the fact \nthat Herman Talmadge still has the good judgment that he possessed \nwhile in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, accordingly, I ask unanimous consent that the February \n11, 1997, interview, headed ``Hummon'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the interview was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Macon Telegraph, Feb. 11, 1997]\n\n                               ``Hummon''\n\n                          (By Randall Savage)\n\n       Hampton.--Former U.S. Sen. Herman E. Talmadge is 83 now.\n       He doesn't dip, smoke or chew anymore, although he's not \n     above nibbling on a cigar now and then. A year ago, doctors \n     removed a cancerous tumor from his throat, and he underwent \n     25 radiation treatments.\n       ``They can't find any trace of it now,'' he said.\n       But Talmadge no longer runs two miles every day, as he did \n     for more than 20 years. He gave that up five years ago, \n     opting for brisk daily walks instead. Arthritis, however, had \n     ended even those. The condition hinders his mobility, and he \n     walks with a cane.\n       ``I got to be an old man at 82. I was a young man until \n     then,'' Talmadge said.\n       Nevertheless, Talmadge, one of Georgia's most powerful \n     politicians, is as politically astute today as he was when he \n     left the Senate 17 years ago. And he's still delighted to \n     share his views on politics and the world:\n       Question. You held political office for more than 30 years \n     as a Democrat. What do you think of the Democratic Party?\n       Answer. I think well of some of them and poorly of others. \n     I think they helped the Republican Party gain power by \n     continuing to push their liberal policies when the country \n     was becoming more conservative.\n       Question. Do you still consider your self a Democrat?\n       Answer. I guess you could classify me as an independent. I \n     vote for the man or woman. For a number of years, Democrats--\n     the national Democrats in particular--have become more and \n     more liberal in their thinking and actions.\n       Question. How so?\n       Answer. Excessive taxes. Excessive spending. Excessive \n     regulations, Excessive government.\n       Question. And you think the Democratic Party is involved \n     too heavily in that?\n       Answer. Yes. The Republican takeover (of Congress) slowed \n     down the Democrats. They'd been reacting to popular thinking \n     instead of pursuing sound policies. They lean whichever way \n     the wind is blowing.\n       Questions. What do you think of House Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich?\n       Answer. I think you have to give Newt Gingrich credit with \n     leading the Republican revolution that resulted in the \n     Republicans taking over both houses of Congress. But I don't \n     know what I think of him. I listen to him talk and I find \n     myself agreeing with a lot of what he's saying. But he \n     irritates me. When he gets through speaking, I'm irritated \n     over what he said. I don't know why.\n       Question. The Republican takeover of Congress--what do you \n     think of that?\n\n[[Page S3414]]\n\n       Answer. Well, it remains to be seen. They slowed the \n     expenditures of government. They made the Democrats pause and \n     look and listen. In fact, the only reason (President) Clinton \n     got elected the last time is because he foreclosed (GOP \n     presidential hopeful Bob) Dole on all his issues. He took his \n     issues away from him.\n       Question. You mean he adopted Sen. Dole's platform and \n     turned it into his own? When we talked last week, you \n     mentioned that you think Bill Clinton is the cleverest \n     president since Franklin Roosevelt. Why do you say that?\n       Answer. He can turn it around on a dime, and nobody ever \n     notices. I give that fellow (former presidential consultant \n     Dick) Morris credit for that. President Clinton was talking \n     about gays in the military and divisive things like that, and \n     (Morris) takes over his campaign and turns it around 180 \n     degrees. He took Dole's issues away from him, and he got \n     elected on Dole's issues.\n       Question. What do you think of President Clinton's \n     performance so far?\n       Answer. I'd give him a plus on some things, like turning \n     away from his liberal policies and adopting basic \n     conservative policies and getting elected.\n       Question. What are some minuses?\n       Answer. Shifting around and not having any strong opinions \n     on anything.\n       Questions. What do you think of U.S. Sen. Paul Coverdell, \n     the man who holds the seat you held so long?\n       Answer. I don't know Coverdell well. I've had two or three \n     conversations with him. But I've been impressed with him. I \n     check his voting record every week in the Sunday paper. I \n     like the way he votes. Thus far, I think his voting record \n     has been good. I agree with him more than 90 percent of \n     the time. I think he's doing all right.\n       Question. What concerns you most about government in 1997?\n       Answer. Too much taxes. Too much regulation. Too much \n     expenditure. Basically, the government does for people what \n     they cannot do for themselves.\n       Question. What about society? What do you think of society \n     in general?\n       Answer. It reminds me of the latter days of the Roman \n     Empire. We have gotten away from faith and values, the things \n     that made this country great. It's a sad commentary. Crime is \n     rampant, and children are being born out of wedlock and \n     looking to their government for support. There's declining \n     morality and a lack of discipline all over the country.\n       Question. What should be done to turn things around?\n       Answer. We should have substitute fathers and mothers for \n     these (parentless and single-parent) people. They could teach \n     them values while they're young. The substitutes would be \n     role models for them. They would have role models besides \n     prostitutes and drug peddlers.\n       Question. How would you hook up youngsters with the \n     substitutes?\n       Answer. It would take an organized effort on the part of \n     all churches in the country, all of the governments in the \n     country, all of the civic clubs in the country. It would be \n     the most mammoth undertaking we've had in a long time. But it \n     could save the country. It would take a long time. But a good \n     start would be to save 50 children in Henry County (where \n     Talmadge lives).\n       Question. You've had a few bouts with the news media. What \n     do you think of the media?\n       Answer. They've adopted a new policy since World War II \n     when I first started out in politics. They used to want to \n     know why, who, where, what, when and how. Those were \n     fundamental virtues of journalism. The journalism teachers \n     instilled those fundamental virtues in their students. Now, \n     they're prosecutors of anybody holding public office. A \n     politician has to prove his innocence every day. (Media) \n     treats everyone as if they're crooks.\n       Question. How is the world different today from what it was \n     before you retired?\n       Answer. The collapse of communism has made it a different \n     world. Freedom is beginning to be brought to all countries \n     throughout the world, almost all of them. During my days in \n     the Senate, we wondered what was going to prevail, communism \n     or freedom.\n       Question. What are you most proud of?\n       Answer. My accomplishments as governor of the state of \n     Georgia. I think Georgia made its greatest progress when I \n     was governor. It became truly the Empire State of the South. \n     It's been making progress since that time in building \n     schools, protecting natural resources, building roads and \n     bridges--you name it. We paved 10,000 miles of roads. We gave \n     teachers a raise in salary of over 100 percent. We built new \n     buildings. We built health centers and hospitals throughout \n     the state. When I took office, the only hospitals we had in \n     Georgia were a few in the larger cities. If a person had an \n     accident in rural Georgia, they had to go to Macon or \n     Savannah or Jacksonville, Fla., to get treatment. Now they're \n     all over.\n       Question. If you were running for office today, what would \n     your platform be?\n       Answer. It would be what I've always run on--economical \n     government, service to the constituency and hard work.\n       Question. What advice would you give to anyone who'd \n     listen?\n       Answer. Work hard and stay out of trouble. Save your money \n     and make prudent investments. Take an Egyptian or Indian who \n     comes to this country. They don't speak the English language, \n     and they work for minimum wage. But they save half their \n     money. In a few years, they're wealthy. They save their money \n     and make prudent investments.\n       Once an avid hunter, Talmadge no longer pursues that sport \n     because of his arthritic knees, but he spends many hours \n     fishing in one of the five lakes near his home in Hampton. \n     After he finished the interview, he sat down to rest in his \n     leather recliner sitting between a portrait of himself on the \n     rear wall and a portrait of his famous father, Gene Talmadge, \n     over the mantel.\n       ``Come see me in two or three months,'' Talmadge smiled and \n     said. ``When the weather warms up, we'll go fishing.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3413-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on April 17, 1997, the Senate Committee on \nRules and Administration adopted rules of procedure as a supplement to \nthe Committee Rules of Procedure for the purpose of the committee's \ninvestigation of the election for U.S. Senator in the State of \nLouisiana in 1996.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the rules of procedure be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Committee on Rules and Administration Committee Motion\n\n              (As passed by the Committee, April 17, 1997)\n\n       Whereas, the United States Constitution, Article I, Section \n     5 provides that the Senate is ``the Judge of the Elections, \n     Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members * * *'';\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court has reviewed this \n     Constitutional provision on several occasions and has held: \n     ``[The Senate] is the judge of elections, returns and \n     qualifications of its members. * * * It is fully empowered, \n     and may determine such matters without the aid of the House \n     of Representatives or the Executive or Judicial Department,'' \n     [Reed et al. v. The County Comm'rs of Delaware County, Penn., \n     277 U.S. 376, 388 (1928)]; and\n       Whereas, in the course of Senate debate, it has been \n     stated: ``The Constitution vested in this body not only the \n     power but the duty to judge, when there is a challenged \n     election result involving the office of U.S. Senator.'' \n     [Congressional Record Vol. 121, Part 1, p. 440].\n       Therefore, the Committee on Rules and Administration, \n     having been given jurisdiction over ``contested elections'' \n     under Rule 25 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, authorizes \n     the Chairman, in consultation with the ranking minority \n     member, to direct and conduct an Investigation of such scope \n     as deemed necessary by the Chairman, into illegal or improper \n     activities to determine the existence or absence of a body of \n     fact that would justify the Senate in making the \n     determination that fraud, irregularities or other errors, in \n     the aggregate, affected the outcome of the election for \n     United States Senator in the state of Louisiana in 1996.\n       This Committee Motion will operate in conjunction with and \n     concurrent to the Standing Rules of the Senate. In addition, \n     the following Rules of Procedure are applicable, as a \n     supplement to the Committee Rules of Procedure:\n       A. Full Committee subpoenas: The chairman, with the \n     approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     chairman\n\n[[Page S3415]]\n\n     may subpoena attendance or production without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him has not received notification from \n     the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by \n     him of disapproval of the subpoena within 72 hours, excluding \n     Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the subpoena. If \n     a subpoena is disapproved by the ranking minority member as \n     provided in this section, the subpoena may be authorized by \n     vote of the members of the Committee. When the Committee \n     or chairman authorizes subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued \n     upon the signature of the chairman or any other member of \n     the Committee designated by the chairman.\n       B. Quorum: One member of the Committee shall constitute a \n     quorum for taking sworn or unsworn testimony.\n       C. Swearing Witnesses: All witnesses at public or executive \n     hearings who testify to matters of fact shall be sworn. Any \n     Member of the Committee is authorized to administer an oath.\n       D. Witness Counsel: Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition, and to advise such witness \n     while he is testifying, of his legal rights. Provided, \n     however, that in the case of any witness who is an officer or \n     employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association, or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during deposition by Committee staff or \n     consultant or during testimony before the Committee by \n     personal counsel not from the government, corporation, or \n     association, or by personal counsel not representing other \n     witnesses. This rule shall not be construed to excuse a \n     witness from testifying in the event his counsel is ejected \n     for conducting himself in such a manner so as to prevent, \n     impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the orderly \n     administration of the hearings; nor shall this rule be \n     construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Full Committee depositions: Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this section.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of \n     the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that \n     the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him has not received notification from \n     the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by \n     him of disapproval of the deposition within 72 hours, \n     excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the \n     deposition notice. If a deposition notice is disapproved by \n     the ranking minority member as provided in this subsection, \n     the deposition notice may be authorized by a vote of the \n     members of the Committee.

Mr. President, the city of Louisville and the U.S. Air \nForce have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they know how to \nthrow a party. On Saturday, April 20, 44 tons of fireworks were loaded \nonto barges in the Ohio River and 225 food booths dished up everything \nfrom corn dogs to barbecue to Cajun wings. The armed services brought \n130 planes, including nearly every type of aircraft owned by the Air \nForce, helicopters, jets, and vintage planes.\n  When the party began, as many as 650,000 people were given the \nperformance of a lifetime. Thunder Over Louisville, part of the \nKentucky Derby Festival, has already gained a reputation as a one-of-a-\nkind air show and fireworks display. But I think everyone agreed that \nthis year will be hard to top.\n  Called Wild Blue Thunder in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the \nU.S. Air Force, it was the world's largest show of its kind in America, \nboth for the fireworks display and for the air performances.\n  The fireworks were reported to be larger than the opening and closing \nof the Atlanta Olympics combined and of the Inaugural fireworks. The \nimpressive show culminated in an 11,000-foot waterfall of fireworks off \nthe Clark Memorial Bridge.\n  The television and radio commercials for Thunder Over Louisville use \nthe tag line ``you haven't seen anything until you've seen \neverything.'' The Air Force and other armed services certainly pulled \nout all the stops with air performances showcasing the ``Thunderbirds \nUSAF Aerobatic Team,'' the F-117A stealth fighter, the B-2 stealth \nbomber, the SR-71A strategic reconnaissance plane, the B-1B long range \nstrategic bomber, F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, the A-10 Warthog tank killer \njet fighter, the F-15 Eagle jet fighter, the T-33 Thunderbird, and \nApache and Blackhawk helicopters.\n  The Louisville Courier Journal reported that the F-117 stealth \nfighter was a crowd pleaser, along with the Army's impressive \nhelicopter assault demonstration on the two floating bridges in the \nmiddle of the Ohio River. And after the 123d's C-130H demonstration, I \ncan assure my colleagues the Pentagon doesn't stand a chance of taking \nthem out of Kentucky.\n  I want to commend the city of Louisville, the Derby Festival, the \nU.S. Air Force, and Kentucky's 123d for putting on such an incredible \nshow. Not only were the performances simply spectacular, but despite \nthe magnitude of the crowd, I found the event to be managed with few \nglitches.\n  This was truly a day for family. And from parking to crowd control, \ncity, Air Force, and National Guard officials did everything possible \nto make sure Kentucky families could enjoy themselves safely and \nwithout hassles.\n  Mr. President, let me close by congratulating the Air Force for their \n50th\n\n[[Page S3416]]\n\nanniversary. Their service to this country is immeasureable as is our \ngratitude to all our Air Force service men and women. A big thanks also \ngoes to all those involved with Saturday's event. I look forward to \ngoing back next year and seeing the festival officials, the city, the \narmed services, and the National Guard try and top this year's \nsensational performance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3415-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3416-S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FAMILY IMMIGRATION, SMALL BUSINESS, AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, over the past 30 years, family \nimmigration has contributed to a virtual renaissance of small business \nculture in the United States, according to Prof. Jimy M. Sanders of the \nUniversity of South Carolina, a witness at a recent hearing of the \nSenate Immigration Subcommittee. His examination of census data and \nfield research shows that the family is an institution that embodies an \nimportant form of social capital that immigrants draw on and that the \ncommon self-interests of family members provide financial and labor \nresources crucial to establishing successful enterprises.\n  At the hearing we heard testimony from four immigrant entrepreneurs \nwho were sponsored by family members and whose life experiences \nsupported Professor Sanders' findings:\n  Ilija Letica, an immigrant born in the former Yugoslavia, started \nLetica Corp. as a family business, and still employs several family \nmembers. Today, the manufacturer of plastic and paper packaging \nproducts headquartered in Rochester, MI, employs 1,800 people in 10 \nother States as well--Delaware, Oklahoma, Iowa, Alabama, Nevada, \nIndiana, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Tennessee, and Georgia. His daughter \nMara Letica testified that her father witnessed the effects of \ncommunism: No food, no freedom, no opportunity, and ultimately \nimmigrated to America so he could fulfill his entrepreneurial dreams.\n  Adrian Gaspar, born in Portugal, employs more than 20 people in \nMassachusetts at his firm Adrian A. Gaspar and Co., LLP. His company \nprovides tax services to 400 small companies and over 1,400 \nindividuals. He is proud that his office sits in the same building \nwhere his mother sewed clothes in the hope that she could make a better \nfuture for her son.\n  Perhaps the most inspiring testimony came from Ovidiu Colea, founder \nof Colbar Art, Inc., which manufactures sculptures and art \nreproductions in New York. He dreamed of seeing the Statue of Liberty \nwith his own eyes, when an armed guard captured him trying to escape to \nAmerica. Communist authorities imprisoned him for 5 years in a Romanian \nlabor camp. After 15 more years of wait, he finally made it to America, \ndrove a cab, swept floors, and saved his money to buy a factory, which \ntoday is the country's largest producer of replicas of the Statue of \nLiberty.\n  Finally, we heard from John Tu, president of Fountain Valley, CA-\nbased Kingston Technology, a leading manufacturer of computer memory \nproducts for personal computers. Mr. Tu, born in China, immigrated to \nAmerica after being sponsored by his sister. He and fellow immigrant \nDavid Sun employ over 500 people and built the company, started as a \nfamily based business operating out of a garage, into a company they \nsold last year for $1 billion. Both Mr. Tu and Mr. Sun took the $1 \nbillion in profits from the sale of the company and gave $100 million \nto their employees, most of them native born, resulting in bonuses \nranging from $100,000 to $300,000 per employee. ``Only in America,'' \nMr. Tu testified, ``could this happen.''\n  Gary MacDonald, a native born employee of Kingston Technology, \npointedly noted in his testimony that four of the five high-growth \ncompanies that he has worked for in his career were started by \nimmigrant entrepreneurs.\n  Overall, immigrants are approximately 10 to 20 percent more likely \nthan the native born to start a new business in this country, and more \nthan 1 in 10 legal immigrants own their own businesses. In addition, in \n1995, 12 percent of the Inc. 500--a compilation of the fastest growing \ncorporations in America--were companies started by immigrants. It is \nimportant to have a discussion about both what is right and wrong with \ndifferent aspects of U.S. immigration policy. But any balanced debate \non legal immigration must take into account the economic and social \ncontributions made by the 1 in 10 legal immigrants who own small and \nlarge businesses in this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Colea's testimony be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the testimony was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Testimony of Ovidiu Colea, President, Colbar Art Incorporated--Before \n   the Subcommittee on Immigration, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n                         Senate--April 15, 1997\n\n       Good morning Senator Abraham and subcommittee members, good \n     morning ladies and gentlemen. My name is Ovidiu Colea, I am \n     the founder and the president of Colbar Art Inc., \n     manufacturer of sculptures and art reproductions, located on \n     Long Island City, in New York State. It is a great pleasure \n     and honor for me to be invited here. With your permission, I \n     would like to take some time to testify through my own \n     experience about the positive side and the benefits of the \n     legal immigration in the United States. I would like your \n     permission to use some parts of my life story to better \n     understand why the liberty and freedom from this country can \n     change some lives forever and bring many benefits to this \n     country.\n       I was born in Bucharest, Romania in 1939, during the \n     beginning of World War II in Europe. That war changed for a \n     long time the lives of people from many countries. After the \n     war ended in 1945, when the paranoia communists came to power \n     in many countries, many people left their home countries, but \n     many could not. One of those people was my own father. When I \n     grew older, I grew up with that missing spirit of liberty and \n     freedom. I spent time together with my father night after \n     night and year after year enjoying the only liberty. For 30 \n     minutes each night, we got together in the house with the \n     lights turned off and listening to our only hope, two radio \n     stations, Voice of America and Free Europe. This was the only \n     freedom we could afford.\n       When I was 18, I took my way to liberty, hoping to reach my \n     dream. I decided to leave the country in order to come to \n     America. In the summer of 1958, I decided to cross the border \n     to swim over the Danube River on the night. I hid myself in \n     the corn fields for many hours near the river, waiting for \n     the night. When I felt the cold metal of the guard's gun \n     pointing on my head, on that moment, my way to freedom and \n     liberty was closed. I was arrested, then sent to a prison \n     labor camp for the next 5 years. What was my crime? I wanted \n     to be free, to have liberty and to reach America. Five years \n     of starvation, physical punishment, long hours of labor in \n     hot and cold weather, sleeping on the floor, eating the roots \n     of the plants and digging for growing seeds in the soil and \n     being punished for trying to learn a foreign language. \n     Nothing of this changed my determination of trying to come to \n     America. After two decades, I came to America with a visa. \n     When I came to the United States, I was penniless, but this \n     country gave me hope.\n       My first job in 1978 was working in a casting factory, \n     making $3.00 an hour. In the night, which was my second job, \n     I drove a taxi in New York City. I also had a third job, \n     which I worked during the weekends for over 3 years. I got \n     married and had two children. After 9 months working for a \n     company, I was laid off. After 1 week of unemployment, I \n     opened a partnership company, Barrett-Colea.\n       In 1982, my company won a contract from AT for an Olympic \n     project to make 65,000 replicas for the Olympic commemorative \n     in Los Angeles, the largest sculpture reproduction ever \n     produced in the United States of America. The company created \n     many jobs for this project. In 1985, my company applied for \n     and won a license from the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island \n     Foundation. We gained the right to use the symbol of the \n     Statue of Liberty on our product. The replicas of my \n     company's product, which are made only in the United States, \n     were presented to President Reagan, who sent us a beautiful \n     letter of recognition of our effort on May 12, 1986.\n       Many jobs were created and through their hard work, the \n     company was able to par- \n\n[[Page S3417]]\n\n     ticipate on the national effort to restore the Statue of \n     Liberty, our Nation's most precious symbol of liberty and \n     freedom. Our replicas are used by the INS and other \n     institutions around the United States of America. The company \n     made a new advancement in the art field, developing new \n     reproduction methods using acrylic. This technology is only \n     available in the United States, which gave our country the \n     advantage in the art field. In 1986, I applied for and \n     obtained a patent on a new technique of embodiment for \n     acrylic sculptures. In 1988, my new company, Colbar Art Inc., \n     consisted of 5 employees developed new technique and \n     reproduction methods.\n       In 1989, my new company, Colbar Art Inc., began a project \n     with the Buddhist Association of America in Carmel, NY, a \n     project to build the biggest statue of the Buddha in the \n     United States of America, which will stand 37 feet high. This \n     project created new jobs for the company, the largest of its \n     type in the United States. The project took 3 years to \n     complete. At present through my company s efforts, the jobs \n     created over the time increased year after year. At the \n     present time, the company employs more than 30 people, among \n     them, many are immigrants.\n       At present, my company is the largest manufacturer of \n     Statue of Liberty replicas in the United States and a large \n     number of my employees are working to preserve the beauty of \n     our symbol of freedom. At the same time, the company is \n     manufacturing the best high quality limited edition \n     reproduction of acrylic sculptures, which are made only in \n     our company.\n       A new challenge faces American companies and the challenge \n     comes from the emerging economic power with low labor costs. \n     In order to be more competitive in this market, American \n     companies must find people to employ on a priority basis \n     which mean American companies must be able to employ the \n     right person at the right time. Any delay could greatly \n     affect the success or failure of the company. Despite the low \n     labor costs on other countries, I chose to keep the jobs in \n     my country, America, giving back something that she gave to \n     me. I thank my country for the opportunity that was given to \n     me. American companies must do everything possible to make \n     jobs available primarily for our people first.\n       Mr. Chairman and subcommittee members, I thank you very \n     much for your time and I hope my experience will be seen as a \n     positive contribution of one immigrant who loves this \n     country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3416-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      13TH ANNUAL TUFTONIA'S WEEK CELEBRATION AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week marks the 13th annual \nobservance of Tuftonia's Week by Tufts University in Medford, MA, in \nwhich many Tufts alumni from around the world return to honor their \noutstanding university. This celebration has special meaning for me. My \ndaughter, Kara, is a graduate of Tufts, and I've worked closely with \nmany scholars at Tufts for many years on a wide variety of public \npolicy issues. I am proud to count myself as a member of the Tufts \nfamily.\n  For the second year in a row, the theme of Tuftonia's Week is \ncommunity service. Participants will honor the large number of Tufts \ngraduates across the country who are volunteering in their communities \nand helping to improve the lives of others in their neighborhoods \nthrough the TuftServe Program. Last year, Tufts alumni contributed more \nthan 218,000 volunteer hours.\n  Tufts deserves great credit for its leadership among the Nation's \nuniversities in emphasizing service learning and providing \nopportunities for students to combine community service with their \nacademic curriculum. Programs like TuftServe are the types of service \ninitiatives that will be highlighted at the President's Summit for \nAmerica's Future, beginning next Sunday, April 27. The summit will \nreaffirm our national commitment to community service. Every American \nshould have the opportunity to participate in projects that help others \nand improve their community.\n  I congratulate Tufts for giving their students that opportunity. I am \nhonored to take this opportunity to commend Tufts' President, John \nDiBiaggio, and the many others in the Tufts community for their \nimpressive accomplishments in enhancing education and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3417-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nLEGISLATION TO RESTORE ELIGIBILITY OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS FOR SSI AND FOOD \n                                 STAMPS\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, last year, the President and Congress \nenacted welfare legislation which I said was welfare repeal, not \nwelfare reform. At that time, researchers at the Urban Institute \nestimated 2.6 million people would fall below the poverty line because \nof the legislation, 1.1 million of them children. The same researchers \nprojected that 3.5 million children would be dropped from the rolls in \n2001 because of the time limits contained in the legislation.\n  During the debate last year, there was little attention given to the \nprovisions concerning the eligibility of legal immigrants for benefits. \nThese immigrants have come to America legally. They pay taxes and serve \nin our military. Yet the new law eliminates the eligibility of these \nimmigrants--should misfortune strike them--for SSI and food stamps, and \nit severely limits their eligibility for TANF and Medicaid. Many legal \nimmigrants affected by these restrictions are elderly. In my own State \nof New York, they might be frail disabled survivors of the Holocaust, \nor refugees from the former Soviet Union who are about to lose their \nonly means of support. This situation has come to our attention now \nbecause it is among the first parts of the bill to be implemented.\n  The President has proposed restoring eligibility for SSI to those \nlegal immigrants who become disabled after entering this country. He \nhas also proposed permitting refugees and asylees additional time \nbefore becoming subject to the various restrictions, in light of the \ndifficult circumstances under which they arrive on our shores. I \nsupport these proposals, although I regret that enactment of the \nwelfare repeal law has made this new legislation necessary.\n  I am pleased to join with colleagues of both parties in introducing \nlegislation to continue SSI and food stamp benefits to those legal \nimmigrants already receiving them and to permanently exempt refugees \nand asylees from the eligibility restrictions. This is a good first \nstep in addressing the immediate and pressing needs of these \nimmigrants, and I urge our fellow Senators to join us in this effort. \nIt represents the beginning of a bipartisan discussion on how to \naddress this issue, and I commend the legislation to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3417-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate on April 18, 1997, received a message from \nthe President of the United States submitting a withdrawal and a \nnomination which was referred to the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  The nomination received on April 18, 1997, is shown in today's Record \nat the end of the Senate proceedings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3417-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3417-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3417-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3417-S3418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on April 18, 1997, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1003.

A bill to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of \n1935, to enact the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1997, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n             the public utility holding company act of 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I introduce the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act of 1997. This legislation is substantively \nidentical to S. 1317 which the Senate Banking Committee reported in the \n104th Congress. The bill would repeal the Public Utility Holding \nCompany Act of 1935, [PUHCA] and would transfer residual regulatory \nauthority from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission and State public service commissions.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is introduced with the bipartisan \ncosponsorship of Senators Murkowski, Dodd, Sarbanes, Gramm, Shelby, \nMack, Faircloth, Allard, Lott, Domenici, Akaka, Inouye, Coats, Cochran, \nRoberts, Brownback, Coverdell, and Specter.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would eliminate duplicative, \nunnecessary regulation which unfairly burdens a few utility holding \ncompanies. It would allow holding companies to improve service and \npossibly lower the costs of consumers' utility bills. The bill would \nenhance existing regulatory tools and provide State and Federal \nregulators new authority to ensure that they can protect energy \nconsumers from unfair rate increases.\n  PUHCA was originally enacted more than six decades ago to regulate \npublic utility holding companies. At that time, this Federal statute \nwas needed to fill the regulatory gap that enabled holding companies to \nconceal assets by creating and speculating in public utility companies.\n  Mr. President, PUHCA has achieved the congressional purpose--it broke \nup the mammoth holding company structures that existed more than half a \ncentury ago. PUHCA is not only outdated, it is the relic of a different \nera. Today there is strong regulation of the energy industry at the \nState and Federal level. In addition, the Federal securities laws' \nregistration and disclosure requirements have become effective tools \nfor the SEC to protect investors and ensure the integrity of the market \nfor public utility holding company securities.\n  Originally enacted to protect consumers and investors, PUHCA has \nbecome an unnecessary impediment to efficient and flexible business \noperations. Currently, there are 180 public utility holding companies \nin the United States. Of these 180 companies, 165 are exempt from PUHCA \nand only 15 companies are subject to direct SEC regulation. As a \nresult, PUHCA imposes a burdensome regulatory scheme on these 15 \nregistered holding companies and prevents them from diversifying into \nnew business areas. PUHCA keeps these holding companies from \ndiversifying, limits their growth opportunities and options, and \nrequires the companies to apply for SEC permission to engage in almost \nall new business activities.\n  PUHCA also hinders the growth of nonregistered, exempt holding \ncompanies. Once exempt companies expand their business across State \nlines they too become subject to PUHCA's restrictions. As a result, \nexempt companies refrain from expanding across State lines even when \nsuch a move would lead to cheaper and more efficiently produced energy \nfor consumers. Similarly, PUHCA prevents non-utility holding companies \nfrom diversifying into utility business.\n\n  Mr. President, PUHCA is more than just another example of Government \noverregulation--it is an impediment to both the deregulation of the \nenergy industry and to the growth and diversification of existing \nbusinesses. Since many States have begun to deregulate the energy \nindustry and Congress plans to review energy reform issues, the time \nfor PUHCA reform is now. This year, in my own backyard, Long Island, \ntwo utility companies will merge.\n\n[[Page S3420]]\n\n This merger is expected to reduce energy bills for Long Island energy \ncustomers who currently pay the highest rates for energy in the \ncontinental U.S. The merger will not only lead to lower rates, but it \nshould also mean better service for customers.\n  While Long Island's energy customers can finally look forward to \nlower rates, PUHCA prevents other utility companies from expanding, \nmerging, and offering new services to consumers. Like any other utility \nmerger, the State, the FERC and other Federal regulators will have to \napprove this merger. Under PUHCA, if either of these companies was a \nregistered holding company or the merger involved companies from \nneighboring States, the companies would also have to seek SEC approval \nof the merger in advance and at all subsequent stages of restructuring. \nFor example, if this merger included utility companies from New Jersey \nor Connecticut, PUHCA's restrictions on diversification and burdensome \nrequirements, could have prevented a merger that would benefit \nconsumers, investors, and business.\n  As one of the leaders in energy deregulation, New York State provides \nan example of why PUHCA reform is necessary now. Without PUHCA reform, \ncompanies will choose alternative corporate structures to avoid PUHCA's \nrestrictive requirements, preventing the efficient restructuring of the \nenergy industry. Congress must reform PUHCA so that the energy industry \nwill be efficient and consumers can realize the reduction in rates and \nimprovement in services they deserve.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today follows the SEC's Division \nof Investment Management's 1995 recommendation to conditionally repeal \nPUHCA since ``the current regulatory system imposes significant costs, \nin direct administrative charges and foregone economies of scale and \nscope, that often cannot be justified in terms of benefits to utility \ninvestors.'' The legislation has been crafted in consultation with \nState and Federal utility regulators, public interest groups, the \nSenate Energy Committee, and both registered and non-registered utility \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize the purpose of the bill. The Public \nUtility Company Act of 1997 would maintain the provisions of the 1935 \nAct essential to consumer protection. In fact, the bill enhances \nconsumer safeguards by enabling energy regulators to oversee all \nholding company operations. Specifically, the bill makes it easier for \nFERC and State public service commissions to protect consumers from \npaying nonutility related costs by giving the regulators expanded \nauthority to review the books and records of all holding company \nactivities to determine energy rates. At the same time, the bill would \npreserve FERC's authority to review transactions, acquisitions, and \nmergers of utilities and would clarify the FERC and state commission's \nauthority to allocate costs when setting rates. The bill also gives \nstate commissions vital enforcement backup to ensure that they can \naccess all the books and records necessary to make rate determinations.\n\n  Mr. President, the goal of PUHCA reform is increased competition--to \nmake sure consumers ultimately pay lower utility rates not higher ones. \nWhile some would prefer to address PUHCA reform in the larger context \nof comprehensive energy deregulation, there is no reason to delay \nconsideration of this separate bill I introduce today. Rather than \npackage PUHCA with comprehensive reform of the federal energy laws, \nPUHCA reform can proceed, on a stand alone basis, as it does not affect \nthe larger energy issues which my knowledgeable colleagues on the \nEnergy Committee are considering.\n  In fact, the experts in the energy field, lead by the distinguished \nchairman and former ranking member of the Energy Committee, Senators \nMurkowski and Johnston, who testified before the Banking Committee on \nthis issue last year, believe that PUHCA reform should move \nindependently of, and separate from, full energy deregulation. PUHCA \nreform is a necessary first step in creating an efficient energy \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, I have been a proponent of PUHCA reform for 16 years. \nCongress should allow consumers access to the cheapest power and the \nbest services by repealing this burdensome and unnecessary law. The \nAmerican people deserve and expect an efficient energy industry \nunfettered by unnecessary regulation. The legislation I introduce today \naccomplishes this by removing the energy industry from the 60-year-old \nregulatory shackles put in place by PUHCA. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation so that we may provide consumers with a highly \nefficient energy market that has better consumer protections.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was \n     intended to facilitate the work of Federal and State \n     regulators by placing certain constraints on the activities \n     of holding company systems;\n       (2) developments since 1935, including changes in other \n     regulation and in the electric and gas industries, have \n     called into question the continued relevance of the model of \n     regulation established by that Act;\n       (3) there is a continuing need for limited Federal and \n     State regulation in order to ensure the rate protection of \n     utility customers; and\n       (4) limited Federal regulation is necessary to supplement \n     the work of State commissions for the continued rate \n     protection of electric and gas utility customers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to eliminate unnecessary regulation, yet continue to \n     provide for consumer protection by facilitating existing rate \n     regulatory authority through improved Federal and State \n     commission access to books and records of all companies in a \n     holding company system, to the extent that such information \n     is relevant to rates paid by utility customers, while \n     affording companies the flexibility required to compete in \n     the energy markets; and\n       (2) to address protection of electric and gas utility \n     customers by providing for Federal and State access to books \n     and records of all companies in a holding company system that \n     are relevant to utility rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to cosponsor the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act of 1997. Enactment of this legislation is long \noverdue.\n  Mr. President, the Public Utility Holding Company Act was enacted in \n1935 to curb serious abuses by utilities that hurt consumers. Back then \nit was needed, but since then much has\n\n[[Page S3422]]\n\nchanged. As a result, PUHCA now does more harm than good.\n  This legislation will eliminate unnecessary regulation. It will also \nstreamline and make more effective the regulation that is still needed. \nBy doing so, it will promote competition in the electric power industry \nwithout jeopardizing consumer protections.\n  Over the past six decades, a comprehensive State-Federal regulatory \nsystem has been developed to protect consumers. In a nutshell, State \npublic utility commissions regulate transactions that are intrastate in \nnature, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulates those \nthat are interstate in nature. State commissions perform their \nregulatory activities pursuant to State law, and the FERC performs it \npursuant to the Federal Power Act.\n  With the maturity of both State and Federal utility regulation, PUHCA \nis now at best superflouous, but in some instances it actually \ninterferes with appropriate regulation. For example, the Ohio Power \ncourt case held that decisions by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission under PUHCA preempt FERC's regulatory authority over \nutilities under the Federal Power Act. This legislation solves that \nproblem by giving the FERC clear and exclusive authority to address \nmatters within its jurisdiction and expertise. It will also enhance the \nability of State regulatory agencies to do their jobs. In short, the \nstreamlining of the regulatory system proposed by this legislation will \nnot diminish needed consumer protection, and in several important ways \nit will actually enhance it.\n  If the regulatory system created by PUHCA were necessary for consumer \nprotection, then the regulatory burdens it imposes might be justified. \nBut as everyone now acknowledges, PUHCA is not needed to protect \nconsumers. As a result, regulatory costs caused by PUHCA are simply \npassed on to consumers in the form of higher rates without any \noffsetting consumer benefits.\n  Congress has long recognized that PUHCA creates problems. In 1978, \nthe Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act provided an exemption from \nPUHCA for certain types of electric power generators. In 1992, the \nEnergy Policy Act gave additional exemptions to certain other types of \nelectric power generators. These were Band-Aid fixes to PUHCA; needed, \nbut not a complete solution. Fundamental reform of PUHCA is needed and \nis justified. The time is ripe to streamline and modernize the act. It \nis for these reasons that I am cosponsoring Senator D'Amato's \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, there may be some who will try to use this legislation \nas a vehicle to restructure the electric utility industry, including to \nimpose retail wheeling or to federally preempt State public utility \ncommissions. I will strenuously resist any such effort. I have received \nassurances that Senator D'Amato is of like mind. This is not the place \nto do this. Retain wheeling and other utility competitive issues are \nnot linked to the issues involved in PUHCA reform. Moreover, retail \nwheeling and other Federal Power Act matters are entirely within the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, not the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, to which this \nlegislation will be referred. Electric utility issues are very complex, \nand they are very significant not only to consumers but also to this \nNation's competitiveness and economic well-being. These kinds of \nchanges cannot, and will not be made without careful and complete \nconsideration by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of all \naspects of the issues and questions they raise. That is why the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources is now in the process of \nreviewing the factors that affect the competitiveness of the electric \npower industry.\n  Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I am today cosponsoring \nthis legislation and I hope that it will soon be on the President's \ndesk for his signature.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Gregg, \n        Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Bond, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Nickles):\n  S. 622. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe application of the pension nondiscrimination rules to governmental \nplans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    nondiscrimination rules for government pension plans legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenators Conrad, Cochran, Gregg, Moseley-Braun, Enzi, Inouye, Baucus, \nReid, D'Amato, Kyl, Ashcroft, Domenici, Hagel, Bond, Thomas, and \nMurkowski that would make permanent the current moratorium on the \napplication of the pension nondiscrimination rules to State and local \ngovernment pension plans. During the last Congress, I introduced \nsimilar legislation as S. 2047. And this year, a similar provision was \nincluded in S. 14, introduced by Senator Daschle.\n  The current laws governing private pension plans contain specific \nrules aimed at ensuring that pension plans do not discriminate in favor \nof highly paid employees. For nearly 20 years, State and local \ngovernment pension plans have been deemed to satisfy these complex \nnondiscrimination rules until Treasury can figure out how or if these \nrules are applicable to unique government pension plans. This bill \nsimply puts an end to this stalled process and dispels two decades of \nuncertainty for administrators of State and local government retirement \nplans. Let me summarize the evolution of this issue and why this bill \nis being introduced today.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has long ago established a \npolicy of encouraging tax-deferred retirement savings. Most retirement \nplans that benefit employees are employer-sponsored tax-deferred \nretirement plans. Over the years, Congress has required that these \nplans meet strict nondiscrimination standards designed to ensure that \nthey do not provide disproportionate benefits to business owners, \nofficers, or highly compensated individuals relative to other \nemployees.\n  In response to the growing popularity of employer-sponsored tax-\ndeferred pension plans, Congress passed the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act [ERISA] in 1974 to enhance the rules governing pension \nplans. However, during consideration of ERISA, Congress recognized that \nnondiscrimination rules for private pension plans were not readily \napplicable to public pension plans because of the unique nature of \ngovernmental employers. Former Representative Al Ullman stated, during \nWays and Means Committee consideration of ERISA, that Congress was not \nprepared to apply nondiscrimination rules to public plans, saying that:\n\n       The committee exempted Government plans from the new higher \n     requirements because adequate information is not now \n     available to permit a full understanding of the impact these \n     new requirements would have on governmental plans.\n\n  After studying the issue, the Internal Revenue Service on August 10, \n1977, issued News Release IR-1869, which stated that issues concerning \ndiscrimination under State and local government retirement plans would \nnot be raised until further notice. Thus, an indefinite moratorium was \nplaced on the application of the new rules to government plans.\n\n  In 1986, Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which made \nfurther changes to pension laws and the general nondiscrimination \nrules. On May 18, 1989, the Department of the Treasury, in proposed \nregulations, lifted the 12-year public sector moratorium and required \nthat public sector plans comply with the new rules immediately. \nHowever, further examination revealed, and Treasury and the IRS \nrecognized, that a separate set of rules was required for State and \nlocal government plans because of their unique features.\n  Consequently, through final rules issued in September 1991, the \nTreasury reestablished the moratorium on a temporary basis until \nJanuary 1, 1993, and solicited comments for consideration. In addition, \nState and local government pension plans were deemed to satisfy the \nstatutory nondiscrimination requirements for years prior to 1993. Since \nthen, the moratorium has been extended three more times, the latest of \nwhich is in effect until 1999.\n  Mr. President, here we are, in April 1997, 23 years since the passage \nof\n\n[[Page S3423]]\n\nERISA, and State and local government pension plans are still living \nunder the shadow of having to comply with the cumbersome, costly, and \ncomplex nondiscrimination rules. Experience over the past 20 years has \nshown that the existing nondiscrimination rules have limited utility in \nthe public sector. Furthermore, the long delay in action illustrates \nthe seriousness of the problem and the doubtful issuance of \nnondiscrimination regulations by the Department of the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, during consideration of another extension of the \nmoratorium, a coalition of associations representative of State and \nlocal governmental plans summarized their current position in a letter \nto IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson dated October 13, 1995.\n\n       In our discussions with Treasury over the past two years, \n     there have been no abuses or even significant concerns \n     identified that would warrant the imposition of such a \n     cumbersome thicket of federal rules on public plans that \n     already are the subject of State and local government \n     regulation.\n       Accordingly, while we always remain open to further \n     discussion, as our Ways and Means statement indicates, the \n     experience of the past two years in working with Treasury to \n     develop a sensible and workable set of nondiscrimination \n     rules for governmental plans has convinced us that the task \n     ultimately is a futile one--portending tremendous cost, \n     complexity, and disruption of sovereign State operations in \n     the absence of any identifiable problem.\n\n  Mr. President, the sensible conclusion of this 20-year exercise is to \nadmit that the Treasury is not likely to issue regulations for State \nand local pension plans and Congress should make the temporary \nmoratorium permanent.\n  Furthermore, there are examples to support this legislation. Relief \nfrom the pension nondiscrimination rules is not a new concept. In \nreality, Mr. President, State and local government pension plans face a \nhigher level of scrutiny. State law generally requires publicly elected \nlegislators to amend the provisions of a public plan. Electoral \naccountability to the voters and media scrutiny serve as protections \nagainst abusive and discriminatory benefits.\n\n  Moreover, precedent exists for Congress to grant relief from the \nnondiscrimination rules. In 1986, the Congress established the Thrift \nSavings Fund for Federal employees. As originally enacted, the fund was \nrequired to comply with the 401(k) nondiscrimination rules on employee \ncontributions and matching contributions to the fund. However, in 1987, \nas part of a Continuing Appropriations Act for 1988, the Congress \npassed a provision that made these nondiscrimination rules inapplicable \nto the Federal Thrift Savings Fund. Thus, Congress has reaffirmed the \nneed to treat governmental pension plans as unique.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not sweeping, nor does it grant \nany new treatment to these plans. Because of the moratorium, \ngovernmental plans are currently treated as satisfying the \nnondiscrimination rules. Lifting the moratorium would impose on \ngovernmental pension plans the cost task of testing for discrimination \nwhen no significant abuses or concerns exist. In fact, finally imposing \nthe nondiscrimination rules at this juncture may require benefits to be \nreduced for State and local government employees and force costly \nmodifications to these retirement plans. This legislation coincides \nwith the principle of allowing a State to enjoy the right to determine \nthe compensation of its employees.\n  Mr. President, with another expiration of the moratorium looming in \nthe future, I believe it is time to address this issue. I have no \nillusion that it will be resolved quickly. The complexities of these \nrules and the uniqueness of governmental plans have brought us to where \nwe are today. I believe that, as Senators better understand the history \nof this issue, they will agree with us that the appropriate step is to \nend this uncertainty and make the temporary moratorium permanent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This legislation, \noriginally introduced by Senator Hatch and myself in the 104th \nCongress, will provide relief to State and local governments from \nunnecessary and overly burdensome Federal regulations.\n  Pension nondiscrimination laws are to assure that workers at all \nlevels of employment are given access to the benefits of tax-exempt \npension plans. As employers, State and local governments employ a wide \nrange of workers, from judges to firefighters to teachers. Each \noccupation requires that its unique circumstances be considered when \ndetermining pension benefits. Laws that were created by the Federal \nGovernment do not adequately address the needs of the diverse work \nforce of State and local governments.\n  Public pension plans are negotiated by popularly elected governments \nand subject to public scrutiny. They do not require a high degree of \nFederal review. The process of enacting these plans promotes fair \nbenefits for governmental employees. Public pension plans have been \ngiven temporary exemption from nondiscrimination laws for almost 20 \nyears, and the result is that full-time public employees enjoy almost \ntwice the pension coverage rate of their counterparts in the private \nsector. It is time to make this temporary exemption permanent.\n  This bill enjoys a wide range of support from State and local \ngovernments, as well as public employee representatives. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Hatch and me, along with a bipartisan group \nof Senators, to ease the burden of Federal regulation on State and \nlocal governments. I look forward to this bill's consideration in \ncommittee and on the Senate floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 623. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to deem certain \nservice in the organized military forces of the\n\n[[Page S3424]]\n\nGovernment of the Commonwealth of the Phillipines and the Philippine \nScouts to have been active service for purposes of benefits under \nprograms administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; to the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n                THE FILIPINO VETERANS EQUITY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which \namends title 38, United States Code, to restore full veterans' \nbenefits, by reason of service to certain organized military forces of \nthe Philippine Commonwealth Army and the Philippine Scouts.\n  On July 26, 1942, President Roosevelt issued a military order that \ncalled members of the Philippine Commonwealth Army into the service of \nthe U.S. Forces of the Far East. Under the command of Gen. Douglas \nMacArthur, our Filipino allies joined American soldiers in fighting \nsome of the most fiercest battles of World War II.\n  From the onset of the war through February 18, 1946, Filipinos who \nwere called into service under President Roosevelt's order were \nentitled to full veterans' benefits by reason of their active service \nin our Armed Forces. Unfortunately, on February 18, 1946, the Congress \nenacted the Rescission Act of 1946 (now codified as section 107, title \n38, United States Code), which states that service performed by these \nFilipino veterans is not deemed as active service for purposes of any \nlaw of the United States conferring rights, privileges, or benefits. On \nMay 27, 1946, the Congress extended the limitation on benefits to the \nnew Philippine Scouts units.\n  Interestingly enough, section 107 denied Filipino veterans access to \nhealth care, particularly for nonservice connected disability, and \ndenied them other benefits such as pensions and home loan guarantees. \nAdditionally, section 107 limited the benefits received for service-\nconnected disabilities and death compensation to 50 percent of what was \nreceived by their American counterparts.\n  As a result, Filipino veterans sued to obtain relief from this \ndiscriminatory treatment. The U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia, on May 12, 1989, in Quiban versus U.S. Veterans \nAdministration, declared section 107 unconstitutional. However, the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed that ruling \nand the veterans did not file a petition for certiorari to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Thus, the Congress is the only hope for rectifying this \ninjustice.\n  For many years, Filipino veterans of World War II have sought to \ncorrect this injustice by seeking equal treatment for their valiant \nmilitary service in our Armed Forces. We must not ignore the \nrecognition they duly deserve as U.S. veterans. Accordingly, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure which would restore full veterans' \nbenefits, by reason of service, to our Filipino allies of World War II.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a competitive process for the awarding of \nconcession contracts in units of the National Park System, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE CONCESSION POLICY REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, as a part of the Earth Day celebration, I \nam, once again, introducing legislation to reform the concessions \npolicies of the National Park Service. This bill is very similar to a \nbill I sponsored in the 103d Congress--listen to this--which passed the \nSenate 90 to 9 and passed the House 386 to 30, but it is not yet law. \nIt repeals the 1965 Concessions Policy Act which has been over a 30-\nyear-old outrage.\n  My legislation would establish an open competitive process for \nawarding concessions contracts in units of the National Park System. It \nwill be a competitive process for the first time. These contracts are \nvery lucrative the way they are let under the 1965 act, and the \nAmerican people are getting shafted and have been for a very long time.\n  Instead of putting the money that we get today back into the Treasury \nfor general purposes, under my bill, the money we get from the \ncontracts will go to a special account for the use of the National Park \nService, and Lord only knows every study shows they need it.\n  This will be the 18th year that I have worked to reform the \nconcession policies of this country. The very first oversight hearing I \never held upon becoming chairman of the Parks Subcommittee in 1979 was \non this very issue. One has to have a lot of patience to operate around \nhere.\n  Since that time, there has been no telling how many reports, \nhearings, markups, floor debates there have been. Everybody agrees the \nexisting law ought to be changed, but in 18 years, with the most \ndiligent efforts I can put into it, it has not been changed, simply \nbecause the park concessioners have more clout with some Members of the \nSenate than have I. They have more clout than the American people have \nwith the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, let me just tell you what has been happening.\n  In 1995--that is the latest year for which we have complete \ninformation on these concession contracts--in 1995, the United States \nreceived just under $16 million in franchise fees on gross concession \nrevenues of $676 million, a whopping 2.4-percent return.\n  These contracts are almost handed down from generation to generation. \nThey probably put them in their will and give them to their first-born \nson. It is almost impossible to undo one. But the U.S. taxpayer had a \n2.4 percent return on $676 million of national park concessions fees \nlast year.\n  In all fairness, let me add this. Under the existing law, a \nconcessioner can also make improvements in the parks in consultation \nand agreement with the National Park Service. He can make improvements, \nhe might even build a new hotel--all kinds of things like that--and he \nis entitled then to take that into consideration as a part of his fee. \nBut even when you add that in, even when you add in the amount that \nconcessioners spend to improve the park, which, incidentally, is to \ntheir benefit because it invariably increases revenues, that increases \nthe amount we received to $40 million on $676 million, still only a \n5.9-percent return.\n  You can invest in a T-bill and do as well, but this is our land, our \nproperty, the reason tourists go there and spend their money, because \nit is a park that Congress, in its infinite wisdom, established. Any \nproperty owner in the United States should ask yourself this question: \nWould you lease your property out for that kind of return when it was \nproducing that kind of revenue for the lessee? You would not even \nconsider it.\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\n  A 5.9-percent return we are getting now is better than we have \nreceived in the past, but listen to this, just to show you how \nridiculous the current policy is. You will recall that Matsushita \nbought MCA, which owned the Yosemite Park and Curry Co., the \nconcessioner at Yosemite. So Matsushita, when they bought this company, \ninherited the concessions contract at Yosemite, which produces the most \nconcessions revenue of any park in the United States.\n  This will show what happens when you have competition. The people in \nthis place, incidentally, are supposed to believe in capitalism. They \nbelieve in competition. They believe if you leave it to the \nmarketplace, everything will work out just hunky-dory, except, it \nseems, for mining and concessions.\n  So, here was a contract that Matsushita gave up, and whoever got the \nnew contract was going to have to pay off a $62 million note.\n  What happened in this contract, Matsushita gave up the contract, the \nNational Park Foundation took it for 1 day just for transition \npurposes, and then Delaware North bid and was awarded the new contract, \nthe first time, I believe, in the history of the National Park Service, \nsince the old law, that a contract had been let competitively.\n  Would you like to know what happened? The year before this contract \nwas let, the taxpayers got a return from the Yosemite concessions \noperations of three-quarters of 1 percent. And the first year--the \nfirst year--Delaware North had it under the new, actually competitively \nlet contract; on over $80 million of gross revenues, the taxpayers \nreceived about a 16-percent return.\n  Why, Mr. President, do we continue to beat this dog about how \nimportant it is to rebuild these facilities in the parks and give a \nconcessioner credit for it and all that?\n  My bill eliminates the anticompetitive measures of the 1965 act, but \nit also recognizes that all concessions are not the same.\n  People come to me and say, ``How about the small operators? They're \nstruggling to make ends meet.'' Under my bill small family operations \ngrossing less than $500,000 a year would retain a preference to renew \ntheir contracts--so would outfitters and guide operators. Even though \nthey are not a major share of the revenue, we probably exempt 80 to 90 \npercent of the concession operations because most of them are \nadmittedly rather small. But my bill ensures that there will be open \ncompetition for the large contracts which generate over 90 percent of \nthe total concessions revenue.\n  As I have already pointed out, the revenues that we get under this \nbill will go straight into a special account to be used by the National \nPark Service, similar to the entrance fee legislation just enacted last \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, one of the major changes that is made in this bill is \nthe elimination of what is known as possessory interest. And here is \nthe way it has been working. A concessioner goes to the National Park \nService--this is just a hypothetical case--and says, ``We want to build \na hotel for $10 million.'' They work out the deal and the Park Service \napproves it.\n  What happens at that point is, they start depreciating that hotel. \nAny businessman does that, of course. So the concessioner starts \ndepreciating this $10 million hotel over a 30- or 40-year period, \nwhatever the IRS requires--let us assume it is a 40-year depreciation--\nand at the end of 20 years he has depreciated $5 million and has $5 \nmillion left to recover.\n  Under existing law, he is entitled to receive whatever he can get for \nthat hotel. If he surrenders the contract, or is kicked out, or for any \nother reason, loses his contract, he can receive literally the fair \nmarket value of the hotel, which may very well be $15 million. He only \npaid $10 million, he has a tax deduction of $5 million, and he can turn \nright around and sell it for $15 million and make that an obligation of \nthe next concessioner.\n  How much nonsense can you put in one law? You think about that. Now, \nyou talk about a bird's nest on the ground, that is possessory \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, there is one other provision in the old law that is \nequally as egregious. And that is the preferential right an incumbent \nconcessioner gets to renew his contract. Another hypothetical case--you \nhave a 15-year contract, we will say, in Yellowstone National Park. At \nthe end of the 15 years, the Park Service will put out a notice to \nanybody who might be interested to let them know if they would like to \nbid on the concessions operation at Yellowstone.\n  So let us assume that I would kind of like to have the Yellowstone \ncontract, so I go to the Park Service and say, ``I would like to bid on \nthis.'' And the Park Service says, ``That's just jakey. You go ahead \nand bid. Tell us what you would give us for it.'' But let me tell you \nsomething, whatever you bid, the guy who has the contract now is \nentitled meet your bid, and if so, he gets it.\n  You tell me, why would I spend a half-million dollars or whatever it \ntakes preparing a bid on something as significant as the concessions in \nYelowstone National Park, knowing that the person who has that contract \nnow need only meet my bid?\n  He may have paid a 2-percent return to the Federal Government last \nyear. I may be willing to pay 10 percent. And the \nincumbent concessioner knows what the contract is worth. So he comes in \nand says, ``Well, I'll give you 10 percent, too.'' So I ask you, if you \nare a businessman, who in his right mind is going to go out there and \nspend a lot of money preparing a bid, knowing that the person who has \nthe contract right now only need match your bid?\n\n  I hear a lot of talk on the floor of the Senate about good old \ncapitalism and good old competition and how it solves all problems. \nThis is the most egregious policy I can imagine and yet it has been \ngoing on for years and years.\n  But if we pass this bill it will not go on any more.\n  Mr. President, we have made some progress through the efforts of the \nadministration. However, they have gone about as far as they can go \njust doing things by regulation. They cannot do very much more. But I \ngive a lot of credit to Bruce Babbitt and President Clinton for at \nleast trying to bring some equity into this without changing the law.\n  But you know, we have a lot of Senators here who have good friends \nwho had the concession contract on some park in their State for 40 \nyears, and they just cannot see fit to change the law.\n  You know, the other night I was watching some show on NBC about \nmining and how egregious our mining policies are. I have worked on that \nfor about 8 years. And I think this year may finally be the year \nbecause it is getting to be a kind of a political hot potato for people \nwho are not from mining States to continue to allow that kind of \nripoff, rape, and pillage of the taxpayers. But I can tell you it is \nnot a bit worse than this concessions policy we have had for all these \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Such \n     possessory interest may be assigned, transferred, encumbered, \n     or relinquished.\n       (3) Upon the termination of a concession contract in effect \n     before the date of enactment of this title, the Secretary \n     shall determine the value of any outstanding possessory \n     interest applicable to the contract, such value to be \n     determined for all purposes on the basis of applicable laws \n     and contracts in effect on the day before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant \n     a possessory interest to a concessioner whose contract in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act does not \n     include recognition of a possessory interest.\n       (b) New Contracts.--(1)(A) With respect to a concession \n     contract entered into on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the value of any outstanding possessory interest \n     associated with such contract shall be set at the value \n     determined by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a)(3).\n       (B) As a condition of entering into a concession contract, \n     the value of any outstanding possesory interest shall be \n     reduced on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same \n     number of years as the time period associated with the \n     straight line depreciation of the structure, fixture, or \n     improvement associated with such possessory interest, as \n     provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and \n     regulations in effect on the day before the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (C) In the event that the contract expires or is terminated \n     prior to the elimination of any outstanding possessory \n     interest, the concessioner shall be entitled to receive from \n     the United States or the successor concessioner payment equal \n     to the remaining value of the possessory interest.\n       (D) A successor concessioner may not revalue any \n     outstanding possessory interest, nor the period of time over \n     which such interest is reduced.\n       (E) Title to any structure, fixture, or improvement \n     associated with any outstanding possessory interest shall be \n     vested in the United States.\n       (2)(A) If the Secretary determines during the competitive \n     selection process that all proposals submitted either fail to \n     meet the minimum requirements or are rejected (as provided in \n     section 7), the Secretary may, solely with respect to any \n     outstanding possessory interest associated with the contract \n     and established pursuant to a concession contract entered \n     into prior to the date of enactment of this Act, suspend the \n     reduction provisions of subsection (b)(1)(B) for the duration \n     of the contract, and re-initiate the competitive selection \n     process as provided in section 7.\n       (B) The Secretary may suspend such reduction provisions \n     only if the Secretary determines that the establishment of \n     other new minimum contract requirements is not likely to \n     result in the submission of satisfactory proposals, and that \n     the suspension of the reduction provisions is likely to \n     result in the submission of satisfactory proposals: Provided, \n     however, That nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to \n     require the Secretary to establish a minimum franchise fee at \n     a level below the franchise fee in effect for such contract \n     on the day before the expiration date of the previous \n     contract.\n       (c) New Structures.--(1) On or after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, a concessioner who constructs or acquires a new, \n     additional, or replacement structure, fixture, or improvement \n     upon land owned by the United States within a park, pursuant \n     to a concession contract, shall have an interest in such \n     structure, fixture, or improvement equivalent to the actual \n     original cost of acquiring or constructing such structure, \n     fixture, or improvement, less straight line depreciation over \n     the estimated useful life of the asset according to Generally \n     Accepted Accounting Principles: Provided, That in no event \n     shall the estimated useful life of such asset exceed the \n     depreciation period used for such asset for Federal income \n     tax purposes.\n       (2) In the event that the contract expires or is terminated \n     prior to the recovery of such costs, the concessioner shall \n     be entitled to receive from the United States or the \n     successor concessioner payment equal to the value of the \n     concessioner's interest in such structure, fixture, or \n     improvement. A successor concessioner may not revalue the \n     interest in such structure, fixture, or improvement, the \n     method of depreciation, or the estimated useful life of the \n     asset.\n       (3) Title to any such structure, fixture, or improvement \n     shall be vested in the United States.\n       (d) Insurance, Maintenance and Repair.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect the obligation of a concessioner to \n     insure, maintain, and repair any structure, fixture, or \n     improvement assigned to such concessioner and to insure that \n     such structure, fixture, or improvement fully complies with \n     applicable safety and health laws and regulations.\n\n     SEC. 13. RATES AND CHARGES TO PUBLIC.\n\n       The reasonableness of a concessioner's rates and charges to \n     the public shall, unless otherwise provided in the bid \n     specifications and contract, be judged primarily by \n     comparison with those rates and charges for facilities and \n     services of comparable character under similar conditions, \n     with due consideration for length of season, seasonal \n     variance, average percentage of occupancy, accessibility, \n     availability and costs of labor and materials, type of \n     patronage, and other factors deemed significant by the \n     Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 14. CONCESSIONER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.\n\n       (a) Regulations.--as soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish, after an \n     appropriate period for public comment, regulations \n     establishing standards and criteria for evaluating the \n     performance of concessions operating within parks.\n       (b) Periodic Evaluation.--(1) The Secretary shall \n     periodically conduct an evaluation of each concessioner \n     operating under a concession contract pursuant to this Act, \n     as appropriate, to determine whether such concessioner has \n     performed satisfactorily. In evaluating a concessioner's \n     performance, the Secretary shall seek and consider applicable \n     reports and comments from appropriate Federal, State, and \n     local regulatory agencies, and shall seek and consider the \n     applicable views of park visitors and concession customers. \n     If the Secretary's performance evaluation results in an \n     unsatisfactory rating of the concessioner's overall \n     operation, the Secretary shall provide the concessioner with \n     a list of the minimum requirements necessary for the \n     operation to be rated satisfactory, and shall so notify the \n     concessioner in writing.\n       (2) The Secretary may terminate a concession contract if \n     the concessioner fails to meet the minimum operational \n     requirements identified by the Secretary within the time \n     limitations established by the Secretary at the time notice \n     of the unsatisfactory rating is provided to the concessioner.\n       (3) If the Secretary terminates a concession contract \n     pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall solicit \n     proposals for a new contract consistent with the provisions \n     of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 15. RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each concessioner shall keep such records \n     as the Secretary may prescribe to enable the Secretary to \n     determine that all terms of the concessioner's contract have \n     been, and are being faithfully performed, and the Secretary \n     or any of the Secretary's duly authorized representatives \n     shall, for the purpose of audit and examination, have access \n     to such records and to other books, documents and papers of \n     the concessioner pertinent to the contract and all the terms \n     and conditions thereof as the Secretary deems necessary.\n       (b) General Accounting Office Review.--The Comptroller \n     General of the United States or any of his or her duly \n     authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of \n     five calendar years after the close of the business year for \n     each concessioner, have access to and the right to examine \n     any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the \n     concessioner related to the contracts or contracts involved.\n\n     SEC. 16. EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN LEASE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       The provisions of section 321 of the Act of June 30, 1932 \n     (47 Stat. 412; 40 U.S.C. 303b), relating to the leasing of \n     buildings and properties of the United States, shall not \n     apply to contracts awarded by the Secretary pursuant to this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 17. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Gorton and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 625. A bill to provide for competition between forms of motor \nvehicle insurance, to permit an owner of a motor vehicle to choose the \nmost appropriate form on insurance for that person, to guarantee \naffordable premiums, to provide for more adequate and timely \ncompensation for accident victims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   THE AUTO CHOICE REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am happy today to join with my \nesteemed colleagues, Senator Moynihan and Senator Lieberman, to \nannounce the introduction of the Auto Choice Reform Act. As you know, \nwe introduced this bill in the last Congress, along with Senator Dole. \nWe are proud to announce that Senator Slade Gorton and Senator Rod \nGrams have also joined us as original cosponsors.\n  You will hear lots of discussion today, and in the coming months, \nabout various aspects of automobile insurance and tort liability. But, \neverything you will hear about Auto Choice can be summed up in two \nwords: choice and savings.\n  Consumers want, need, and deserve both.\n  Very simply, the Auto Choice Reform Act offers consumers the choice \nof opting out of the pain and suffering litigation lottery. The \nconsumers who make this choice will achieve a substantial\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\nsavings on automobile insurance premiums.\n  Based on an analysis by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, the \nJoint Economic Committee estimates that, under Auto Choice, consumers \ncould save a total of $45 billion nationwide in 1997--at no cost to the \nGovernment. And, over 5 years, Auto Choice could make available a total \nof $246 billion in savings. Now, that's better than any tax cut that \neither party has proposed.\n  What does a $45 billion annual savings mean to the average driver? \nWell, that savings is colorfully and clearly illustrated behind me with \nthis check: ``Pay to the Order of the American Driver--$243.'' And this \ncheck is not a one-time payment. Motorists could achieve this type of \nsavings every year.\n  However, before you can truly comprehend the benefits of Auto Choice, \nyou must understand the terrible costs of the current tort liability \nsystem.\n  The Nation's auto insurance system desperately needs an overhaul. And \nnobody knows this better than the American motorist--who is now paying \non average $757 for automobile insurance. Between 1987 and 1994, \naverage premiums rose 44 percent--nearly 1\\1/2\\ times the rate of \ninflation.\n  Why are consumers forced to pay so much?\n  Because the auto insurance system is clogged and bloated by fraud, \nwasteful litigation, and abuse.\n  First, let's talk about fraud. In 1995, the F.B.I. announced a wave \nof indictments stemming from Operation Sudden Impact, the most wide-\nranging investigation of criminal fraud schemes involving staged car \naccidents and massive fraud in the health care system. The F.B.I. \nuncovered criminal enterprises staging bus and car accidents in order \nto bring lawsuits and collect money from innocent people, businesses \nand governments. F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh estimates that every \nAmerican household is burdened by an additional $200 in unnecessary \ninsurance premiums to cover this enormous amount of fraud.\n  In addition to the pervasive criminal fraud that exists, the \nincentives of our litigation system encourage injured parties to make \nexcessive medical claims to drive up their damage claims in lawsuits. \nThe Rand Institute for Civil Justice, in a study released in 1995, \nconcluded that 35 to 42 percent of claimed medical costs in car \naccident cases are excessive and unnecessary. Let me repeat that in \nsimple English: well over one-third of doctor, hospital, physical \ntherapy, and other medical costs claimed in car accident cases are \nfor nonexistent injuries or for unnecessary treatment.\n\n  The value of this wasteful health care? Four billion dollars \nannually. I don't need to remind anyone of the ongoing local and \nnational debate over our health care system. While people have \nstrongly-held differences over the causes and solutions to that \nproblem, the Rand data make one thing certain --lawsuits, and the \npotential for hitting the jackpot, drive overuse and abuse of the \nhealth care system. Reducing those costs by $4 billion annually, \nwithout depriving one person of needed medical care, is clearly in our \nnational interest.\n  Why would an injured party inflate their medical claims, you might \nask. It's simple arithmetic. For every $1 of economic loss, a party \nstands to recover up to $3 in pain and suffering awards. In short, the \nmore you go to the doctor, the more you get from the jury. And, the \nmore you get from the jury, the more money your attorney puts in his \nown pocket.\n  In addition to the massive fraud encouraged by the liability system, \nseriously injured people are grossly undercompensated under the tort \nsystem. A 1991 Rand study reveals that people with economic losses \nbetween $25,000 and $100,000 recover on the average only 50 percent of \ntheir economic losses. People with losses in excess of $100,000 recover \nonly 9 percent.\n  Moreover, liability insurance does not pay until the claim is \nresolved. Studies show that the average time to recover is 16 months, \nand it takes longer in serious injury cases.\n  The Auto Choice bill gives consumers a way out of this system of high \npremiums, rampant fraud, and slow, inequitable compensation. Our bill \nwould remove the perverse incentives of lawsuits, while ensuring that \ncar accident victims recover fully for their economic loss.\n  Now, I'd like to answer the question: what is Auto Choice? Let me \nfirst answer with what it is not. It does not abolish lawsuits, and it \ndoes not eliminate the concept of fault within the legal system. There \nwill no doubt be less reason to go to court, but the right to sue is \nabsolutely not abolished.\n  What it does do is allow drivers to decide how they want to be \ninsured. In establishing the choice mechanism, the bill unbundles \neconomic and noneconomic losses and allows the driver to choose whether \nto be covered for noneconomic losses--that is, pain and suffering \nlosses.\n  In other words, if a driver wants to be covered for pain and \nsuffering, he stays in the current State system. If he wants to opt-out \nof the pain and suffering regime, he chooses the personal protection \nsystem.\n  This choice, which sounds amazingly simple and imminently reasonable, \nis, believe it or not, currently unavailable for over ninety percent of \nall motorists. Auto Choice will change that.\n  Let me briefly explain the choices that our bill will offer every \nconsumer. A consumer will be able to choose one of two insurance \nsystems.\n  The first choice is the tort maintenance system. Drivers who wish to \nstay in their current system would choose this system and be able to \nsue and be sued for pain and suffering. These drivers would essentially \nbuy the same type of insurance that they currently carry--and would \nrecover, or fail to recover, in the same way that they do today. The \nonly change for tort drivers would be that, in the event that they are \nhit by a personal protection driver, the tort driver would recover both \neconomic and noneconomic damages from his own insurance policy. This \nsupplemental first-party policy for tort drivers will be called tort \nmaintenance coverage.\n\n  The second choice is the personal protection system. Consumers \nchoosing this system would be guaranteed prompt recovery of their \neconomic losses, up to the levels of their own insurance policy. These \ndrivers would give up recovery of pain and suffering damages in \nexchange for being immune from pain and suffering lawsuits. Personal \nprotection drivers would achieve substantially reduced premiums because \nthe personal protection system would dramatically reduce: First, pain \nand suffering damages, second, fraud, and third, the bulk of attorney \nfees.\n  Under both insurance systems--tort maintenance and personal \nprotection--the injured party whose economic losses exceed his own \ncoverage will have the right to sue the responsible party for the \nexcess. Moreover, tort drivers will retain the right to sue each other \nfor both economic and noneconomic loss. Critics who say the right to \nsue is abolished by this bill are plain wrong.\n  The advantages of personal protection coverage are enormous.\n  First, personal protection coverage assures that those who suffer \ninjury, regardless of whether someone else is responsible, will be paid \nfor their economic losses. The driver does not have to leave \ncompensation up to the vagaries of how an accident occurs and how much \ncoverage the other driver has. A driver whose car goes off a slippery \nroad will be able to recover for his economic losses. Such a blameless \ndriver could not recover under the tort system because no other person \nwas at fault. No matter when and how a driver or a member of his family \nis injured, the driver knows his insurance will protect his family.\n  Second, the choice as to how much insurance protection to purchase is \nin the hands of the driver, who is in the best position to know how \nmuch coverage he and his family need. He can choose as much or as \nlittle insurance as his circumstances require, from $20,000 of \nprotection to $1 million of coverage.\n  Third, people who elect the personal protection option will, in the \nevent they are injured, be paid promptly, as their losses accrue.\n  Fourth, we will have more rational use of precious health care \nresources. Insuring on a first-party basis eliminates the incentives \nfor excess medical claiming. When a person chooses to be compensated \nfor actual economic loss, the tort system's incentives for padding \none's claims disappear.\n  Fifth, Auto Choice offers real benefits for low-income drivers \nbecause the\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nsavings are progressive. Low-income drivers will see the biggest \nsavings because they pay a higher proportion of their disposable income \nin insurance costs. A study of low income residents of Maricopa County, \nAZ, revealed that households below 50 percent of the poverty line spent \nan amazing 31.6 percent of their disposable income on car insurance.\n  For many low-income families the choices are stark: car insurance and \nthe ability to get to the job, or medicine, new clothing or extra food \nfor the children. Or, they choose the worst alternative of all--driving \nwithout any insurance. Should we allow our litigation system to promote \nsuch unlawful conduct?\n  Moreover, Auto Choice offers benefits to all taxpayers, even those \nwho don't drive. For example, local governments will save taxpayer \ndollars through decreased insurance and litigation costs. This will \nallow governments to use our tax dollars to more directly benefit the \ncommunity. Think of all the additional police and firefighters that \ncould be hired with money now spent on lawsuits. Or, schools and \nplaygrounds that could be better equipped. New York City spends more on \nliability claims than it spends on libraries, botanical gardens, the \nBronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Department of Youth \nServices, combined. Imagine the improved quality of life in our urban \nareas if governments were free of spending on needless lawsuits.\n\n  Last, we will create incentives for safer cars. Now, it actually \ncosts more to insure a safer car. That's because a driver in a bigger \ncar who is responsible for another's injury may have a bigger claim to \npay. After all, the bigger, safer car may cause more damage to the \nperson in a smaller, less safe car. So insuring a bigger, safer car \ncosts more. But under auto choice and first-party coverage, insurance \ncompanies would reward customers with lower premiums for safer cars.\n  The bottom line? We think that consumers should be able to make one \nsimple choice: ``Do you want to continue to pay $757 a year for auto \ninsurance and have the right to recover pain and suffering damages? Or \nwould you rather save $243 a year on your premiums, be promptly \nreimbursed for your economic losses, and forego pain and suffering \ndamages?''\n  It's really that simple. And, we're not even going to tell them which \nanswer is the right one. Because that's not up to us. It's up to the \nconsumer. We simply want to give them the choice.\n  In closing, I'd like to do something I rarely do--quote the New York \nTimes--which summed up the benefits, and indeed, the simplicity of Auto \nChoice: Auto Choice ``would give families the option of foregoing suits \nfor nonmonetary losses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement \nfor every blow to their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the \nlawyers.''\n  Now, before I turn over the floor to Senator Moynihan, I'd like to \nshare with you a scathing indictment of the tort liability system that \nwas written more than a quarter of a century ago by a true visionary:\n\n       No one involved has an incentive to moderation or \n     reasonableness. The victim has every reason to exaggerate his \n     losses. It is some other person's insurance company that must \n     pay. The company has every reason to resist. It is somebody \n     else's customer who is making the claim. Delay, fraud, \n     contentiousness are maximized, and in the process the system \n     becomes grossly inefficient and expensive. Automobile \n     accident litigation has become a 20th-Century equivalent of \n     Dickens's Court of Chancery, eating up the pittance of widows \n     and orphans, a vale from which few return with their respect \n     for just[ice] undiminished.\n\n  Well, those insightful and prophetic words were spoken by none other \nthan the man who stands here with me as an original cosponsor today, my \ncolleague from the State of New York, Pat Moynihan. Pat, it's taken \nover 25 years, but I think we're finally going to overhaul this broken-\ndown auto insurance system.\n  Mr. President, this bill has broad support from across the spectrum. \nIt should be obvious by the support and endorsements that this bill has \nalready received that this is not conservative or liberal legislation. \nIt is consumer legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill and statements in support of Auto Choice from the Republican \nmayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani, the former Massachusetts \nGovernor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis, and \nthe executive director of the Reform Party, Russ Verney, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Auto Choice Reform Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the costs of operating a motor vehicle are excessive \n     due in substantial part to the legal and administrative costs \n     associated with the resolution of claims under the tort \n     liability insurance system;\n       (2) the tort liability insurance system often results in--\n       (A) the failure to provide compensation commensurate with \n     loss;\n       (B) an unreasonable delay in the payment of benefits; and\n       (C) the expenditure of an excessive amount for legal fees;\n       (3) the incentives of the tort liability insurance system \n     for motor vehicles are distorted, and result in--\n       (A) significant fraud in the claims process, which \n     exacerbates the level of distrust of many individuals in the \n     United States with respect to the legal process and the rule \n     of law;\n       (B) significant, wasteful, fraudulent, and costly overuse \n     and abuse of scarce health care resources and services;\n       (C) unbearable cost burdens on low-income individuals, \n     imposing on them the Hobson's choice of driving on an \n     unlawful, uninsured basis or foregoing essential needs, such \n     as food and adequate shelter;\n       (D) significant reductions in, access to, and purchases of, \n     motor vehicles, which--\n       (i) damage the economic well-being of many low-income \n     individuals; and\n       (ii) cause unnecessary harm to a critical component of the \n     economy of the United States;\n       (E) significant deterioration of the economic well-being of \n     the majority of major cities in the United States through the \n     imposition of a massive tort tax that--\n       (i) places a disproportionate burden on urban residents; \n     and\n       (ii) contributes to the abandonment of the cities by many \n     taxpayers who are able to achieve substantial after-tax \n     savings on automobile insurance premiums by moving to \n     adjacent suburban communities; and\n       (F) significant inability to achieve market-based discounts \n     in insurance rates for owners of safer cars, which reduces \n     the level of safety for drivers and passengers of motor \n     vehicles;\n       (4) insurance to indemnify individuals for personal \n     injuries arising from motor vehicle collisions is frequently \n     unavailable at a reasonable cost because of the potential \n     liability for third-party tort claims;\n       (5) a system that gives consumers the opportunity to insure \n     themselves and that separates economic and noneconomic \n     damages for the purposes of purchasing insurance would \n     provide significant cost savings to drivers of motor \n     vehicles;\n       (6) a system that enables individuals to choose the form of \n     motor vehicle insurance that best suits their needs would--\n       (A) enhance individual freedom;\n       (B) reduce the cost of motor vehicle insurance; and\n       (C) increase average compensation in the event of an \n     accident; and\n       (7) a system that targets and emphasizes the scourge of \n     those individuals who drive under the influence of drugs or \n     alcohol will further deter such dangerous and unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to allow consumers of motor \n     vehicle insurance to choose between--\n       (1) an insurance system that provides substantially the \n     same remedies as are available under applicable State law; \n     and\n       (2) a predominately first-party insurance system that \n     provides for--\n       (A) more comprehensive recovery of economic loss in a \n     shorter period of time; and\n       (B) the right to sue negligent drivers for any \n     uncompensated economic losses.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Giuliani\n\n       Today, members of Congress and other leaders from across \n     the political spectrum, representing diverse populations and \n     constituencies, unite in expressing support for the \n     introduction and passage of bold, necessary federal \n     legislation reforming auto insurance and tort law in America.\n       The introduction of auto-choice legislation marks a \n     milestone in the nation's response to motorist demands for \n     fair, equitable and cost-effective insurance coverage. \n     Millions of drivers are presently paying excessive insurance \n     premiums because of inflated claims and huge pain and \n     suffering awards. Under this legislation proposed by Senators \n     Lieberman, McConnell and Moynihan, among others, the nation \n     as a whole stands to save $45 billion in insurance premiums \n     this year alone, with the average driver nationwide saving \n     $243 per year. That amounts to the equivalent of a $243 tax \n     cut without any corresponding cut in services. The newly \n     released report by the Joint Economic Committee of the United \n     States Congress on ``The Benefits and Savings of Auto-\n     Choice'' estimates that with auto choice, New York City \n     motorists will see an average decrease of $417 per driver per \n     year.\n       The genius of this bill is the unbundling of pain and \n     suffering coverage from insurance premiums and the switch to \n     first party coverage--similar to no-fault coverage. Moreover, \n     people who want coverage for pain and suffering--and are \n     willing to pay for it--can obtain it. But, they will not \n     recover pain and suffering damages at the expense of third \n     parties, or at the expense of our court system where \n     sympathetic juries often grant windfalls for being injured in \n     the form of subjective non-economic damages. There is simply \n     no justification for many of the enormous awards to the \n     injured who--though rightfully compensated for objective \n     pecuniary loss--are rewarded for unsubstantiated pain and \n     suffering damages, often with no regard for the relationship \n     to the fault of the parties concerned.\n       Over the years, New York City has risked losing the \n     valuable civic contributions of many of its residents to the \n     suburbs where insurance rates are usually more affordable. \n     Coupled with the reduction in crime our City has experienced, \n     reduced insurance premiums would provide added incentive for \n     City residents to keep their homes and their businesses in \n     the City. These reforms come at no cost to City residents nor \n     would they diminish governmental services. Motorists in \n     municipalities and urban centers across the land stand to \n     reap these enormous savings.\n       When we value the productivity of our urban residents and \n     demonstrate our respect for their contributions, we improve \n     the quality of life for the City as a whole and ensure its \n     prosperity for years to come. Auto-choice assists in doing \n     precisely that. It demonstrates our leaders' respect for the \n     economic well being of even the most hard pressed motorist.\n       But equally as important, the bill would help restore a \n     little faith in our courts and judicial system, which have \n     been increasingly plagued with criticism by, and stands to \n     lose the confidence of, ordinary citizens. When people see \n     some lawyers running from the hospital to the court to the \n     insurance company, they understand why their premiums are so \n     high. Plaintiffs receive barely one-half of all settlements \n     after lawyers, experts and court fees are paid. Under \n     existing law, plaintiff attorneys have tremendous incentive \n     to shoot for the gold--that giant pain and suffering cash \n     cow--paid for by the American motorist through excessive \n     insurance premiums.\n       People wonder: why can't this process be controlled? Today, \n     we tell these people that they, not special interests, are in \n     charge. We assure them that money which should not be \n     unjustly taken from them, will not be. We give them the \n     chance to determine for themselves how much insurance \n     coverage is\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\n     enough coverage for them and their families. And, keep in \n     mind, under auto-choice, all motorists obtain coverage for \n     objective economic loss, such as medical bills or lost wages.\n       The bill is sensible and fair, and I respectfully urge \n     Congress to pass this important legislation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Northeastern University, College of Arts and Sciences, \n           Department of Political Science,\n                                                   April 17, 1997.\n       I enthusiastically endorse the ``choice'' auto insurance \n     bill you are jointly sponsoring. Your action is an important \n     act of bipartisan leadership on an issue that significantly \n     affects all Americans.\n       The issue you address has been a great concern of mine \n     throughout my political career ever since I sponsored the \n     first no-fault auto insurance bill in the nation.\n       Given the horrendous high costs of auto insurance, coupled \n     with its long delays, high overhead, and rank unfairness when \n     it comes to payment, your ``choice'' reform takes the \n     sensible approach of allowing consumes to choose how to \n     insure themselves. In other words, your reform trust the \n     American people to decide for themselves whether to spend \n     their money on ``pain and suffering'' coverage of food, \n     medicine, life insurance or any other expenditure they deem \n     more valuable for themselves and their families.\n       The bill is a particularly important to the people who live \n     in American cities where premiums are the highest. It is no \n     surprise that the cost studies done by the Joint Economic \n     Committee indicate that while your reform will make stunning \n     cost savings available to all American consumers, its largest \n     benefits will go to the low income drivers living in urban \n     areas.\n       The bill will also help resolve the country's problems with \n     runaway health costs. By allowing consumer to remove \n     themselves from a system whose perverse incentives trigger \n     the cost of health care costs, your reform will lower the \n     cost of health care for all Americans while ensuring that \n     health care expenditure are more clearly targeted to health \n     care needs.\n       I look forward to assisting you to the fullest possible \n     degree as you exercise your vitally need leadership on behalf \n     of America's consumers.\n     Michael S. Dukakis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          Statement of Reform Party Chairman Russell J. Verney\n\n       Only on rare occasions does Congress have the opportunity \n     to stimulate our national economy without adding to the $5.2 \n     trillion debt burden this generation is leaving to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n       Auto Choice Reform is one of those rare opportunities. It \n     allows the owners of automobiles the choice of the level of \n     insurance coverage they wish to provide for their own losses. \n     protects an injured or harmed person's right to collect for \n     their losses and can cut the average automobile owner's \n     annual insurance rate by an average of $243 per year.\n       Auto Choice Reform is an idea whose time has come. \n     Unfortunately, it will also stimulate a new furious round of \n     campaign (investments) contributions by special interests who \n     benefit from the current high cost of auto insurance rates \n     and protracted litigation associated with automobile \n     insurance and accidents injuries.\n       As list of top donors to political parities and candidates \n     during 1995 and 1996, published by Mother Jones Magazine \n     listed numerous individuals from the insurance industry and \n     trial lawyers who have established their right of access to \n     our top political leaders in this country.\n       The sponsors and promoters of the common sense Auto Choice \n     Reform Act will have to overcome the easy access special \n     interests have to our country's decision makers if this $44 \n     billion per year cost savings for motorists in this country \n     is to be achieved.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997, a bill submitted by my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator McConnell.\n  This legislation is designed to create a new option in auto insurance \nfor consumers who would prefer a system that guarantees quick and \ncomplete compensation. This alternative system would change most \ninsurance coverage to a first-party system from a third-party system \nand it would separate economic and noneconomic compensation by \nunbundling the premium. Therefore, drivers would be allowed to insure \nthemselves for only economic loss or for both economic and noneconomic \nloss.\n  In the 1950's, I first became interested in the issue of auto \ninsurance reform as a member of New York Gov. Averell Harriman's \nTraffic Safety Policy Coordinating Committee. At that time, while \nworking on auto safety issues, I became convinced that as the number of \nautomobiles increased, the number of automobile accidents would, \ninexorably, also increase. And the problem with the current state of \nthe insurance system begins right there. A driver buys protection \nagainst the risk that he will negligently cause an accident that will \ninjure another person. If that should occur, the driver's insurance \ncompany is responsible for compensating the victim. But this \ncontradicts the very nature of traffic accidents. If they were orderly \nevents, in which cause and effect could be clearly discerned and \nascribed, then the present insurance system could work. But accidents \nare nothing of the sort. It is often very difficult to determine fault \nin traffic accidents. It is the role of the liable party's insurance \ncompany to argue that the plaintiff's injuries--no matter how hideous--\nare not as serious as he or she claims. These cases overwhelm the court \nsystem and in so doing, they prevent real justice from occurring. \nJustice is possible only when it is done quickly and reflects the sense \nof what is right and what is wrong, as I wrote in ``Next: A New Auto \nInsurance Policy,'' which appeared in the August 27, 1967 New York \nTimes magazine:\n\n       The most serious secondary effect of the existing insurance \n     system, however, lies in its impact on the courts. This \n     process begins with the use of the police to enforce the \n     traffic laws, as a result of which the incidence of arrest by \n     armed police in the United States is the highest of any \n     society in history. The jam starts there, and is followed by \n     a flood of accident litigation cases that derive, in part at \n     least, from the original criminal case. We have now reached \n     the point where accident litigation accounts for an estimated \n     65 to 80 percent of the total civil court cases tried in the \n     United States. This in turn has brought us to the point where \n     delays in justice here are the longest of any democracy on \n     earth. It now takes an average of 30.1 months to obtain a \n     jury trial in the metropolitan areas of the nation. In \n     Westchester and Kings counties, it is 50 months plus. In \n     Chicago it is 60 months plus.\n       A legal expert in the field, James Marshall, has argued \n     that persons involved in or witnessing an automobile accident \n     are not really capable of reconstructing it in court. The \n     event is too complex, and levels of perception too low. (How \n     would a witness to a shooting respond to a question as to \n     which way the bullet was traveling?) A fortiori the attempt \n     to reconstruct such an episode three, four, or five years \n     afterward is nigh impossible. Thus the question must be asked \n     whether a social concern of the highest order--the \n     administration of justice--is not being sacrificed to one of \n     a much lower priority, the reenactment of traffic accidents. \n     (As indeed the whole cops-and-robbers, shoot-'em-up paradigm \n     for managing the road system must be questioned. It was not \n     just chance that the riots in Watts and Newark began with \n     police arresting a motorist.)\n       There is little likelihood, however, that greater efforts \n     toward the administration of justice--more judges, or \n     whatever--would change matters. A New York survey has shown \n     that of 220,000 annual claims of victims seeking to recover \n     damages caused by another's fault, only 7,000 reach trial, \n     and 2,500 reach verdict. Given the number and rate of \n     accidents in the existing transport system, a kind of \n     Malthusian principle governs the courts: the number of \n     litigated cases will automatically increase to use up all the \n     available judicial facilities and maintain a permanent \n     backlog. At a time when issues of justice, violence, and \n     civic peace are of immediate and pressing concern, to devote \n     the better part of the judicial (and an enormous portion of \n     the legal) resources of the nation to managing the road \n     system is the kind of incompetence that societies end up \n     paying for.\n       Only one adult response is possible: the present automobile \n     insurance system has to change . . .\n\n  In that article, 30 years ago, I proposed two alternatives to \ntraditional tort coverage as solutions for the problem. One was to have \nthe Federal Government provide insurance--financed by a penny or so \nincreases in the Federal gasoline tax--for injuries and economic \nlosses, with claims being adjusted in a fashion similar to the workers' \ncompensation system. The second alternative was along the lines of the \ncurrent legislation. For the past 35 years, Jeffrey O'Connell, the \nSamuel McCoy Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, has been \nfiguring out the permutations of this second type of reform. It is his \nrecommendations that shape today's legislation.\n  Over 16 million motor vehicle accidents occur every year. The average \namount of time it takes to receive compensation for losses in a tort \ncase is over 18 months. Minimally injured parties are overcompensated \nwhile victims of serious injuries often fail to receive full \nrestitution. According to a study by the RAND Institute, people with \neconomic losses of under $5,000 receive over two to three times that \namount in compensation. People with $25,000 to $100,000 worth of \nlosses, however, currently are compensated for just over one-half of \ntheir losses, on average. The very seriously injured--\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nthose with economic losses of over $100,000--receive compensation worth \nonly 9 percent of their damages, on average. The current system does \nnot work.\n  This legislation is called Auto Choice because drivers would have a \nchoice between this new system, called personal protection insurance \n[PPI], or they could remain insured under the system currently \noperating in their State--the tort maintenance system [TM]. For people \nwho choose to insure themselves for only economic damages, this is akin \nto a $243 tax cut, according to a recent report by the Joint Economic \nCommittee, only without any impact on the Federal budget. Our \nlegislation would ensure more complete and more rapid recovery of \nlosses for the people who incur them, and it would reduce the number of \ncases that presently overwhelm the courts.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky for inviting me to cosponsor this \nlegislation, and hope other Senators agree with us that the time for \nauto choice has come.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am here today with Senators \nMcConnell, Moynihan, Gorton, and Grams to introduce the Auto Choice \nReform Act of 1997. If enacted, this bill would save American consumers \ntens of billions of dollars, while at the same time producing an auto \ninsurance system that operates more efficiently and promises drivers \nbetter and quicker compensation.\n  America's drivers are plagued today by an auto accident insurance and \ncompensation system that is too expensive and that does not work. Each \nof us currently pays an average of $785 annually for our auto insurance \nper car. This is an extraordinarily large sum, and one that is \nparticularly difficult for people of modest means--and almost \nimpossible for poor people--to afford. A study of Maricopa County, AZ \ndrives this point home. That study found that families living below 50 \npercent of the poverty line spend nearly one-third of their household \nincome on premiums when they purchase auto insurance.\n  Perhaps those costs would be worth it if they meant that people \ninjured in car accidents were fully compensated for their injuries. But \nunder our current tort system, that often is not the case, particularly \nfor people who are seriously injured. Because of the need to prove \nfault and the ability to receive compensation only through someone \nelse's insurance policy, some injured drivers--like those in one car \naccidents or those who are found to have been at fault themselves--are \nleft without any compensation at all. Others must endure years of \nlitigation before receiving any compensation for their injuries. In the \nend, people who suffer minimal injuries in auto accidents generally end \nup overcompensated, while victims of serious injuries often fail to \nreceive full restitution. According to a study by Rand's Institute for \nCivil Justice, people who suffer economic losses--lost wages and \nmedical bills, for example--in the range of $25,000 to $100,000 \ncurrently are compensated for just over one-half of their losses on \naverage. The very seriously injured--those with economic losses of over \n$100,000--receive compensation worth just 9 percent of those damages on \naverage. Much of this shortfall is due to the high transaction costs--\nthe 33-percent attorneys' fee regularly taken out of a plaintiff's \nrecovery, for one thing--associated with the current system.\n  These statistics show that our auto insurance and compensation laws \nviolate the cardinal rule I think those of us in the business \nlegislating have a duty to follow: to draft our laws to encourage \npeople to minimize their disputes, and to encourage those who do have \ndisputes to resolve them as efficiently, as economically, and as \nquickly as possible. This is particularly true when we are dealing with \nlaws impacting on people who are physically injured, because injured \npeople simply--and literally--cannot afford to wait the years it often \ntakes for a lawsuit to wind its way through our legal system. The laws \ngoverning our auto accident and insurance system do not now meet those \nsimple criteria. They instead require consumers to pay extraordinarily \nhigh premiums to purchase auto insurance. That auto insurance, in turn \nand as a result of our broken legal system, does not bring seriously \ninjured people either speedy or full compensation for their injuries.\n\n  My colleagues and I set out to rethink the legal framework governing \nour car insurance and compensation system. We asked ourselves whether \nwe could write a law that would both lower premiums and better \ncompensate people for injuries suffered in car accidents. Why, we \nwondered, should people hurt in car crashes--people who have bought and \npaid for insurance policies--not be able to receive compensation for \ntheir injuries unless they find someone else who was at fault, sue \nthem, engage in potentially years of litigation, and collect from that \nother person? Why, we asked, couldn't auto insurance instead be more \nlike health and homeowner insurance, where people know when they buy \ntheir policies that they will be compensated immediately for any \ncovered injury, regardless of who caused the injury and without having \nto find and pay a lawyer and often suffer through years of litigation?\n  The answer we came up with was that there is no reason not to change \nour auto insurance and compensation laws to address these problems. Our \nAuto Choice proposal would address these problems by introducing reason \ninto our auto insurance and accident laws. The bill would produce a \nsystem that would guarantee immediate compensation to injured people. \nAt the same time, it would bring tremendous savings to the system--up \nto $45 billion annually according to a recent study. And, it would do \nso, not by forcing people to do something they do not want to do, but \nby giving them the choice--the right to determine for themselves what \nis in their best interests.\n  Here's how our plan would work: All drivers would be required to \npurchase a certain minimum level of insurance, but they would get to \nchoose the type of coverage they want. Those drivers who value \nimmediate compensation for their injuries and lower premiums would be \nable to purchase what we call personal protection insurance. If the \ndriver with that type of coverage is injured in an accident, he or she \nwould get immediate compensation for all economic losses--things like \nlost wages, medical bills and attorneys fees--up to the limits of his \nor her policy, without regard to who was at fault in the accident.\n  If their economic losses exceeded those policy limits, the injured \nparty could sue the other driver for the extra economic loss on a fault \nbasis. The only thing the plaintiff could not do is sue the other \ndriver for noneconomic losses, the so-called pain and suffering \ndamages.\n  Those drivers who did not want to give up the ability to collect pain \nand suffering damages could choose a different option, called tort \nmaintenance coverage. Drivers with that type of policy would be able to \ncover themselves for whatever level of economic and noneconomic damages \nthey want, and they would then be able to collect those damages, also \nfrom their own insurance company, after proving fault.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, the savings from this new Choice system would \nbe dramatic. According to a newly released report from the Joint \nEconomic Committee, if all American drivers opted for personal \nprotection insurance, they would save an average of $243 annually on \ntheir auto insurance premiums. Drivers in my home State of Connecticut \nwould see even better savings, putting an additional $383 per year into \ntheir pockets. All told, the American economy could save up to $45 \nbillion each and every year under our proposal.\n  Our Auto Choice plan, I think, both serves the reform goals I \ndiscussed above and incorporates all of the lessons we learned during \nour past experiences with no-fault laws. It ensures that most injured \npeople would be compensated immediately and that we all can purchase \nauto insurance at a reasonable rate. As I said at the outset, we as \nlegislators do our best when we make sure that our legal system \nminimizes the potential for disputes in society and facilitates the \nresolution of those disputes that exist. The Auto Choice law would do \nexactly that. It would ensure that something tens of thousands of us \nnow have disputes about--who should compensate whom for car accidents--\nno longer would be the subject of disputes because everyone who is \ninjured will know from the outset that they will be compensated, they \nwill know by whom they will be compensated, and they will know they \nwill be compensated without having to sue someone else first. Mr. \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\nthis bill would be a boon to the American driver and to the American \neconomy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see it enacted \ninto law.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators McConnell, \nGrams, Moynihan, and Lieberman in cosponsoring the Auto Choice Reform \nAct, a measure that offers consumers a quick-pay, low-cost policy to \nreplace their current policies--policies that are grossly inflated by \nthe costs of damage claims for pain and suffering.\n  Auto Choice Reform Act. Choice. Removing the perverse incentives to \ninflate damages that our current system creates, and allowing consumers \nto make rational choices, lies at the heart of this bill. Unlike some \nother no-fault measures, the Auto Choice Reform Act gives consumers, \nand States, choices. Choices which, if exercised, should significantly \nlower insurance premiums. For States, the choice is whether or not to \noffer the no-fault option to residents. A State can opt out \nlegislatively, or if the State commissioner of insurance shows that a \nno-fault system will not result in a 30 percent decrease in bodily \ninjury premiums for those who choose PPI. If States choose to offer the \nno-fault option, however, consumers still have the choice of whether or \nnot to participate in the no-fault system. No driver will be deprived \nof her ability to sue, but instead, can choose between two systems.\n  If they want, consumers can avail themselves of the new no-fault \ninsurance system that the bill creates. If a consumer elects the \npersonal protection insurance [PPI] system, then, in the event of an \naccident, and regardless of fault, she is compensated by her own \ninsurer for economic losses, such as car repair, medical expenses or \nlost wages, up to her policy limit. She does not, however, recover for \nnoneconomic losses, pain and suffering, and she may not be sued for \npain and suffering damages. If her economic damages exceed her policy \nlimit, however, she may sue for economic damages. By taking the often-\ninflated damages for pain and suffering out of the equation, consumers \nchoosing PPI should see a significant savings in their insurance \npremiums--a savings that has been estimated at $243 per policy.\n  Motorists who choose not to participate in the no-fault system are \nallowed that option under this legislation. Again, the choice is with \nthe consumer. By opting for what the bill refers to as tort maintenance \ncoverage, a TMC driver can keep her traditional liability policy under \nwhich she can sue other TMC drivers for both economic and noneconomic \ndamages. To cover noneconomic damages in accidents with PPI drivers, \nwho TMC drivers cannot sue for noneconomic damages, the TMC driver can \npurchase a supplemental policy and recover the noneconomic damages from \nher own insurer.\n  What does all of this mean? The New York Times perhaps summed it up \nbest in an editorial that predicted that Auto Choice ``would give \nfamilies the option of forgoing suits for non-monetary losses in \nexchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow to their \npocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.'' Mr. President, I \nhope the Senate will act promptly to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 626. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide for legal accountability for sweatshop conditions in the \ngarment industry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                    Stop the Sweatshops Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Monday, President Clinton announced \nan agreement by the Apparel Industry Partnership that establishes a \nworkplace code of conduct for the industry. I commend this agreement, \nwhich is the product of a presidential task force on the exploitation \nof garment industry workers by unscrupulous clothing manufacturers. The \nagreement is designed to encourage voluntary compliance with labor \nstandards in all countries that manufacture clothing sold in the United \nStates.\n\n  Congress can build on this agreement by acting to abolish sweatshops \nin our own country. Last year, Congressman Bill Clay and I introduced \nthe Stop the Sweatshops Act. Today I am introducing that legislation to \nhelp fulfill the promise of the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement. \nThis bill will reinforce that agreement by making clothing \nmanufacturers liable for sweatshop practices by contractors. This \nliability will help to ensure that honest employers who obey our laws \nwill not lose out in competition with dishonest employers who do not. \nWithout this bill, economic forces in the clothing industry make it \nunlikely that the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement will be fully \neffective in protecting American workers.\n  Sweatshops continue to plague the garment industry. As important as \nthe Apparel Industry Partnership agreement is, it has a significant \ndeficiency. It has no enforcement mechanism. It applies only to \nmanufacturers who agree to its terms and it does not specify how \nviolations will be remedied or what penalties will be imposed. The Stop \nthe Sweatshops Act remedies these deficiencies for all clothing \nmanufacturing done in this country.\n  This bill will require manufacturers to exert their considerable \neconomic power to ensure fair treatment of garment workers. It will \nprevent manufacturers from playing one contractor against another, \nwhich drives down the prices of their goods. It is the cutthroat \ncompetition resulting from such practices that causes dangerous and \nunhealthy working conditions, brutally long hours, and inadequate pay.\n  The record of worker exploitation in the garment industry shows that \neffective enforcement is crucial. Of the 22,000 manufacturers of \nclothing and accessories in the United States, the Department of Labor \nfinds that more than half are paying wages substantially below the \nminimum wage, and a third are exposing their workers to serious safety \nand health risks.\n  Sweatshops run by unscrupulous contractors have a long and sordid \nhistory in this country. In 1911, a tragic fire at the Triangle \nShirtwaist Co. on Lower East Side in New York City killed 146 young \nimmigrant women. They suffocated or were burned to death because the \nexits had been locked or blocked.\n  Eighty-six years later, we still find too often that conditions have \nnot improved. In August 1996, four Brooklyn garment factories were \nclosed and their owners were arrested for operating sweatshops. Serious \nfire code violations were found, including locked exit doors, \nobstructed aisles, and violations of sprinkler system requirements. In \naddition, the contractors maintained two sets of accounting records, \none showing that workers were being paid as little as $2.67 per hour--\nfar less than the minimum wage. The workers were all Asian immigrants \nmaking clothes for K-Mart.\n  K-Mart requires its garment contractors to identify all \nsubcontractors they employ, and to make ``regular and surprise \ninspections'' of manufacturing operations. But this requirement did not \nprevent the fire code violations, wage violations, and other illegal \npractices of the contractors arrested in Brooklyn last summer. This \nexample shows that voluntary codes of conduct and monitoring programs, \nas the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement encourages, cannot, by \nthemselves, eradicate the problem.\n  Another sweatshop scandal came to light last spring, with respect to \nclothing made for Wal-Mart. It shows how far some manufacturers are \nwilling to go to cut costs, and the terrible human toll that follows. \nIn August 1995, Federal investigators raided a sewing factory outside \nLos Angeles. In a compound surrounded by barbed wire, agents found \ndozens of Thai and Mexican immigrant women working 20-hour days for as \nlittle as $1.00 per hour. The women were held captive at their sewing \ntables by guards who threatened them if they tried to escape.\n  American consumers do not want their clothing produced in this way. A \nU.S. News and World Report poll showed that 6 in 10 Americans are \nconcerned about working conditions in U.S. manufacturing firms. A poll \nreported in Newsday showed that 83 percent of consumers would be \nwilling to pay an extra $1 on a $20 item if they knew the garment \nwasn't made in a sweatshop.\n  Many law-abiding manufacturers already recognize the need to stamp \nout sweatshops in the United States. But, as these examples make clear, \ncurrent law and voluntary codes of conduct are not adequate to prevent \nabuses. The 800 investigators of the Department of\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nLabor who monitor compliance with wage and hour laws cannot do the job \nalone. Manufacturers have the economic muscle and market power to end \nthese abuses. But, under the current system, the market power works in \nthe wrong direction--it encourages contractors to inflict sweatshop \nconditions on employees, rather than pay fair wages and maintain proper \nworking conditions.\n  The most effective way to enlist manufacturers in the battle against \nsweatshops is to make them liable along with their contractors for \nviolations of the law. Manufacturers who know they will face liability \nwill take the steps necessary to ensure that their contractors comply \nwith applicable laws.\n  Our Stop the Sweatshops Act does just that. It amends the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to make manufacturers in the garment industry liable, \nalong with their contractors, for violations of these laws.\n  Manufacturers will be liable for injunctive relief and civil \npenalties assessed against a contractor found to have broken the law. \nThey will also be liable for back pay owed to employees for such \nviolations. Manufacturers will be liable only for violations committed \non work done for that manufacturer.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess a civil \npenalty of up to $1,000 for each employee in cases where contractors \nfail to keep required payroll records. If the records are fraudulent, \nthe Secretary can assess penalties up to $10,000 for the first offense \nand $15,000 for further offenses. These penalties will give employers \nan incentive to keep proper records, and punish contractors who attempt \nto conceal abuses by maintaining two sets of records.\n  This bill sends a clear message to garment industry employers. \nExploitation of workers will not be tolerated. Sweatshops are \nunacceptable. We intend to do all we can to stamp them out, and this \nlegislation will help us achieve that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 626\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Stop \n     Sweatshops Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal \n     is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The production of garments in violation of minimum \n     labor standards burdens commerce and the free flow of goods \n     in commerce by spreading and perpetuating labor conditions \n     that undermine minimum living standards and by providing an \n     unfair means of competition to the detriment of employers who \n     comply with the law.\n       (2) The existence of working conditions detrimental to fair \n     competition and the maintenance of minimum standards of \n     living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-\n     being of workers is a continuing and growing problem in the \n     domestic garment industry.\n       (3) The Congress concurs in the findings of the Comptroller \n     General that most sweatshop employers violate the \n     recordkeeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 and that the failure of such employers to maintain \n     adequate records has affected, and continues to affect \n     adversely, the ability of the Department of Labor to collect \n     wages due to workers.\n       (4) The amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     to provide for legal responsibility on the part of \n     manufacturers for compliance with such Act's wage and hour, \n     child labor, and industrial homework provisions by \n     contractors in the garment industry and to provide civil \n     penalties for violations of that Act's recordkeeping \n     requirements is necessary to promote fair competition and \n     working conditions that are not detrimental to the \n     maintenance of health, efficiency, and general well-being of \n     workers in the garment industry.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reauthorize the African Elephant Conservation Act; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n   THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Earth Day \nto introduce legislation to reauthorize the African Elephant \nConservation Act of 1988, a historic conservation measure that \ncontinues to successfully preserve the African elephant in its natural \nenvironment. This legislation will extend the act through September of \nthe year 2002.\n  The African Elephant Conservation Act has resulted in the \nstabilization of elephant populations on the African Continent. By the \nlate 1980's, the population of African elephants had dramatically \ndeclined from approximately 1.3 million animals in 1979 to less than \n700,000 in 1987. The primary reason for this decline was the poaching \nand illegal slaughter of elephants for their tusks, which fueled the \ninternational trade in ivory.\n  To address this problem, the U.S. Congress enacted the African \nElephant Conservation Act to provide assistance to African nations in \ntheir efforts to stop poaching and to develop and implement effective \nconservation programs. To accomplish this goal, the legislation created \nthe African elephant conservation fund. Since 1988, Congress has \nappropriated over $6 million to fund 48 conservation projects in 17 \nrange states throughout Africa, with additional contributions of $7 \nmillion through private matching moneys.\n  The African elephant conservation fund has resulted in the \ndevelopment and implementation of various elephant conservation plans. \nToday, elephant populations have stabilized and are on the increase in \nsouthern Africa, the international ivory trade has been dramatically \nreduced, and wildlife rangers are better equipped to stop illegal \npoaching activities. The conservation fund originally focused on anti-\npoaching efforts. Over the last several years, the projects have \ndiversified to include elephant population research, efforts to \nmitigate elephant and human conflicts, the cataloging of ivory \nstockpiles, and the identification of new techniques for effective \nelephant management. It is important, however, to keep in mind that, \nwhile the African elephant conservation fund has resulted in several \nsuccessful conservation projects, much work remains to be done to \nensure that the African elephant continues to survive in its natural \nenvironment.\n  We must work to ensure that the African elephant does not once again \ndecline and disappear from its historic range. I am confident that \nadditional conservation projects funded through the legislation will \nhelp to preserve this flagship species for many future generations. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting the African Elephant \nConservation Reauthorization Act of 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 628.

Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator Hutchison, \nI am proud to introduce legislation that would name the Federal \ncourthouse in Brownsville, TX after a man who has been involved in the \nadministration of justice throughout South Texas for nearly 60 years, \nJudge Reynaldo G. Garza.\n  Judge Garza was the first Mexican-American to be appointed to a \nFederal judgeship in the history of our country, when President Kennedy \nappointed him to a district court bench in 1961. Judge Garza served as \na U.S. District Judge until 1979, when President Carter appointed him \nto the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he still serves, at the \nage of 81, in senior status.\n  Besides being named a the first Mexican-American Federal district \njudge, he was the first Mexican-American chief district judge, and the \nfirst Mexican-American Federal circuit court judge. He would have been \nthe first Mexican-American ever to have been appointed to a President's \nCabinet if he had accepted President Carter's request to serve as the \nNation's attorney general in 1977. Sensibly, however, Judge Garza \ndidn't want to move from Brownsville to Washington, DC.\n  Judge Garza's life has been filled with extraordinary \naccomplishments. Born in 1915 in Brownsville to Ygnacio and Zoila \nGarza, both Mexican immigrants, he was the sixth of eight children. \nJudge Garza reached adulthood during the Depression and, through sheer \nability, hard work and determination, graduated from the University of \nTexas Law School in 1939. He then established a law practice in \nBrownsville, mixing his work with the demands of raising five children \nand serving his community in capacities ranging from the local school \nboard and city commission to the Knights of Columbus.\n  Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, \nReynaldo Garza enlisted in the U.S. Army and served until the war's end \nin 1945 as a gunnery sergeant and in other capacities. In 1943, Garza \nwas selected to serve as translator in a meeting between President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt and Mexican President Miguel Avila Camacho, \nmarking the first time a U.S. president had met with a Mexican \npresident on Mexican soil.\n  Judge Garza's selfless commitment to his family, his community and \nhis Nation is exemplary, and today, he serves as a role model for \npeople both inside and outside of the legal profession.\n  I am privileged to introduce this legislation in Judge Garza's honor \ntoday and look forward to working with my colleagues to make the \nReynaldo G. Garza Federal courthouse a reality.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, today we honor our Nation's first \nMexican-American Federal judge, Judge Reynaldo G. Garza. I am proud to \ncosponsor legislation with Senator Gramm to name the new Federal \ncourthouse in Brownsville for Judge Garza. In this way, we will record \nfor generations to come Judge Garza's selfless service to the city of \nBrownsville, to Texas and to our Nation.\n  Traditionally, we reserve this honor for judges who no longer walk \nthe courthouse halls. However, we wish to grant an exception for this \nexceptional man. Born of immigrant parents, Reynaldo Garza has paved a \nhopeful path for other immigrant sons. After distinguishing himself as \na lawyer, he served on the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict until his appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit in 1979 by President Carter. As the first Mexican-\nAmerican to achieve these distinctions, Judge Garza truly personifies \nthe pioneer spirit of this great Nation.\n  I would like Judge Garza to be remembered as well for his gracious \nresponse to this action. Upon learning that the courthouse might be \nnamed for him, Judge Garza said simply, ``I'm humbled by the fact that \nsomebody would even think I'm worthy of it.'' Indeed, no one is \nworthier than Judge Garza of this small token of our respect and \nadmiration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (by request):\n  S. 629. A bill entitled the ``OECD Shipbuilding Agreement Act''; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  THE OECD SHIPBUILDING AGREEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President: today I introduce a bill to implement the \nOECD shipbuilding agreement to end foreign shipbuilding subsidies. This \nbill is an administration draft that I submit to better focus upcoming \ncongressional discussion of the issues. With Europe just announcing \n$2.1 billion in new subsidies for its shipyards, the United States \ncannot afford to delay action on this agreement any longer.\n  The United States has taken a leadership role in pushing for the \nelimination of unfair subsidies in the international commercial \nshipbuilding sector. In 1981, the United States unilaterally eliminated \nits own commercial shipbuilding subsidies. In October 1989, the United \nStates, at the request of the six defense-oriented shipyards and the \nsmaller commercial shipyards, initiated negotiations in the OECD aimed \nat eliminating trade distorting foreign shipbuilding subsidies. After 5 \nyears of negotiations and constant prodding by the U.S. Congress, the \nOECD shipbuilding agreement was signed by the European Union, Japan, \nthe Republic of Korea, Finland, Norway, and the United States on \nDecember 21, 1994.\n  The OECD shipbuilding agreement, which covers over 80 percent of the\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\nworld's commercial shipbuilding and repair capacity, would prohibit \ngovernment subsidies to the shipbuilding industry, as well as \ndiscipline export credits, set common rules for government financing \nprograms, and establish a mechanism for addressing injurious pricing, \nthat is, dumping. As of June 1, 1996, all signatories, except the \nUnited States, had ratified the agreement.\n  In the last Congress, several parties expressed serious concerns \nabout certain aspects of the agreement and the proposed implementing \nlegislation which we were unable to address before the end of the last \nsession. As a result, the agreement's entry into force has been delayed \nby more than a year. I am hopeful that an agreement on implementing \nlegislation can be reached early this session and I think the bill I am \nintroducing today is a huge step in that direction.\n  I am very concerned, however, that further delay in confirming United \nStates commitment to this agreement will seriously undermine U.S. long-\nterm efforts to eliminate foreign shipbuilding subsidies, especially as \nother countries face increased pressure to resume the granting of \nsubsidies to their shipbuilding industries. The United States can't \nafford a shipbuilding subsidies race. We are cutting funding of \nimportant domestic programs now. The United States needs to approve and \nimplement the shipbuilding agreement in order to give us the tools to \nchallenge foreign subsidies and protect our shipbuilding industry \nagainst unfair foreign competition.\n  I ask you to join the battle against unfair international \nshipbuilding subsidies by supporting the swift passage of legislation \napproving and implementing the OECD shipbuilding agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                       PART 1--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SECTION 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deposit \nin the highway trust fund the receipts of the 4.3-cent increase in the \nfuel tax rates enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 federal highway trust fund legislation\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill today to ensure \nthat adequate resources are available to reverse the very destructive \ntrend of Federal disinvestment in our Nation's critical infrastructure \nof highways and bridges. The bill that I introduce would place into the \nhighway trust fund the 4.3-\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\ncents-per-gallon gas tax that is currently used for our deficit \nreduction.\n  Senators will recall that back in May and June of last year, there \nwas much debate on this 4.3-cent gas tax, which was first imposed by \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.\n  During this past summer, I deferred offering this bill as an \namendment to two separate tax bills, and I did so at the request of \nboth the majority and the minority leaders. But unfortunately, another \nopportunity to offer the amendment to a tax bill did not arise.\n  By depositing this additional 4.3-cents per gallon gas tax into the \nhighway trust fund, Congress will have the resources to better meet the \ntrue needs of our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  Our Federal investment in infrastructure as a percentage of the total \nFederal budget has declined significantly since 1980. Few economics \nwould disagree that adequate long-term investment in infrastructure is \ncritical to a nation's economic well-being. Only through investment \nhere at home, only through investment to maintain and renew our own \nphysical plant, can our economy grow and generate good wages for our \ncitizens.\n\n  Even so, our Nation's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of \nour gross domestic product has almost been cut in half since 1980. As a \nnation, we invest a considerably smaller percentage of our gross \ndomestic product in infrastructure than our economic competitors invest \nin economic infrastructure in Europe and in Asia.\n  Nowhere do we pay a greater price for inadequate infrastructure \ninvestment than in our Nation's highways. Our National Highway System \ncarries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commerce and nearly 80 \npercent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. Yet, we have \nallowed segments of our National Highway System to fall into disrepair.\n  The Department of Transportation recently released its latest report \non the condition of the Nation's highways. Its findings are even more \ndisturbing than earlier reports. The Department of Transportation \ncurrently classified less than half of the mileage on our interstate \nsystem as being in good condition and only 39 percent of our entire \nNational Highway System is rated in good condition. Fully 61 percent of \nour Nation's highways are rated in either fair condition or in poor \ncondition. Almost one in four of our Nation's highway bridges are now \ncategorized as either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, investment in our \nNation's highways is a full $15 billion short each year just to \nmaintain these current inadequate conditions--just to maintain them. \nPut another way, we would have to increase our national highway \ninvestment by more than $15 billion a year just to avoid further \ndeterioration of our national highway network.\n  It should be noted that, while our highway infrastructure continue to \ndeteriorate, highway use is on the rise. Indeed, it is growing at a \nvery rapid pace. The number of vehicle miles traveled has grown by \nroughly 40 percent in just the last decade. As a result, we are \nwitnessing new highs in the levels of highway congestion, causing \ndelays in the movement of goods and people that costs our national \neconomy more than $40 billion a year.\n  So, Mr. President, it is clear that the requirement that we place on \nour National Highway System are growing while our investment continues \nto decline. We are simply digging ourselves a deeper and deeper hole. \nSix years ago, in 1991, it was estimated that an investment of $47.5 \nbillion would be necessary on an annual basis to ensure that highway \nconditions would not deteriorate any further than existed in that \nyear--that it would not get any worse. By 1993, that figure grew to \n$51.6 billion. And 2 years ago, that figure grew to $54.8 billion. \nErgo, the longer we delay increasing Federal highway spending, the more \nexpensive it will be to reverse this destructive trend, which costs our \nNation dearly.\n  Productivity improvements are the key to global competitiveness, \nrising standards of living and economic growth. Investments in highways \nresult in significant, nationwide improvements in productivity. \nAccording to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 billion \ninvested in highways creates and sustains over 40,000 full-time jobs. \nFurthermore, the very same $1 billion also results in a $240 million \nreduction in overall production costs for American manufacturers.\n  While we can easily see the economic impact of disinvestment in our \nNation's highways, we must not lose sight of the fact that \ndeteriorating highways have a direct relationship to safety as well. We \nmay be talking about your life. We may be talking about your life. And \nwe are. Almost 42,000 people died on our Nation's highways in 1996. \nThat equates to having a mid-sized passenger aircraft crash every day, \nkilling all of its occupants. The National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration counts poor road conditions as a contributing factor in \na large percentage of these fatal accidents, as well as those in which \nthere are serious injuries. The economic impact of these highway \naccidents cost our Nation $150 billion a year, and that figure is \ngrowing. More importantly, this wasteful carnage brings incredible \nsorrow to affected families and friends, and the Nation loses the \nskills, the talents, and the contributions of the victims.\n  The Senate will soon take up legislation to reauthorize the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. This bill \nwill be one of the most important pieces of legislation that we \nconsider this session. Many Members, including myself, have introduced \nlegislation to address specific transportation needs in their States \nand regions. Also, many Members have spoken of the need for formula \nchanges to bring about what they perceive to be a more equitable \ndistribution of funds from the highway program.\n  However, we must face the fact that, absent a substantial increase in \nthe current level of spending on our highway program, we will not have \nthe resources available to address the many important, but often \ncompeting, needs for our Nation's highway requirements in all regions \nof the country.\n  So in the coming weeks, Mr. President, I look forward to working with \nall of my colleagues toward the enactment of substantially increased \nauthorizations and appropriations for our Nation's highway system. And \nthe bill that I have introduced today will provide a very helpful tool \nwith which to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3424-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3424-S3455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 624. A bill to establish a competitive process for the awarding of \nconcession contracts in units of the National Park System, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE CONCESSION POLICY REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, as a part of the Earth Day celebration, I \nam, once again, introducing legislation to reform the concessions \npolicies of the National Park Service. This bill is very similar to a \nbill I sponsored in the 103d Congress--listen to this--which passed the \nSenate 90 to 9 and passed the House 386 to 30, but it is not yet law. \nIt repeals the 1965 Concessions Policy Act which has been over a 30-\nyear-old outrage.\n  My legislation would establish an open competitive process for \nawarding concessions contracts in units of the National Park System. It \nwill be a competitive process for the first time. These contracts are \nvery lucrative the way they are let under the 1965 act, and the \nAmerican people are getting shafted and have been for a very long time.\n  Instead of putting the money that we get today back into the Treasury \nfor general purposes, under my bill, the money we get from the \ncontracts will go to a special account for the use of the National Park \nService, and Lord only knows every study shows they need it.\n  This will be the 18th year that I have worked to reform the \nconcession policies of this country. The very first oversight hearing I \never held upon becoming chairman of the Parks Subcommittee in 1979 was \non this very issue. One has to have a lot of patience to operate around \nhere.\n  Since that time, there has been no telling how many reports, \nhearings, markups, floor debates there have been. Everybody agrees the \nexisting law ought to be changed, but in 18 years, with the most \ndiligent efforts I can put into it, it has not been changed, simply \nbecause the park concessioners have more clout with some Members of the \nSenate than have I. They have more clout than the American people have \nwith the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, let me just tell you what has been happening.\n  In 1995--that is the latest year for which we have complete \ninformation on these concession contracts--in 1995, the United States \nreceived just under $16 million in franchise fees on gross concession \nrevenues of $676 million, a whopping 2.4-percent return.\n  These contracts are almost handed down from generation to generation. \nThey probably put them in their will and give them to their first-born \nson. It is almost impossible to undo one. But the U.S. taxpayer had a \n2.4 percent return on $676 million of national park concessions fees \nlast year.\n  In all fairness, let me add this. Under the existing law, a \nconcessioner can also make improvements in the parks in consultation \nand agreement with the National Park Service. He can make improvements, \nhe might even build a new hotel--all kinds of things like that--and he \nis entitled then to take that into consideration as a part of his fee. \nBut even when you add that in, even when you add in the amount that \nconcessioners spend to improve the park, which, incidentally, is to \ntheir benefit because it invariably increases revenues, that increases \nthe amount we received to $40 million on $676 million, still only a \n5.9-percent return.\n  You can invest in a T-bill and do as well, but this is our land, our \nproperty, the reason tourists go there and spend their money, because \nit is a park that Congress, in its infinite wisdom, established. Any \nproperty owner in the United States should ask yourself this question: \nWould you lease your property out for that kind of return when it was \nproducing that kind of revenue for the lessee? You would not even \nconsider it.\n\n[[Page S3425]]\n\n  A 5.9-percent return we are getting now is better than we have \nreceived in the past, but listen to this, just to show you how \nridiculous the current policy is. You will recall that Matsushita \nbought MCA, which owned the Yosemite Park and Curry Co., the \nconcessioner at Yosemite. So Matsushita, when they bought this company, \ninherited the concessions contract at Yosemite, which produces the most \nconcessions revenue of any park in the United States.\n  This will show what happens when you have competition. The people in \nthis place, incidentally, are supposed to believe in capitalism. They \nbelieve in competition. They believe if you leave it to the \nmarketplace, everything will work out just hunky-dory, except, it \nseems, for mining and concessions.\n  So, here was a contract that Matsushita gave up, and whoever got the \nnew contract was going to have to pay off a $62 million note.\n  What happened in this contract, Matsushita gave up the contract, the \nNational Park Foundation took it for 1 day just for transition \npurposes, and then Delaware North bid and was awarded the new contract, \nthe first time, I believe, in the history of the National Park Service, \nsince the old law, that a contract had been let competitively.\n  Would you like to know what happened? The year before this contract \nwas let, the taxpayers got a return from the Yosemite concessions \noperations of three-quarters of 1 percent. And the first year--the \nfirst year--Delaware North had it under the new, actually competitively \nlet contract; on over $80 million of gross revenues, the taxpayers \nreceived about a 16-percent return.\n  Why, Mr. President, do we continue to beat this dog about how \nimportant it is to rebuild these facilities in the parks and give a \nconcessioner credit for it and all that?\n  My bill eliminates the anticompetitive measures of the 1965 act, but \nit also recognizes that all concessions are not the same.\n  People come to me and say, ``How about the small operators? They're \nstruggling to make ends meet.'' Under my bill small family operations \ngrossing less than $500,000 a year would retain a preference to renew \ntheir contracts--so would outfitters and guide operators. Even though \nthey are not a major share of the revenue, we probably exempt 80 to 90 \npercent of the concession operations because most of them are \nadmittedly rather small. But my bill ensures that there will be open \ncompetition for the large contracts which generate over 90 percent of \nthe total concessions revenue.\n  As I have already pointed out, the revenues that we get under this \nbill will go straight into a special account to be used by the National \nPark Service, similar to the entrance fee legislation just enacted last \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, one of the major changes that is made in this bill is \nthe elimination of what is known as possessory interest. And here is \nthe way it has been working. A concessioner goes to the National Park \nService--this is just a hypothetical case--and says, ``We want to build \na hotel for $10 million.'' They work out the deal and the Park Service \napproves it.\n  What happens at that point is, they start depreciating that hotel. \nAny businessman does that, of course. So the concessioner starts \ndepreciating this $10 million hotel over a 30- or 40-year period, \nwhatever the IRS requires--let us assume it is a 40-year depreciation--\nand at the end of 20 years he has depreciated $5 million and has $5 \nmillion left to recover.\n  Under existing law, he is entitled to receive whatever he can get for \nthat hotel. If he surrenders the contract, or is kicked out, or for any \nother reason, loses his contract, he can receive literally the fair \nmarket value of the hotel, which may very well be $15 million. He only \npaid $10 million, he has a tax deduction of $5 million, and he can turn \nright around and sell it for $15 million and make that an obligation of \nthe next concessioner.\n  How much nonsense can you put in one law? You think about that. Now, \nyou talk about a bird's nest on the ground, that is possessory \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, there is one other provision in the old law that is \nequally as egregious. And that is the preferential right an incumbent \nconcessioner gets to renew his contract. Another hypothetical case--you \nhave a 15-year contract, we will say, in Yellowstone National Park. At \nthe end of the 15 years, the Park Service will put out a notice to \nanybody who might be interested to let them know if they would like to \nbid on the concessions operation at Yellowstone.\n  So let us assume that I would kind of like to have the Yellowstone \ncontract, so I go to the Park Service and say, ``I would like to bid on \nthis.'' And the Park Service says, ``That's just jakey. You go ahead \nand bid. Tell us what you would give us for it.'' But let me tell you \nsomething, whatever you bid, the guy who has the contract now is \nentitled meet your bid, and if so, he gets it.\n  You tell me, why would I spend a half-million dollars or whatever it \ntakes preparing a bid on something as significant as the concessions in \nYelowstone National Park, knowing that the person who has that contract \nnow need only meet my bid?\n  He may have paid a 2-percent return to the Federal Government last \nyear. I may be willing to pay 10 percent. And the \nincumbent concessioner knows what the contract is worth. So he comes in \nand says, ``Well, I'll give you 10 percent, too.'' So I ask you, if you \nare a businessman, who in his right mind is going to go out there and \nspend a lot of money preparing a bid, knowing that the person who has \nthe contract right now only need match your bid?\n\n  I hear a lot of talk on the floor of the Senate about good old \ncapitalism and good old competition and how it solves all problems. \nThis is the most egregious policy I can imagine and yet it has been \ngoing on for years and years.\n  But if we pass this bill it will not go on any more.\n  Mr. President, we have made some progress through the efforts of the \nadministration. However, they have gone about as far as they can go \njust doing things by regulation. They cannot do very much more. But I \ngive a lot of credit to Bruce Babbitt and President Clinton for at \nleast trying to bring some equity into this without changing the law.\n  But you know, we have a lot of Senators here who have good friends \nwho had the concession contract on some park in their State for 40 \nyears, and they just cannot see fit to change the law.\n  You know, the other night I was watching some show on NBC about \nmining and how egregious our mining policies are. I have worked on that \nfor about 8 years. And I think this year may finally be the year \nbecause it is getting to be a kind of a political hot potato for people \nwho are not from mining States to continue to allow that kind of \nripoff, rape, and pillage of the taxpayers. But I can tell you it is \nnot a bit worse than this concessions policy we have had for all these \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                                 S. 624\n\n       Be it enacted in the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such minimum requirements shall \n     include, but need not be limited to--\n       (A) the minimum acceptable franchise fee;\n       (B) any facilities, services, or capital investment \n     required to be provided by the concessioner; and\n       (C) measures necessary to ensure the protection and \n     preservation of park resources.\n       (2) The Secretary shall reject any proposal, \n     notwithstanding the franchise fee offered, if the Secretary \n     determines that the person, corporation, or entity is not \n     qualified, is likely to provide unsatisfactory service, or \n     that the proposal is not responsive to the objectives of \n     protecting and preserving park resources and of providing \n     necessary and appropriate facilities or services to the \n     public at reasonable rates.\n       (3) If all proposals submitted to the Secretary either fail \n     to meet the minimum requirements or are rejected by the \n     Secretary, the Secretary shall establish new minimum contract \n     requirements and re-initiate the competitive selection \n     process pursuant to this section.\n       (e) Selection of Best Proposal.--(1) In selecting the best \n     proposal, the Secretary shall consider the following \n     principal factors:\n       (A) the responsiveness of the proposal to the objectives of \n     protecting and preserving park resources and of providing \n     necessary and appropriate facilities and services to the \n     public at reasonable rates;\n       (B) the experience and related background of the person, \n     corporation, or entity submitting the proposal, including but \n     not limited to, the past performance and expertise of such \n     person, corporation, or entity in providing the same or \n     similar facilities or services;\n       (C) the financial capability of the person, corporation, or \n     entity submitting the proposal;

PROTECTION OF CONCESSIONER INVESTMENT.\n\n       (a) Current Contract.--(1) A concessioner who before the \n     date of the enactment of this Act has acquired or \n     constructed, or is required under an existing concession \n     contract\n\n[[Page S3428]]\n\n     to commence acquisition or construction of any structure, \n     fixture, or improvement upon land owned by the United States \n     within a park, pursuant to such contract, shall have a \n     possessory interest therein, to the extent provided by such \n     contract.\n       (2) Unless otherwise provided in such contract, said \n     possessory interest shall not be extinguished by the \n     expiration or termination of the contract and may not be \n     taken for public use without just compensation. Such \n     possessory interest may be assigned, transferred, encumbered, \n     or relinquished.\n       (3) Upon the termination of a concession contract in effect \n     before the date of enactment of this title, the Secretary \n     shall determine the value of any outstanding possessory \n     interest applicable to the contract, such value to be \n     determined for all purposes on the basis of applicable laws \n     and contracts in effect on the day before the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant \n     a possessory interest to a concessioner whose contract in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act does not \n     include recognition of a possessory interest.\n       (b) New Contracts.--(1)(A) With respect to a concession \n     contract entered into on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the value of any outstanding possessory interest \n     associated with such contract shall be set at the value \n     determined by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (a)(3).\n       (B) As a condition of entering into a concession contract, \n     the value of any outstanding possesory interest shall be \n     reduced on an annual basis, in equal portions, over the same \n     number of years as the time period associated with the \n     straight line depreciation of the structure, fixture, or \n     improvement associated with such possessory interest, as \n     provided by applicable Federal income tax laws and \n     regulations in effect on the day before the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (C) In the event that the contract expires or is terminated \n     prior to the elimination of any outstanding possessory \n     interest, the concessioner shall be entitled to receive from \n     the United States or the successor concessioner payment equal \n     to the remaining value of the possessory interest.\n       (D) A successor concessioner may not revalue any \n     outstanding possessory interest, nor the period of time over \n     which such interest is reduced.\n       (E) Title to any structure, fixture, or improvement \n     associated with any outstanding possessory interest shall be \n     vested in the United States.\n       (2)(A) If the Secretary determines during the competitive \n     selection process that all proposals submitted either fail to \n     meet the minimum requirements or are rejected (as provided in \n     section 7), the Secretary may, solely with respect to any \n     outstanding possessory interest associated with the contract \n     and established pursuant to a concession contract entered \n     into prior to the date of enactment of this Act, suspend the \n     reduction provisions of subsection (b)(1)(B) for the duration \n     of the contract, and re-initiate the competitive selection \n     process as provided in section 7.\n       (B) The Secretary may suspend such reduction provisions \n     only if the Secretary determines that the establishment of \n     other new minimum contract requirements is not likely to \n     result in the submission of satisfactory proposals, and that \n     the suspension of the reduction provisions is likely to \n     result in the submission of satisfactory proposals: Provided, \n     however, That nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to \n     require the Secretary to establish a minimum franchise fee at \n     a level below the franchise fee in effect for such contract \n     on the day before the expiration date of the previous \n     contract.\n       (c) New Structures.--(1) On or after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, a concessioner who constructs or acquires a new, \n     additional, or replacement structure, fixture, or improvement \n     upon land owned by the United States within a park, pursuant \n     to a concession contract, shall have an interest in such \n     structure, fixture, or improvement equivalent to the actual \n     original cost of acquiring or constructing such structure, \n     fixture, or improvement, less straight line depreciation over \n     the estimated useful life of the asset according to Generally \n     Accepted Accounting Principles: Provided, That in no event \n     shall the estimated useful life of such asset exceed the \n     depreciation period used for such asset for Federal income \n     tax purposes.\n       (2) In the event that the contract expires or is terminated \n     prior to the recovery of such costs, the concessioner shall \n     be entitled to receive from the United States or the \n     successor concessioner payment equal to the value of the \n     concessioner's interest in such structure, fixture, or \n     improvement. A successor concessioner may not revalue the \n     interest in such structure, fixture, or improvement, the \n     method of depreciation, or the estimated useful life of the \n     asset.\n       (3) Title to any such structure, fixture, or improvement \n     shall be vested in the United States.\n       (d) Insurance, Maintenance and Repair.--Nothing in this \n     section shall affect the obligation of a concessioner to \n     insure, maintain, and repair any structure, fixture, or \n     improvement assigned to such concessioner and to insure that \n     such structure, fixture, or improvement fully complies with \n     applicable safety and health laws and regulations.\n\n     SEC. 13. RATES AND CHARGES TO PUBLIC.\n\n       The reasonableness of a concessioner's rates and charges to \n     the public shall, unless otherwise provided in the bid \n     specifications and contract, be judged primarily by \n     comparison with those rates and charges for facilities and \n     services of comparable character under similar conditions, \n     with due consideration for length of season, seasonal \n     variance, average percentage of occupancy, accessibility, \n     availability and costs of labor and materials, type of \n     patronage, and other factors deemed significant by the \n     Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 14. CONCESSIONER PERFORMANCE EVALUATION.\n\n       (a) Regulations.--as soon as practicable after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall publish, after an \n     appropriate period for public comment, regulations \n     establishing standards and criteria for evaluating the \n     performance of concessions operating within parks.\n       (b) Periodic Evaluation.--(1) The Secretary shall \n     periodically conduct an evaluation of each concessioner \n     operating under a concession contract pursuant to this Act, \n     as appropriate, to determine whether such concessioner has \n     performed satisfactorily. In evaluating a concessioner's \n     performance, the Secretary shall seek and consider applicable \n     reports and comments from appropriate Federal, State, and \n     local regulatory agencies, and shall seek and consider the \n     applicable views of park visitors and concession customers. \n     If the Secretary's performance evaluation results in an \n     unsatisfactory rating of the concessioner's overall \n     operation, the Secretary shall provide the concessioner with \n     a list of the minimum requirements necessary for the \n     operation to be rated satisfactory, and shall so notify the \n     concessioner in writing.\n       (2) The Secretary may terminate a concession contract if \n     the concessioner fails to meet the minimum operational \n     requirements identified by the Secretary within the time \n     limitations established by the Secretary at the time notice \n     of the unsatisfactory rating is provided to the concessioner.\n       (3) If the Secretary terminates a concession contract \n     pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall solicit \n     proposals for a new contract consistent with the provisions \n     of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 15. RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each concessioner shall keep such records \n     as the Secretary may prescribe to enable the Secretary to \n     determine that all terms of the concessioner's contract have \n     been, and are being faithfully performed, and the Secretary \n     or any of the Secretary's duly authorized representatives \n     shall, for the purpose of audit and examination, have access \n     to such records and to other books, documents and papers of \n     the concessioner pertinent to the contract and all the terms \n     and conditions thereof as the Secretary deems necessary.\n       (b) General Accounting Office Review.--The Comptroller \n     General of the United States or any of his or her duly \n     authorized representatives shall, until the expiration of \n     five calendar years after the close of the business year for \n     each concessioner, have access to and the right to examine \n     any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of the \n     concessioner related to the contracts or contracts involved.\n\n     SEC. 16. EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN LEASE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       The provisions of section 321 of the Act of June 30, 1932 \n     (47 Stat. 412; 40 U.S.C. 303b), relating to the leasing of \n     buildings and properties of the United States, shall not \n     apply to contracts awarded by the Secretary pursuant to this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 17. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Gorton and Mr. Grams):\n  S. 625. A bill to provide for competition between forms of motor \nvehicle insurance, to permit an owner of a motor vehicle to choose the \nmost appropriate form on insurance for that person, to guarantee \naffordable premiums, to provide for more adequate and timely \ncompensation for accident victims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                   THE AUTO CHOICE REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am happy today to join with my \nesteemed colleagues, Senator Moynihan and Senator Lieberman, to \nannounce the introduction of the Auto Choice Reform Act. As you know, \nwe introduced this bill in the last Congress, along with Senator Dole. \nWe are proud to announce that Senator Slade Gorton and Senator Rod \nGrams have also joined us as original cosponsors.\n  You will hear lots of discussion today, and in the coming months, \nabout various aspects of automobile insurance and tort liability. But, \neverything you will hear about Auto Choice can be summed up in two \nwords: choice and savings.\n  Consumers want, need, and deserve both.\n  Very simply, the Auto Choice Reform Act offers consumers the choice \nof opting out of the pain and suffering litigation lottery. The \nconsumers who make this choice will achieve a substantial\n\n[[Page S3429]]\n\nsavings on automobile insurance premiums.\n  Based on an analysis by the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, the \nJoint Economic Committee estimates that, under Auto Choice, consumers \ncould save a total of $45 billion nationwide in 1997--at no cost to the \nGovernment. And, over 5 years, Auto Choice could make available a total \nof $246 billion in savings. Now, that's better than any tax cut that \neither party has proposed.\n  What does a $45 billion annual savings mean to the average driver? \nWell, that savings is colorfully and clearly illustrated behind me with \nthis check: ``Pay to the Order of the American Driver--$243.'' And this \ncheck is not a one-time payment. Motorists could achieve this type of \nsavings every year.\n  However, before you can truly comprehend the benefits of Auto Choice, \nyou must understand the terrible costs of the current tort liability \nsystem.\n  The Nation's auto insurance system desperately needs an overhaul. And \nnobody knows this better than the American motorist--who is now paying \non average $757 for automobile insurance. Between 1987 and 1994, \naverage premiums rose 44 percent--nearly 1\\1/2\\ times the rate of \ninflation.\n  Why are consumers forced to pay so much?\n  Because the auto insurance system is clogged and bloated by fraud, \nwasteful litigation, and abuse.\n  First, let's talk about fraud. In 1995, the F.B.I. announced a wave \nof indictments stemming from Operation Sudden Impact, the most wide-\nranging investigation of criminal fraud schemes involving staged car \naccidents and massive fraud in the health care system. The F.B.I. \nuncovered criminal enterprises staging bus and car accidents in order \nto bring lawsuits and collect money from innocent people, businesses \nand governments. F.B.I. Director Louis Freeh estimates that every \nAmerican household is burdened by an additional $200 in unnecessary \ninsurance premiums to cover this enormous amount of fraud.\n  In addition to the pervasive criminal fraud that exists, the \nincentives of our litigation system encourage injured parties to make \nexcessive medical claims to drive up their damage claims in lawsuits. \nThe Rand Institute for Civil Justice, in a study released in 1995, \nconcluded that 35 to 42 percent of claimed medical costs in car \naccident cases are excessive and unnecessary. Let me repeat that in \nsimple English: well over one-third of doctor, hospital, physical \ntherapy, and other medical costs claimed in car accident cases are \nfor nonexistent injuries or for unnecessary treatment.\n\n  The value of this wasteful health care? Four billion dollars \nannually. I don't need to remind anyone of the ongoing local and \nnational debate over our health care system. While people have \nstrongly-held differences over the causes and solutions to that \nproblem, the Rand data make one thing certain --lawsuits, and the \npotential for hitting the jackpot, drive overuse and abuse of the \nhealth care system. Reducing those costs by $4 billion annually, \nwithout depriving one person of needed medical care, is clearly in our \nnational interest.\n  Why would an injured party inflate their medical claims, you might \nask. It's simple arithmetic. For every $1 of economic loss, a party \nstands to recover up to $3 in pain and suffering awards. In short, the \nmore you go to the doctor, the more you get from the jury. And, the \nmore you get from the jury, the more money your attorney puts in his \nown pocket.\n  In addition to the massive fraud encouraged by the liability system, \nseriously injured people are grossly undercompensated under the tort \nsystem. A 1991 Rand study reveals that people with economic losses \nbetween $25,000 and $100,000 recover on the average only 50 percent of \ntheir economic losses. People with losses in excess of $100,000 recover \nonly 9 percent.\n  Moreover, liability insurance does not pay until the claim is \nresolved. Studies show that the average time to recover is 16 months, \nand it takes longer in serious injury cases.\n  The Auto Choice bill gives consumers a way out of this system of high \npremiums, rampant fraud, and slow, inequitable compensation. Our bill \nwould remove the perverse incentives of lawsuits, while ensuring that \ncar accident victims recover fully for their economic loss.\n  Now, I'd like to answer the question: what is Auto Choice? Let me \nfirst answer with what it is not. It does not abolish lawsuits, and it \ndoes not eliminate the concept of fault within the legal system. There \nwill no doubt be less reason to go to court, but the right to sue is \nabsolutely not abolished.\n  What it does do is allow drivers to decide how they want to be \ninsured. In establishing the choice mechanism, the bill unbundles \neconomic and noneconomic losses and allows the driver to choose whether \nto be covered for noneconomic losses--that is, pain and suffering \nlosses.\n  In other words, if a driver wants to be covered for pain and \nsuffering, he stays in the current State system. If he wants to opt-out \nof the pain and suffering regime, he chooses the personal protection \nsystem.\n  This choice, which sounds amazingly simple and imminently reasonable, \nis, believe it or not, currently unavailable for over ninety percent of \nall motorists. Auto Choice will change that.\n  Let me briefly explain the choices that our bill will offer every \nconsumer. A consumer will be able to choose one of two insurance \nsystems.\n  The first choice is the tort maintenance system. Drivers who wish to \nstay in their current system would choose this system and be able to \nsue and be sued for pain and suffering. These drivers would essentially \nbuy the same type of insurance that they currently carry--and would \nrecover, or fail to recover, in the same way that they do today. The \nonly change for tort drivers would be that, in the event that they are \nhit by a personal protection driver, the tort driver would recover both \neconomic and noneconomic damages from his own insurance policy. This \nsupplemental first-party policy for tort drivers will be called tort \nmaintenance coverage.\n\n  The second choice is the personal protection system. Consumers \nchoosing this system would be guaranteed prompt recovery of their \neconomic losses, up to the levels of their own insurance policy. These \ndrivers would give up recovery of pain and suffering damages in \nexchange for being immune from pain and suffering lawsuits. Personal \nprotection drivers would achieve substantially reduced premiums because \nthe personal protection system would dramatically reduce: First, pain \nand suffering damages, second, fraud, and third, the bulk of attorney \nfees.\n  Under both insurance systems--tort maintenance and personal \nprotection--the injured party whose economic losses exceed his own \ncoverage will have the right to sue the responsible party for the \nexcess. Moreover, tort drivers will retain the right to sue each other \nfor both economic and noneconomic loss. Critics who say the right to \nsue is abolished by this bill are plain wrong.\n  The advantages of personal protection coverage are enormous.\n  First, personal protection coverage assures that those who suffer \ninjury, regardless of whether someone else is responsible, will be paid \nfor their economic losses. The driver does not have to leave \ncompensation up to the vagaries of how an accident occurs and how much \ncoverage the other driver has. A driver whose car goes off a slippery \nroad will be able to recover for his economic losses. Such a blameless \ndriver could not recover under the tort system because no other person \nwas at fault. No matter when and how a driver or a member of his family \nis injured, the driver knows his insurance will protect his family.\n  Second, the choice as to how much insurance protection to purchase is \nin the hands of the driver, who is in the best position to know how \nmuch coverage he and his family need. He can choose as much or as \nlittle insurance as his circumstances require, from $20,000 of \nprotection to $1 million of coverage.\n  Third, people who elect the personal protection option will, in the \nevent they are injured, be paid promptly, as their losses accrue.\n  Fourth, we will have more rational use of precious health care \nresources. Insuring on a first-party basis eliminates the incentives \nfor excess medical claiming. When a person chooses to be compensated \nfor actual economic loss, the tort system's incentives for padding \none's claims disappear.\n  Fifth, Auto Choice offers real benefits for low-income drivers \nbecause the\n\n[[Page S3430]]\n\nsavings are progressive. Low-income drivers will see the biggest \nsavings because they pay a higher proportion of their disposable income \nin insurance costs. A study of low income residents of Maricopa County, \nAZ, revealed that households below 50 percent of the poverty line spent \nan amazing 31.6 percent of their disposable income on car insurance.\n  For many low-income families the choices are stark: car insurance and \nthe ability to get to the job, or medicine, new clothing or extra food \nfor the children. Or, they choose the worst alternative of all--driving \nwithout any insurance. Should we allow our litigation system to promote \nsuch unlawful conduct?\n  Moreover, Auto Choice offers benefits to all taxpayers, even those \nwho don't drive. For example, local governments will save taxpayer \ndollars through decreased insurance and litigation costs. This will \nallow governments to use our tax dollars to more directly benefit the \ncommunity. Think of all the additional police and firefighters that \ncould be hired with money now spent on lawsuits. Or, schools and \nplaygrounds that could be better equipped. New York City spends more on \nliability claims than it spends on libraries, botanical gardens, the \nBronx Zoo, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Department of Youth \nServices, combined. Imagine the improved quality of life in our urban \nareas if governments were free of spending on needless lawsuits.\n\n  Last, we will create incentives for safer cars. Now, it actually \ncosts more to insure a safer car. That's because a driver in a bigger \ncar who is responsible for another's injury may have a bigger claim to \npay. After all, the bigger, safer car may cause more damage to the \nperson in a smaller, less safe car. So insuring a bigger, safer car \ncosts more. But under auto choice and first-party coverage, insurance \ncompanies would reward customers with lower premiums for safer cars.\n  The bottom line? We think that consumers should be able to make one \nsimple choice: ``Do you want to continue to pay $757 a year for auto \ninsurance and have the right to recover pain and suffering damages? Or \nwould you rather save $243 a year on your premiums, be promptly \nreimbursed for your economic losses, and forego pain and suffering \ndamages?''\n  It's really that simple. And, we're not even going to tell them which \nanswer is the right one. Because that's not up to us. It's up to the \nconsumer. We simply want to give them the choice.\n  In closing, I'd like to do something I rarely do--quote the New York \nTimes--which summed up the benefits, and indeed, the simplicity of Auto \nChoice: Auto Choice ``would give families the option of foregoing suits \nfor nonmonetary losses in exchange for quick and complete reimbursement \nfor every blow to their pocketbook. Everyone would win--except the \nlawyers.''\n  Now, before I turn over the floor to Senator Moynihan, I'd like to \nshare with you a scathing indictment of the tort liability system that \nwas written more than a quarter of a century ago by a true visionary:\n\n       No one involved has an incentive to moderation or \n     reasonableness. The victim has every reason to exaggerate his \n     losses. It is some other person's insurance company that must \n     pay. The company has every reason to resist. It is somebody \n     else's customer who is making the claim. Delay, fraud, \n     contentiousness are maximized, and in the process the system \n     becomes grossly inefficient and expensive. Automobile \n     accident litigation has become a 20th-Century equivalent of \n     Dickens's Court of Chancery, eating up the pittance of widows \n     and orphans, a vale from which few return with their respect \n     for just[ice] undiminished.\n\n  Well, those insightful and prophetic words were spoken by none other \nthan the man who stands here with me as an original cosponsor today, my \ncolleague from the State of New York, Pat Moynihan. Pat, it's taken \nover 25 years, but I think we're finally going to overhaul this broken-\ndown auto insurance system.\n  Mr. President, this bill has broad support from across the spectrum. \nIt should be obvious by the support and endorsements that this bill has \nalready received that this is not conservative or liberal legislation. \nIt is consumer legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill and statements in support of Auto Choice from the Republican \nmayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani, the former Massachusetts \nGovernor and Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Dukakis, and \nthe executive director of the Reform Party, Russ Verney, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Auto Choice Reform Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the costs of operating a motor vehicle are excessive \n     due in substantial part to the legal and administrative costs \n     associated with the resolution of claims under the tort \n     liability insurance system;\n       (2) the tort liability insurance system often results in--\n       (A) the failure to provide compensation commensurate with \n     loss;\n       (B) an unreasonable delay in the payment of benefits; and\n       (C) the expenditure of an excessive amount for legal fees;\n       (3) the incentives of the tort liability insurance system \n     for motor vehicles are distorted, and result in--\n       (A) significant fraud in the claims process, which \n     exacerbates the level of distrust of many individuals in the \n     United States with respect to the legal process and the rule \n     of law;\n       (B) significant, wasteful, fraudulent, and costly overuse \n     and abuse of scarce health care resources and services;\n       (C) unbearable cost burdens on low-income individuals, \n     imposing on them the Hobson's choice of driving on an \n     unlawful, uninsured basis or foregoing essential needs, such \n     as food and adequate shelter;\n       (D) significant reductions in, access to, and purchases of, \n     motor vehicles, which--\n       (i) damage the economic well-being of many low-income \n     individuals; and\n       (ii) cause unnecessary harm to a critical component of the \n     economy of the United States;\n       (E) significant deterioration of the economic well-being of \n     the majority of major cities in the United States through the \n     imposition of a massive tort tax that--\n       (i) places a disproportionate burden on urban residents; \n     and\n       (ii) contributes to the abandonment of the cities by many \n     taxpayers who are able to achieve substantial after-tax \n     savings on automobile insurance premiums by moving to \n     adjacent suburban communities; and\n       (F) significant inability to achieve market-based discounts \n     in insurance rates for owners of safer cars, which reduces \n     the level of safety for drivers and passengers of motor \n     vehicles;\n       (4) insurance to indemnify individuals for personal \n     injuries arising from motor vehicle collisions is frequently \n     unavailable at a reasonable cost because of the potential \n     liability for third-party tort claims;\n       (5) a system that gives consumers the opportunity to insure \n     themselves and that separates economic and noneconomic \n     damages for the purposes of purchasing insurance would \n     provide significant cost savings to drivers of motor \n     vehicles;\n       (6) a system that enables individuals to choose the form of \n     motor vehicle insurance that best suits their needs would--\n       (A) enhance individual freedom;\n       (B) reduce the cost of motor vehicle insurance; and\n       (C) increase average compensation in the event of an \n     accident; and\n       (7) a system that targets and emphasizes the scourge of \n     those individuals who drive under the influence of drugs or \n     alcohol will further deter such dangerous and unlawful \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to allow consumers of motor \n     vehicle insurance to choose between--\n       (1) an insurance system that provides substantially the \n     same remedies as are available under applicable State law; \n     and\n       (2) a predominately first-party insurance system that \n     provides for--\n       (A) more comprehensive recovery of economic loss in a \n     shorter period of time; and\n       (B) the right to sue negligent drivers for any \n     uncompensated economic losses.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTO CHOICE INSURANCE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Operation of the Right To Choose.--Under this Act, a \n     person shall have the right to choose between the following \n     insurance systems:\n       (1) Personal protection system.--A person may choose \n     insurance under a system that provides for personal \n     protection insurance for that person and any resident \n     relative or dependent of that person.\n       (2) Tort maintenance system.--A person may choose insurance \n     under a system that provides for the form of motor vehicle \n     insurance (including tort liability, no-fault, add-on, or \n     uninsured motor vehicle insurance) that is otherwise required \n     in the State in which the person is insured.\n       (b) Personal Protection System.--\n       (1) Minimum policy requirements.--In order for a personal \n     protection insurance policy to be covered by this Act, a \n     motor vehicle insurance policy issued by an insurer shall, at \n     a minimum--\n       (A) provide personal protection insurance coverage--\n       (i) with no per accident limit; and\n       (ii) in coverage amounts equal to the greater of--\n\n       (I) the minimum per person limits of liability insurance \n     for personal injury under the applicable State financial \n     responsibility law; or\n       (II) in a State covered by a no-fault motor vehicle \n     insurance law, the minimum level of insurance required for \n     no-fault benefits;\n\n       (B) contain provisions for a waiver of certain tort rights \n     in accordance with this Act; and\n       (C) contain provisions under the applicable State financial \n     responsibility law relating to liability for--\n       (i) property damage; and\n       (ii) bodily injury to protect third parties whose rights to \n     recover both economic and noneconomic loss are not affected \n     by the immunities provided under this Act for those persons \n     choosing personal protection insurance coverage.\n       (2) Superseding provision.--This Act supersedes a State law \n     to the extent that, with respect to the issuance of a \n     personal protection insurance policy, the State law--\n       (A) would otherwise bar a provision that provides for the \n     personal protection authorizations and accompanying \n     immunities set forth in this Act; or\n       (B) is otherwise inconsistent with the requirements of this \n     Act.\n\n[[Page S3432]]\n\n       (3) Primacy of payment.--\n       (A) In general.--Personal protection insurance benefits \n     shall be reduced by an amount equal to any benefits provided \n     or required to be provided under an applicable Federal or \n     State law for workers' compensation or any State-required \n     nonoccupational disability insurance.\n       (B) Reimbursement of payors.--\n       (i) In general.--A personal protection insurer may take \n     appropriate measures to ensure that any person otherwise \n     eligible for personal protection benefits who has been paid \n     or is being paid for losses payable by personal protection \n     insurance from a source other than the applicable personal \n     protection insurer shall not receive multiple payment for \n     those losses.\n       (ii) Accrual of rights.--Any right to payment for losses \n     referred to in clause (i) from a personal protection insurer \n     accrues only to that payor.

Giuliani\n\n       Today, members of Congress and other leaders from across \n     the political spectrum, representing diverse populations and \n     constituencies, unite in expressing support for the \n     introduction and passage of bold, necessary federal \n     legislation reforming auto insurance and tort law in America.\n       The introduction of auto-choice legislation marks a \n     milestone in the nation's response to motorist demands for \n     fair, equitable and cost-effective insurance coverage. \n     Millions of drivers are presently paying excessive insurance \n     premiums because of inflated claims and huge pain and \n     suffering awards. Under this legislation proposed by Senators \n     Lieberman, McConnell and Moynihan, among others, the nation \n     as a whole stands to save $45 billion in insurance premiums \n     this year alone, with the average driver nationwide saving \n     $243 per year. That amounts to the equivalent of a $243 tax \n     cut without any corresponding cut in services. The newly \n     released report by the Joint Economic Committee of the United \n     States Congress on ``The Benefits and Savings of Auto-\n     Choice'' estimates that with auto choice, New York City \n     motorists will see an average decrease of $417 per driver per \n     year.\n       The genius of this bill is the unbundling of pain and \n     suffering coverage from insurance premiums and the switch to \n     first party coverage--similar to no-fault coverage. Moreover, \n     people who want coverage for pain and suffering--and are \n     willing to pay for it--can obtain it. But, they will not \n     recover pain and suffering damages at the expense of third \n     parties, or at the expense of our court system where \n     sympathetic juries often grant windfalls for being injured in \n     the form of subjective non-economic damages. There is simply \n     no justification for many of the enormous awards to the \n     injured who--though rightfully compensated for objective \n     pecuniary loss--are rewarded for unsubstantiated pain and \n     suffering damages, often with no regard for the relationship \n     to the fault of the parties concerned.\n       Over the years, New York City has risked losing the \n     valuable civic contributions of many of its residents to the \n     suburbs where insurance rates are usually more affordable. \n     Coupled with the reduction in crime our City has experienced, \n     reduced insurance premiums would provide added incentive for \n     City residents to keep their homes and their businesses in \n     the City. These reforms come at no cost to City residents nor \n     would they diminish governmental services. Motorists in \n     municipalities and urban centers across the land stand to \n     reap these enormous savings.\n       When we value the productivity of our urban residents and \n     demonstrate our respect for their contributions, we improve \n     the quality of life for the City as a whole and ensure its \n     prosperity for years to come. Auto-choice assists in doing \n     precisely that. It demonstrates our leaders' respect for the \n     economic well being of even the most hard pressed motorist.\n       But equally as important, the bill would help restore a \n     little faith in our courts and judicial system, which have \n     been increasingly plagued with criticism by, and stands to \n     lose the confidence of, ordinary citizens. When people see \n     some lawyers running from the hospital to the court to the \n     insurance company, they understand why their premiums are so \n     high. Plaintiffs receive barely one-half of all settlements \n     after lawyers, experts and court fees are paid. Under \n     existing law, plaintiff attorneys have tremendous incentive \n     to shoot for the gold--that giant pain and suffering cash \n     cow--paid for by the American motorist through excessive \n     insurance premiums.\n       People wonder: why can't this process be controlled? Today, \n     we tell these people that they, not special interests, are in \n     charge. We assure them that money which should not be \n     unjustly taken from them, will not be. We give them the \n     chance to determine for themselves how much insurance \n     coverage is\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\n     enough coverage for them and their families. And, keep in \n     mind, under auto-choice, all motorists obtain coverage for \n     objective economic loss, such as medical bills or lost wages.\n       The bill is sensible and fair, and I respectfully urge \n     Congress to pass this important legislation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Northeastern University, College of Arts and Sciences, \n           Department of Political Science,\n                                                   April 17, 1997.\n       I enthusiastically endorse the ``choice'' auto insurance \n     bill you are jointly sponsoring. Your action is an important \n     act of bipartisan leadership on an issue that significantly \n     affects all Americans.\n       The issue you address has been a great concern of mine \n     throughout my political career ever since I sponsored the \n     first no-fault auto insurance bill in the nation.\n       Given the horrendous high costs of auto insurance, coupled \n     with its long delays, high overhead, and rank unfairness when \n     it comes to payment, your ``choice'' reform takes the \n     sensible approach of allowing consumes to choose how to \n     insure themselves. In other words, your reform trust the \n     American people to decide for themselves whether to spend \n     their money on ``pain and suffering'' coverage of food, \n     medicine, life insurance or any other expenditure they deem \n     more valuable for themselves and their families.\n       The bill is a particularly important to the people who live \n     in American cities where premiums are the highest. It is no \n     surprise that the cost studies done by the Joint Economic \n     Committee indicate that while your reform will make stunning \n     cost savings available to all American consumers, its largest \n     benefits will go to the low income drivers living in urban \n     areas.\n       The bill will also help resolve the country's problems with \n     runaway health costs. By allowing consumer to remove \n     themselves from a system whose perverse incentives trigger \n     the cost of health care costs, your reform will lower the \n     cost of health care for all Americans while ensuring that \n     health care expenditure are more clearly targeted to health \n     care needs.\n       I look forward to assisting you to the fullest possible \n     degree as you exercise your vitally need leadership on behalf \n     of America's consumers.\n     Michael S. Dukakis.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n          Statement of Reform Party Chairman Russell J. Verney\n\n       Only on rare occasions does Congress have the opportunity \n     to stimulate our national economy without adding to the $5.2 \n     trillion debt burden this generation is leaving to our \n     children and grandchildren.\n       Auto Choice Reform is one of those rare opportunities. It \n     allows the owners of automobiles the choice of the level of \n     insurance coverage they wish to provide for their own losses. \n     protects an injured or harmed person's right to collect for \n     their losses and can cut the average automobile owner's \n     annual insurance rate by an average of $243 per year.\n       Auto Choice Reform is an idea whose time has come. \n     Unfortunately, it will also stimulate a new furious round of \n     campaign (investments) contributions by special interests who \n     benefit from the current high cost of auto insurance rates \n     and protracted litigation associated with automobile \n     insurance and accidents injuries.\n       As list of top donors to political parities and candidates \n     during 1995 and 1996, published by Mother Jones Magazine \n     listed numerous individuals from the insurance industry and \n     trial lawyers who have established their right of access to \n     our top political leaders in this country.\n       The sponsors and promoters of the common sense Auto Choice \n     Reform Act will have to overcome the easy access special \n     interests have to our country's decision makers if this $44 \n     billion per year cost savings for motorists in this country \n     is to be achieved.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Auto Choice Reform Act of 1997, a bill submitted by my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator McConnell.\n  This legislation is designed to create a new option in auto insurance \nfor consumers who would prefer a system that guarantees quick and \ncomplete compensation. This alternative system would change most \ninsurance coverage to a first-party system from a third-party system \nand it would separate economic and noneconomic compensation by \nunbundling the premium. Therefore, drivers would be allowed to insure \nthemselves for only economic loss or for both economic and noneconomic \nloss.\n  In the 1950's, I first became interested in the issue of auto \ninsurance reform as a member of New York Gov. Averell Harriman's \nTraffic Safety Policy Coordinating Committee. At that time, while \nworking on auto safety issues, I became convinced that as the number of \nautomobiles increased, the number of automobile accidents would, \ninexorably, also increase. And the problem with the current state of \nthe insurance system begins right there. A driver buys protection \nagainst the risk that he will negligently cause an accident that will \ninjure another person. If that should occur, the driver's insurance \ncompany is responsible for compensating the victim. But this \ncontradicts the very nature of traffic accidents. If they were orderly \nevents, in which cause and effect could be clearly discerned and \nascribed, then the present insurance system could work. But accidents \nare nothing of the sort. It is often very difficult to determine fault \nin traffic accidents. It is the role of the liable party's insurance \ncompany to argue that the plaintiff's injuries--no matter how hideous--\nare not as serious as he or she claims. These cases overwhelm the court \nsystem and in so doing, they prevent real justice from occurring. \nJustice is possible only when it is done quickly and reflects the sense \nof what is right and what is wrong, as I wrote in ``Next: A New Auto \nInsurance Policy,'' which appeared in the August 27, 1967 New York \nTimes magazine:\n\n       The most serious secondary effect of the existing insurance \n     system, however, lies in its impact on the courts. This \n     process begins with the use of the police to enforce the \n     traffic laws, as a result of which the incidence of arrest by \n     armed police in the United States is the highest of any \n     society in history. The jam starts there, and is followed by \n     a flood of accident litigation cases that derive, in part at \n     least, from the original criminal case. We have now reached \n     the point where accident litigation accounts for an estimated \n     65 to 80 percent of the total civil court cases tried in the \n     United States. This in turn has brought us to the point where \n     delays in justice here are the longest of any democracy on \n     earth. It now takes an average of 30.1 months to obtain a \n     jury trial in the metropolitan areas of the nation. In \n     Westchester and Kings counties, it is 50 months plus. In \n     Chicago it is 60 months plus.\n       A legal expert in the field, James Marshall, has argued \n     that persons involved in or witnessing an automobile accident \n     are not really capable of reconstructing it in court. The \n     event is too complex, and levels of perception too low. (How \n     would a witness to a shooting respond to a question as to \n     which way the bullet was traveling?) A fortiori the attempt \n     to reconstruct such an episode three, four, or five years \n     afterward is nigh impossible. Thus the question must be asked \n     whether a social concern of the highest order--the \n     administration of justice--is not being sacrificed to one of \n     a much lower priority, the reenactment of traffic accidents. \n     (As indeed the whole cops-and-robbers, shoot-'em-up paradigm \n     for managing the road system must be questioned. It was not \n     just chance that the riots in Watts and Newark began with \n     police arresting a motorist.)\n       There is little likelihood, however, that greater efforts \n     toward the administration of justice--more judges, or \n     whatever--would change matters. A New York survey has shown \n     that of 220,000 annual claims of victims seeking to recover \n     damages caused by another's fault, only 7,000 reach trial, \n     and 2,500 reach verdict. Given the number and rate of \n     accidents in the existing transport system, a kind of \n     Malthusian principle governs the courts: the number of \n     litigated cases will automatically increase to use up all the \n     available judicial facilities and maintain a permanent \n     backlog. At a time when issues of justice, violence, and \n     civic peace are of immediate and pressing concern, to devote \n     the better part of the judicial (and an enormous portion of \n     the legal) resources of the nation to managing the road \n     system is the kind of incompetence that societies end up \n     paying for.\n       Only one adult response is possible: the present automobile \n     insurance system has to change . . .\n\n  In that article, 30 years ago, I proposed two alternatives to \ntraditional tort coverage as solutions for the problem. One was to have \nthe Federal Government provide insurance--financed by a penny or so \nincreases in the Federal gasoline tax--for injuries and economic \nlosses, with claims being adjusted in a fashion similar to the workers' \ncompensation system. The second alternative was along the lines of the \ncurrent legislation. For the past 35 years, Jeffrey O'Connell, the \nSamuel McCoy Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, has been \nfiguring out the permutations of this second type of reform. It is his \nrecommendations that shape today's legislation.\n  Over 16 million motor vehicle accidents occur every year. The average \namount of time it takes to receive compensation for losses in a tort \ncase is over 18 months. Minimally injured parties are overcompensated \nwhile victims of serious injuries often fail to receive full \nrestitution. According to a study by the RAND Institute, people with \neconomic losses of under $5,000 receive over two to three times that \namount in compensation. People with $25,000 to $100,000 worth of \nlosses, however, currently are compensated for just over one-half of \ntheir losses, on average. The very seriously injured--\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\nthose with economic losses of over $100,000--receive compensation worth \nonly 9 percent of their damages, on average. The current system does \nnot work.\n  This legislation is called Auto Choice because drivers would have a \nchoice between this new system, called personal protection insurance \n[PPI], or they could remain insured under the system currently \noperating in their State--the tort maintenance system [TM]. For people \nwho choose to insure themselves for only economic damages, this is akin \nto a $243 tax cut, according to a recent report by the Joint Economic \nCommittee, only without any impact on the Federal budget. Our \nlegislation would ensure more complete and more rapid recovery of \nlosses for the people who incur them, and it would reduce the number of \ncases that presently overwhelm the courts.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky for inviting me to cosponsor this \nlegislation, and hope other Senators agree with us that the time for \nauto choice has come.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am here today with Senators \nMcConnell, Moynihan, Gorton, and Grams to introduce the Auto Choice \nReform Act of 1997. If enacted, this bill would save American consumers \ntens of billions of dollars, while at the same time producing an auto \ninsurance system that operates more efficiently and promises drivers \nbetter and quicker compensation.\n  America's drivers are plagued today by an auto accident insurance and \ncompensation system that is too expensive and that does not work. Each \nof us currently pays an average of $785 annually for our auto insurance \nper car. This is an extraordinarily large sum, and one that is \nparticularly difficult for people of modest means--and almost \nimpossible for poor people--to afford. A study of Maricopa County, AZ \ndrives this point home. That study found that families living below 50 \npercent of the poverty line spend nearly one-third of their household \nincome on premiums when they purchase auto insurance.\n  Perhaps those costs would be worth it if they meant that people \ninjured in car accidents were fully compensated for their injuries. But \nunder our current tort system, that often is not the case, particularly \nfor people who are seriously injured. Because of the need to prove \nfault and the ability to receive compensation only through someone \nelse's insurance policy, some injured drivers--like those in one car \naccidents or those who are found to have been at fault themselves--are \nleft without any compensation at all. Others must endure years of \nlitigation before receiving any compensation for their injuries. In the \nend, people who suffer minimal injuries in auto accidents generally end \nup overcompensated, while victims of serious injuries often fail to \nreceive full restitution. According to a study by Rand's Institute for \nCivil Justice, people who suffer economic losses--lost wages and \nmedical bills, for example--in the range of $25,000 to $100,000 \ncurrently are compensated for just over one-half of their losses on \naverage. The very seriously injured--those with economic losses of over \n$100,000--receive compensation worth just 9 percent of those damages on \naverage. Much of this shortfall is due to the high transaction costs--\nthe 33-percent attorneys' fee regularly taken out of a plaintiff's \nrecovery, for one thing--associated with the current system.\n  These statistics show that our auto insurance and compensation laws \nviolate the cardinal rule I think those of us in the business \nlegislating have a duty to follow: to draft our laws to encourage \npeople to minimize their disputes, and to encourage those who do have \ndisputes to resolve them as efficiently, as economically, and as \nquickly as possible. This is particularly true when we are dealing with \nlaws impacting on people who are physically injured, because injured \npeople simply--and literally--cannot afford to wait the years it often \ntakes for a lawsuit to wind its way through our legal system. The laws \ngoverning our auto accident and insurance system do not now meet those \nsimple criteria. They instead require consumers to pay extraordinarily \nhigh premiums to purchase auto insurance. That auto insurance, in turn \nand as a result of our broken legal system, does not bring seriously \ninjured people either speedy or full compensation for their injuries.\n\n  My colleagues and I set out to rethink the legal framework governing \nour car insurance and compensation system. We asked ourselves whether \nwe could write a law that would both lower premiums and better \ncompensate people for injuries suffered in car accidents. Why, we \nwondered, should people hurt in car crashes--people who have bought and \npaid for insurance policies--not be able to receive compensation for \ntheir injuries unless they find someone else who was at fault, sue \nthem, engage in potentially years of litigation, and collect from that \nother person? Why, we asked, couldn't auto insurance instead be more \nlike health and homeowner insurance, where people know when they buy \ntheir policies that they will be compensated immediately for any \ncovered injury, regardless of who caused the injury and without having \nto find and pay a lawyer and often suffer through years of litigation?\n  The answer we came up with was that there is no reason not to change \nour auto insurance and compensation laws to address these problems. Our \nAuto Choice proposal would address these problems by introducing reason \ninto our auto insurance and accident laws. The bill would produce a \nsystem that would guarantee immediate compensation to injured people. \nAt the same time, it would bring tremendous savings to the system--up \nto $45 billion annually according to a recent study. And, it would do \nso, not by forcing people to do something they do not want to do, but \nby giving them the choice--the right to determine for themselves what \nis in their best interests.\n  Here's how our plan would work: All drivers would be required to \npurchase a certain minimum level of insurance, but they would get to \nchoose the type of coverage they want. Those drivers who value \nimmediate compensation for their injuries and lower premiums would be \nable to purchase what we call personal protection insurance. If the \ndriver with that type of coverage is injured in an accident, he or she \nwould get immediate compensation for all economic losses--things like \nlost wages, medical bills and attorneys fees--up to the limits of his \nor her policy, without regard to who was at fault in the accident.\n  If their economic losses exceeded those policy limits, the injured \nparty could sue the other driver for the extra economic loss on a fault \nbasis. The only thing the plaintiff could not do is sue the other \ndriver for noneconomic losses, the so-called pain and suffering \ndamages.\n  Those drivers who did not want to give up the ability to collect pain \nand suffering damages could choose a different option, called tort \nmaintenance coverage. Drivers with that type of policy would be able to \ncover themselves for whatever level of economic and noneconomic damages \nthey want, and they would then be able to collect those damages, also \nfrom their own insurance company, after proving fault.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, the savings from this new Choice system would \nbe dramatic. According to a newly released report from the Joint \nEconomic Committee, if all American drivers opted for personal \nprotection insurance, they would save an average of $243 annually on \ntheir auto insurance premiums. Drivers in my home State of Connecticut \nwould see even better savings, putting an additional $383 per year into \ntheir pockets. All told, the American economy could save up to $45 \nbillion each and every year under our proposal.\n  Our Auto Choice plan, I think, both serves the reform goals I \ndiscussed above and incorporates all of the lessons we learned during \nour past experiences with no-fault laws. It ensures that most injured \npeople would be compensated immediately and that we all can purchase \nauto insurance at a reasonable rate. As I said at the outset, we as \nlegislators do our best when we make sure that our legal system \nminimizes the potential for disputes in society and facilitates the \nresolution of those disputes that exist. The Auto Choice law would do \nexactly that. It would ensure that something tens of thousands of us \nnow have disputes about--who should compensate whom for car accidents--\nno longer would be the subject of disputes because everyone who is \ninjured will know from the outset that they will be compensated, they \nwill know by whom they will be compensated, and they will know they \nwill be compensated without having to sue someone else first. Mr. \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S3436]]\n\nthis bill would be a boon to the American driver and to the American \neconomy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see it enacted \ninto law.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators McConnell, \nGrams, Moynihan, and Lieberman in cosponsoring the Auto Choice Reform \nAct, a measure that offers consumers a quick-pay, low-cost policy to \nreplace their current policies--policies that are grossly inflated by \nthe costs of damage claims for pain and suffering.\n  Auto Choice Reform Act. Choice. Removing the perverse incentives to \ninflate damages that our current system creates, and allowing consumers \nto make rational choices, lies at the heart of this bill. Unlike some \nother no-fault measures, the Auto Choice Reform Act gives consumers, \nand States, choices. Choices which, if exercised, should significantly \nlower insurance premiums. For States, the choice is whether or not to \noffer the no-fault option to residents. A State can opt out \nlegislatively, or if the State commissioner of insurance shows that a \nno-fault system will not result in a 30 percent decrease in bodily \ninjury premiums for those who choose PPI. If States choose to offer the \nno-fault option, however, consumers still have the choice of whether or \nnot to participate in the no-fault system. No driver will be deprived \nof her ability to sue, but instead, can choose between two systems.\n  If they want, consumers can avail themselves of the new no-fault \ninsurance system that the bill creates. If a consumer elects the \npersonal protection insurance [PPI] system, then, in the event of an \naccident, and regardless of fault, she is compensated by her own \ninsurer for economic losses, such as car repair, medical expenses or \nlost wages, up to her policy limit. She does not, however, recover for \nnoneconomic losses, pain and suffering, and she may not be sued for \npain and suffering damages. If her economic damages exceed her policy \nlimit, however, she may sue for economic damages. By taking the often-\ninflated damages for pain and suffering out of the equation, consumers \nchoosing PPI should see a significant savings in their insurance \npremiums--a savings that has been estimated at $243 per policy.\n  Motorists who choose not to participate in the no-fault system are \nallowed that option under this legislation. Again, the choice is with \nthe consumer. By opting for what the bill refers to as tort maintenance \ncoverage, a TMC driver can keep her traditional liability policy under \nwhich she can sue other TMC drivers for both economic and noneconomic \ndamages. To cover noneconomic damages in accidents with PPI drivers, \nwho TMC drivers cannot sue for noneconomic damages, the TMC driver can \npurchase a supplemental policy and recover the noneconomic damages from \nher own insurer.\n  What does all of this mean? The New York Times perhaps summed it up \nbest in an editorial that predicted that Auto Choice ``would give \nfamilies the option of forgoing suits for non-monetary losses in \nexchange for quick and complete reimbursement for every blow to their \npocketbook. Everyone would win--except the lawyers.'' Mr. President, I \nhope the Senate will act promptly to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY:\n  S. 626. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide for legal accountability for sweatshop conditions in the \ngarment industry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                    Stop the Sweatshops Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Monday, President Clinton announced \nan agreement by the Apparel Industry Partnership that establishes a \nworkplace code of conduct for the industry. I commend this agreement, \nwhich is the product of a presidential task force on the exploitation \nof garment industry workers by unscrupulous clothing manufacturers. The \nagreement is designed to encourage voluntary compliance with labor \nstandards in all countries that manufacture clothing sold in the United \nStates.\n\n  Congress can build on this agreement by acting to abolish sweatshops \nin our own country. Last year, Congressman Bill Clay and I introduced \nthe Stop the Sweatshops Act. Today I am introducing that legislation to \nhelp fulfill the promise of the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement. \nThis bill will reinforce that agreement by making clothing \nmanufacturers liable for sweatshop practices by contractors. This \nliability will help to ensure that honest employers who obey our laws \nwill not lose out in competition with dishonest employers who do not. \nWithout this bill, economic forces in the clothing industry make it \nunlikely that the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement will be fully \neffective in protecting American workers.\n  Sweatshops continue to plague the garment industry. As important as \nthe Apparel Industry Partnership agreement is, it has a significant \ndeficiency. It has no enforcement mechanism. It applies only to \nmanufacturers who agree to its terms and it does not specify how \nviolations will be remedied or what penalties will be imposed. The Stop \nthe Sweatshops Act remedies these deficiencies for all clothing \nmanufacturing done in this country.\n  This bill will require manufacturers to exert their considerable \neconomic power to ensure fair treatment of garment workers. It will \nprevent manufacturers from playing one contractor against another, \nwhich drives down the prices of their goods. It is the cutthroat \ncompetition resulting from such practices that causes dangerous and \nunhealthy working conditions, brutally long hours, and inadequate pay.\n  The record of worker exploitation in the garment industry shows that \neffective enforcement is crucial. Of the 22,000 manufacturers of \nclothing and accessories in the United States, the Department of Labor \nfinds that more than half are paying wages substantially below the \nminimum wage, and a third are exposing their workers to serious safety \nand health risks.\n  Sweatshops run by unscrupulous contractors have a long and sordid \nhistory in this country. In 1911, a tragic fire at the Triangle \nShirtwaist Co. on Lower East Side in New York City killed 146 young \nimmigrant women. They suffocated or were burned to death because the \nexits had been locked or blocked.\n  Eighty-six years later, we still find too often that conditions have \nnot improved. In August 1996, four Brooklyn garment factories were \nclosed and their owners were arrested for operating sweatshops. Serious \nfire code violations were found, including locked exit doors, \nobstructed aisles, and violations of sprinkler system requirements. In \naddition, the contractors maintained two sets of accounting records, \none showing that workers were being paid as little as $2.67 per hour--\nfar less than the minimum wage. The workers were all Asian immigrants \nmaking clothes for K-Mart.\n  K-Mart requires its garment contractors to identify all \nsubcontractors they employ, and to make ``regular and surprise \ninspections'' of manufacturing operations. But this requirement did not \nprevent the fire code violations, wage violations, and other illegal \npractices of the contractors arrested in Brooklyn last summer. This \nexample shows that voluntary codes of conduct and monitoring programs, \nas the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement encourages, cannot, by \nthemselves, eradicate the problem.\n  Another sweatshop scandal came to light last spring, with respect to \nclothing made for Wal-Mart. It shows how far some manufacturers are \nwilling to go to cut costs, and the terrible human toll that follows. \nIn August 1995, Federal investigators raided a sewing factory outside \nLos Angeles. In a compound surrounded by barbed wire, agents found \ndozens of Thai and Mexican immigrant women working 20-hour days for as \nlittle as $1.00 per hour. The women were held captive at their sewing \ntables by guards who threatened them if they tried to escape.\n  American consumers do not want their clothing produced in this way. A \nU.S. News and World Report poll showed that 6 in 10 Americans are \nconcerned about working conditions in U.S. manufacturing firms. A poll \nreported in Newsday showed that 83 percent of consumers would be \nwilling to pay an extra $1 on a $20 item if they knew the garment \nwasn't made in a sweatshop.\n  Many law-abiding manufacturers already recognize the need to stamp \nout sweatshops in the United States. But, as these examples make clear, \ncurrent law and voluntary codes of conduct are not adequate to prevent \nabuses. The 800 investigators of the Department of\n\n[[Page S3437]]\n\nLabor who monitor compliance with wage and hour laws cannot do the job \nalone. Manufacturers have the economic muscle and market power to end \nthese abuses. But, under the current system, the market power works in \nthe wrong direction--it encourages contractors to inflict sweatshop \nconditions on employees, rather than pay fair wages and maintain proper \nworking conditions.\n  The most effective way to enlist manufacturers in the battle against \nsweatshops is to make them liable along with their contractors for \nviolations of the law. Manufacturers who know they will face liability \nwill take the steps necessary to ensure that their contractors comply \nwith applicable laws.\n  Our Stop the Sweatshops Act does just that. It amends the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to make manufacturers in the garment industry liable, \nalong with their contractors, for violations of these laws.\n  Manufacturers will be liable for injunctive relief and civil \npenalties assessed against a contractor found to have broken the law. \nThey will also be liable for back pay owed to employees for such \nviolations. Manufacturers will be liable only for violations committed \non work done for that manufacturer.\n  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess a civil \npenalty of up to $1,000 for each employee in cases where contractors \nfail to keep required payroll records. If the records are fraudulent, \nthe Secretary can assess penalties up to $10,000 for the first offense \nand $15,000 for further offenses. These penalties will give employers \nan incentive to keep proper records, and punish contractors who attempt \nto conceal abuses by maintaining two sets of records.\n  This bill sends a clear message to garment industry employers. \nExploitation of workers will not be tolerated. Sweatshops are \nunacceptable. We intend to do all we can to stamp them out, and this \nlegislation will help us achieve that goal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 626\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE AND REFERENCE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Stop \n     Sweatshops Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Reference.--Whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal \n     is expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.).\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The production of garments in violation of minimum \n     labor standards burdens commerce and the free flow of goods \n     in commerce by spreading and perpetuating labor conditions \n     that undermine minimum living standards and by providing an \n     unfair means of competition to the detriment of employers who \n     comply with the law.\n       (2) The existence of working conditions detrimental to fair \n     competition and the maintenance of minimum standards of \n     living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-\n     being of workers is a continuing and growing problem in the \n     domestic garment industry.\n       (3) The Congress concurs in the findings of the Comptroller \n     General that most sweatshop employers violate the \n     recordkeeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 and that the failure of such employers to maintain \n     adequate records has affected, and continues to affect \n     adversely, the ability of the Department of Labor to collect \n     wages due to workers.\n       (4) The amendment of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     to provide for legal responsibility on the part of \n     manufacturers for compliance with such Act's wage and hour, \n     child labor, and industrial homework provisions by \n     contractors in the garment industry and to provide civil \n     penalties for violations of that Act's recordkeeping \n     requirements is necessary to promote fair competition and \n     working conditions that are not detrimental to the \n     maintenance of health, efficiency, and general well-being of \n     workers in the garment industry.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to reauthorize the African Elephant Conservation Act; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n[[Page S3438]]\n\n   THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION ACT REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of Earth Day \nto introduce legislation to reauthorize the African Elephant \nConservation Act of 1988, a historic conservation measure that \ncontinues to successfully preserve the African elephant in its natural \nenvironment. This legislation will extend the act through September of \nthe year 2002.\n  The African Elephant Conservation Act has resulted in the \nstabilization of elephant populations on the African Continent. By the \nlate 1980's, the population of African elephants had dramatically \ndeclined from approximately 1.3 million animals in 1979 to less than \n700,000 in 1987. The primary reason for this decline was the poaching \nand illegal slaughter of elephants for their tusks, which fueled the \ninternational trade in ivory.\n  To address this problem, the U.S. Congress enacted the African \nElephant Conservation Act to provide assistance to African nations in \ntheir efforts to stop poaching and to develop and implement effective \nconservation programs. To accomplish this goal, the legislation created \nthe African elephant conservation fund. Since 1988, Congress has \nappropriated over $6 million to fund 48 conservation projects in 17 \nrange states throughout Africa, with additional contributions of $7 \nmillion through private matching moneys.\n  The African elephant conservation fund has resulted in the \ndevelopment and implementation of various elephant conservation plans. \nToday, elephant populations have stabilized and are on the increase in \nsouthern Africa, the international ivory trade has been dramatically \nreduced, and wildlife rangers are better equipped to stop illegal \npoaching activities. The conservation fund originally focused on anti-\npoaching efforts. Over the last several years, the projects have \ndiversified to include elephant population research, efforts to \nmitigate elephant and human conflicts, the cataloging of ivory \nstockpiles, and the identification of new techniques for effective \nelephant management. It is important, however, to keep in mind that, \nwhile the African elephant conservation fund has resulted in several \nsuccessful conservation projects, much work remains to be done to \nensure that the African elephant continues to survive in its natural \nenvironment.\n  We must work to ensure that the African elephant does not once again \ndecline and disappear from its historic range. I am confident that \nadditional conservation projects funded through the legislation will \nhelp to preserve this flagship species for many future generations. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting the African Elephant \nConservation Reauthorization Act of 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 628. A bill to designate the United States courthouse to be \nconstructed at the corner of 7th Street and East Jackson Street in \nBrownsville, Texas, as the ``Reynaldo G. Garza United States \nCourthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n     the reynaldo g. garza u.s. courthouse designation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, along with my colleague, Senator Hutchison, \nI am proud to introduce legislation that would name the Federal \ncourthouse in Brownsville, TX after a man who has been involved in the \nadministration of justice throughout South Texas for nearly 60 years, \nJudge Reynaldo G. Garza.\n  Judge Garza was the first Mexican-American to be appointed to a \nFederal judgeship in the history of our country, when President Kennedy \nappointed him to a district court bench in 1961. Judge Garza served as \na U.S. District Judge until 1979, when President Carter appointed him \nto the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he still serves, at the \nage of 81, in senior status.\n  Besides being named a the first Mexican-American Federal district \njudge, he was the first Mexican-American chief district judge, and the \nfirst Mexican-American Federal circuit court judge. He would have been \nthe first Mexican-American ever to have been appointed to a President's \nCabinet if he had accepted President Carter's request to serve as the \nNation's attorney general in 1977. Sensibly, however, Judge Garza \ndidn't want to move from Brownsville to Washington, DC.\n  Judge Garza's life has been filled with extraordinary \naccomplishments. Born in 1915 in Brownsville to Ygnacio and Zoila \nGarza, both Mexican immigrants, he was the sixth of eight children. \nJudge Garza reached adulthood during the Depression and, through sheer \nability, hard work and determination, graduated from the University of \nTexas Law School in 1939. He then established a law practice in \nBrownsville, mixing his work with the demands of raising five children \nand serving his community in capacities ranging from the local school \nboard and city commission to the Knights of Columbus.\n  Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941, \nReynaldo Garza enlisted in the U.S. Army and served until the war's end \nin 1945 as a gunnery sergeant and in other capacities. In 1943, Garza \nwas selected to serve as translator in a meeting between President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt and Mexican President Miguel Avila Camacho, \nmarking the first time a U.S. president had met with a Mexican \npresident on Mexican soil.\n  Judge Garza's selfless commitment to his family, his community and \nhis Nation is exemplary, and today, he serves as a role model for \npeople both inside and outside of the legal profession.\n  I am privileged to introduce this legislation in Judge Garza's honor \ntoday and look forward to working with my colleagues to make the \nReynaldo G. Garza Federal courthouse a reality.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, today we honor our Nation's first \nMexican-American Federal judge, Judge Reynaldo G. Garza. I am proud to \ncosponsor legislation with Senator Gramm to name the new Federal \ncourthouse in Brownsville for Judge Garza. In this way, we will record \nfor generations to come Judge Garza's selfless service to the city of \nBrownsville, to Texas and to our Nation.\n  Traditionally, we reserve this honor for judges who no longer walk \nthe courthouse halls. However, we wish to grant an exception for this \nexceptional man. Born of immigrant parents, Reynaldo Garza has paved a \nhopeful path for other immigrant sons. After distinguishing himself as \na lawyer, he served on the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict until his appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit in 1979 by President Carter. As the first Mexican-\nAmerican to achieve these distinctions, Judge Garza truly personifies \nthe pioneer spirit of this great Nation.\n  I would like Judge Garza to be remembered as well for his gracious \nresponse to this action. Upon learning that the courthouse might be \nnamed for him, Judge Garza said simply, ``I'm humbled by the fact that \nsomebody would even think I'm worthy of it.'' Indeed, no one is \nworthier than Judge Garza of this small token of our respect and \nadmiration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (by request):\n  S. 629. A bill entitled the ``OECD Shipbuilding Agreement Act''; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  THE OECD SHIPBUILDING AGREEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President: today I introduce a bill to implement the \nOECD shipbuilding agreement to end foreign shipbuilding subsidies. This \nbill is an administration draft that I submit to better focus upcoming \ncongressional discussion of the issues. With Europe just announcing \n$2.1 billion in new subsidies for its shipyards, the United States \ncannot afford to delay action on this agreement any longer.\n  The United States has taken a leadership role in pushing for the \nelimination of unfair subsidies in the international commercial \nshipbuilding sector. In 1981, the United States unilaterally eliminated \nits own commercial shipbuilding subsidies. In October 1989, the United \nStates, at the request of the six defense-oriented shipyards and the \nsmaller commercial shipyards, initiated negotiations in the OECD aimed \nat eliminating trade distorting foreign shipbuilding subsidies. After 5 \nyears of negotiations and constant prodding by the U.S. Congress, the \nOECD shipbuilding agreement was signed by the European Union, Japan, \nthe Republic of Korea, Finland, Norway, and the United States on \nDecember 21, 1994.\n  The OECD shipbuilding agreement, which covers over 80 percent of the\n\n[[Page S3439]]\n\nworld's commercial shipbuilding and repair capacity, would prohibit \ngovernment subsidies to the shipbuilding industry, as well as \ndiscipline export credits, set common rules for government financing \nprograms, and establish a mechanism for addressing injurious pricing, \nthat is, dumping. As of June 1, 1996, all signatories, except the \nUnited States, had ratified the agreement.\n  In the last Congress, several parties expressed serious concerns \nabout certain aspects of the agreement and the proposed implementing \nlegislation which we were unable to address before the end of the last \nsession. As a result, the agreement's entry into force has been delayed \nby more than a year. I am hopeful that an agreement on implementing \nlegislation can be reached early this session and I think the bill I am \nintroducing today is a huge step in that direction.\n  I am very concerned, however, that further delay in confirming United \nStates commitment to this agreement will seriously undermine U.S. long-\nterm efforts to eliminate foreign shipbuilding subsidies, especially as \nother countries face increased pressure to resume the granting of \nsubsidies to their shipbuilding industries. The United States can't \nafford a shipbuilding subsidies race. We are cutting funding of \nimportant domestic programs now. The United States needs to approve and \nimplement the shipbuilding agreement in order to give us the tools to \nchallenge foreign subsidies and protect our shipbuilding industry \nagainst unfair foreign competition.\n  I ask you to join the battle against unfair international \nshipbuilding subsidies by supporting the swift passage of legislation \napproving and implementing the OECD shipbuilding agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 629\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                       PART 1--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n     SECTION 101.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deposit \nin the highway trust fund the receipts of the 4.3-cent increase in the \nfuel tax rates enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1993; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 federal highway trust fund legislation\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill today to ensure \nthat adequate resources are available to reverse the very destructive \ntrend of Federal disinvestment in our Nation's critical infrastructure \nof highways and bridges. The bill that I introduce would place into the \nhighway trust fund the 4.3-\n\n[[Page S3455]]\n\ncents-per-gallon gas tax that is currently used for our deficit \nreduction.\n  Senators will recall that back in May and June of last year, there \nwas much debate on this 4.3-cent gas tax, which was first imposed by \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.\n  During this past summer, I deferred offering this bill as an \namendment to two separate tax bills, and I did so at the request of \nboth the majority and the minority leaders. But unfortunately, another \nopportunity to offer the amendment to a tax bill did not arise.\n  By depositing this additional 4.3-cents per gallon gas tax into the \nhighway trust fund, Congress will have the resources to better meet the \ntrue needs of our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  Our Federal investment in infrastructure as a percentage of the total \nFederal budget has declined significantly since 1980. Few economics \nwould disagree that adequate long-term investment in infrastructure is \ncritical to a nation's economic well-being. Only through investment \nhere at home, only through investment to maintain and renew our own \nphysical plant, can our economy grow and generate good wages for our \ncitizens.\n\n  Even so, our Nation's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of \nour gross domestic product has almost been cut in half since 1980. As a \nnation, we invest a considerably smaller percentage of our gross \ndomestic product in infrastructure than our economic competitors invest \nin economic infrastructure in Europe and in Asia.\n  Nowhere do we pay a greater price for inadequate infrastructure \ninvestment than in our Nation's highways. Our National Highway System \ncarries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commerce and nearly 80 \npercent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. Yet, we have \nallowed segments of our National Highway System to fall into disrepair.\n  The Department of Transportation recently released its latest report \non the condition of the Nation's highways. Its findings are even more \ndisturbing than earlier reports. The Department of Transportation \ncurrently classified less than half of the mileage on our interstate \nsystem as being in good condition and only 39 percent of our entire \nNational Highway System is rated in good condition. Fully 61 percent of \nour Nation's highways are rated in either fair condition or in poor \ncondition. Almost one in four of our Nation's highway bridges are now \ncategorized as either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, investment in our \nNation's highways is a full $15 billion short each year just to \nmaintain these current inadequate conditions--just to maintain them. \nPut another way, we would have to increase our national highway \ninvestment by more than $15 billion a year just to avoid further \ndeterioration of our national highway network.\n  It should be noted that, while our highway infrastructure continue to \ndeteriorate, highway use is on the rise. Indeed, it is growing at a \nvery rapid pace. The number of vehicle miles traveled has grown by \nroughly 40 percent in just the last decade. As a result, we are \nwitnessing new highs in the levels of highway congestion, causing \ndelays in the movement of goods and people that costs our national \neconomy more than $40 billion a year.\n  So, Mr. President, it is clear that the requirement that we place on \nour National Highway System are growing while our investment continues \nto decline. We are simply digging ourselves a deeper and deeper hole. \nSix years ago, in 1991, it was estimated that an investment of $47.5 \nbillion would be necessary on an annual basis to ensure that highway \nconditions would not deteriorate any further than existed in that \nyear--that it would not get any worse. By 1993, that figure grew to \n$51.6 billion. And 2 years ago, that figure grew to $54.8 billion. \nErgo, the longer we delay increasing Federal highway spending, the more \nexpensive it will be to reverse this destructive trend, which costs our \nNation dearly.\n  Productivity improvements are the key to global competitiveness, \nrising standards of living and economic growth. Investments in highways \nresult in significant, nationwide improvements in productivity. \nAccording to the Federal Highway Administration, every $1 billion \ninvested in highways creates and sustains over 40,000 full-time jobs. \nFurthermore, the very same $1 billion also results in a $240 million \nreduction in overall production costs for American manufacturers.\n  While we can easily see the economic impact of disinvestment in our \nNation's highways, we must not lose sight of the fact that \ndeteriorating highways have a direct relationship to safety as well. We \nmay be talking about your life. We may be talking about your life. And \nwe are. Almost 42,000 people died on our Nation's highways in 1996. \nThat equates to having a mid-sized passenger aircraft crash every day, \nkilling all of its occupants. The National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration counts poor road conditions as a contributing factor in \na large percentage of these fatal accidents, as well as those in which \nthere are serious injuries. The economic impact of these highway \naccidents cost our Nation $150 billion a year, and that figure is \ngrowing. More importantly, this wasteful carnage brings incredible \nsorrow to affected families and friends, and the Nation loses the \nskills, the talents, and the contributions of the victims.\n  The Senate will soon take up legislation to reauthorize the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA. This bill \nwill be one of the most important pieces of legislation that we \nconsider this session. Many Members, including myself, have introduced \nlegislation to address specific transportation needs in their States \nand regions. Also, many Members have spoken of the need for formula \nchanges to bring about what they perceive to be a more equitable \ndistribution of funds from the highway program.\n  However, we must face the fact that, absent a substantial increase in \nthe current level of spending on our highway program, we will not have \nthe resources available to address the many important, but often \ncompeting, needs for our Nation's highway requirements in all regions \nof the country.\n  So in the coming weeks, Mr. President, I look forward to working with \nall of my colleagues toward the enactment of substantially increased \nauthorizations and appropriations for our Nation's highway system. And \nthe bill that I have introduced today will provide a very helpful tool \nwith which to do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 76\n\n       Whereas the preservation of basic freedoms and world peace \n     has always been a valued objective of this great country;\n       Whereas thousands of American men and women have selflessly \n     given their lives in service as peacemakers and peacekeepers;\n       Whereas greater strides should be made to demonstrate the \n     appreciation and gratitude these loyal Americans deserve and \n     to commemorate the ultimate sacrifice they made;\n       Whereas Memorial Day is the day of the year for the Nation \n     to appropriately remember American heroes by inviting the \n     citizens of this Nation to respectfully honor them at a \n     designated time; and\n       Whereas the playing of ``Taps'' symbolizes the solemn and \n     patriotic recognition of those Americans who died in service \n     to our Country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate requests that--\n       (1) a nationwide moment of remembrance be observed on \n     Memorial Day, May 26, 1997, by the simultaneous pausing of \n     all citizens to acknowledge the playing of ``Taps'' at 3:00 \n     p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) in honor of the Americans that \n     gave their lives in the pursuit of freedom and peace; and\n       (2) the President issue a proclamation calling upon the \n     departments and agencies of the United States and interested \n     organizations, groups, and individuals to participate in and \n     promote this nationwide tribute to the dedicated American men \n     and women who died in the pursuit of freedom and peace.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nproclaiming a nationwide moment of remembrance, to be observed on \nMemorial Day, May 26, 1997, in order to appropriately honor American \npatriots lost in the pursuit of peace and liberty around the world.\n  This year, the nonprofit organization, No Greater Love, which assists \nthe families of Americans who died in service to their country or in \nterrorist acts, is launching the first annual ``Proud to Remember'' \ncampaign. The goal of this campaign is to make certain that those who \nhave died in service to our country will be appropriately honored in a \npatriotic and personal way on this special day of remembrance. In other \nwords, they seek to put ``memorial'' back into Memorial Day.\n  Pursuant to this resolution, on Memorial Day, Monday, May 26, 1997, \nthe entire Nation will be asked to observe a moment of remembrance at \n3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, in honor of those who have sacrificed \ntheir lives for us. ``Taps'' will be played at this time across the \ncountry to honor our fallen heroes.\n  It is our hope that this moment of remembrance will bring all \nAmericans together in a spirit of respect, patriotism, and gratitude, \nand also help restore the recognition our veterans deserve for the \nsacrifices they have made on behalf of our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3457-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 77--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n                                COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

THE CITIZENS AND THE CONSTITUTION\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to commend 25 outstanding \nstudents from West Warwick High School in West Warwick, RI, who will be \nvisiting Washington later this month to compete in the national finals \nof the ``We The People . . . The Citizens And The Constitution'' \nprogram.\n  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with it, the ``We The \nPeople . . . The Citizens And The Constitution'' program is among the \nmost extensive educational programs in the country, developed to \neducate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The \nthree-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in \nwhich students' oral presentations are judged on the basis of their \nknowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply these \nprincipals to contemporary situations.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We The People . \n. . The Citizens And The Constitution'' program provides an excellent \nopportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the \nsignificance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history. We \nhear so much these days about growing apathy and ignorance among young \npeople about our history and governmental traditions. In my view, \nprograms such as this can go a long way to combat these ills. It is \nheartening to see young Rhode Islanders taking such an active and \nparticipatory interest in public affairs.\n  Mr. President, you may be interested to know that West Warwick High \nSchool has an outstanding track record in the ``We The People . . . The \nCitizens And The Constitution'' program. The West Warwick team has won \nthe Rhode Island State competition for 7 of the past 10 years.\n  I am very proud of Jamie Amaral, Mary Asselin, Jonathan Bassi, Justin \nBroz, John Caressimo, Brian Carr, Andrew Constanza, Krystle Couto, \nBethany DeBlois, Candice Felske, John Johnson, Jonathan Juneau, Jamie \nKullberg, Kristin Larocque, Gina Musto, Meghan O'Brien, Ryan O'Grady, \nStephanie Paquet, Erica Ricci, Hillary Sisson, Derek Tevyaw, Kevin \nWillette, Kristen Wolslegel, Man Yu, and Debra Zenofsky for making it \nto the national finals. I applaud this terrific group of young men and \nwomen for their hard work and perseverance. Also, Mr, President, I want \nto congratulate Michael Trofi, a fine teacher who deserves so much \ncredit for guiding the West Warwick High School team to the national \nfinals.\n  As Mr. Trofi and this fine group of West Warwick High School students \nprepare for their trip to Washington to compete in the national finals \non April 26-28, I want to congratulate them for what they have already \nachieved and wish them the best of luck in the final competition. These \nstudents, with the guidance of Mr. Trofi, have learned what our Nation \nis all about and what countless men and women have fought and died to \nprotect. No matter what the outcome of the contest is, they have each \nearned the greatest prize of all: Knowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3458-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3458-S3459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SUPPORTING NETDAY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to alert this body \nto a very special event, which took place this past weekend, called \nNetDay. NetDay, which began in 1996, is a unique partnership between \nthe public, private and educational communities with the common goal of \nfitting K-12 classrooms with the technological infrastructure needed \nfor the 21st century.\n  In the beginning of this year, on behalf of myself, Senator John \nWarner, Senator Conrad Burns, Senator Charles Robb, Senator Patty \nMurray, and Senator Barbara Boxer, I introduced Sense of the Senate \nResolution 51, celebrating the success of NetDay activities and \nencouraging all schools to participate in 1997 NetDay activities, \nincluding the projects which took place this past weekend. As I did in \nFebruary of this year, when I introduced the NetDay resolution, I would \nlike to again commend the organizers and volunteers of NetDay, an \nexcellent example of individuals creating a stronger community with the \ngoal of increasing the quality of their schools.\n  The success of this weekend was impressive. Although it is still too \nearly to cite official statistics of Saturday's event, NetDay \norganizers have stated that ``schools up and down the State, in \nisolated towns in the north, farming towns in the central valley, and \nhundreds in urban communities all participated in NetDay.'' In \naddition, the 38 empowerment zone schools of the Los Angeles Unified \nSchool District were involved in NetDay activities and future planning. \nLast year alone, NetDay was successful in bringing out more than \n100,000 Americans, including 50,000 Californians to volunteer in their \nneighborhood schools. These students, teachers, parents, and friends of \nthe schools, came to wire classrooms and school libraries throughout \nthe Nation. Thousands of individuals accomplished their goal to install \ncommunications cables, connect wires and switches to upgrading their \nschools for the 21st century.\n  The success of NetDay is significant. Last year, over 25,000 \nelementary, junior and senior high schools were wired. I expect these \nnumbers to dramatically increase as NetDay organizer compile results \nfrom Saturday's activities. Throughout the United States, volunteers \nclimbed ladders and got on their hands and knees to install the wiring \ninfrastructure needed to connect thousands of elementary and secondary \nschool classrooms with contemporary technology.\n  As I have mentioned in earlier floor speeches, NetDay began in \nCalifornia on March 9, 1996. The term was coined by cofounders John \nGage of Sun Microsystems, one of the Nation's leading technology \ncompanies and Michael Kaufman of KQED, a California public broadcasting \nstation. Mr. Gage and Mr. Kaufman saw this initiative as a day where \nhundreds of Californians came out to an ``old fashioned barn raising \nfor the modern technology age.''\n  Just as volunteers would gather in the Nation's early years, with \nneighbor helping neighbor, to build homes, barns or community \nbuildings, California's NetDay volunteers gather in support of \nneighborhood schools. Amazingly, and to their surprise, NetDay \nsucceeded in one year in wiring 3,500 schools efficiently and cost-\neffectively, establishing and improving our classroom information \ninfrastructure up and down the State.\n  However, as our classrooms continue to modernize and improve their \ntechnological infrastructure there is much work to be accomplished, \nboth in California and throughout the Nation. Consider the following:\n\n  According to the Department of Education half of our K-12 schools \nlack full access to advance technology in the classroom.\n  Ninety-five percent of those K-12 schools who want to but are not yet \nwired, do not have the needed budgetary resources or organized \nvolunteer base to wire their schools.\n  Rural areas and regions with high poverty continue to have less \naccess to advanced educational technology compared to their suburban \nand urban counterparts.\n  These few points illustrate that there is still much to be done in \nour children's classrooms. NetDay organizers are committed to working \nwith under served neighborhoods and ensuring that the appropriate \nresources, both in volunteers and computer wiring kits, are channels to \nthese communities. In addition, this year's NetDay will focus on \ncommunities that did not fully benefit from last years initial set of\n\n[[Page S3459]]\n\nprojects and activities. In all, NetDay continues to save schools and \ntaxpayers millions of dollars in educational technology startup costs, \nwhile training and equipping teachers with the knowledge needed to be a \nsuccessful and integral part of the technical educational experience.\n  According to NetDay organizers, this year's relationship between \nprivate business, the labor community, and neighborhood schools is \nstronger than ever. Business sponsors and corporate volunteers will be \ninstrumental in making NetDay a successful reality. The small, and \nlarge, companies continue to supply the project the needed computer and \nwiring equipment, and have also encouraged their employees to work with \ntheir children's or neighborhood schools. In addition, the labor \ncommunity will continue to go into schools across America, where they \nare committed to work with private partners in ensuring that their \nlocal schools have the educational infrastructure needed for a well \ntrained work force for the 21st century. The most valuable asset of \nNetDay continues to be the commitment of thousands of volunteers who \nwill work in their community schools.\n  As the communities throughout America celebrate their NetDay \naccomplishments and prepare for future activities for this year and \nbeyond, it is my honor to once again, recognize the NetDay cofounders, \nMichael Kaufman and John Gage, and organizers, Ann Murphy and Teresa \nWann, and the dozens of corporate sponsors and business partners, and \nthe thousands of students, teachers, parents, and school administrators \nfor their achievement. The success and commitment they have shown to \nAmerica and my State of California should be applauded.\n  My colleague and cochair on the U.S. Senate information technology \ncaucus, Senator John Warner, Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Senator \nCharles Robb of Virginia, Senator Patty Murray from Washington, and my \nCalifornia colleague Senator Barbara Boxer join me in supporting the \nadvancement of educational technology by sponsoring this resolution. \nTogether, we urge our Senate colleagues to affirm congressional support \nfor preparing U.S. classrooms with the needed technological \ninfrastructure for the 21st century.\n  I invite my Senate colleagues to join this public-private partnership \neffort and I congratulate all the volunteers who participated in NetDay \n1997 and encourage them to keep up the commendable and exemplary \nwork.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3458-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ASSOCIATION OF CHINESE- AMERICANS, INC.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable organization in my home State of Michigan, the Association \nof Chinese Americans, Inc. The ACA, which promotes the presence of and \nprovides services to Chinese Americans in the Greater Detroit area, is \ncelebrating its 25th anniversary on April 26, 1997.\n  In 1972, Michigan residents of Chinese descent formed the Association \nof Chinese Americans with the motto ``Embracing the hopes and dreams of \nChinese in the United States.'' The ACA became the first chapter of the \nOrganization of Chinese Americans, a national group which helps \nChinese-Americans preserve and promote their cultural heritage in the \nUnited States.\n  Many people in metropolitan Detroit have benefited from the ACA's \nactivities, which includes physical and mental health services and \nlegal counseling for people in need. The ACA also sponsors social and \neducational activities for Chinese-American youth, such as dance \ntroupes, camping trips, and college scholarships.\n  The ACA plays an important role in preserving and promoting elements \nof Chinese culture in the United States, helping to keep Chinese art, \nlanguage, and traditions alive within the Chinese-American community. \nOne of America's great strengths is its diversity, and the ACA helps to \nremind us all of the valuable additions Chinese-Americans have made to \nAmerican culture.\n  The ACA has encouraged Chinese-Americans to participate in the \nelectoral process, and has helped give Chinese-Americans a strong voice \nin our political system. Members of the ACA frequently share their \nopinions, insights, and knowledge of issues which affect the Chinese-\nAmerican community with elected officials at all levels of government.\n  The Association of Chinese-Americans has been effective in furthering \nthe hopes and dreams of Chinese-Americans. I am proud to have such a \nvibrant and important organization in Michigan, and I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in offering congratulations to the men and women \nof the ACA on the occasion of its 25th anniversary.\n  [At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3459-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING THE LIFE OF LYMAN SPITZER, JR\n\n   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute \nto an outstanding scientist and visionary, Mr. Lyman Spitzer Jr., who \nrecently died in Princeton, NJ at the age of 82. Mr. Spitzer was one of \nthose rare individuals who not only made history, he actually changed \nhistory.\n  Spitzer was a theoretician of astrophysics and plasma physics who \ninspired the Hubble Space telescope and a myriad of orbiting \nobservatories. His scientific contributions began decades ago, when he \nplayed a leading role in the development of sonar during World War II.\n  After World War II, Spitzer's attention turned to what would become \nhis lifelong dream and his lifelong work, the Hubble telescope. The \nmost complex undertaking in unmanned space study, the telescope can \npeer into the deepest reaches of space. And it was only Lyman Spitzer's \nvision, advocacy and tenacity which made this dream a reality. He \nshepherded the project from, as the New York Times noted, ``a glimpse \nin his own eye in 1947,'' to its liftoff in 1990.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Spitzer's interests included all aspects of \nastronautics. He was the catalyst of the Copernicus Orbiting \nAstronomical Observatory, an ultraviolet predecessor of Hubble that \nNASA launched in 1972. He was also a pioneer of the effort to use \nnuclear fusion as a clean and limitless source of energy. And Spitzer \nwas the founding director of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, \nwhere he worked until the day he died.\n  Lyman Spitzer enhanced our vision of the universe, increased our \nknowledge of the stars and expanded our own horizons. He is an \noutstanding example of the difference a single individual can make. \nOthers may continue his work in Princeton, but no one will ever be able \nto replace him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3459-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3459-S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CENTRAL MARYLAND GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I would like to make my colleagues \naware of an important anniversary in the history of health care in \nMichigan. Precisely 100 years ago today, osteopathic physicians became \nlicensed to practice medicine in Michigan.\n  Michigan was the fourth State to legalize the practice of osteopathy \nand, according to the Michigan Association of Osteopathic Physicians \nand Surgeons, today has the largest number of osteopathic practitioners \nin the Nation. For the past 100 years, osteopathic physicians have \nserved the people of Michigan by developing therapeutic and diagnostic \nmethods of treating disease to accompany traditional medical \nprocedures.\n  The philosophy of osteopathy was first articulated by Dr. Andrew \nTaylor Still, a physician from the State of Missouri. Dr. Still's \nteachings guide today's osteopathic physicians as they integrate \nstandard medical practices with the body's natural systems for \nregulating and healing itself, especially the largest of these, the \nmusculoskeletal system.\n  People from every corner of Michigan have benefited from the care of \nosteopathic physicians, who can be found in disciplines ranging from \nfamily practice to surgery. We are truly grateful for the commitment to \nquality care made by these doctors--the members of the Michigan \nAssociation of Osteopathic Physicians and Surgeons, the Michigan \nOsteopathic Hospital Association, the Michigan Women's Osteopathic \nAuxiliary, the Michigan Osteopathic Medical Assistance Association, and \nthe Michigan Osteopathic Guild Association.\n  I know my colleagues join me in offering best wishes and \ncongratulations to the osteopathic physicians of Michigan, who have \nserved the community with dedication and compassion for the past 100 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3460-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 228, \nthe Government Shutdown Prevention Act. I commend Senator McCain for \nhis leadership in drafting this important legislation.\n  We all lose when the Government shuts down. In Montana, as well as \nacross the Nation, Federal workers were furloughed and national parks \nwere closed; businesses and families were negatively affected when the \nGovernment shut down in December 1995 and January 1996. Consequently, \nmillions of dollars were lost.\n  President Clinton put Congress between a rock and a hard place in \nthat he knew that we did not want to risk another Government shutdown. \nWe were forced to pass a budget that added $6 billion back into \nClinton's pet programs. The President was more interested in playing \npolitics than he was in balancing the budget.\n  Montanans are tired of political games. We can not let the \nadministration replay its efforts to force Congress to spend billions \nof dollars just to avoid the threat of a shutdown because of gridlock. \nIt is the responsibility of the Government to work for the people--not \nagainst them.\n  Senator McCain's bill provides a safeguard against Government \nshutdowns. It establishes an automatic continuing resolution to provide \nthe lowest spending levels for Federal agencies and programs in the \nevent that the annual appropriations bills are not enacted by the start \nof the fiscal year. This provides an incentive to pass appropriations \nbills in a timely manner.\n  This bill also addresses the concerns of those on Medicare, Medicaid, \nand Social Security as it specifically states that entitlements will be \npaid regardless of what appropriations are passed.\n  I feel that the Government Shutdown Prevention Act protects \nMontanans. No longer will Montana's elderly and disabled have to fear \nnot being able to pay medical bills because of a Government shutdown. \nWelfare recipients will not have to worry about going hungry because of \nthe President's political gameplaying. Finally, Montana communities \nlike West Yellowstone, Gardiner, and Columbia Falls--which serve as \ngateways to Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks--will not suffer \nbecause gridlock has forced the closure of national monuments and \nparks. The Government Prevention Shutdown Act ensures that the \nGovernment is working for the benefit of Montana. This is why I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3460-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3460-S3462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HEALTH VOLUNTEERS OVERSEAS--UGANDA WAR VICTIMS PROJECT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we hear people complain about how \nforeign aid is a waste of money, and there are certainly examples of \nit. The United States poured countless millions of dollars into the \npockets of President Mobutu, and one need only observe the chaos and \nsuffering in Zaire today to understand what a terrible mistake that \nwas. Many of us said so at the time, but we were ignored. During that \nsame period, the United States propped up General Noriega in Panama, \nuntil he was no longer useful to us.\n  But you do not hear very much about the good uses of foreign aid, and \nhow it makes a difference between life and death, or hope and misery, \nfor millions of people around the world. In fact, there are far more \nexamples of those good uses, than of the scandals that attract the \nattention of the media.\n  One example is the War Victims Fund project in Uganda. This project \nbegan in 1989, and it is now coming to an end. I think Members of \nCongress and the public should know about it, because it is a \nremarkable example of what the U.S. Government, a private voluntary \norganization, the good will and hard work of American volunteers, and \nthe support of the Government of Uganda, have done for the benefit of \nthousands of wounded and severely disabled people in that country.\n  Uganda, a once productive country that boasted the finest medical \nschool in sub-Saharan Africa, was virtually destroyed by the disastrous \nIdi Amin and Obote regimes. The medical school was destroyed, its \nfaculty members killed or run out of the country. Years of civil war \nleft thousands of casualties, including many victims of landmines.\n  In 1989, the year the Leahy War Victims Fund was established, USAID \nbegan a project in Uganda. It was implemented by Health Volunteers \nOverseas, a Washington, DC-based organization that sends volunteer \ndoctors, nurses, and other medical professionals to train people in \npoor countries.\n  Health Volunteers Overseas did an extraordinary job in Uganda during \nthe 7-year life of this project. There were tremendous achievements, \nand one terrible tragedy when Dr. Rodney Belcher, the Virginia \northopedic surgeon without whom the project would not have accomplished \nnearly so much, was gunned down in a robbery. His loss was felt \nthroughout Uganda, because so many people knew of his selflessness, and \nthat he had literally given his life for them and future generations in \nthat country. His legacy is the scores of Ugandan health professionals \nhe trained who are carrying on his work today.\n  Mr. President, HVO's final report on the Uganda project should be \nread by all. Its staff and volunteers deserve our sincere thanks, and \nour continued support. USAID, and President Museveni and his Health \nMinistry, also deserve credit. I ask that excerpts of the report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The excerpts of the report follow:\n\nExcerpts of Final Report--Uganda Orthopaedics and Physical Therapy for \n                          the Disabled Project\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       In August of 1989, Health Volunteers Overseas (HVO) entered \n     into a three year grant agreement with the U.S. Agency for \n     International Development (USAID) Mission in\n\n[[Page S3461]]\n\n     Uganda to ``improve the provision of orthopaedic, prosthetic, \n     orthotic and physical therapy services for Uganda's thousands \n     of children and adults who have lost upper and lower limbs, \n     been crippled through the paralytic residual of poliomyelitis \n     or otherwise become immobilized, especially those persons \n     whose disabilities resulted from civil strife''.\n       This grant concluded on December 31, 1996.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                            accomplishments\n\n                               Facilities\n\n       HVO renovated and furnished the Polio Clinic at Old Mulago \n     Hospital to serve as the site for the Department of \n     Orthopaedics. The renovated building included space for \n     departmental offices, weekly clinics, library, storage, \n     seminar/classroom, and the HVO offices.\n       HVO renovated and equipped the operating room suite at Ward \n     7 at Old Mulago, creating two ``clean'' theaters for non-\n     septic cases. These rooms were opened in March of 1991 and \n     according to a report dated January 31, 1995, ``the well \n     trained nursing and theater staff [are] working smoothly to \n     assist the surgical teams in performing an average of 20 \n     surgical operations weekly for conditions including polio, \n     trauma, fractures, spinal and hip injuries, tuberculosis, \n     cerebral palsy, bone tumors, club feet and a variety of \n     severe and late burns of hands and limbs''.\n       HVO rebuilt and equipped the Mbale Workshop which had been \n     destroyed in a fire in March of 1990.\n       HVO renovated and furnished a guest house on the hospital \n     grounds to serve as housing for volunteers.\n       HVO built a new, larger sterile store room adjacent to the \n     OR suite in the fall of 1996. This was funded by a private \n     donation to HVO, not with grant monies.\n\n                         Training and Education\n\n       HVO established a M.Med. (Orthopaedics) postgraduate degree \n     at Makerere University and Mulago Hospital. The goal of this \n     program is to train a corps of Ugandan orthopaedic surgeons \n     who will be qualified to continue the teaching program in \n     orthopaedic surgery and trauma management after the end of \n     this grant. The curriculum for this four year degree was \n     approved by the University Senate and accepted by the School \n     of Postgraduate Studies in 1995. The authors of the \n     curriculum included Drs. Belcher and Lawrence Gordon. In the \n     fall of 1995, three young Ugandan physicians were formally \n     enrolled in the program as the first residents.\n       Over the life of this grant, various cadres of personnel \n     were taught the principles of orthopaedic surgery and trauma \n     management. According to a summary provided by Dr. Belcher \n     in 1995, over 450 medical students, 45 physicians and \n     surgeons, 36 orthopaedic assistant paramedical officers, \n     16 physical therapists and 40 nurses had been exposed to \n     training and education related to orthopaedic surgery.\n       Considerable effort was also devoted to training the OR \n     personnel and surgical nursing staff in operating theater \n     sterile techniques and surgical procedures. When the \n     operating theaters at Ward 6 were nearing completion, HVO \n     sent an experienced OR nurse, Theresa McInerney, to Kampala \n     for a 6 month tour. Her job was to get the newly renovated OR \n     suite functioning. This included organizing donations \n     received from the United States, determining what additional \n     items needed to be procured from the United States or could \n     be made locally, and developing procedures to ensure that \n     sterile technique was maintained. She also initiated a series \n     of classes for the OR personnel in OR technique with a \n     special emphasis on asepsis and the importance of \n     productivity.\n       This training continued under the direction of another OR \n     nurse, Wilma Ostrander, who served several tours in Uganda. \n     She focused her efforts on improving the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of the OR nursing and paramedical staff through \n     a series of lectures and demonstrations. She also \n     participated in the development of infection control programs \n     designed to improve the safety of the environment in the \n     operating rooms resulting in lower post-operative infections \n     and complications.\n       On return visits, she also assisted the department in the \n     development of a computerized inventory system to track the \n     utilization of supplies and equipment. This has facilitated \n     the development of a departmental system to reorder supplies \n     as needed, a critical function for the department. As part of \n     this process, she has introduced the utilization of patient \n     records and patient supply lists so that there is a record \n     available tracing the items used and to facilitate stock \n     orders.\n       As the OR became functional, it also became clear that \n     there was not an adequate number of trained technicians at \n     the hospital who could handle the maintenance and servicing \n     of the medical equipment needed for surgery. This was \n     particularly evident in the lengthy process required for the \n     commissioning of the autoclave purchased for the Ward 7 OR \n     suite. Once commissioned, Dr. Belcher learned that there was \n     no one on the staff of the hospital who could maintain this \n     autoclave, despite the fact that it was similar to others at \n     New Mulago Hospital.\n       As a result, HVO entered into a collaborative relationship \n     with the American Medical Resources Foundation (AMRF), a \n     Boston-based NGO, to design and deliver a series of workshops \n     to teach Ugandan technicians at both Old and New Mulago \n     Hospitals how to repair, maintain and service medical \n     equipment. A total of three workshops were held in 1996 \n     focusing on the repair of cardiology, radiology, anesthesia, \n     respiratory and OR equipment. The first workshop was attended \n     by 30 hospital engineers and technicians from Mulago, Mengo, \n     Rubago and Nsambya Hospitals. Although there was significant \n     interest in the other two workshops, HVO and AMRF decided to \n     limit the number of participants to 15 in order to ensure \n     adequate time for hands-on work in diagnosing and repairing \n     equipment.\n       HVO also sent a resident to Hong Kong for 2.5 months of \n     post-graduate training at the University of Hong Kong under \n     the direction of Professor John C.Y. Leong. This training not \n     only served as an opportunity to see how services are \n     delivered in another country, but also fostered the \n     development of professional contacts outside of Uganda.\n\n                         Extension of Services\n\n       The scope of this project was national. HVO, under the \n     direction of Dr. Belcher, focused considerable effort on \n     expanding the delivery of services to hospitals outside \n     Kampala and developing an effective orthopaedic referral \n     system for the up-country regions of Uganda.\n       For the first three years of the project, regular visits to \n     various up-country facilities were undertaken by members of \n     the Department of Orthopaedics, usually accompanied by a \n     volunteer. Patients would be examined and the difficult cases \n     referred to Mulago for surgery. Others would be measured and \n     fitted with calipers or, if feasible, taken into surgery.\n       These visits ceased when travel funds for department \n     personnel were no longer forthcoming from the Ministry of \n     Health. However, Dr. Belcher planned an ambitious program of \n     up-country visits starting again in 1996.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The goal of these trips outside of Kampala was to increase \n     the visibility of the services available for the disabled, to \n     identify patients in need of services and to successfully \n     enroll them in treatment programs.\n       With the end of the grant, this aspect of the project is \n     perhaps the least likely to continue, although the need for \n     this type of outreach is critical. Funds are needed for \n     transportation, as well as food and housing for the team \n     members. It is unlikely that the Ministry of Health will be \n     able to fund as many trips as originally planned on an annual \n     basis.\n\n                         Other Accomplishments\n\n       HVO was able, with funds from the grant, to identify and \n     procure essential educational materials, including books, \n     journals, slide sets, and videos. HVO also purchased items \n     necessary for the viewing and development of educational \n     materials. For example, HVO procured overhead and slide \n     projectors, a television and video machine, computers with \n     CD-ROM capabilities, and a photocopier. Access to this \n     equipment is essential as members of the department or \n     volunteers seek to organize lectures and teaching materials \n     for students.\n       More than 5,000 books and journals were shipped to Uganda \n     under the auspices of this grant. Most of these were donated \n     by members of HVO. HVO, based on input and recommendations of \n     the senior members of the Department of Orthopaedics, also \n     procured a set of current reference texts in medicine, \n     rehabilitation, and orthopaedics for the departmental \n     library. This order filled many gaps that existed in the \n     library and will serve the educational needs of the \n     department for many years to come.\n       One of HVO's educational objectives at the Medical School \n     and Mulago Hospital was to develop better interaction and \n     communication between the various departments involved in \n     patient services and teaching. This was accomplished through \n     the development of a weekly joint conference with the \n     Radiology Department where orthopaedic surgeons and \n     radiologists reviewed patient x-rays and learn from one \n     another. Similar conferences were established with a joint \n     pathology, radiology, orthopaedic, and oncology conference \n     held monthly. Other joint conferences were established with \n     the Neurosurgical and Pediatric Departments.\n       In addition, HVO, with the assistance of Dr. Belcher, was \n     able to develop links with other departments. HVO initiated \n     volunteer-staffed teaching programs with the departments of \n     anesthesia, medicine and pediatrics. Strengthening the \n     capacity of these departments to treat patients and to teach \n     future generations of Ugandan medical providers is critical \n     to the overall improvement of health care in Uganda.\n       When it became evident that HVO volunteers would not be \n     able to have an active role assisting AVSI in the School for \n     Physical Therapists, HVO recruited several PT volunteers to \n     work primarily with the Departments of Physical Therapy. \n     Donna Tinsley, a PT who spent 6 months in Kampala with the \n     project, taught PT students during bedside ward rounds on \n     Ward 7 as well as in the amputee, cerebral palsy and polio \n     clinics.\n\n\n                          problems encountered\n\n       Some of the problems encountered in the course of \n     implementing this project are inherent in the way \n     international assistance is designed. The original grant was \n     for a period of three years, an extremely short period of \n     time in which to ``improve the provision of orthopaedic, \n     prosthetic, orthotic and physical therapy services . . .'' \n     for a country such as Uganda. Extensions were forthcoming but \n     only for 12 to 18 months at a time. This\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\n     short-term focus prevented HVO from developing longer range \n     plans that might have been more effective.\n       The logistical problems involved in renovating and \n     equipping the departmental offices and OR suites on Ward 7 \n     were, at times, monumental. Dealing with local contractors \n     was very difficult. Materials were often delayed or ``went \n     missing''. Workers might not show up on time or even at all. \n     These problems contributed to a substantial delay in the \n     project which was compensated for by a one-year extension.\n       Communications between the field office and HVO's \n     Washington office were hampered by frequent power outages and \n     missing faxes. This situation, however, improved over the \n     life of the project, especially with the introduction of e-\n     mail.\n       As was mentioned above, there were recurring problems with \n     the maintenance of equipment, including, but not limited to, \n     medical equipment. Due to power surges, office equipment \n     frequently was damaged, often beyond repair. The problems \n     associated with the commissioning of the autoclave might well \n     serve as a case study in the difficulties in merging a highly \n     sophisticated piece of equipment into a facility which cannot \n     provide adequate supplies of water and electricity. Despite \n     considerable research and investigation as to which autoclave \n     would be best suited to the department's needs and \n     building's capacity, this autoclave was inoperable for \n     several years. When finally commissioned, its maintenance \n     was a recurring problem.\n\n\n                         project sustainability\n\n       The death on March 11, 1996, of Dr. Rodney Belcher was a \n     tremendous loss for all involved in this project. Dr. Belcher \n     was murdered in front of the HVO office on the hospital \n     grounds in the course of a carjacking attempt that was \n     ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Given the unexpected and tragic turn of events in 1996, \n     what are the chances that activities undertaken to date will \n     continue and that the impact of these many years of hard work \n     will be sustained over time?\n       On a positive note, the senior members of the department \n     immediately took charge upon Dr. Belcher's death and \n     appropriately divided the departmental workload. The \n     department has continued to function with weekly clinics, \n     twice weekly operating schedules, ward rounds, seminars, etc. \n     Through the end of 1996, thanks to funding available from \n     HVO, up-country outreach clinics were conducted. Dr. Naddumba \n     has been elected Head of the Department and has earned high \n     marks for his administrative and political skills.\n       Health Volunteers Overseas will continue to send volunteers \n     to share their technical expertise with members of the \n     Department of Orthopaedics. HVO will also send volunteers to \n     work with faculty and students in the Departments of \n     Medicine, Pediatrics, and Anesthesia.\n       In addition, Dr. Norgrove Penny, a Canadian orthopaedic \n     surgeon and member of Orthopaedics Overseas, accepted a four \n     year contract in Kampala with the Christoffel Blindenmission \n     (CBM) beginning in August of 1996. He is working in \n     conjunction with the Uganda Society for Disabled Children and \n     the Leonard Cheshire Homes of Uganda, both British based \n     charities working in community based projects. His job \n     includes developing services to up-country district hospitals \n     who at present have no orthopaedic services.\n       There have been discussions between members of the \n     Department of Orthopaedics at Mulago Hospital and Dr. Penny \n     regarding the possibility of working together. There \n     certainly appears to be an overlap of mutual interests and \n     HVO/Washington has strongly supported this possibility.\n       However, * * * without a certain level of ongoing financial \n     support there will be some serious problems ahead for the \n     department and for the delivery of orthopaedic and \n     rehabilitation services to the population at large in Uganda.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       This project began in the fall of 1989 in the midst of \n     great anticipation and hope. Uganda was recovering from a \n     long period of intense civil strife marked by intense \n     fighting, brutality and bloodshed. HVO had an opportunity to \n     participate in a program that would help rehabilitate the \n     lives of thousands touched in one way or another by the \n     breakdown of society during this period.\n       Now, seven years later, we can say that this project has \n     done much to ``improve the provision of orthopaedic, \n     prosthetic, orthotic and physical therapy services for \n     Uganda's thousands of children and adults who have lost upper \n     and lower limbs, been crippled through the paralytic residual \n     of poliomyelitis or otherwise become immobilized, especially \n     those persons whose disabilities resulted from civil \n     strife''.\n       The death of Dr. Rodney Belcher was a devastating even. His \n     death, however, serves as a beacon for members of the \n     department and HVO who are determined not to allow this event \n     to diminish the accomplishments of his many years of \n     dedication and hard work.\n  [At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3460-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING THE MOST WORSHIPFUL GRAND LODGE'S SCHOLARSHIP WINNERS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Most Worshipful Grand \nLodge, Masonic Architects of the Universe, Inc., Ancient Free and \nAccepted Masons, Electa Grand Chapter, Order of the Eastern Star of \nNewark, NJ, will be awarding scholarships to at least 16 deserving \nstudents at its second annual Scholarship Banquet on May 18. Young \npeople from New York; Connecticut; Washington, DC; and Essex and Hudson \ncounties in New Jersey will be recognized during the evening's \nceremonies. I congratulate all the scholarship recipients, and I \nencourage them to always strive for academic excellence. In the words \nof poet Muriel Ruyskier, I urge them to ``reach the limits of \nthemselves, to reach beyond themselves.''\n  Mr. President, education is the key that unlocks the door to the \nfuture. By the year 2000, 60 percent of all new jobs in America will \nrequire advanced technology skills. Anyone who does not have the \nrequired education will not be able to compete. Education isn't a \nluxury, it's a necessity.\n  I know that the scholarships awarded by the Most Worshipful Grand \nLodge will help the recipients face tomorrow's challenges. But I also \nhope that these awards will instill in the winners a love for \neducation. In the 19th century Jewish ghettos of Eastern Europe, \nmothers used to pour a little honey on a book, in order to demonstrate \nto their children the sweetness of learning. And learning is sweet, \nbecause it enriches our lives; it opens our minds to new possibilities, \nand it allows us to fully enjoy the wonders of the universe.\n  Mr. President, as we honor this year's scholarship winners, I also \nwant to commend the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge for its outstanding \ncommunity work, particularly in the area of education. Through its \nactions, the Grand Lodge demonstrates that not only does it take an \nentire village to raise a child, it takes an entire community to \neducate a child.\n  I again congratulate all of the scholarship winners, and I wish them \ncontinued success as they continue on the path of knowledge and the \npath of life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3462-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3462-S3463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMITTEE RULES OF PROCEDURE IN THE CONGRESSIONAL \n                                 RECORD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

ANITA JONES\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nprofessional dedication, vision and public service of Dr. Anita K. \nJones who is completing her appointment, after 4 years, as the Director \nof Defense Research and Engineering [DDR]. A native of Texas, and \nlongtime Virginia resident, Dr. Jones is one of this country's \npreeminent information technology experts and a pioneer for women in \nscience and engineering career fields everywhere. Prior to coming to \nthe Department of Defense, she was the chair of the department of \ncomputer science at the University of Virginia. As DDR, she serves in \none of the Nation's top technical positions and oversees the largest \ndefense research and development organization in the world.\n  Her strong support for, and oversight of, the multibillion-dollar \nDefense Science and Technology [S] Program dramatically improved the \nwarfighting capabilities and readiness of our Nation's military forces \nboth today and well into the future. Dr. Jones spearheaded the \nimplementation of a new structured planning process which aligns \ntechnology research and development more directly with critical \nwarfighting and national security priorities. Through strong \nleadership, she brought the technology and operational military \ncommunities together to design detailed plans to sustain U.S. dominance \non the battlefield into the next century.\n  In addition, Dr. Jones focused the Department of Defense S Program \nto ensure military and national preeminence in several strategic \ntechnologies with both military and commercial application such as \ninformation technology, high-performance computing, advanced \nelectronics, materials and modeling and simulation. Her active outreach \nwithin the Department of Defense expanded greatly the scope of the \nDefense S Program and the speed and ease at which technology is \ndeveloped and transitioned into our warfighting arsenal and support \ninfrastructure. Furthermore, her direct support of pervasive \ntechnologies such as high end computing and semiconductors resulted in \nbreakthroughs across a wide spectrum of applications, both military and \ncivilian, such as modeling of geophysical phenomenon, aerodynamics and \nprocess flow, which contributed directly to our Nation's ability to \nexecute a record number of peacekeeping and military operations without \nthe loss of a single life due to combat.\n  Dr. Jones' awards include the Department of Defense Award for \nDistinguished Public Service and the Meritorious Civilian Service \nAward. She has served on several Government advisory boards and \nscientific review panels such as the Defense Science Board, Air Force \nScientific Advisory Board, the National Research Council, and the \nNational Science Foundation. She is a member of the National Academy of \nEngineers and is a fellow of the Association of Computing Machinery and \nthe Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.\n  I know that Dr. Jones' husband, William A. Wulf, and her daughters, \nKarin and Ellen, are proud of her many accomplishments, and so is the \nNation. Her distinguished service will be genuinely missed in the \nDepartment of Defense, and all of us who know her wish her every \nsuccess as she returns to the University of Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3463-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LOAN INTEREST FORGIVENESS FOR EDUCATION ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, it was with great pleasure that on \nApril 15, Tax Day, I joined with Senators Grassley and Moseley-Braun in \ncosponsoring the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act, S. 573.\n  With Americans scrambling last week to get their tax returns filed, \nthis bill offers a bit of relief for students who rely on loans to pay \ntheir higher education bills. This legislation will restore the tax \ndeduction for student loan interest, with eligibility for the deduction \nphased out for taxpayers with incomes between $65,000 and $85,000 \n(single returns) and $85,000 and $105,000 (joint returns). This modest \nstep will take some of the sting out of repaying student loans.\n  A college degree is more important in today's job market than it has \never been. At the same time, education costs continue to rise and the \naverage debt of graduates is at record levels. On top of that, the tax \nburden has increased, putting a serious strain on college graduates as \nthey work to pay off their loans and interest and still get ahead in \nthe job market.\n  Let us give student loan recipients a tax break. Let us send a \nmessage about the importance of student loans and higher education. \nThis is a sound investment in our Nation's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3463-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING FRED VANDERVEEN OF SALISBURY, MD\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nvery special American, Mr. Fred Vanderveen, of Salisbury, MD. I am \nproud to say that Mr. Vanderveen is the 1997 winner of the National \nHeroes Award from the Sporting Goods Manufacturer's Association. This \nprestigious award is given each year to three individuals who make \noutstanding and unique humanitarian contributions to local sports \nprograms throughout the Nation.\n  Fred Vanderveen is a full-time high school biology teacher. But the \nclassroom is only one area where Mr. Vanderveen is preparing our \nchildren for the future. He knows that developing the health and \nfitness of our children's bodies is as important as developing their \nminds. He also knows that kids need a safe place to go where they can \nhave positive experiences, where they will be among friends, and where \nthey will feel important. So he invested his life's savings in a sports \nand training facility called Youth Exercise Services. His facility is \ndesigned to meet the needs of mentally and physically handicapped \nathletes, at-risk youths, and anyone who will say no to drugs and yes \nto exercise.\n  Mr. Vanderveen takes to his playing field at Youth Exercise Services \nthe same way I take to the Senate floor: mission-driven, determined, \nand unwilling to lose. Through his dedication and hard work, the kids \nhe touches learn that they don't have to lose either. Whether they are \nhandicapped, at-risk, or just looking for a positive after school \nenvironment, they've got the chance to come out winners because Fred \nVanderveen cares about each and every one of them.\n  Mr. President, I want to give my warmest congratulations to Mr. \nVanderveen, and to the kids whose lives he helps make better. His 1997 \nHeroes Award is richly deserved, and the State of Maryland is proud to \ncall him one of our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3463-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3463-S3464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO JANE McCAFFERY FOR WINNING THE CONTINENTAL CABLEVISION'S \n                      1997 NATIONAL EDUCATOR AWARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Jane McCaffery, a teacher at Lincoln Street School and \nMain Street School in Exeter, NH, on receiving the Continental \nCablevision's 1997 National Educator Award.\n\n[[Page S3464]]\n\n  As a former teacher myself, I commend her outstanding accomplishment \nand well-deserved honor.\n  Continental Cablevision designed the Educator Award program in 1989 \nto encourage teachers to use Cable in the Classroom, a cable industry \ninitiative which provides schools with free cable connections and \naccess to more than 500 hours of commercial-free educational \nprogramming each month. Jane was chosen for this distinguished honor \nfrom among educators in all of the communities that Continental \nCablevision serves in New Hampshire.\n  Under the direction of Jane, Exeter elementary students, teachers and \ntheir work are showcased in ``Booktalk,'' an ambitious weekly cable TV \nprogram. The program encourages students to read and invites families \nto participate in activities related to their children's reading. It \nalso raises community awareness about the elementary curriculum. Jane \nand an Australian crocodile puppet explore one curriculum theme each \nweek and feature a reading by teachers, students or guests, ideas for \nfamilies to further pursue the learning theme, and many creative \npresentations.\n  New Hampshire has always been fortunate to have many talented \nteachers, but Jane McCaffery is certainly a role model among the \nteachers of the Granite State. I am proud of her commitment to \neducation and congratulate her superb achievement. It is an honor to \nrepresent her in the U.S. Senate.\n  [At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3463-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SALEM COUNTY EDUCATION ANNIVERSARIES\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Salem County School District on a number of notable anniversaries. \nThe year 1997 marks the 40th anniversary of the district, the 25th \nanniversary of the initiation of occupational, technical and vocational \nprograms and services to secondary students and the 15th anniversary of \nthe operation of the New Jersey Regional Day School at Mannington for \nthe Department of Education.\n  Mr. President, these anniversaries are especially significant because \neducation is the key that will open the door to the future for our \nchildren. By the year 2000, 60 percent of all new jobs in America will \nrequire advanced technical skills. The industrial age has given way to \nthe information age and, more than ever before, students need a quality \neducation if they are going to be able to compete.\n  But a quality education doesn't only benefit the individual, it also \nbenefits our Nation. If our firms and factories are to find the \neducated workers they need, and if these same firms are to remain \ncompetitive in the global marketplace, then our students must receive \nthe necessary training and skills. Our economic future depends on it.\n  Mr. President, 300 years ago this year, the colony of Massachusetts \npassed the very first American education law. It required that every \ntown of at least 50 people hire a teacher of reading and writing. Those \nfirst colonists, huddled in their tiny villages along the Atlantic \ncoast, understood the importance of education for their children and \nfor their communities. And ever since, making ourselves the best \neducated Nation on Earth has always been the very essence of our \nAmerican dream. The work of the Salem County School District, and the \nSalem County Vocational Technical Schools, is helping to ensure that \nthis particular American dream remains an American reality.\n  To the students of Salem County, I say don't ever forget that there's \nalways more to be learned, always more to be seen, always more to be \nexplored. And to the Salem County Board of Education, the Salem County \nSchool District, and the Salem County Vocational Technical Schools, I \nsay congratulations and continue your fine work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3464-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL PENSION DISCLOSURE ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in order \nto offer my support for the Congressional Pension Disclosure Act of \n1997.\n  This bill will require that detailed information about the pension of \nevery Member of Congress be published twice a year. These facts--how \nmuch has been contributed to a pension plan, how much is to be received \nin retirement, and acquired Federal retirement benefits--should be \npublic information.\n  Montanans, as well as those in every other State, deserve the right \nto know how public funds are being spent. The disclosure of pension \ncontributions and benefits will allow Montanans to judge whether or not \nthe amounts are fair and just. Taxpayers will be able to make fully \ninformed decisions about the kind of job we representatives are doing \nin abiding the will of the people and keeping Government spending under \ncontrol.\n  The Congressional Pension Disclosure Act will make facts readily \navailable to anyone who wants them. Perception that Congress operates \nin secrecy would be eliminated and the people of Montana would know \nthat their representatives have nothing to hide. Simply said, by \ndisclosing the size of our pensions, we in Congress will make a step in \nthe right direction toward restoring faith in government by the \nAmerican people.\n  I commend Senator Abraham for drafting this meaningful legislation, \nand I am proud to have signed on as a cosponsor of S. 269.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3464-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SANCTIONS AGAINST BURMA\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. I commend the President for his decision to \ninvoke investment sanctions on Burma, in accordance with section 570 of \nPublic Law 104-208. The President deserves praise for his action. \nConditions in Burma remain grim and warrant this limited measure.\n  Perhaps no one is more deserving of praise than the Senator from \nKentucky, Senator McConnell. He and I have stood together in support of \nthe people of Burma for many years now and I congratulate him for his \nsteadfast efforts to assist in achieving a democratic transition in \nBurma.\n  Burma is a democracy denied. It is a country with a democratic past. \nWith our help it can have a democratic future. We find ourselves at a \npoint in history where numerous nations are struggling to build \ndemocratic governments. It is not always an easy process. Those who are \ninvolved in such transitions watch for America s response to situations \nsuch as we find in Burma, where a military junta prevents the \nimplementation of a democratic election. Let us be clear. This is not \nonly about human rights and trade. This is about our commitment to \ndemocracy.\n  There are those who argue that constructive engagement is the only \nway to effect change in a country. Constructive engagement is a \neuphemism for doing business with thugs. Foreign investment in Burma \nprovides hard currency for the State Law and Order Restoration Council \n[SLORC]. Most U.S. companies refuse to support such a regime through \nforeign investment. Amoco, Levi Strauss, Liz Claiborne, Macy's, Eddie \nBauer, Columbia Sportswear, Oshkosh B'Gosh, Pepsi, Apple Computer, and \nmany other companies already have cut business ties with Burma. I \ncommend the President for his action which supports the decisions of \nthese responsible companies.\n  Finally, I would note that this is not an end to our efforts in \nBurma, but a beginning. Strong bilateral pressure needs to be \nsupplemented with multilateral action. I call on other nations which \nshare our concern for the people of Burma to join us. Most importantly, \nthe SLORC should know that we will remain vigilant and continue to \ndefend the rights of Burmese democracy leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3464-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3464-S3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SLOVAKIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call to my \ncolleagues' attention human rights developments in Slovakia. These \ndevelopments point Slovakia in the opposite direction from the road \ntheir neighbors have been traveling. Their neighbors accept western \nvalues and seek integration into western institutions, developments \nleading to individual freedom, political democracy, and economic \nprosperity in a free market system. In stark contrast, Slovakia is not \nin compliance with some important Helsinki process commitments and is \nshowing signs of regression toward authoritarian, if not totalitarian \nrelations between the state and its citizens.\n  This country, which showed so much promise upon gaining independence \nin 1993, has failed to press ahead with vitally needed democratic \nreforms, in contrast with so many other countries in the region, \nincluding other newly independent countries. While the Czech Republic, \nHungary, and Poland have worked hard to qualify for EU membership and \nNATO accession, Slovakia has lagged behind. While states like Lithuania \nand Slovenia have emerged from repressive empires to bring prosperity \nand hope to their peoples, Slovakia has not. Even Romania, which has \nstruggled profoundly with the transition from totalitarianism, has \nmanaged to undertake significant reforms in the past few months.\n  From the outset, members of the Helsinki Commission have supported \nthe\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\ndemocratic transformation in Slovakia. We believe that a strong, \ndemocratic Slovakia will enhance stability and security in Europe.\n  Unfortunately, human rights and democratization in Slovakia have \ntaken a severe beating--both literally and figuratively--in recent \nmonths. The hopes raised by free and fair elections and by the passage \nof a democratic constitution have been dashed\n  Last month, I understand some officials in Bratislava criticized a \ncongressional report on NATO enlargement and complained that the \ndiscussion of Slovakia's progress toward democracy was too superficial. \nWell, I will provide a little more detail for those who genuinely want \nto know what worries us here in Washington.\n  Parliamentary democracy in Slovakia took a bullet in late November, \nwhen parliamentarian Frantisek Gaulieder, after announcing his \nresignation from the ruling coalition's Movement for a Democratic \nSlovakia, was stripped of his parliamentary mandate through \nantidemocratic means that are unheard of anywhere else in Europe. His \nremoval has been protested by the European Union and the United States \nat OSCE meetings in Vienna, but, so far, to no avail.\n  Even more outrageously, there was a bomb attack against Mr. \nGaulieder's home, while he and his family were present. This is a \ntactic that reminds me of the Communists, fascists, and other similarly \nbloody and ruthless groups.\n  The 1995 kidnaping of President Kovac's son is not only still \nunsolved, but the manner in which this matter has been investigated has \nfueled speculation that the government's own security forces were \ndirectly involved in this crime. The murder last year of Robert Remias, \nwho may have had key evidence in this case, and the ineffectual \ninvestigation of that case has deepened these suspicions.\n\n  Adding to this disturbing pattern, questions are already being raised \nabout the official investigation of the December bomb attack on \nFrantisek Gaulieder's home: Mr. Gauliedier has reported that some of \nhis testimony regarding the attack is missing from his police file, \nthat the first investigator was removed after only 3 days on the case, \nand that the Slovak Minister of Interior has, shockingly, suggested \nthat Mr. Gaulieder may have planted the bomb himself--the same ``he-\ndid-it-himself'' story that no one believes regarding the kidnaping of \nMr. Kovac, Jr.\n  I am now informed that this investigation, like the Kovac and Remias \ncases, has been ``closed for lack of evidence.'' For a country \nsupposedly seriously committed through its OSCE obligations to the \nestablishment of a ``rule of law'' state, this is a damagingly poor \nperformance.\n  In addition to these acts of violence, it has been reported that the \nPresident, the President's son, and members of the Constitutional Court \nhave been subjected to death threats. In fact, in early December the \nAssociation of Slovak Judges characterized the anonymous, threatening \nletters addressed to Milan Cic, the Chair of the Slovak Constitutional \nCourt, as an attack against the court as a whole and a means of \npolitical intimidation.\n  It has also been reported that on February 24 an opposition political \nfigure in Banska Bystrica, Miroslav Toman, was attacked by four \nassailants.\n  We see a country where politically motivated violence is on the \nincrease, where public confidence in the government's intent to provide \nsecurity for all Slovaks has plummeted, and where acts of violence and \nthreats of violence have brought into question both the rule of law and \nthe very foundations of democracy.\n  The ruling coalition has continued to pursue an openly hostile agenda \ntoward a free and independent media and free speech in general. During \nthe course of the past year, two newspapers--Slovenska Republika and \nNaroda Obroda--have seen a total of 21 editors quit over alleged \npolitical interference with their work. Defamation suits launched by \npublic officials appear to be a common vehicle for harassing one's \npolitical opponents.\n  Most recently, on November 19, the government barred four journalists \nfrom attending a regular press conference after the weekly cabinet \nmeeting because the journalists were believed to be unsympathetic to \nthe government. Although this decision was ultimately rescinded after a \npublic outcry--including a protest from the journalists' union--it was \nfurther evidence of the government's relentless efforts to curb any \nreporting it doesn't like.\n  In fact, in one of the more shocking episodes of the battle for free \nspeech in Slovakia, it has been reported that Vladimir Meciar--the \nPrime Minister of the country and, not insignificantly, a former \nboxer--warned journalist Dusan Valko just a few weeks ago that ``I will \npunch you so that your own mother will not recognize you.'' So much for \nMr. Meciar's tolerance for other points of view and nonviolence.\n\n  The Slovak Government continues to pursue a minorities policy that \nwould be laughable if it were not so wrong and harmful. This policy has \nincluded everything from banning the playing of non-Slovak national \nanthems last year to the more recent decision to bar the issuance of \nreport cards in the Hungarian language, reversing long-standing \npractices. Such petty gestures are beneath the dignity of the Slovak \npeople, whose heritage has survived more than a thousand years of \nforeign--and often markedly repressive--rule. The Slovak language and \nculture, now protected in an independent Slovakia, are not so weak that \nthey can only flourish at the expense of others.\n  More seriously, it should be noted that past repressive crackdowns on \nminorities--for example, in Cluj, Romania, and in Kosovo, Serbia--began \nby whittling away at the minority language opportunities that had \ntraditionally been respected by the majority community. Accordingly, \nthese seemingly small restrictions on the Hungarian minority in \nSlovakia may very well be the harbinger of more repressive tactics \nahead.\n  With this in mind, the failure of the Slovak parliament to adopt a \ncomprehensive minority language law, and the recommendation of the \nMinistry of Culture that such a law is not even necessary, defy common \nsense. Current laws on minority-language use in Slovakia do not provide \nadequate or satisfactory guidance regarding the use of Hungarian for \nofficial purposes, as the recent report-card flap shows. Much harm can \nbe done until a minority language law is passed based on a genuine \naccommodation between the majority and minority communities.\n  Finally, recent reductions in government-provided cultural subsidies \nhave had a disproportionately negative effect on the Hungarian \ncommunity. The Slovak Government's defense, that all ethnic groups have \nbeen equally disadvantaged by these cut-backs, is unpersuasive in light \nof the Culture Minister Hudec's stated intent to ``revive'' Slovak \nculture in ethnically mixed areas and to make cultural subsidies \nreflect that goal.\n  While Hungarians suffer from a more direct form of government \nintolerance, other ethnic groups suffer more indirectly. Put another \nway, it is not so much government action which threatens Romani \ncommunities in Slovakia, it is government inaction.\n  According to the most recent State Department report on Slovakia, \nskinhead violence against Roma is a serious and growing problem; three \nRoma were murdered as a result of hate crimes last year, and others \nhave been severely injured. Some Roma leaders, in response to their \ngovernment's inability or unwillingness to protect them, have called \nfor the formation of self-defense units. Obviously, the Slovak \nGovernment is just not doing enough to address the deadly threats they \nface.\n  Moreover, the repugnant anti-Roma statements that have repeatedly \nbeen made by Jan Slota, a member of the ruling coalition, have fostered \nthis climate of hatred. The fact that the Czech Republic, Germany, and \nother European countries also confront skinhead movements in no way \nrelieves Slovakia of its responsibility to combat racism, just as \nSlovakia's skinhead problem does not relieve the other countries of \ntheir responsibilities.\n  It is time and past time for Prime Minister Meciar to use his moral \nauthority and political leadership to set Slovakia on the right course. \nHe must make clear, once and for all, that Jan Slota--who also called \nthe Hungarian minority ``barbarian Asiatic hordes''--is not his \nspokesman, and that the Slovak National Party's unreconstructed \nfascists do not represent the majority of the people of Slovakia.\n  Mr. President, the leadership of the Helsinki Commission, including \nmy co-chairman, Representative Christopher H. Smith, and ranking \nmembers Senator Frank Lautenberg and Representative Steny Hoyer, have \nraised our concern about developments in Slovakia with Slovak officials \non a number of occasions. Unfortunately, all we hear from the Slovak \nleadership is one excuse after another, and all we see is a search for \none scapegoat after another: it's the Hungarians, it's the Czechs, it's \nthe Ukrainian mafia, it's the hostile international community seeking \nto destroy Slovakia's good name, it's a public relations problem \nabroad, not real problems back home--in short, there is always somebody \nelse to blame besides the people that are, in fact, running the \ncountry.\n  I don't mean to suggest that there have been no positive developments \nin Slovakia over the past 4 years. In fact, I have been especially \nheartened by the\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nemergence of a genuine civil society that is increasingly willing to \nexpress its views on a broad range of issues. But positive initiatives \nby the Government have been too few and too far between.\n  I make this statement today in the hope that the leadership in \nBratislava will start to make real reforms, like their colleagues in \nRomania, and begin to restore the promising future that the people of \nSlovakia deserve. Their present policies are leading down a path toward \ninternational isolation, increasing criticism, and economic deprivation \nfor their people. One Belarus is enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3464-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, APRIL 23, 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE.

The Senate's antecedent process for review \nof discrimination claims in Senate employment, which was created by the \nGovernment Employee Rights Act of 1991, continues to govern older \ncases. The case of William L. Singer versus Office of Senate Fair \nEmployment Practices, now pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nFederal circuit, is a case initiated under the 1991 act.\n  The petitioner in this case, a former officer in the Capitol Police \nDepartment, seeks review of a ruling of the Select Committee on Ethics, \nwhich affirmed a decision of a hearing board appointed by the Director \nof the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices. The hearing board \ndecision rejected the officer's claim that his termination from the \nCapital Police violated the Americans With Disabilities Act and the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, as made applicable by the Government \nEmployee Rights Act.\n  Under the Government Employee Rights Act, a final decision of the \nEthics Committee is entered in the records of the Office of Senate Fair \nEmployment Practices, which is then named as the respondent if the \ndecision is challenged in the Federal circuit. As petitions for review \nin the Federal circuit challenges final decisions of a Senate \nadjudicatory process, under the Government Employee Rights Act the \nSenate legal counsel may be directed to defend those decisions through \nrepresentation of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in \ncourt.\n  Accordingly, this resolution directs the Senate legal counsel to \nrepresent the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in the case \nof Singer versus Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, in defense \nof the Ethics Committee's final decision.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, that any statements relating to the \nresolution appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 77\n\n       Whereas, in the case of William L. Singer v. Office of \n     Senate Fair Employment Practices, No. 97-6000, pending in the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, \n     petitioner William L. Singer has sought review of a final \n     decision of the Select Committee on Ethics which had been \n     entered, pursuant to section 308 of the Government Employee \n     Rights Act of 1991, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1208 (1994), in the records \n     of the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices;\n       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the \n     Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) \n     and 288c(a)(1) (1994), the Senate may direct its counsel to \n     defend committees of the Senate in civil actions relating to \n     their official responsibilities;\n       Whereas, pursuant to section 303(f) of the Government \n     Employee Rights Act of 1991, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1203(f) (1994), \n     for purposes of representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, \n     the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices, the \n     respondent in this proceeding, is deemed a committee within \n     the meaning of sections 703(a) and 704(a)(1) of the Ethics in \n     Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a), \n     288c(a)(1) (1994): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is directed to \n     represent the Office of Senate Fair Employment Practices in \n     the case of William L. Singer v. Office of Senate Fair \n     Employment Practices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/22/senate-section/article/S3466-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
