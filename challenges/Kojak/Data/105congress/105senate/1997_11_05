Mr. President, although I am delighted that the Senate \nwill today be confirming James S. Gwin as a Federal district court \njudge, the Republican Leader has once again passed over and refused to \ntake up the nomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is \nthe longest pending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, having \nlanguished on the Senate Calendar since June 12. The central district \nof California desperately needs this vacancy filled, which has been \nopen for more than 18 months, and Margaret Morrow is eminently \nqualified to fill it.\n  Just last week, the opponents of this nomination announced in a press \nconference that they welcomed a debate and rollcall vote on Margaret \nMorrow. But again the Republican majority leader has refused to bring \nup this well-qualified nominee for such debate and vote. It appears \nthat Republicans have time for press conferences to attack one of the \nPresident's judicial nominations, but the majority leader will not \nallow the U.S. Senate to turn to that nomination for a vote. We can \ndiscuss the nomination in sequential press conferences and weekend talk \nshow appearances but not in the one place that action must be taken on \nit, on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The Senate has suffered through \nhours of quorum calls in the past few weeks which time would have been \nbetter spent debating and voting on this judicial nomination.\n  The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are puzzling--not only to \nthose\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\nof us in the Senate who know her record but to those who know her best \nin California, including many Republicans.\n  They cannot fathom why a few Senators have decided to target someone \nas well-qualified and as moderate as she is.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a recent article from the \nLos Angles Times by Henry Weinstein on the nomination of Margaret \nMorrow, entitled ``Bipartisan Support Not Enough For Judicial \nNominee,'' be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. This article documents the deep and widespread bipartisan \nsupport that Margaret Morrow enjoys from Republicans that know her. In \nfact, these Republicans are shocked that some Senators have attacked \nMs. Morrow. For example, Sheldon H. Sloan, a former president of the \nLos Angeles County Bar Association and an associate of Gov. Pete \nWilson, declared that: ``My party has the wrong woman in their \nsights.''\n  Stephen S. Trott, a former high-ranking official in the Reagan \nadministration and now a Court of Appeals judge wrote to the majority \nleader to try to free up the Morrow nomination, according to this \narticle Judge Trott informed Senator Lott.\n\n       I know that you are concerned, and properly so, about the \n     judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench. \n     So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means: \n     follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes. \n     Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I \n     have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a \n     judicial position.\n\n  Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican \nadministration, observed in the article that: ``Margaret has gotten \ntangled in a web of larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere \npawn in this struggle.'' I could not agree more.\n  Mr. President, it is time to free the nomination of Margaret Morrow \nfrom this tangled web that some extremists are trying to weave. It is \ntime to debate and vote on the nomination of Margaret Morrow.\n  Mr. President, again, I am pleased we will take up the nomination of \nJudge James Gwin. But we are, once again, overlooking the nomination of \nMargaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest pending \njudicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, and is strongly supported \nby both Republicans and Democrats. The Senate ought to have the courage \nand the honesty to either vote for her or against her.\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 3, 1997]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           Bipartisan Support Not Enough for Judicial Nominee\n\n(U.S. Senate: Margaret Morrow's appointment is stalled despite backing \nacross political spectrum. Some say she is victim of effort to downsize \n                                courts)\n\n                          (By Henry Weinstein)\n\n       If ever there was an unlikely candidate to be the target \n     for a militant campaign against ``judicial activism,'' it \n     would be Los Angeles lawyer Margaret Mary Morrow.\n       An honors graduate of Harvard Law School, 47, was the first \n     female president of the California Bar Assn., where she \n     worked to strengthen the state's attorney discipline system.\n       A commercial litigation specialist, Morrow is a partner in \n     the Los Angeles office of Arnold & Porter, one of the most \n     venerable firms based in the nation's capital. Her clients \n     have included First Interstate Bank, McDonnell Douglas, TWA \n     and The Limited.\n       President Clinton, on the recommendation of Sen. Barbara \n     Boxer (D-Calif.), tapped Morrow for a federal trial judgeship \n     in May 1996. She quickly won bipartisan support--including \n     endorsements from judges appointed by presidents Ronald \n     Reagan and George Bush and governors George Deukmejian and \n     Pete Wilson.\n       ``Margaret is superbly well qualified,'' said Los Angeles \n     lawyer Robert C. Bonner, who has served as a federal judge \n     and head of the Drug Enforcement Administration during Bush's \n     presidency.\n       She also received the highest possible rating--``very well \n     qualified''--from the American Bar Assn.'s judicial \n     evaluation committee. By late 1996, after a perfunctory \n     hearing, Morrow cleared the committee unanimously. But the \n     nomination died, along with several others in the \n     congressional slowdown that inevitably occurs in election \n     years.\n       Clinton renominated Morrow on Jan. 7. Within three weeks, \n     trouble emerged and her nomination remains in limbo even \n     though she was approved a second time on June 12 by the \n     Judiciary Committee, whose chairman, Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), \n     said in late September that he would push for a swift vote \n     and support her.\n       Much to the surprise of her backers, particularly her \n     Republican supporters, Morrow has become the subject of the \n     sort of intense partisan attacks generally reserved for \n     nominees with a long record of activism such as civil rights \n     lawyer Thurgood Marshall or a trail of controversial \n     decisions such as Judge Robert Bork.\n       Indeed, the story of Morrow's confirmation battle is in \n     significant measure a tale about the fissures within the \n     Republican Party about judicial nominations.\n       One conservative federal judge, speaking on condition of \n     not being identified, said that, in reality, the campaign \n     against Morrow has nothing to do with her qualifications or \n     her views, but rather is part of a ``conscious plan to \n     downsize'' the federal courts in the western United States \n     with the goal of remaking them after Clinton's presidency \n     ends.\n       Echoed Bonner: ``Margaret has gotten tangled in a web of \n     larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere pawn in \n     this struggle.''\n       The campaign against Morrow began with a Jan. 28 op-ed \n     piece in The Washington Times by Thomas L. Jipping, director \n     of the militantly conservative Free Congress Foundation's \n     Judicial Selection Monitoring Project.\n       Jipping contended that Morrow was likely to become an \n     ``activist judge,'' who improperly would attempt to legislate \n     a political agenda from the bench. Soon, Republican senators \n     John Ashcroft of Missouri and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, both \n     staunch conservatives, new members of the Judiciary Committee \n     and Jipping allies, joined the attack.\n       Since that time, Morrow has been back to the committee for \n     another hearing and answered three sets of questions in \n     writing--including highly unusual questions about her \n     positions on many California ballot initiatives during the \n     past 10 years. She also told the committee she would adhere \n     strictly to precedents and would have no problem applying the \n     death penalty.\n       Last Wednesday, the effort to derail Morrow's nomination \n     escalated. Ashcroft and Sessions announced that they would \n     spearhead further opposition to Morrow and said more than 100 \n     ``grassroots'' organizations, including the National Rifle \n     Assn. and the Traditional Values Coalition, had joined the \n     campaign against her.\n       The coalition was assembled while Ashcroft had placed ``a \n     hold'' on the nomination, which under Senate protocol had \n     prevented it from coming to the floor for a vote. On \n     Wednesday, at a news conference announcing the coalition, he \n     said he now favors a roll-call vote.\n       Ashcroft and Sessions pointedly reminded their colleagues \n     that several organizations in the coalition would be \n     ``scoring'' the votes of senators on the nomination.\n       Morrow's adversaries contend that she would be a ``judicial \n     activist'' on the bench. ``She views the law as an engine for \n     social change . . . and as a means of imposing public policy \n     from the courts on the rest of us,'' Ashcroft asserted.\n       Morrow declined to respond. ``I do not believe it is \n     appropriate for me to comment while my nomination is pending \n     before the Senate,'' she said in a brief telephone interview \n     at week's end.\n       Morrow has previously denied such characterizations. For \n     example, in June 1996, she told the Judiciary Committee: ``I \n     view the role of a judge as being the resolution of disputes \n     that come before . . . him or her for resolution. So I would \n     look to the facts of the case. I would attempt to apply the \n     law as I understand it to those facts. And I would not seek \n     to expand them or otherwise to use any particular case as a \n     reason for articulating new constitutional rights or \n     otherwise expanding what I understand to be the existing \n     law.''\n       Boxer and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the ranking minority \n     member on the Judiciary Committee, came to Morrow's defense \n     last week. Boxer described her as ``the epitome of \n     mainstream'' and Leahy charged that a coalition of \n     conservative activists is using Morrow as ``a fund-raising \n     vehicle'' for their campaign to reduce the power of \n     federal judges.\n       Perhaps more importantly, several staunch Republicans said \n     the accusations against Morrow are ludicrous. ``My party has \n     the wrong woman in their sights,'' declared Sheldon H. Sloan, \n     former president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn. and a \n     close ally of Wilson. ``There is no flag burning for Margaret \n     Morrow,'' said Sloan, describing the nominee as both an \n     outstanding lawyer and ``a church-going, basketball mom.''\n       A large number of prominent Republicans have backed the \n     nominee in writing--highlighted by rare letters of support \n     from three conservative U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals \n     judges--Pamela A. Rymer, Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Stephen S. \n     Trott, State Supreme Court Justice Marvin R. Baxter and state \n     appeals court justices Roger Boren, H. Walter Croskey and \n     Charles S. Vogel, all appointed by Republican governors, also \n     have weighed in on Morrow's behalf, as have Los Angeles Mayor \n     Richard Riordan, then-state\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n\n     Assembly Majority Leader James E. Rogan of Glendale and \n     Orange County Dist. Att. Michael R. Capizzi.\n       In an effort to unclog the nomination, Trott, who earlier \n     served as a high-ranking official in the Justice Department \n     under President Reagan, recently wrote to Senate Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).\n       ``I know you are concerned, and properly so, about the \n     judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench. \n     So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means: \n     follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes. \n     Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I \n     have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a \n     judicial position.''\n       In their letters, some of Morrow's backers have sought to \n     clearly establish their bona fides with conservative \n     senators.\n       ``I am a lifelong Republican from Orange County, \n     California,'' Costa Mesa attorney Andrew J. Guilford wrote \n     Hatch. ``I have never voted for a Democrat in any \n     presidential campaign. . . . I did not believe Anita Hill, I \n     am happy that Justice Clarence Thomas is on our Supreme Court \n     and I regret that [Robert] Bork is not on our Supreme Court. \n     It is partly my concern over the unfair destruction of Judge \n     Bork's judicial career that causes me to enthusiastically \n     endorse Margaret Morrow.''\n       Backers of Morrow cite her intellect, character and record \n     of public service. As president of the Los Angeles County Bar \n     Assn., she instituted a voluntary program urging attorneys to \n     provide at least 35 hours of free legal services yearly for \n     the poor. And she was a member of the commission that drafted \n     an ethics code for Los Angeles city government.\n       Morrow's advocates also assert that her speeches and \n     writings have been distorted beyond recognition by her foes, \n     particularly one sentence in a 1988 article on the initiative \n     process that is cited as prime evidence of her ``activist'' \n     proclivities.\n       In the Los Angeles Lawyer magazine article, Morrow wrote: \n     ``The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature' \n     of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of \n     intelligent voting by a majority.''\n       The article was written in the wake of one of the most \n     expensive initiative campaigns in state history, highlighted \n     by five complicated measures dealing with insurance and \n     attorney's fees. At the time, many charged that that \n     television advertising about the measures was misleading, \n     prompting widespread calls for reform.\n       Morrow's article did not call for abolition of initiatives. \n     The article noted that use of the initiative had escalated \n     dramatically in the 1980s, discussed possible reforms of the \n     initiative and legislative processes and urged lawyers to \n     play a role in improving government.\n       Croskey, an appointee of Deukmejian, said he was stunned \n     that the article was cited as evidence that Morrow would \n     improperly legislate from the bench.\n       ``She was making a profound and useful criticism of the \n     initiative process and how it could be improved,'' Croskey \n     said. ``To metamorphose that into the conclusion that she is \n     a judicial activist has no foundation.''\n       On Friday, Croskey faxed a letter to Lott urging the \n     senator to bring the nomination to the floor for a vote. But \n     it seems unlikely that will happen before Congress adjourns \n     in the next few weeks. Lott, who has the power under Senate \n     procedure to hold up the nomination indefinitely, said a few \n     days ago that he felt no pressure to take any action on \n     judicial nominees during the remainder of the year.\n       The White House declined to comment last week on Morrow's \n     nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11709-6", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11711-S11715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT OF 1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard.). The clerk will report the motion \nto proceed.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows;\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 1269, a bill \n     to establish objectives for negotiating and procedures for \n     implementing certain trade agreements.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate, as I understand it, will be \nvoting in about 50 minutes on the confirmation of a judge. Between now \nand that time, there will be time for debate on the motion to proceed \nto the fast-track legislation, and I intend to take a few minutes of \nthat time. I believe Senator Wellstone will be here as well to speak. I \nwanted to begin, again, discussing this question because there seems to \nbe a substantial amount of misinformation and there is a substantial \nmisimpression by many people about what this debate is.\n  I started yesterday by saying this debate is not about whether we \nshould have free trade or expanded trade or more trade. It is not about \nthat. I think we should have expanded trade. I think we should lower \nbarriers, lower tariffs--in fact, eliminate barriers, lower tariffs, \nand have a world in which we have more opportunity to trade. It's not \nabout those who believe in trade and those who don't. It is a debate \nabout whether our current trade strategy is working for this country. \nDoes the current trade strategy work? Or is this country embarking on a \ntrade strategy and are we in the middle of a trade strategy that, in \nrecent years, has failed us, hurt our economy, injured our \nmanufacturing base, has moved American jobs overseas and put us in a \nweaker position? I happen to think that is the case.\n  I want to go through some of this to describe why I am concerned \nabout not just this fast-track proposal, but our trade policy \ngenerally. Mr. President, this is a chart that shows our net export \nbalance. All of this red below the line represents deficits. We have \nhad the largest net export deficits in the history of this country for \n3 years in a row, and this year will make it the fourth year in a row. \nThese are the largest trade deficits in the history of this country.\n  Now, I would ask the question of those trotting out here supporting \nthe current trade strategy and saying, ``let's again pass fast-track \ntrade authority.'' Is this going in the right direction? Is this the \nright trade strategy? Is this producing the right results? If so, where \ndo you intend to go with this? Do you want to take the chart out here \nand go down to $350 billion a year in net trade deficits, as some are \npredicting will happen? Because if you think this is working, the \nlogical extension of this is larger and larger deficits.\n  We are now the largest debtor nation in the world, and a significant \npart of that debt comes from the contributions of these trade deficits. \nSo if you think the current trade strategy is working real well and you \nlike this chart and you love debt, then you need to be out here saying, \ngee, let's pass fast track and continue doing what we are doing because \nit is really good for this country.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have said before that I used to teach \neconomics, briefly, in college. But I was able to overcome that \nexperience and go on to do other things in life. I am told that in the \nold days in ancient China, those who would travel from one region to \nanother giving advice of the type we now get from economists had to be \ncareful about it. That is because if they gave the wrong advice and \nstuck around the province too long and it was discovered what they had \nsuggested would happen didn't happen, they were boiled, cut in two, or \nput on the sides of two chariots and pulled apart. We have no such \ndilemma posed to the economists of today.\n  Economists of today tell us what they think, for example, on trade. \nThey say if you pass a trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, we will \nsubstantially increase American jobs. We passed a trade agreement with \nCanada and Mexico, called NAFTA, and we lost 395,000 American jobs. \nWhere are the economists who predicted these enormous gains for our \ncountry? They are off predicting the results of fast-track and new \ntrade agreements. It's just fine for them to keep predicting, despite \nthe fact that they are consistently wrong.\n\n  The components of this country's economy are personal consumption--\nyou see where that is. That is personal consumption and expenditures. \nThat is one component. There is gross private domestic investment. \nThen, we have Government expenditures and investments. The fourth \ncomponent of this economy is the balance of net exports. Now, if you \nlook at this chart, is this balance of net exports a net positive or a \nnet negative? This shows red. Why? Because it is a net negative. It is \na drag on our economy. It pulls our economy down, not lifts it up.\n  So when the President or Members of the Senate come to this Chamber \nand say, gee, we are doing so well, we have more exports and we are \ndoing so well, and it boosts our economy, they are dead flat wrong. \nThey would not pass the beginner's course in economics, preaching that \nmessage, because net exports and the current balance of net exports is \na drag on our economy. It is not a contribution to our economy.\n  In fact, yesterday, somebody said, well, since we have negotiated the \nagreement with Mexico under NAFTA, we now get more cars into Mexico \nthat are produced in the United States.\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\n That is true, we do. It is absolutely true. Conclusion: Was it a good \nagreement for our country? No, not at all. While we get a few more cars \ninto Mexico, they send far more cars into the United States. So the net \nbalance of auto trade between the United States and Mexico is \ncompletely out of kilter. In fact, we now import more cars from Mexico \nthan the United States exports to the entire rest of the world. So the \nnext time somebody stands up and talks about automobiles, and talks \nabout what a great deal it is in terms of automobile trade with Mexico, \nI say tell the whole story. If you are describing a checkbook, don't \njust stand here and crow about the deposits. Tell us about the \nwithdrawals. Tell the whole story.\n\n  So, Mr. President, the circumstances of trade are this. We are \ninvolved in a great deal of international trade. I support that. I \ninsist that trade be fair to our country, to our producers, to our \nbusinesses, and to our workers. And, it is not fair. We don't have the \nnerve and will to require it be fair with China, with Japan, with \nMexico--yes, with Canada. That is the problem. The result is huge \ndeficits.\n  This chart shows that the imports of manufactured goods now in this \ncountry equal 51 percent of our total manufacturing in America. Just 16 \nor 18 years ago it was down to about 25 percent of our manufacturing \nbase. Now imports equal over 50 percent of our manufacturing base.\n  Is that moving in the right direction? I don't think so.\n  Here is a chart that shows all of the fast-track authority that we \nhave given Presidents. When the Tokyo round took effect, we had a $28 \nbillion trade deficit at that point. We had fast track for the United \nStates-Canada Free Trade Agreement. When it took effect we had a $115 \nbillion trade deficit. We gave fast track for NAFTA. At that point we \nhad a $166 billion trade deficit. Then we gave fast track to the \nUruguay round. Then, we were up to $173 billion in trade deficits. Now \nwe are at $191 billion in net merchandise trade deficits.\n  It is going to go higher. Do people think we are moving in the right \ndirection? I have no idea what town they grew up in. They think this is \nsuccess. It is not success. It is burdening this country with an \nobligation this country must repay. This country will repay and must \nrepay nearly $2 trillion of accumulated net trade deficits with a lower \nstandard of living in our future. That is not conjecture. It must be \ndone because other people now have claims in the form of American \ndollars against our future.\n  Let me talk for just a moment about one of the more recent \nagreements, the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement. I talked \nabout the descriptions of the NAFTA agreement. I have told previously \nof the folks in ancient Rome who used to predict the future. We now \ncall them economists. They used to call them augurs. It was the \npractice of augury. The practice of augury was to read the flight of \nbirds, and evaluate the entrails of cattle, among other things, in \norder to portend the future. In our country we have economists. They \ntell us, on the one hand, and on the other hand. That is why Harry \nTruman said that he preferred a one-armed economist. Then they could \ntell us with one hand. What did the economists tell us with respect to \nNAFTA? They said if we would pass NAFTA with Canada and Mexico, we \nwould have nearly 400,000--I guess 250,000, first, and some said \n350,000 --new jobs in America. NAFTA was passed. What we lost was \n167,000 jobs to Canada, according to the Economic Policy Institute, and \n227,000 jobs to Mexico.\n  Is that moving in the right direction? Not where I come from. We were \ntold the trade that would come into our country from Mexico would be \nthe product of low-skilled labor. What are the largest imports into the \nUnited States from Mexico? Automobiles, automobile parts, and \nelectronics. That is not the product of low-skilled labor.\n  This last chart shows that the United States has become the world's \nlargest debtor nation. It might not matter to people here. I don't see \npeople coming into the Chamber worried about this. Three or four of us \ntalk from time to time about the growing trade deficit. To most people \nit doesn't seem to matter. They say, ``Look at the cars we send to \nMexico. Isn't that a wonderful thing?''\n  They come here and talk about the deposit slips in their checkbook. \nThey don't talk about the expenditures. The net balance of trade has \nbeen negative for our country, and growing worse. It is causing \nsubstantial trouble in our country. The question is: Will we solve \nthis? Will someone decide this is not good for our country and decide \nto solve it? Need it be solved by starting a trade war? Should it be \nsolved by putting walls around our country and describing ourselves as \nprotectionists? No, I don't think so. That is not the point. That is \nnot what we are here arguing.\n\n  The point we are debating is that those who come here with this \nmantra chant of ``free trade''--just a mantra chant. You are either for \nfree trade, or you are some xenophobic isolationist stooge who doesn't \nunderstand it. You just do not understand what the world has become. \nYou are either for free trade, and you, therefore, understand all of \nthe implications of that, or you just don't get it. You are for free \ntrade, or you are a blatant protectionist, and shame on you. We are \ngoing to call you ``Smoot and Hawley.'' That is the way this debate \nmoves very quickly. Almost, instantaneously, it moves into that kind of \na discussion.\n  The discussion that ought to be among all of is this. We now have the \nlargest merchandise trade deficit in the history of this country. Is it \ngood for this country? The answer is no. The question is, What will we \ndo about it? Does anyone here have a plan to deal with this growing, \nmushrooming trade deficit that hurts this country? Anybody? Has anybody \nheard anybody come to the floor of the Senate who chants this mantra of \nfree trade who says anything about dealing with these mushrooming \ndeficits? Or is it for them just the act of chanting that satisfies \ntheir soul? Is it just the act of chanting that satisfies their desire \nto serve?\n  One would hope that those who come to the floor talking about the \nneed for expanded trade--not with some chant--with some thoughtful \nanalysis of this country's needs would also understand the need for \nbalanced trade and the need for fair trade, and the demand that when we \nsay to our trading partners, ``You are strong, tough, worthy \ncompetitors of ours in the international marketplace, and we demand of \nyou fair free trade.''\n  As a nation, we need to say to China, ``We demand of you that if you \naccess the American marketplace and we will allow you to continue to do \nthat, but when you do it you have a responsibility to this country. \nThat responsibility is to open your marketplace to our goods.'' Don't \ntell us that you want to flood our marketplace with Chinese goods and \nthen keep China's marketplace largely closed to American goods. Don't \ntell us that you want us to be your cash cow for hard currency, China, \nand you want to ship all of your goods to our country. But when it \ncomes time to play by the book and compete, don't displace America as \nthe largest wheat seller to China. That is not what we expect of a \nmutually beneficial trade relationship.\n  We need to say to Japan, ``Don't tell us that you want a $60 billion \na year trade surplus and deficit with us every year as far as the eye \ncan see. Don't tell us you want to access our marketplace and then tell \nus we can't get American goods into yours.''\n  That is not fair trade in any town in this country. And we ought to \nexpect on behalf of the American economy and the American people and \nAmerican workers and producers that we demand fair trade treatment from \nour allies and our trading partners.\n  Canada--we had a free trade agreement with Canada. We had an $11 \nbillion trade deficit with Canada. We passed a free trade agreement. \nNow, the trade deficit has more than doubled.\n  In my part of the country we have a flood of unfairly subsidized \nCanadian grain coming through the borders. It is a virtual flood. It is \nsent to this country by a state trading enterprise called the Canadian \nWheat Board. That would be illegal here in America. It has secret \npricing. No one knows the price. It is sold by a state trading \nenterprise. That is a monopoly enterprise. The result is an avalanche \nof Canadian grain coming in undercutting our market and undercutting \nour farmers. It is patently unfair. And, we can't do a thing about it\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\nbecause it is in the trade agreements that were negotiated with Canada. \nThose negotiations were done in secret, behind closed doors. These \nsecret negotiations pulled the rug out from under our producers. So now \nwhen trade is patently unfair you still cannot stop it.\n  I ask someone to come to the Senate floor today or tomorrow and tell \nus what you propose to do to demand that Canada stop that flood of \nunfairly subsidized grain. What do you propose to do to demand that?\n  What do you propose to do to demand that China open its markets? What \ndo you propose to do to demand China open its markets completely to \nAmerican imports when it buys airplanes made and manufactured in the \nUnited States of America rather than demanding that it wants United \nStates airplanes manufactured in China?\n  What do you intend to do to say to Japan that the trade agreement 10 \nyears ago with them on beef represents the lowest expectations of trade \nbehavior that this country has? We negotiated trade on beef. And even \nour cattlemen jumped for joy because we finally reached an agreement \nwith Japan on beef. Guess what the agreement is? There remains nearly a \n50-percent tariff on all American beef getting into Japan. Is that a \nfair agreement? No. It represents the lowest expectations we have of \nour abilities to require our trading partners to treat us fairly. We \nstill have a nearly 50-percent tariff on American beef going into \nJapan.\n  What on Earth are we doing? Why is this country lacking the nerve and \nthe will to stand up to our trading partners and say to them, ``Here is \na mirror; treat us fairly because we are going to treat you like you \ntreat us?'' From our trade standpoint, our leadership is ready for us \nto say our market is open to you. We lead in the spirit of free and \nfair trade. We lead in the spirit of expanded trade. But, we demand \nmore of our trading partners. We demand that our trading partners \nprovide opportunities to American producers, American businesses, and \nAmerican workers to access your marketplace just as you access ours.\n  Is this all theory? No, it is not all theory. Those who come to the \nfloor and talk about free trade will talk in the abstract all day long. \nBut what this is about is who will have the jobs and the economic \ngrowth and the opportunity 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, and 50 years \nfrom now.\n  I have no quarrel with those who come to the floor of the Senate and \nsay that our future is in global trade. We have a global economy. Our \nfuture requires expansion of trade opportunities. I have no quarrel \nwith those who have read the economic textbooks that describe the \ndoctrine of comparative advantage, and the teachings of Ricardo, and \nothers, who describe a world in which some can more appropriately \nproduce one product and others can more appropriately raise one \ncommodity. To the extent there are natural advantages to each, they \nshould trade with each other. That becomes the doctrine of comparative \nadvantage. Each does what it is their advantage to do and, therefore, \ntrade with each other. I have no quarrel with that.\n  Of course, when Ricardo wrote that, incidentally, there was only \nnation-to-nation trading. There were no corporations when that doctrine \nwas described. It is not the same now when the doctrine is interpreted \nto mean that a comparative advantage is a political advantage rather \nthan a natural advantage, a natural resource advantage, or some sort of \nproduction advantage.\n  What is a political comparative advantage? A political advantage is a \ngovernment over in some recess of the world when it describes the \nconditions of its production as a method of production in which you can \nhire 12-year-olds and pay them 12 cents an hour, and you can dump the \npollution into the air and the water, and you can work the kids in \nunsafe factories. There is a political advantage in which that kind of \nproduction is acceptable and tolerated, and produces the commodities \nthat are then traded in the international marketplace. But, that has \nnothing to do with the doctrine of comparative advantage. Absolutely \nnothing.\n  The question I asked yesterday about trade is one this country needs \nto continue to ask. Is there a requirement for admission to the \nAmerican marketplace which, incidentally, has no substitute on the face \nof this globe. There are more people in other countries. China has far \nmore people than we. But there is no substitute to having access to the \nAmerican marketplace.\n  Is there any admission to the American marketplace? I am not talking \nabout cash, or paying money to access the American marketplace. I ask \nis there an admission price at all? Will the admission price be, for \nexample, a requirement that you not employ 8-year-olds or 10- or 12-\nyear-olds to produce in a production factory and work them 12 hours a \nday and pay them little or nothing?\n  Could we at least start way back right at the first step and say, \n``Well, at least we will not accept the production of prison labor from \na foreign country to come into our country and have the socks that are \nproduced in a foreign prison hanging on a discount wall for sale to the \nAmerican public?''\n  So we must decide what is right. We should not allow the work of \nforeign prisoners to come into our country because clearly that is \nunfair trade. So then let's step up the chain a bit, and ask ourselves: \nIf not from foreign prisons--and I think most of us would agree that is \ncertainly not fair trade--what about foreign factories that hire young \nkids, young children? I mentioned 12-year-olds. How about 8-year-olds? \nHow about 250 million children producing around the world? Is there \nsomething that we find difficult in this country in our trade \nrelationship in saying to another country, ``Look, you have to meet \ncertain standards?''\n  We are not demanding you pay the same minimum wage they pay in \nPittsburgh or Denver. We are not demanding that. But you have to meet \nsome standards in order to access our marketplace because we don't \nbelieve American producers who risk their money to build their plant, \nhire their workers, and then manufacture their goods ought to have to \ncompete against someone who manufactures the same product for one-\nhundredth of the price or one-twentieth of the price because they don't \nhave the responsibility to deal with air pollution and water pollution, \nchild labor laws, and safe workplaces, minimum wages, and all of those \nkind of things.\n  Is there any standard that represents some standard of behavior that \nwe expect in being able to access the American marketplace? Or is this \na circumstance where we have decided that those corporations, the \nlargest in the world who are now international corporations--not \nnational enterprises but international corporations--have decided that \nthe expectation they have of this system is to be able to look at their \ncorporation and evaluate where in this world can they produce most \ncheaply. Where can they produce least expensively? Where can they \nproduce it, and then where can they ship that product to the most \naffluent marketplace and therefore expect maximum profit?\n\n  Is that the construct of this new system, the new global economy? Buy \na Gulfstream; travel around the world; look out the window and find \nwhere could you produce with the least possible expense? What corner is \nit? Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bangladesh? What corner of the world is it \nthat would allow you to take that manufacturing plant that you have in \nIthaca, NY, shut it down, fire the workers, move it overseas, and \nproduce at the least possible cost, paying the least amount of money, \nhaving a factory that has the least compliance with air and water \npollution, no bother about worker safety issues, and so on, no OSHA, \nand then produce the same product and ship it back to Ithaca to be sold \non the hardware store shelf? Is that the construct?\n  I am afraid that is what most of our institutional discussion has \nbeen in this country about, the new global reality. The new global \nreality is we should not worry about what percent of the manufacturing, \nin terms of our consumption, is done in the United States. We should \nnot worry about our manufacturing base. We should not worry about \nwhether we have a strong manufacturing base. What we should worry about \nis consumption. How are we doing as consumers?\n  I suppose we are doing fine as consumers. We have ample credit cards \navailable. In fact, just wait at home today and open your mail box. You \nwill get another invitation for 10 more, preapproved, with substantial \nlimit,\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\nand if you are lucky, you can go to a discount store somewhere and \nprobably buy something that was produced in a country that used kids to \nproduce it, produced it less expensively, and you might--not always, \nbut you might--be able as a consumer to purchase it less expensively at \nthe expense of a diminished manufacturing base in this country, at the \nexpense of a larger trade deficit, and at the expense of a lower \nstandard of living later when this country will have to reconcile these \nhuge and growing trade deficits.\n  Mr. President, let me end where I began. I know Senator Wellstone \nfrom Minnesota is waiting to speak. I started today by asking the \nquestion, can someone come to this Chamber in the next day or so and \nlook at this ocean of red ink, of net trade deficits that are growing \nworse year after year after year, not better--can someone come here \ntoday, someone who thinks we are on the right path, who wants us to \nkeep doing what we are doing and tell me how they believe this \nrepresents success? How do they believe this contributes to this \ncountry's well-being?\n  If they believe, as I do, that this ocean of red ink has made this \ncountry the largest debtor nation on Earth and it is destructive to \nthis country's best interests. Then I say, let's in the coming hours \ntalk about what we can do to fix this and don't tell me more of the \nsame because that's what you are saying: We want more of the same.\n  This is what has happened. We have big, big deficits, getting worse. \n``Let's keep doing more of the same,'' they say. I say, let's change. \nLet's expect more and demand more of our trading partners. Let's have \nopen foreign markets. Let's have the nerve and the will to stand up for \nthis country's economic interests, and let's not move quickly to the \nthoughtless debate that this is between those who support free trade \nand those who do not.\n  That is not what this is about. It is about those of us who believe \nthis country has an abiding and growing trade problem and is choking on \ntrade deficits and must stand up and do something about it for this \ncountry's sake and those who believe things are just fine and we ought \nto keep doing more of what we have been doing. That is what the debate \nis about.\n  I will have more to say. Let me yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from North \nDakota for his very important leadership in what is really a historic \ndebate.\n\n  Let me say at the beginning that I don't think this is a debate where \ntwo positions are either we have walls that we put on the border of our \ncountry or we are involved in an international economy. We are a part \nof an international economy.\n  That's a false dichotomy. The question is, Are there any rules that \ngo with this?\n  Let me, first of all, start out with one of the major reasons I \noppose the motion to proceed to S. 1269, this reciprocal trade \nagreement of 1997.\n  I oppose it on the principle of democracy and representative \naccountability alone. I am opposed to fast track for that reason alone. \nIt seems to me that we ought to understand that what we are talking \nabout is a trade agreement which will crucially affect the quality or \nlack of quality of lives of the people that all of us represent, that \nwill affect our domestic laws, everything in the world to do with wage \nlevels, with consumer protection, with environmental protection, and it \nis difficult for me to understand how we could surrender our rights as \nSenators to an unlimited debate and the right to amendments to an \nimportant piece of legislation, indeed, to some legislation that will \ncome before us, other agreements that will come before us up to the \nyear 2001 that we have not even seen. Before we have even seen these \nagreements, we are supposed to agree to a procedure whereby we can't \ncome to the floor and fight for the people we represent, we can't come \nto the floor and try to improve a trade agreement and make it work \nbetter for working families in our States. I would oppose this \nagreement just on this principle alone.\n  S. 1269 would lock us into fast-track rules for debates and votes \nthat we are going to be taking later on in the Congress. This will lock \nus in until the year 2001. That is the duration of the bill's \nprovisions. So what we are deciding right now is whether or not we are \ngoing to establish highly restrictive rules which will govern our \ndebate and votes later on implementing bills for agreements, the \ncontents of which we do not know at this time.\n  That is profoundly antidemocratic. On the principle of democracy, on \nthe principle of being here to represent people in Minnesota, I would \noppose this fast-track legislation just on this idea alone.\n  Let's talk a little bit about what could happen between now and 2001. \nWe could bring Chile into NAFTA. It may be good; it may not be good. We \ncould broaden what we call NAFTA to include additional countries in \nLatin America and the Caribbean, turning NAFTA eventually into a free-\ntrade area for the Americas, FTAA. We could look to the Asian Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation Forum, and we could negotiate these privileges as \nwell, which could be NAFTA-like privileges, vis-a-vis countries in \nAsia. We might complete a worldwide multilateral agreement on \ninvestment which would be called the NIA. We could do all of these \nthings.\n  But the point is that under this provision, if we enter into these \nagreements up until the year 2001, all of this will come to the floor \nof the Senate with an expedited procedure. No amendments will be in \norder and there will be a limited number of hours. How can we as \nSenators represent consumers in our States, how can we represent \nworking families in our States, how can we be out here fighting for \ndecent jobs and decent wages, how can we, for that matter, represent \npeople in other countries who want to see their standard of living \nlifted, not depressed, and at the same time agree to these kinds of \nagreements--we don't even know what will be in them--with this \nprocedure that there will be limited debate and no amendments.\n  This is a basic principle of democracy. I say to my colleagues we \nshould not vote for this fast-track procedure because it denies us the \nability to be out here representing the people in our States. That is \nwhat fast track is all about--an up-or-down vote on a giant bill which \nhas a critical impact on numerous laws, these laws having a dramatic \nimpact on the quality or lack of quality of life of the people we \nrepresent. That is one of the reasons I opposed NAFTA and one of the \nreasons I opposed the creation of the WTO as well.\n\n  Let me point out that one administration official testified last year \nthat negotiators had effectively concluded 200 trade agreements since \nPresident Clinton took office in 1993--nearly 200 trade agreements--and \nonly two of those utilized fast-track procedures. So if trade \nagreements can be so readily reached without the benefit of fast track, \nthen I question the need to impose these kinds of procedures which are \ninherently undemocratic. They shorten the debate. We cannot come out \nhere with amendments. We cannot come out here to represent people in \nour States the way we should. Therefore, I would oppose this, and I \nhope my colleagues will as well.\n  This whole idea of trade policy, which is so important, is supposed \nto be good for all of us, including consumers. Have the representatives \nof consumer groups been involved in this discussion? Certainly \ncorporations and various economic sectors have helped to decide what \nour goals are, which is appropriate. But how about consumers? Consumers \nmight be worried about downward harmonization of standards. Consumers \nmight be worried about food safety standards and how this will affect \ntheir children. They might be worried about or oppose in principle \ndeplorable child labor conditions in other countries. They might be \nworried about or oppose in principle deplorable violations of human \nrights of people in other countries.\n  Consumers, the people we represent, may say, look, we would like to \nmake sure that this is a part of a trade agreement. But the position \nthe administration has taken in fast track is that these concerns are \nexcluded as trade objectives. But they probably would be included as \nobjectives if we had a more democratic process for negotiating and \nconsidering trade agreements.\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\n  What I am trying to say is it becomes, I think, a Catch-22. If we as \nSenators are going to say, ipso facto, we give approval to any number \nof different trade agreements up through the year 2001, the provisions \nof which we do not even know about yet, then quite clearly what we are \nsaying is we will not be able to come out here with amendments to \nprotect consumers and working families, in which case I think we are \ngoing to get the same response from the administration, which is we \nwill not make these agreements part of a trade agreement, basic \nprotection on fair labor standards, on consumer protection, on \nenvironmental protection.\n  I think that is the tragic mistake we will be making if we approve \nfast track.\n  My second reason for opposing the motion to proceed is that I am not \nat all confident--in fact, unfortunately, I am quite certain--that as \nopposed to improving the standard of living and the quality of life for \na majority of Americans, these trade agreements will have precisely the \nopposite effect.\n  Let me also say that I am equally concerned about trade agreements \nthat will lead to an improvement of the quality of life and living \nstandards of people in other countries. I am all for trade agreements \nthat lead to an improvement of the standard of living of people in our \ncountry and people in other countries. I am not in favor of a trade \nagreement that ends up not being global village but global pillage, \nwhere what you have instead is a systematic violation of the rights of \nchildren, of basic human rights, of basic fair labor standards and of \nbasic environmental standards leading to profits for the few large \nmultinational corporations and misery for way too many people \nthroughout the world.\n  Mr. President, we have had extensive debate on NAFTA, which was \napproved, and also extensive debate on the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade, which ultimately led to the creation of the World Trade \nOrganization, the WTO. I voted against implementing these trade \nagreements because I was concerned that these trade agreements would \nnot take our country in the right direction. Now, as I think about it, \nI am afraid that the empirical evidence supports this view as well.\n  Let me say again, I didn't oppose NAFTA or WTO because I am a \nprotectionist. I am an internationalist. I don't have any interest in \nbuilding walls on the borders of our country to keep out goods and \nservices. Nor do I fear fair competition from workers and companies \noperating in other countries. I am not afraid of our neighbors. I don't \nfear other countries nor their people. I am in favor of open trade, and \nI believe the President should negotiate trade agreements which lead, \ngenerally, to more open markets here and abroad.\n  Indeed, I am aware of the benefits of trade for the economy of \nMinnesota, and I am told about that constantly. We have an extremely \ninternationally minded community of corporations, larger companies, \nsmall businesses, working people and farmers in our State. And we have \ndone relatively well in this international economy. I am very proud of \nMinnesota's performance in this international economy.\n  We have lost some jobs to trade, as have most States, but we have \nalso benefited from trade. We benefit both from the exports and the \nimports: The exports create the jobs, as we all know, but the imports \nare not necessarily a bad thing. They provide the competition for \nconsumers and they can push our own domestic companies to do better, to \nbe more productive and to be more efficient. Open trade can contribute \nsignificantly to the expansion of wealth and opportunity, and it can \nreward innovation and productivity. It can deliver higher quality goods \nand services at better prices.\n  So, what I am saying is not that we should not be involved in \ninternational trade, not that our country doesn't have a major role--we \nhave a major role and play a major role in the international economy. \nBut what I am saying is that the Congress should exercise its proper \nrole in regulating trade, which is what trade agreements do, so that \nthe rules of this international trade reflect American values. That is \nhow America can lead in the world and it is how America should lead in \nthe world.\n  What American values are we talking about when it comes to trade? \nWhat are the American values when it comes to trade? We believe in open \nmarkets at home and abroad. But we also think there is a role for \nGovernment to play, especially when it comes to the protection of \nfundamental labor rights for working women and men, when it comes to \nthe protection of children in the labor force, when it comes to \nenvironmental standards, when it comes to food and other consumer \nprotections. These are important values in our country. When it comes \nto fundamental standards dealing with human rights and when it comes to \ndemocracy, these are important American values. The question is, how \ncan we pursue these values when we are negotiating trade agreements?\n  The Clinton administration believes that the commercial issues are \nprimarily in the body of the trade agreements, which are enforceable \nwith trade sanctions, and that the environmental and the labor rights \nissues and the human rights issues are secondary. A majority of the \nSenate appears to agree. I do not, and I don't believe most Americans \nagree with the President and the majority of the Senate on this \nquestion. I believe, and I think most Americans believe, that \nfundamental standard-of-living and quality-of-life issues are exactly \nwhat trade policy should be all about. That is why strong and \nenforceable labor rights, environmental and consumer protections belong \ndirectly in the agreements themselves. And if trade agreements do not \nhelp to uphold democracy and respect for human rights, then they are \ndeficient. That is my position and, as we enter the 21st century, these \nshould be the pillars of American leadership in the world.\n  At the same time we are told that America must lead on the issue of \ntrade, we are also told that if we don't negotiate trade agreements, \neven ones that do not live up to our own principles, then other \ncountries will do so with each other in our absence; we will be left \nout. That is what we are told. What a contradiction. We must lead but \nwe must do so by weakening our values, by leaving enforcement of labor \nrights out of agreements we negotiate, by leaving protection of the \nenvironment out of agreements we negotiate, by surrendering our \nprincipal linkage of human rights concerns to trade policy.\n  Are we saying that when it comes down to it, that money is basically \nall that matters? Is that how America should lead the world? Not in my \nview. Our trade policy should seek to create fair trading arrangements \nwhich lift up the standards of people in all nations. It should foster \ncompetition based on productivity, quality, and rising living \nstandards--not competition based on exploitation and a race to the \nbottom.\n  As one Minnesotan, Larry Weiss, wrote in our State's largest \nnewspaper earlier this week, ``What we want is a global village, not \nglobal pillage.'' Protection of basic labor and environmental and food \nsafety standards are just as important and just as valid as any other \ncommercial or economic objective sought by the U.S. negotiators in \ntrade agreements. We need to be encouraging good corporate citizenship, \nnot the flight of capital and the dissemination of good-paying jobs \nfrom the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Gwin to be a U.S. district \ncourt judge for the northern district of Ohio.\n  Since 1989, Judge Gwin has served as a judge for the Court of Common \nPleas in Stark County, OH. Three times during his judgeship, Judge Gwin \nhas been elected administrative judge by his peers, and in 1995, he was \nelected presiding judge. In addition to his legal service, Judge Gwin \nhas volunteered for several organizations, including the North Central \nOhio Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and the Central Stark County Mental \nHealth Center. His nomination enjoys the strong bipartisan support of \nSenator Glenn and Senator DeWine.\n  Despite his exemplary record, one or more of my colleagues on the \nmajority has again demanded a rollcall vote on a judicial nomination. \nThat is, of course, the right of any Senator and I do not object. \nIndeed, I welcome the vote. I expect this rollcall vote to be much like \nthe last eight in which a unanimous Senate approves a well-qualified \njudicial nomination. I congratulate Judge Gwin and his family on this \nachievement and look forward to his service on the U.S. district court.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Under unanimous consent, the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, it is the role of national governments \nto establish the rules within which companies and countries trade. That \nis what trade agreements do. They set strict rules. If, for example, a \ncountry does not enforce respect for patents, trade sanctions can be \ninvoked.\n  Mr. President, you can bet that U.S. companies get right in the face \nof our negotiators to make sure that the rules in these agreements \nwhich protect their interests are ironclad and will be strictly \nenforced. That is what companies do. You can be absolutely sure that \nU.S. companies would laugh in the face of negotiators if they were told \nthat their concerns were legitimate but could be pursued just as \nseriously in less enforceable side agreements.\n  My point, Mr. President, is that it is fine to represent the \ninterests of the companies. We should do so. But we are also elected to \nrepresent other people in our country, not just large multinational \ncorporations. We are elected to represent the majority of people.\n  I say, Mr. President, that we should take a very strong interest not \nonly in representing the majority of people in our country but also in \nrepresenting a lot of people, ordinary citizens, wage earners, ordinary \npeople in the countries we trade with. Because if they do not make \nenough money to demand the products that we produce, then we are not \ngoing to do well.\n  Mr. President, I think this fast-track agreement, which extends on to \nNAFTA and GATT, is deeply skewed toward large corporate interests. That \nhas been our recent experience with trade agreements. And I want to \ntalk a little bit about what has happened with NAFTA.\n  NAFTA has been in operation for 3 years. And we heard a lot about \nwhat NAFTA was going to do for all of us. We have an opportunity now to \nlook at the results with NAFTA. They include loss of jobs, suppression \nof wages, and the weakening of food, safety, and pollution laws.\n\n  Mr. President, if we repeat these mistakes, we are only going to \ncondemn ourselves to replicate some of NAFTA's worst measurable \nconsequences. Let me draw for colleagues from a respected Economic \nPolicy Institute report. This report was issued in September of this \nyear and titled ``NAFTA and the States: Job Destruction is \nWidespread.'' EI's study concluded that ``an exploding deficit in net \nexports with Mexico and Canada has eliminated 394,835 U.S. jobs since \nNAFTA took effect in 1994.'' The report argues that this job loss \ncontributed significantly to a 4-percent decline in real median wages \nin the United States since 1993. Minnesota, according to this report, \nlost about 6,500 jobs due to the NAFTA-related trade deficit between \n1993 and 1996, contributing to about a 3.8 percent drop in real median \nwages.\n  Mr. President, last month the Institute for Policy Studies and United \nfor a Fair Economy published a study which tracked the performance and \nactions of a number of companies which belong to a major corporate \ncoalition which is advocating passage of fast track. The study found \nthat the 40 companies which are members of the America Leads on Trade \ncoalition, from whom all of our offices have received pro-fast-track \nmaterials regularly, cut jobs in 89 U.S. plants under NAFTA. The study \nalso documents that almost 13,000 workers who were laid off by members \nof this coalition, America Leads on Trade, qualified for NAFTA \nretraining assistance. And while jobs were being cut by these firms, \nthese firms' profits soared and the salaries of their CEO's were \nsignificantly higher than those of executives in other leading firms.\n  Mr. President, again, looking at the record with NAFTA, according to \nPublic Citizen in a report released in September of this year, U.S. \nfood imports have skyrocketed while U.S. inspections of imported food \nhave declined significantly. The report charges that ``imports of \nMexican crops documented by the U.S. Government to be at high risk of \npesticide contamination have dramatically increased under NAFTA, while \ninspection has decreased.''\n  Mr. President, our experience with NAFTA can't be dismissed. Jobs and \nwages in the United States have gone down. We have this paradox over \nthe last 20 years of workers' productivity going up but real wages \ngoing down. Wages have gone down in Mexico, too,\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\ndespite the fact that some workers in Mexico are performing high-skill, \nhigh-productivity labor. Our trade balance has dramatically worsened \nwith respect to Mexico. This is all in the last 3 years, post-NAFTA \nagreement, and the number of U.S. firms that have not only relocated to \nMexico but just as importantly have threatened to relocate to Mexico \nhave effectively held wages down. Mr. President, this is a classic \ntactic used in any effort to organize--companies just simply saying, \n``We will go to Mexico.''\n  Violations of fundamental democratic rights--we care about those \nrights--as well as basic human and labor rights continue to occur \nregularly in Mexico. And a NAFTA side agreement has not significantly \nimproved Mexico's environment--the environment degradation goes on at \nthe Maquiladoras--nor have they done anything to raise the wages or \nliving standards of the people. When I visited the Maquiladora I \nthought the environmental degradation was horrifying. I could not \nbelieve little children that I saw working in the plants. When I talked \nto people, they were quite often terrified to even talk to a U.S. \nSenator for fear of losing their job.\n  Mr. President, I simply will say it one more time, we should be \nengaged in trade agreements, we should be a vital part of an \ninternational economy, and we are, but we can do it without injuring \npeople in communities in our country and we can do it without injuring \npeople in communities in other countries if we have the inclusion of \nenforceable labor rights and environmental provisions right in the \nagreements themselves. We don't have any like that in this fast-track \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, I said at the beginning that I wouldn't support this \nagreement on the principle of democracy alone. To lock ourselves into \ntrade agreements up to the year 2001--other countries in Latin America, \nCaribbean countries, Asian countries--without even knowing what those \nagreements will entail, to not be able to come out here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate and introduce amendments to fight for people in your \nState or South Carolina or Iowa or Washington or any other State, I \nthink denies us as Senators what is really the most cherished and I \nthink most sacred responsibility we have, which is the responsibility \nto be out here fighting for people.\n  These trade agreements affect the quality of life of people in \nMinnesota and all across the country. I believe that in the absence of, \nas a part of this trade agreement, clear fair labor standards and \nenvironmental standards and human rights standards, these trade \nagreements will continue to do exactly what NAFTA has done--depress the \nliving standards of people in the United States and people in other \ncountries, lead to further violation of human rights in other \ncountries, not do one positive thing about environmental degradation, \nand ultimately it will be a good deal for large multinational \ncorporations and a very bad deal for the people in Minnesota and the \npeople across the country.\n  Mr. President, by way of conclusion, I oppose this agreement because \nof the fast-track procedure alone. I think it is profoundly \nantidemocratic. I oppose it because of the empirical evidence that has \ncome in about NAFTA. It is quite clear to me this will lead to a \ndepressing of living standards of people in our country and people in \nother countries. And finally, Mr. President, I oppose this agreement \nnot because I am not an internationalist. I am the son of a Jewish \nimmigrant from Russia. I am an internationalist. We are in an \ninternational economy. I want our country to lead the way. But I want \nthe United States of America to lead the way as an economic power in \nthis international economy by advocating our values. Our values respect \nhuman dignity, our values respect human rights, our values respect \nprotecting children's lives, our values respect the environment, and \nour values respect fair labor working conditions for people. That is \nwhat is lacking in this agreement. That is why I am in such profound \nopposition to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support fair trade because trading \ncreates jobs in America. A billion dollars worth of trade creates \n18,000 jobs. Those jobs pay 15 percent above the national average of \njobs in America. In my State of Iowa, corporations that export pay 32 \npercent higher benefits than corporations that don't export. If we are \ngoing to continue to grow as a Nation, we are going to have to be able \nto export more to create good paying jobs in America.\n  Why do we, from time to time as a Congress, give the President \nauthority to negotiate trade agreements? The power to regulate \ninterstate and foreign commerce is very clearly a power given to the \nCongress by the Constitution. It is one of the 17 explicit powers \nmentioned in the Constitution. Congress guards its constitutional \nauthority very carefully.\n  But we have found that it is very difficult for Congress, made up of \n535 men and women, to negotiate with 132 different countries who are \npart of the GATT process. Congress, for the large part, can't even \nnegotiate agreements among its own Members a lot of times. So you can \nsee the difficulty of Congress as a body reaching an agreement with \nforeign countries on how to reduce barriers.\n  So from time to time under very strict guidelines we delegate some of \nour negotiating authority to the President. But we don't do it in a \nwilly-nilly fashion. We do it with safeguards to make sure that \nCongress' constitutional power to regulate interstate and foreign \ncommerce is protected. And we do it for a short period of time. We also \nkeep the power to deny the President the ability to negotiate with a \nspecific country, if we don't want the President to do that. We make \nsure that the President and his people consult with Congress on a very \nregular basis so that we know what is going on, but more important, so \nthe negotiators know what Congress wants negotiated or doesn't want \nnegotiated to ensure the negotiations reflect the will of Congress. \nThen, obviously, nothing can become the law of our Nation if it is not \npassed by the Congress of the United States and signed by the President \nof the United States.\n\n  So we are very cautious in giving the power to negotiate. But we do \nit for two reasons: First, it is very impractical for Congress to \nnegotiate with foreign countries, and quite frankly it is something \nthat the President does on a regular basis on a lot of foreign policy \nissues. But more important we have seen opportunities for America's \neconomic expansion happen because we have reduced barriers to trade \nsince World War II. We have a track record of knowing our economy can \nexpand when we export. We have a track record of knowing that jobs are \ncreated if we export. And we have a track record of knowing that those \njobs that do export pay very good wages.\n  So we start with the proposition that we want to have an expanding \neconomy, that we want to create jobs and we want to create good jobs \nbecause that has been the track record of expanding foreign trade over \nthe last 50 years. We move forward with confidence, giving this \nPresident, as we have given Republican and Democrat Presidents in the \npast, the authority to negotiate trade agreements. And we are confident \nthat the workers and consumers of America will benefit as a result of \ngiving the President this negotiating authority.\n  We have seen barriers to trade around the world reduced from an \naverage of 40 percent 50 years ago to an average of 5 percent today. \nThose are tariff figures. We have seen still, countries have higher \nbarriers to trade--both tariff and nontariff trade barriers--than what \nwe have in the United States. They are up here and we are down here. So \nit is a given. It is common sense, the extent to which the President \ncan get these other countries to reduce their tariff and nontariff \nbarriers to trade to a level equal to or closer to ours, it levels the \nplaying field for our people, both large and small business, and that \nwill create opportunities to export and enhance the economic well-being \nof our country.\n  So I rise strongly in support of S. 1269, the Reciprocal Trade \nAgreement Act of 1997, and I urge my colleagues to vote aye on further \nmotions to proceed and to take up the bill. Mr. President,\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\nthis debate is long overdue. The President has lacked the authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements since the completion of the Uruguay round \nagreements in 1994.\n  Since then, the United States has, as far as I am concerned, \nrelinquished its leadership role that we have had over the last 50 or \n60 years in international trade issues. And the rest of the world will \nnot wait for a long period of time for the United States to act but \nwill move on without us.\n  This bill will restore the United States to its rightful position as \nthe world's leader in international trade. If nothing else, it's going \nto reassert the moral authority of the United States to be a leader in \nfair trade negotiations around the world, as we have been for the last \n60 years.\n  Since the original reciprocal trade agreements of 1934, the United \nStates has taken this leadership role in reducing barriers to trade. We \nlearned from the Smoot-Hawley legislation, we learned from the Great \nDepression of the 1930's, and we learned from the results of World War \nII that protectionism is not only bad economically, it's bad from the \nstandpoint of promoting peace throughout the world. As I said, in the \nperiod of time since the United States started this process of reducing \nbarriers to trade--not only our own barriers, but other barriers in \nother countries--we have seen global tariffs drop from an average of \nover 40 percent to about 4 or 5 percent today. This dramatic opening of \nworld markets has led to an explosion of economic growth since World \nWar II, and the United States has been the primary beneficiary of this \ngrowth.\n  American workers are the most productive, highest paid workers in the \nworld. American companies produce the highest quality products, and \nAmerican consumers have more choices of goods and pay less of their \nincome on necessities, such as food, than consumers anywhere else in \nthe world. These are the benefits of fair trade agreements.\n  Americans have enjoyed these benefits only because, through U.S. \nleadership, we have convinced other countries that freeing up trade and \nleveling the playing field for everybody is critical to economic \ngrowth, not only in our country, but around the world. And we have led \nby example. We have lowered our own tariffs to show our willingness to \ntrade with the rest of the world, and to show that trade is beneficial \nto workers as well as consumers and not something to be feared. This \nbill reestablishes the United States in this leadership role.\n  This bill will allow the United States to continue on the path of \neconomic growth and prosperity, and will show the way for other \ncountries as well. Free and fair trade creates jobs--stable, high-\npaying jobs. Exports support more than 11 million jobs in our country. \nThese jobs, as I have said before, pay 15 percent higher wages than \nother jobs. In my own State, exporting companies have 32 percent higher \nbenefits than nonexporting corporations.\n  Trade is a major component of the economic growth of even the most \nrecent decade. It is estimated that exports, as a share of gross \ndomestic product, grew by 39 percent and accounted for nearly 50 \npercent of the total U.S. economic growth between the years 1986 and \n1992. This year, total U.S. trade will be 30 percent of our total GDP. \nThese statistics show that trade is important to this country. It's \nimportant to the well-being of our economy.\n  This bill will allow the United States to maintain its competitive \nadvantage in the global economy. Trade negotiating authority is \nnecessary to remove barriers to our exports and, hopefully, some day \nremove all remaining barriers to our exports. These barriers are taking \nmoney out of the pockets of American farmers and workers. But without \nthis bill, the rest of the world will continue to raise barriers to our \nproducts. We will remain on the sidelines--where we have basically been \nsince 1994.\n  Since trade negotiating authority expired back then, over 20 major \ntrade agreements have been consummated. The United States was not a \nparty to any of them. Do the opponents of this bill believe that other \ncountries are looking out for the interests of the United States when \nnegotiating these agreements? We had an opportunity to be at the table. \nOf course, nobody is going to look out for the interests of the United \nStates, except our U.S. negotiators. We in the Congress are going to \nsee that they look out for those interests. We can deny the President's \nauthority to negotiate with a specific country. We will consult with \nthe President of the United States on a regular basis on how those \nnegotiations are going, and advise the President on what should be \nnegotiated. Finally, we have an opportunity to enact the final product \nof any negotiations.\n\n  Now, I said that we have had 20 agreements negotiated, where the \nUnited States was not a party. But I can show in some of those \nnegotiations where U.S. economic interests--and maybe humanitarian and \nnonpolitical interests, or political interests have also been hurt.\n  Chile is a good example of what we have sacrificed by not having \ntrade negotiating authority. In 1992, President Clinton promised Chile \nthat it would be part of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Five \nyears later, Chile has a free trade agreement with Canada and with \nMexico--the other two partners of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement--but not with the United States. Chile is an associate member \nof the MERCOSUR countries, which is a trading block composed of Brazil, \nArgentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Yet, Chile is still not a member of \nNAFTA. You might say, so what; you don't like NAFTA and you are \napplauding. But in the process, American workers and farmers are \nbeginning to feel the consequences of this inaction.\n  An American company recently lost a $200 million telecommunication \ncontract to a Canadian company that enjoys preferential treatment under \nits trade agreement with Chile.\n  American farmers currently supply 90 percent of Chile's free grain \nimports. Those are exports from states like Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, \nand Illinois. But our biggest competitors for this market, Argentina \nand Brazil, enjoy an 11-percent tariff advantage over American farmers. \nAnd whether or not we are going to continually supply feed grains to \nChile--it is only a matter of time before we lose this important \nagricultural market. What will the opponents of this legislation say to \nthe farmers of their State and the workers of their State when these \nworkers and these farmers lose their jobs and lose income because this \nmarket is lost because we have an 11-percent disadvantage? This bill \nallows us to compete for these markets once again.\n  The economic benefits of trade negotiating authority are very clear. \nBut let's remember that trade is also an important foreign policy \ninitiative. Free and fair trade is humanitarian, as well as it is \neconomic. Free and fair trade promotes liberty and freedom around the \nworld. This bill is going to help increase the standard of living of \nour trading partners and, with it, enhance the stability of their \npolitical and economic systems. And when you enhance the political and \neconomic systems, you open the door, through trade, for the United \nStates to export its democratic principles of liberty and freedom. We \nare seeing enhancement of these institutions in countries where freedom \nand liberty was foreign to a lot of people. Economic intercourse opens \nthe way, opens the door; it is a window of opportunity for other things \nthat we in America believe in, which you can't put a dollar and cents \nvalue on. We know that when Americans travel overseas, when we enhance \nour business opportunities with other countries, this sort of rubbing \nshoulders with people of other countries has benefits that go way \nbeyond just the dollars and cents of free and fair trade.\n  The people we trade with experience American values through the goods \nthey purchase and the relationships they form when trading with us. In \ntime, it is likely that they will insist that their own government \nuphold these values as well. We have seen it happen in Latin America, \nEastern Europe, and someday--I am optimistic--we will see it happen in \nChina.\n  Many scholars believe that a country must attain a certain standard \nof living and economic stability before democracy can even begin. \nTrade, and not foreign aid, is the mutually preferred method of \nachieving economic growth and economic stability, which is a forerunner \nof political stability.\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\n  Since 1986, I have hosted, on six different occasions during the \nmonth of August in my State, week-long tours of Iowa by foreign embassy \nambassadors. In other words, the embassies here in Washington, DC, send \ntheir ambassadors and/or trade representatives. I hear from these \npeople coming to my State of Iowa, again and again, from these \ninternational guests, that a mutually beneficial and healthy trade \nrelationship is much preferred over foreign aid from the U.S. \nGovernment. While foreign aid can be fleeting, trade builds and expands \neconomies. This, in turn, fuels the democratization process. So this \nbill helps our trading partners help themselves.\n  Mr. President, the opponents of this bill want to turn back the \nclock. They prefer a time when this country could afford to be \nisolationist, when we could consume all in America that we produce, and \nwe didn't have to worry about exports, and when economic growth could \nbe sustained then by domestic production alone.\n\n  Reminiscing about those past days may make for good political \nrhetoric. But that sort of rhetoric is dangerous because it simply \nignores the economic facts of today's world. They ignore the benefits \nbeyond economics that come from trade. Because, like it or not, we are \nin a global economy. Our jobs and standards of living have become to \nsome degree dependent on trade with other countries. We can't afford to \nbuild walls around this country, and we can't afford to turn inward. If \nthe United States were to do that, other countries would do it as well. \nAnd that could be dangerous. I just saw a quote recently, that I \nbelieve to be accurate. ``If merchandise is not going to cross borders, \nsoldiers will.'' It is a preventive of war. It is a promotion of peace \nwhen we trade.\n  We must lead. We still have all the advantages: A highly skilled, \neducated work force; we have technology, capital, and, most important, \na sense of entrepreneurship that not only benefits America, but when \nthis is promoted around the world, it is going to benefit all of the \neconomies of the world. We also have the most stable economic and \npolitical system the world has ever known. The United States has the \nmost to gain by leading and the most to lose by sitting on the \nsidelines.\n  This bill is the first step back into reasserting our moral authority \nto lead in leveling the playing field in international trade, an \nauthority that we have exercised since the 1930's.\n  Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues that the question is \nnot whether future trade negotiations will occur. They are happening \nright now under our very noses between countries all over the world. I \nhave cited 20 specific examples since 1992. Rather, the question is \nwhether the United States will be at the negotiating table protecting \nthe interests of our citizens for the good of this country and for the \ngood of the world.\n  This legislation must become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support free trade between the United \nStates and other countries.\n  Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use from the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is speaking on the time of the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support free trade between the United \nStates and other countries. I have supported fast-track authority in \nthe past, and I wish I could still do so.\n  But this fast-track bill is grossly one-sided and unfair. It goes the \nextra mile to protect intellectual property rights and other rights of \nbusiness. Yet it puts major roadblocks in front of any effort to \nprotect the rights of workers.\n  The bill lists 15 so-called principal negotiating objectives. \nNegotiators are directed to pursue these matters vigorously in trade \ntalks with other nations. One of the objectives urges negotiators to \nseek strict enforcement of laws protecting copyrights, patents, and \nintellectual property. The bill even directs negotiators to seek \ncriminal penalties for violations of intellectual property rights.\n  But the bill is silent about any corresponding effort to promote \nworkers' rights. Negotiators are forbidden to encourage other countries \nto improve worker protections. Any provisions designed to strengthen \nlabor protections or improve another country's enforcement of its labor \nprotections cannot be given fast-track treatment.\n  No previous fast-track bill took such a one-sided and discriminatory \napproach. For example, the 1988 fast-track law included a specific \nobjective to ``promote worker rights,'' and this was an important part \nof the legislation.\n  The present bill is unprecedented. It's fast-track for business and \nno track for labor, and that isn't fair.\n  We should not make it impossible to use other countries' desire for \naccess to U.S. markets to urge improvements in working conditions. \nLeaders in other countries often say their door is open to such \ninitiatives. But this bill actually prevents our negotiators from \ntaking advantage of such opportunities. It prevents the United States \nfrom using the incentive of access to our markets to persuade a country \nto improve working conditions for its employees, even in cases where \nthe issue is prison labor or child labor. There is nothing fair about \nthat.\n  The bill also prohibits fast-track consideration of any provision \nthat would modify U.S. labor or environmental standards. Any agreement \nthat seeks to create internationally-recognized worker rights--such as \na ban on child labor or prison labor--could not be considered under \nfast-track procedures, because it would restrict the power of the \nUnited States to refuse unilaterally to modify our own laws in these \nareas. There is nothing fair about that.\n  The bill denies our negotiators the power to push for improvements in \nanother country's labor protections. And it denies our negotiators the \npower to push for improvements on a multi-national basis as well. Under \nthis legislation, there could be no effort to improve worker \nprotections in any forum. There is nothing fair about that.\n  Congress should not handcuff our ability to negotiate improvements in \nagreements setting basic labor standards that apply to specific nations \nor to all nations. Instead, we should use the trend toward \nglobalization of markets to raise the level of employee protections \naround the world.\n  We tried to accomplish this goal in the North American Free Trade \nAgreement in 1993. The labor and environmental side agreements that \naccompanied NAFTA were designed to strengthen labor standards and \nestablish a forum for resolving disputes.\n  Many have criticized the effectiveness of these side agreements, and \nwith good reason. In 1994, Mexican workers who tried to organize a \nunion at a Sony Corp. plant in Nuevo Laredo were fired, and some were \nbeaten. This brutality violated Mexican law, and the NAFTA enforcement \nauthorities found that the Mexican Government had failed to comply with \nits obligations under the labor side agreement. But none of the \nemployees was rehired, and no fines were assessed against either the \nMexican Government or the company. The side agreements were not \nenforced.\n  Weak as they are, side agreements like these are barred from \nconsideration under the present bill. Such side agreements could not be \ngiven fast-track treatment. They would be subject to full debate and \namendment in both houses of Congress.\n  But under this defective fast-track bill, an agreement making it a \ncrime to infringe a copyright would be given fast-track treatment, and \nrushed through Congress with limited debate and without amendment.\n  This double standard is unacceptable. Trade affects goods and \nbusiness profits, but it affects workers' lives and health as well. We \ncan't deny the linkage. Yet this bill treats property rights far better \nthan it does labor and environmental protections. Surely the life or \nhealth of a working man or woman deserves at least equal priority.\n  It's also true that NAFTA has failed to live up to our hopes. The \nLabor Department has certified that 127,000 American workers lost their \njobs as a direct result of trade with Mexico and Canada under NAFTA. \nSome experts say the number may be as much as four times higher.\n  The administration has announced that it will seek hundreds of \nmillions\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\nof dollars more for trade adjustment assistance to help workers \ndislocated by foreign trade. When American firms move their American \nplants to foreign countries in search of higher profits through cheaper \nlabor, the American workers left behind pay a heavy price.\n  Trade adjustment assistance can help, but to many workers, it is \nlittle more than funeral expenses. It's obviously not enough to offset \nthe anti-worker, antilabor bias of this discriminatory fast-track bill.\n  The five measures the administration announced earlier this week, \nthrough the World Trade Organization and the World Bank, are another \nsmall step in the right direction on labor issues. But again, four \nstudies and a promise don't fix the problems with this bill.\n  I urge the Senate to reject this unfair approach. This bill puts the \nrights of business on a pedestal, and leaves the rights of workers in \nthe gutter. That kind of discrimination is unacceptable. No worker \nshould be treated with less dignity than a compact disk. I oppose this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to defeat it.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the fast-track \nlegislation, and I yield myself so much time as I might use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think it is important that people \nunderstand that the debate about fast track is a debate about trade. If \nwe reject fast track in the Congress, we are sending a signal to the \nwhole world that the United States of America, which has been the \nstrongest proponent of trade in the post-World War II period, is \nbacking away from that commitment. If we reject fast track, we are \nsaying to the world that the position we have taken in the post-World \nWar II period is a position that we are now vacating. We are saying to \nemerging markets all over the world that we are not going to be the \ndominant force in trade on this planet.\n  That message, in my opinion, would be a devastating message for world \ntrade. It would be a devastating message in terms of America's \nleadership. And I am prayerfully hopeful that in the end reason will \nprevail and that we will not send that message.\n  Mr. President, I have had an opportunity, as a Member of the Senate \nfor 13 years and as a Member of the House for 6 years before that, to \nspeak on many subjects. My colleagues have heard me speak on the budget \non many occasions. I think my colleagues understand that I have great \npassion about that subject. But as compared with world trade, the \nbudget is a secondary issue. The issue that we debate today is the most \nimportant issue that we will debate during this Congress.\n  Americans by and large do not understand the trade issue. One of the \ngreat frustrations of my political career has been that of all the \nissues that we deal with, the hardest issue to get people to understand \nis the trade issue. This is not a new problem. Disraeli, the British \nPrime Minister in the 19th century, once said, ``Not one person in \n10,000 understands the currency question, and yet we meet him every \nday.'' And by ``the currency question,'' he meant the value of the \npound relative to foreign currency in international trade. What \nDisraeli said would certainly be reflected in the debate here today.\n  I would like in my speech to try to do several things.\n  No. 1, I want to try to explain why this issue is so critically \nimportant.\n  No. 2, I want to respond to those who say they are opposed to \nexpanding trade, that they are opposed to fast track because they are \nconcerned about low-wage workers, because they are concerned about \nchild labor, because they are concerned about poverty, because they are \nconcerned about the environment.\n  Finally, I want to do something that we don't do enough of here, and \nthat is we don't attack this trade issue head on.\n  I know I have many colleagues who come to the floor and talk for \nendless hours about how wonderful it would be to build a wall around \nAmerica and go hide under a rock somewhere, how if we could simply \nimitate the economic isolation of North Korea, that all would be \nwonderful and well in America. And generally those of us who know \nbetter don't take the time to come over and respond. I want to be sure \nI take the time to respond today.\n  First of all, trade is critically important. The most important \ncontribution of America in the post-World War II period has been the \nexplosion of world trade. We didn't rebuild Europe with the Marshall \nplan. We didn't rebuild Japan with foreign aid. We didn't stop \ncommunism in Greece and Turkey with economic assistance. I don't in any \nway mean to criticize the Marshall plan or the Truman doctrine. They \nwere both critically important. They sent a very clear signal to the \nworld that we intended to learn from the lessons of World War II and \nthat we were going to resist the expansion of communism. But what \nstopped communism in Europe, what preserved freedom in Greece and \nTurkey, what rebuilt Japan, what created an economic miracle in Taiwan \nand Korea, what changed the balance of power, what won the cold war, \nwhat tore down the Berlin Wall, what liberated Eastern Europe, and what \nset more people free than any victory in any war in the history of \nmankind was the growth of world trade.\n  By opening up American markets and expanding trade first with Europe \nand Japan, then with a special focus on Turkey and Greece, then with a \nfocus on Korea and Taiwan, we literally created a wealth machine, and \nthat wealth machine brought prosperity to America such as we had never \nimagined possible. It created new, massive economic superpowers in \nplaces like South Korea, a poor agricultural country.\n  South Korea is a perfect example. In 1953, they had a per capita \nincome of $50 a year. They were devastated by the Korean conflict. But \nthrough world trade their per capita income grew to over $6,000.\n  The same thing happened in Taiwan. And the attraction of that \neconomic growth in Taiwan, in Hong Kong and Singapore, the sheer \nability of the market system in world trade to feed the hungry, to \ncreate opportunity and freedom and happiness, the shift in the balance \nof power that that economic explosion created literally tore down the \nBerlin wall and liberated Eastern Europe. And while Chiang Kai-shek had \nlong since been in the grave, the economic miracle on the little island \nthat he fled to and the economic miracle in Hong Kong built by world \ntrade was so powerful that it literally forced mainland China to begin \nto change its system and converted an enemy into a trading partner. It \nholds out the great prospect of creating cooperation with the one \ncountry in the world that can be our rival in the 21st century, and \nthat is China.\n  Now, we know the lessons of the 20th century. We know the wars that \ninvolved conflicts over resources; where Germany invaded Russia to get \naccess to resources; where the Japanese invaded Manchuria to try to get \naccess to mineral resources that in many cases were denied in trade \nagreements around the world. We know the totalitarianism of the 20th \ncentury.\n  When I am talking about trade, I am not just talking about goods and \nservices. I am talking about a profoundly moral issue, a moral issue \nthat really boils down to the question of whether we are going to \nrepeat, beginning with a vote on fast track, the policies that created \nthe terrible crises that we faced in the 20th century.\n  Did we learn from history or are we going to repeat it? I hope we \nlearned. This is a profoundly moral issue because it is about freedom. \nIt is about doing something about grinding poverty that for the great \nmass of mankind literally beats down the humanity of working men and \nwomen and their children all over the world.\n  Mr. President, I respect my colleagues and I know they mean well, but \nit is hard for me to sit here and listen to people say that they want \nto reduce trade because they are concerned about poverty. It is very \ndifficult for me as an old economics professor to sit here and listen \nto people say, ``Well, I would like to trade with China or Mexico or \nChile or any other place in the world but I am concerned that workers \nare poor. I am concerned about child labor. And so as a result I do not \nwant to trade.''\n  Why does child labor exist? In the War of 1812 we had 8-year-olds in \nthe\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\nNavy. We had child labor in America up until the Civil War. Why did we \nhave it? Why does it exist all over the world in poor countries? It \nexists because it is a product of poverty. Wages are low because of \npoverty. Working conditions are poor because of poverty. If you really \ncare about workers in another country, you want to trade with that \ncountry because only by trade, only by expanding prosperity both here \nand there can we do something about child labor, can we do something \nabout poverty.\n  So if you really care about workers' rights in other countries, you \ndo not solve their problem, you do not deal with child labor by \nbuilding a wall between us and that country. You eradicate child labor \nby promoting trade, which promotes prosperity, which allows parents to \nput their children in schools and keep them there until they are \neducated.\n  So I reject the argument that is made by people who oppose trade and \noppose fast track, because that is what this fast track debate is \nabout. It is about trade. It is about whether we are going to continue \nto trade or whether we are going to start building walls. And I totally \nreject the idea that those who oppose this bill are protecting low-\nincome workers and children.\n\n  I am protecting low-income workers and children. The policy that I \npromote of trade, expanded economic opportunity, expanded freedom and \nexpanded prosperity, that is the only system in history that has ever \ndone anything about poverty. Trade, free enterprise, individual \nfreedom, those are the great tools for destroying poverty. So if you \nreally want to stop child labor in the world, if you really care about \nworkers' rights, then join the President and join me in tearing down \nbarriers and expanding trade.\n  Likewise, I reject the notion that those who want to promote a good \nenvironment worldwide can do it by preventing trade. I ask my \ncolleagues, and I ask those who are listening, to understand that the \npopulation of the world is growing, that people are going to be hungry, \nand unless we can create an economic system worldwide that is going to \nfeed them, they are going to continue to destroy the environment in \ntheir countries.\n  Environmentalism, the concern about your surroundings, is a product \nof affluence. You can only be concerned about the environment when you \nhave enough to eat. And if you really care about the environment, if \nyou really are concerned about global warming, if you are concerned \nabout the expansion of pollution, you ought to be for trade because \ntrade creates prosperity, and prosperity makes it possible for people \nto improve the technology and in the process to improve the \nenvironment.\n  Our colleague from Massachusetts talked about Mexico. Mexico is a \nrelatively poor country, but as a Senator from a State that shares \n1,200 miles of border with Mexico, I can tell you that the expansion of \ntrade with Mexico has meant bringing 1990's technology into Mexico, \nespecially along the border, to replace 1950's technology, and the net \nresult is that our new investments and the expansion of growth and \nopportunity in Mexico give them the first real opportunity that they \nhave ever had to improve their environment.\n  So if you really care about workers and children, if you really care \nabout the environment, use the one tool, the one tool that we have that \ncan help people in other countries share in the great bounty we share, \nand that tool is trade.\n  Now, I have never heard so much poor mouthing in my life as the poor \nmouthing we have heard about trade. You would think Americans are a \nbunch of incompetents, that our workers are all these guys standing on \nassembly lines with big pot bellies, who are, in the words of that old \ncountry and western song, ``having daydreams about night things in the \nmiddle of the afternoon.''\n  In listening to our colleagues, you would think that we are just \ncomplete incompetents and that we need to build a wall around America \nto protect us from having to compete with other people.\n  That is totally out of sync with reality. America dominates the world \nmarket. Study after study of competitiveness concludes that America is \nthe lowest-cost producer in the world of manufactured products, not \nbecause we have low wages but because we have skilled workers and \nbecause we have the best tools in the world. We dominate the world \nmarketplace. We are the world's largest exporter, the world's largest \nimporter. Our living standards are 20 percent higher than Japanese \nliving standards. Germany has a living standard about 74 percent of our \nlevel. The American economy has grown in the last 10 years by 17.8 \nmillion new permanent, productive, taxpaying jobs. And since employment \nin Government has declined, this represents a net addition to the \nnumber of people who are involved in the marketplace creating goods and \nservices. That is 5.7 million more jobs than Germany and Japan combined \nhave created in the last 10 years.\n  And yet, to listen to our colleagues, our jobs are running offshore; \nour jobs are going to Japan; our jobs are going to Germany; our jobs \nare going to China. We have the highest levels of employment we have \nhad in the history of the country. We have created 17.8 million new \njobs in the last 10 years. Our economy is booming. And yet to listen to \nour colleagues pour ashes over their heads and talk about helpless, \nincompetent Americans, you would think we were incapable of producing \nor selling anything.\n\n  The reality is that in 10 years our exports are up by 130 percent. \nThe exports of Europe are up by 55 percent. The exports of Japan are up \nby 24 percent. But if there is one thing that I could rejoice in, it is \nwe are not hearing people say today, as they did in this debate 2 years \nago, that we ought to copy Japan. We used to have Members of the Senate \nwho would get up and talk about how wonderful it would be if our \neconomy could be like Japan's, if we put up barriers to cheat our \nconsumers and drive up the price of goods, if we had Government and \nbusiness conspire to have these massive plans to dominate the world \nmarket. If we could just do what Japan does, they said, things would be \nwonderful. I do rejoice that nobody says that anymore. They don't say \nit anymore because the Japanese economy is on its back.\n  Government-dominated trade fails. The marketplace succeeds. You hear \nall of these tales of woe about how manufacturing jobs every day are \nleaving the country. The truth is that our exports in manufacturing are \nup 180 percent in the last 10 years. That is nine times the rate of \ngrowth of manufacturing exports in Japan. That is six times the rate of \ngrowth in exports in Germany.\n  One of the problems the President has on fast track today is that for \nthe last 6 years he has pussyfooted with all these protectionists. He \nhas engaged in little acts of protectionism and now all of a sudden he \ncomes back to the same proponents of protectionism that he has been \ncoddling with political favors for 6 years and says, ``Oh, by the way, \nwe have a profound national interest now and you have to stand up for \ntrade.'' No wonder he is having trouble. The President has been on \nthree sides of a two-sided issue for 6 years. But he is on the right \nside of this issue, and I am very proud to be with him.\n\n  Let me make another point about trade. Let me give two examples of \nhow we benefit from trade even when we are not buying goods from \nabroad, and then I want to talk about how we benefit from trade by \nbuying foreign goods.\n  Some of you will remember that in the 1980's, there was this massive \npush to get Ronald Reagan to protect the American automobile industry. \nIn fact, I bought a Chevrolet truck in 1983. It was a clunker. That \ntruck never was any good from the first day I bought it until the Lord \nprovided somebody from an ad in the newspaper who came and bought that \ntruck. Everything you can imagine happened to it. And, if you will \nremember, in the early 1980's, all these protectionists were coming, \nbanging on our doors, saying, ``We are going to be driven out of the \nautomobile industry. General Motors is going to be broke. Ford is in \ncrisis. Chrysler is on the verge of collapse and has to have a \nGovernment bailout.'' Thank God Ronald Reagan said, in essence, \n``compete or die.''\n  In 1983 you didn't want to buy a car or truck produced on Monday \nbecause on Monday autoworkers were still thinking about the weekend. \nAnd you didn't want to buy a car or truck produced on Friday because on \nFriday they were thinking about the coming\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\nweekend. And you probably didn't want to buy one produced in the middle \nof the week because they weren't doing much thinking. I am not just \ntalking about people on the assembly line, I am talking about all those \nwhite collar managers in all those fancy offices in Detroit. They were \ngetting their fannies kicked because they were doing a rotten job and \nthey were ripping off the American consumer. So, rather than make tough \ndecisions and go to work, they came to Washington and they whined and \nthey begged and they pleaded and they said, ``Protect us, protect our \njobs.'' And they wrapped themselves in the American flag. It was our \nduty, they said. We couldn't let all our automobile jobs go to Japan \nand Korea and all those places where people worked hard. So we were \nsupposed to protect them.\n  Ronald Reagan said no. And what happened? Well, in 1991, I bought a \nnew truck. This time I bought a Ford, but that didn't make the \ndifference. In fact, I just recently bought a Chevrolet with the same \nresult. That 1991 truck was the best vehicle I have ever bought in my \nlife. Not only did I drive it; now my son is driving it. It has never \nbroken down. It has never had a major mechanical problem. It is an \nabsolute marvel.\n  Where did it come from? I owe the quality of that truck to the \nJapanese and to the Koreans, and I would like to thank them today. I \nowe it to them because they forced companies and the United Auto \nWorkers to stop this crazy system where workers and managers were \nalways in conflict. So when I bought that Ford Explorer in 1991, the \nUnited Auto Workers were proud to have their name on it along with Ford \nMotor Co. Quality was job 1.\n  I never will forget when General Motors said they had to determine \nwhether they were going to be in the automobile business in the year \n2000. They are still the automobile business, big time in the business. \nThey are producing some of the best cars and the best trucks in the \nworld.\n  If we had engaged in protectionism in 1982 and 1983, we would be \ngetting the same lousy cars, the same lousy trucks, and we would be \npaying more. In fact, when Bill Clinton became President and, as a sop \nto the automobile industry and the labor unions, put a tariff of \nseveral thousand dollars on sport utility vehicles, what do you think \nhappened? The price of sport utility vehicles went up by thousands of \ndollars. It was just theft, reaching right in the pockets of working \nfamilies and pulling out thousands of dollars. That is an example of \nwhat I am talking about.\n  I think one of the mistakes we made--I am not going to go much deeper \ninto this--but one of the mistakes we made is that we talk so much \nabout jobs we forget why we work. There are a few people in America who \nhave remarkable jobs. I see two of them here today who are at least \nlistening to me with one ear, two Senators. If we could afford to do \nthis job for nothing, we would probably do it for nothing. But most \nAmericans work because they want to earn money to buy things. The end \nresult of economic activity is consumption.\n\n  It never ceases to amaze me how perverted things get. I will give an \nexample. We now have a suit filed with the International Trade \nCommission by salmon producers. I think we have about 500 people in \nAmerica, mostly in the State of Maine, who are involved in growing \nsalmon. They have filed an unfair trade practice suit against Chile. \nChile produces massive amounts of salmon. They have a comparative \nadvantage because they raise salmon all year long. They start out with \neggs, they produce these little fingerlings, they feed them--the whole \nprocess is absolutely an economic marvel. When the salmon are 14 \npounds, they harvest them, they clean them, the fillets are shipped \nfresh to America and Europe. And what has happened? Salmon prices have \ngone down dramatically.\n  Salmon is a superior product. When I was growing up I never ate any \nsalmon. Rich folks ate salmon. Salmon has the right kind of \ncholesterol, as our colleague from Alaska would say. Because of the \nability of Chile to produce salmon, literally tens of millions of \nAmericans have changed their diets, and now eating salmon is becoming \nalmost as common as eating steak.\n  So what now are we doing? Right now we have the International Trade \nCommission which, thanks to a President who today is for trade, is full \nof protectionists, and they are in the process of determining whether \nwe should literally take quality food out of the mouths of tens of \nmillions of Americans. Does that make any sense whatsoever, to take \nfood out of the mouths of tens of millions of people to protect the \njobs of 500 people. God never granted them or anyone else the eternal \nright to be in the salmon business.\n  An argument that carries no weight here but carries weight with me--\nand I always love to make it because I feel good when I make it--is, \nwho gives anybody that right? Who has the right to tell me, a free man \nin a free country, that some 500 workers in the State of Maine can rob \nme by making me buy their product instead of buying a cheaper, better \nproduct produced somewhere else? Who gives them the right to do that in \na free country? Am I only free to go to the street corner and shout, \n``Bill Clinton is a dope,'' or ``Phil Gramm is crazy''? Or do I have a \nright to do something that is real, like go and use my money to feed my \nfamily in the way I choose? The argument for protectionism is really an \nargument for theft.\n  I want to give another example. Every day we hear about textiles. \nEvery day we hear this clamor of protectionist arguments about how we \nhave to protect textiles. And do you remember this big deal about how \nwe were successful in reducing tariffs to China and so now we are not \ngoing to be importing as many textiles from China. It was just hailed \nas a great victory.\n  Well, go to the places where real, honest-to-God Americans shop and \nlook at the quality goods and look at the prices. By protecting the \ntextile industry, we are literally taking the shirts off the backs of \nchildren of working families in this country, and nobody seems to care. \nIt is astounding to me in the U.S. Senate that we all care about \nproducers, but nobody cares about consumers. We can get a couple of \nrich executives, business owners, textile manufacturers to come to \nWashington and holler, and pretty soon we are falling all over \nourselves to protect them from competition. Nobody seems to care that \nAmerican children and their parents pay twice what they should for \ntextiles today.\n  The paradox is that it is a losing battle. Britain lost the textile \nindustry to New England, because the textile business is noncompetitive \nin a high-wage country. The exception, of course, is the part that is \ndone by machines. We dominate the world in machine-made textiles, in \nfact, we are making a lot of money in the textile business today, but \nwhere you have to do hand work and where you have a lot of people \ninvolved, you tend to be noncompetitive.\n\n  This is not a new phenomenon. England lost the textile mills to New \nEngland, and then New England lost them to the South. In fact, the \nCongress first adopted the minimum wage to try to prevent textile mills \nfrom moving from New Hampshire to Georgia. But it didn't do any good; \nthey moved anyway. And New Hampshire is much better off for it because \nthey became a high-tech State.\n  Japan has lost the textile industry, Korea is losing the textile \nindustry, and China will lose the textile industry, because the textile \nindustry, at least in hand work, goes where there are low wages. But to \nprotect a handful of jobs, we are willing to literally steal from \nmillions of working families. Every day these arguments are made and \npeople cloak themselves in the American flag when they are arguing for \ngreedy, petty special interests to cheat the consumer. And I thought \nsomebody ought to say something about it.\n  Now, I want to sum up with three quotes. I thought about a way to end \nthis speech, and I want to end it with a quote from Ronald Reagan, one \nof the last things he ever said on trade during his Presidency. But I \nwant to quote first from a Democrat, a Member of Congress from New \nYork, who was a Member of Congress at the turn of the century. Nobody \nhas ever heard of him, but I discovered him in reading a biography on \nWinston Churchill. I discovered him because Bourke Cockran, from New \nYork, was a friend of Churchill's mama, and he profoundly influenced \nChurchill on trade. In fact,\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\nChurchill changed parties several times, as we all know, but he never, \never changed his position on trade. Churchill from the beginning of his \ncareer to the end of his career was a free trader. He was a free trader \nprincipally because of Bourke Cockran, who was one of the great orators \nin the history of this country. I just want to read a short statement \nfrom him because it says more than I can. I am not a very good reader, \nand so I apologize. We forget what trade is about. In the midst of all \nthis special interest and ignorance that dominates this debate, we \nforget what it is about.\n  Cockran is an American. He is in London. It is July 15, 1903. America \nis a protectionist country. England is the only country in the world \nthat has relatively open markets. Cockran is speaking to the Liberal \nClub in England, and ``liberal'' at the turn of the century means what \n``conservative'' means today--freedom. With this relatively short \nparagraph he sums up what trade is about. I want to read it: ``Your \nfree trade system makes the whole industrial life of the world one vast \nscheme of cooperation for your benefit.''\n  He is talking to the British people.\n\n       At this moment, in every quarter of the globe, forces are \n     at work to supply your necessities and improve your \n     condition. As I speak, men are tending flocks on Australian \n     fields and shearing wool which will clothe you during the \n     coming winter. On western lands, men are reaping grain to \n     supply your daily bread. In mines deep underground, men are \n     swinging pickaxes and shovels to wrest from the bosom of the \n     Earth the ores essential to the efficiency of your industry. \n     Under tropical skies, hands are gathering, from bending \n     boughs, luscious fruits which in a few days will be offered \n     for your consumption in the streets of London.\n       Over shining rails, locomotives are drawing trains, on \n     heaving surges, sailors are piloting barks, through arid \n     deserts Arabs are guiding caravans, all charged with the \n     fruits of industry to be placed here freely at your feet. You \n     alone, among all the peoples of the Earth, encourage this \n     gracious tribute and enjoy its full benefit, for here alone \n     it is received freely, without imposition, restriction or \n     tax, while everywhere else, barriers are raised against it by \n     stupidity and folly.\n\n  That speech could be given today about the United States of America. \nUltimately, England went protectionist, and when it did, it declined as \na world power. Ultimately, America promoted trade, and when we did, we \nrose to world prominence.\n  What a different world we live in than the world we have evolved \nfrom. We now have leaders who talk about trade as a problem, who talk \nabout imports as if something is wrong with buying something from \nsomeone else.\n  When Pericles was delivering his funeral oration, honoring the dead \nof Athens, one of the great speeches in history, he talked of trade as \na sign of greatness. Once a year, they had a ceremony where they would \nbring the bones of Athenian warriors who had died defending Athens \nduring that year, and they would all be buried together.\n  When Pericles came to the point in the speech where he wanted to \nexplain how you could know that Athens was a great city, here is what \nhe said, and interestingly enough, he measured the greatness of Athens \nby its imports. What a far cry it is from today; what he understood, we \nhave forgotten. And he understood it 2,500 years ago:\n  ``The magnitude of our city draws the produce of the world into our \nharbor, so that to the Athenian the fruits of other countries are as \nfamiliar a luxury as those of his own.''\n  Only a great country has the capacity through trade to get the whole \nworld to work cooperatively to promote its prosperity.\n  Trade is like love. That is the miracle of this thing. It is not as \nif we are getting rich by trade at the expense of other countries, \nbecause trade makes us rich and it makes them rich. It is like love: \nThe more of it you give away, the more of it you have. That is why it \nis magic. That is why it is so hard to understand.\n  I want to end with a quote from Ronald Reagan. President Reagan has \nnever gotten the credit he deserves for standing up for trade. It was \none of his great achievements in an era that was dominated by \nprotectionism. But here is what he said, and I urge my colleagues, \nespecially on my side of the aisle, people who love Ronald Reagan, to \nlook at these words before we have our final vote on this issue. Ronald \nReagan said this about trade, and it is so accurate in terms of fears \nversus hopes:\n  ``Where others fear trade and economic growth, we see opportunities \nfor creating new wealth and undreamed-of opportunities for millions in \nour own land and beyond. Where others seek to throw up barriers, we \nseek to bring them down; where others take counsel of their fears, we \nfollow our hopes.''\n  I am for free trade. I am for the fast-track bill. These two issues \ncannot be separated. We have colleagues who say, ``Oh, I'm for trade, \nbut I'm against fast track.'' We all know that without fast track, we \nare not going to have an expansion in trade. We all know that without \nfast track, Europe will tie itself to South America in their new free \ntrade area, and we will end up with less and less trade and less and \nless influence and with less and less prosperity.\n  So the issue here is trade, and the issue is freedom. Do you care \nabout working people in America and around the world? If you do, you \nought to be for trade, because trade will raise our living standards, \nand it will raise the living standards of others. If you are really \nconcerned about child labor, about low wages, about grinding poverty \naround the world, the way you help do something about it is through \ntrade. You don't do something about it by building a wall around \nAmerica. If you really care about the environment, you are not going to \nimprove the world environment by promoting poverty. We are going to \npromote it by expanding trade and by expanding prosperity.\n\n  This is a very important vote we are going to have. We have not voted \non anything in this Congress that is more important than giving the \nPresident fast track. If we reject fast track, we are saying that \nspecial interests dominate the trade policies of America, that the \nworld's great trading nation, the most successful nation at trade in \nthe history of the world, the nation that has benefited more from trade \nthan any other country in the history of the planet, we are going to be \nsaying that for the first time in the postwar period we are giving up \nour position of world leadership in trade, that we fear to trade.\n  I don't say that, and I don't believe it. I hope that we are going to \ngive the President fast-track authority and continue a process that \nwill continue our prosperity and economic growth. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad. Because no one else is \non the floor and because of the time balance, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Feinstein from California be allowed to follow the \npresentation by Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me say, the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Gramm, as always, makes an interesting and a challenging \npresentation. He is a very capable Member of the Senate.\n  I will say, I listened with great interest. One of the areas I think \nwhere we want to discuss some disagreement is whether, as he proposes, \nthe American people do not really understand the issue of trade. I \nthink the American people do, in fact, understand the issue of trade, \nand that is precisely what is requiring and causing this kind of \ndiscussion in the U.S. Senate.\n  Having said that--I will expound on that at some later time--let me \nyield now to my colleague, Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. I \nalso listened with great interest to the remarks of our colleague from \nTexas, Senator Gramm. I, too, was struck when he said the American \npeople don't understand trade. I must say, I disagree. I think the \nAmerican people understand it very well. I think they understand that \nfreer trade is in our interest, but I also think they understand that \nsometimes we don't do a very good job of negotiating these trade \nagreements with other countries, and, as a result, we quite often find \nourselves at a disadvantage. That is not in America's interest. We \nought to do a better job.\n  When it is a question of this fast-track proposal, I must say, I \nfavor fast\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\ntrack, but I don't favor this fast-track proposal because it is flawed. \nIt should be fixed, but there has been no serious attempt to fix it.\n  Mr. President, without question, we are the most competitive nation \nin the world. Others have higher barriers erected against our goods \nthan we have erected against theirs, and that is why fundamentally it \nis in our interest to negotiate trade agreements with other nations to \nreduce their barriers to our exports. There is no question that is in \nAmerica's economic interest. For that reason, I voted for the GATT \nagreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. But I also \nrecognize that the devil is in the details, and we have seen that both \nwith the Canadian Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free \nTrade Agreement. There were flaws in those trade agreements, serious \nflaws that should have been fixed before America signed off on those \ntrade agreements.\n  Before I go further into the details of what was wrong with NAFTA and \nthe Canadian Free Trade Agreement and how those flaws came about, I \nwould like to report to those who are listening on what happened in the \nSenate Finance Committee in considering the fast-track legislation that \nis before us, because I find just the process that has led us to where \nwe are today disturbing.\n\n  Senator Gramm said this is the most important measure this Congress \nwill consider this year. I don't know about that, but certainly it is a \nvery important measure. I would guess the American people think, well, \nthe committees have gone over this, they have debated it, they have \ndiscussed it openly and freely, Members have had a chance to offer \namendments. That is how the process usually works around here, but that \nisn't what happened on this bill that is before us today. No, no, \nsomething quite different happened.\n  We had a meeting, a closed meeting, outside of the public eye in the \nback room of the Finance Committee. A number of us had a chance to say, \nlook, we think there are flaws in this legislation that ought to be \nfixed. The chairman told us he didn't want any amendments when we went \nout into the formal session. I didn't know that he meant by that that \nhe wouldn't permit any amendments, but that is what happened, because \nwhen the closed meeting ended and we went out into public session, \nsomething occurred there that I have never seen in my 10 years in the \nU.S. Senate. There was no debate, there was no discussion, there were \nno amendments, because none were permitted.\n  Instead, this legislation was combined with the Caribbean Basin \ninitiative and the tax provisions of the highway bill. They were \nwrapped all into one vote, no rollcall. The three of them together were \nvoice voted, and no amendments were permitted. That is what happened. \nThat is not my idea of the legislative process.\n  What are the advocates of this legislation so afraid of? Why can't we \nhave votes on amendments? Why can't we have a debate? We certainly \ndidn't have it in the Senate Finance Committee that has the \njurisdiction over this legislation. I think I found a number of reasons \nmaybe why they don't want to have amendments considered and they don't \nwant to have a chance for debate and discussion. Maybe it is because \nthere are flaws in this agreement and they would just as soon not \ndiscuss those flaws.\n  Mr. President, I think I detect at least three serious flaws in what \nis before us. First of all, we have to understand what fast track is \nall about, and I think every Member here understands that fast track \nmeans that individual Members give up their right to amend legislation \nimplementing trade agreements.\n  That is a remarkable thing, because the greatness of this body is \nthat every Member has a right to offer amendments on every bill in \norder to alter it, change it, to fix it. But we give up that right \nunder fast track. The idea is that that is important to do, so that the \nPresident can negotiate trade agreements, because other countries would \nbe reluctant to negotiate if the resulting agreements were then subject \nto amendment on the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, the idea is that in exchange for giving up the right \nto amend, that Congress will be fully consulted in negotiating those \ntrade agreements. It is called consultation.\n  Mr. President, I have been here now through GATT, through NAFTA, and \nthrough the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. And I think I can report, \nwithout fear of contradiction, that the notion that Congress is \nconsulted is largely a formality. It is more of a wave and a handshake \nthan it is any kind of serious consultation with Congress. None of that \nwould matter so much if it did not mean that we lose the opportunity to \ncorrect flaws in agreements before they are signed off on by our \ncountry. Before Congress is faced with an up-or-down vote, you approve \nit all or you kill it. Under fast track, it is all or nothing.\n  That is what is seriously wrong with what is in front of us. We have \ngiven up the right to amend but we have not gotten in exchange any \nserious consultation process to try to prevent mistakes from being made \nbefore agreements are reached. That is not in America's interest.\n  The result has been, in previous agreements, that very serious flaws \nhave been included that were injurious to America's interests.\n  In a minute I will discuss one that has affected my State and \naffected it seriously.\n  The second point I want to make, the second flaw that I have detected \nin this legislation, is we still have no means of correcting previous \nagreements that contain mistakes.\n  I know people who are listening must think, ``How can that be? I \nmean, we have a circumstance in which we enter into trade agreements, \nbut there is no mechanism for fixing mistakes that are contained in \nagreements we have already entered into?''\n  Well, as shocking as that might seem, that is precisely what we have. \nWe have a circumstance in which, if there is a mistake in a previous \nagreement, there is no mechanism for fixing it.\n  Some will say, who are trade experts and listening, ``Well, the \nSenator is not right. We do have a way of fixing things. We can file a \nsection 301 case.''\n  Well, let me just say, for people who are not aware of the technical \ndetails in trade legislation, section 301 is like an atom bomb. Section \n301 means we take retaliatory action against a country. But they, under \ntrade agreements we have signed, can then retaliate against us. And \nguess what happens? If we go the route of a 301, which is rarely done--\nrarely done--the country that we retaliate against for an unfair trade \npractice retaliates in turn against us. Obviously, then our country is \nvery reluctant to take such an action.\n  That leaves us without any practical way to fix the mistakes in past \nagreements. I was prepared, in the Finance Committee, to offer an \namendment as part of the negotiating instructions to our trade \nnegotiators that they ought to pursue a mechanism for fixing trade \nagreements that are flawed. Is that such a radical idea? Sounds like \ncommon sense to me. We ought to have a way of fixing agreements that \nhave mistakes that are flawed.\n  Mr. President, I am not just talking theoretically here. I am talking \nout of practical experience, of a bitter experience, that my State had \nwith the so-called Canadian Free Trade Agreement.\n  In North Dakota, we produce Durum wheat. We produce the vast majority \nof Durum wheat produced in the United States. In fact, nearly 90 \npercent of the Durum produced in America is produced in North Dakota.\n  Durum, for those who may not be familiar with that term, is the type \nof wheat that makes pasta. Of course, pasta has enjoyed a dramatic \nincrease in consumption in this country, and North Dakota has been the \nplace that has provided the raw product.\n  Well, in the Canadian Free Trade Agreement there was a flaw, there \nwas a mistake, and that provided an enormous loophole for our neighbors \nto the north to put Durum wheat into our country on an unfair basis. \nAnd you know what happened? Canada took advantage of that loophole, \nthat mistake, that flaw, and before you know it, they went from zero \npercent of the United States market--zero--to 20 percent of the United \nStates market.\n\n  I have a chart that just shows what occurred in Durum after the \nCanadian Free Trade Agreement.\n  This is before the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. You can see they \nhad zero percent of the U.S. market--zero.\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\n  After the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, and its flaw, Canada started \ndramatic increases in exports to the United States. In fact, they \nreached this level, which represented 20 percent of the U.S. market.\n  We then were able to put limitations in place--something we could no \nlonger do because of succeeding trade agreements that we have signed--\nand we were able to reduce their unfairly traded Canadian grain back to \na more tolerable level. But we cannot put this kind of limitation in \nplace anymore. So we are left with a circumstance where one of the \nmajor industries in my State is vulnerable to unfair competition.\n  Some would say, ``Well, it sounds to me, Senator, like you're just \nafraid of competition out in North Dakota.'' Oh, no. We are not afraid \nof competition. We are ready to take on anybody, anytime, head to head \nin any market anywhere. We are among the most competitive agricultural \nareas in the world. But we cannot take on the Canadian farmer and the \nCanadian Government.\n  And that is what we are being asked to do. Because, while the \nCanadian Free Trade Agreement says--and says clearly--neither side \nshall dump below its cost in the other's market, in a secret side deal, \nnever revealed to Congress, our trade negotiator at the time told the \nCanadians, ``When you calculate your cost, you don't have to count \ncertain things. One of the things you don't have to count, you don't \nhave to count the final payment made by the Canadian Government to the \nCanadian farmer.''\n  Guess what the Canadians did? They dramatically decreased the \npayments that count, and they increased the amount of their final \npayment to the Canadian farmer. And they do not have to count one penny \nof the final payment for the purposes of determining whether they are \ndumping wheat below their cost into our market. I know that is a flaw. \nThat is a mistake. That is unfair. But you go and try and fix it, and \nwhat you will find is there is no mechanism for fixing past flawed \nagreements.\n  I think we ought to tell our negotiators, as part of their \nnegotiating instructions, ``Go and try to get a mechanism for fixing \ntrade agreements that have mistakes.'' But that amendment could never \nbe offered in the Senate Finance Committee because no amendments were \npermitted. Why? I have never seen that in my 10 years in the U.S. \nSenate in any committee on which I have served. No amendments \npermitted--none. That reminds me of a different country and a different \ntime--not the United States.\n  Well, the third C that I talk about is currency valuation, because I \nthink that, too, is something we ought to consider.\n  There is no consideration in these trade negotiations about the \ncurrency stability of the country with whom we are negotiating.\n  NAFTA is a perfect example of what that can mean.\n  This chart shows that in the NAFTA agreement we were able to secure a \ntariff gain of 10 percent by that trade agreement because we were able \nto convince Mexico to reduce their tariffs by that amount. So we got a \ntariff gain of 10 percent in terms of our competitive position.\n  Mexico, shortly thereafter, devalued its currency by 50 percent, \ncompletely overwhelming and negating what we had accomplished in the \ntrade negotiation. Is it any wonder that we went from a trade surplus \nwith Mexico before NAFTA to a $16 billion trade deficit with Mexico \ntoday? But nobody wants to talk about it, nobody wants to have an \namendment offered that deals with this question.\n  All I am asking is that when we are negotiating with a country, that \nwe ought to get a certification from our President that he has examined \nthe currency stability of the country with which we are negotiating so \nthat he can assure us that there is little risk of a dramatic \ndevaluation that would completely wipe out what we accomplished at the \ntrade negotiating table.\n  Common sense. It just makes common sense. You look before you leap. \nYou examine the currency stability of the country with whom you are \nnegotiating so that you can assure yourself they are not going to have \na dramatic devaluation that wipes out what you accomplish at the trade \nnegotiating table.\n  That amendment was never considered because, again, no amendments \nwere permitted in the committee.\n  Mr. President, I would like to be able to vote for fast track. I \nbelieve in freer trade. But I also believe that there are serious flaws \nin this fast track proposal that deserve debate and discussion and \nvotes on amendments. We were denied all of those in the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I have never seen it in 10 years in the U.S. Senate. We are \nnow going to have a chance here on the floor to offer those \namendments--at least, I hope we are--I hope the majority leader is not \ngoing to come out here and fill up the tree and prevent amendments \nbeing offered by Members.\n  Mr. President, this is a serious matter. Senator Gramm again said \nthis is the most important vote we are going to have in the Senate this \nyear. Again, I am not sure I would put it at the very pinnacle, but no \nquestion this is an important matter.\n  The fact is, the United States has a lot to gain and a lot to lose. \nWe have a lot to gain if we really accomplish freer trade in this world \nbecause we are the most competitive nation on the globe. We have a lot \nto lose if we negotiate flawed agreements. We have a lot to lose if we \ncontinue on the path that leads to a nearly $200 billion trade deficit \nin part because the United States has not been tough enough in \nnegotiations with other countries.\n  It seems to me these three C's that I have outlined--of consultation, \nof correcting prior agreements that have flaws and, third, that we \nconsider the currency valuation of the country with which we are \nnegotiating so that we can be confident they will not engage in a \ndramatic devaluation and completely offset what we have accomplished at \nthe negotiating table--are commonsense measures.\n  I hope my colleagues, when I have a chance to offer these amendments, \nwill carefully consider them because this is an important matter. We \nhave a chance to make this fast-track proposal much better, to guard \nthe interests of the people of the United States much better.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude as I began. I have supported well-\ncrafted trade agreements. I was proud to vote for GATT. But I have \nopposed those agreements that I thought were flawed and not in the \nnational interest.\n  Now, again, all Members are going to have to make a decision and a \ndetermination. And I say to them, as a member of the Finance Committee \nthat considered the legislation before us, that it is flawed, and it \nought to be fixed. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to do that \non the floor of the Senate, which we did not have in the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for such time \nas I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer my \nviews on this fast track proposal before the Senate. I have followed \nthe debate very carefully. California has a significant stake on issues \nof international trade, an important engine driving the California \neconomy today.\n  In recent weeks, we have heard a great deal about fast track, often \nwith broad, sweeping claims. Some have said those voting against fast \ntrack are protectionist, xenophobic or antitrade. Others have claimed \nfast track is the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. I want to take a few \nminutes to describe just what I think fast-track authority is all \nabout. Fast track is the abrogation of congressional authority to have \nsome leverage on trade agreements and the ability to offer amendments \non the floor.\n  This fast-track bill provides the President, for the remainder of his \nterm, plus an optional extension, the authority to negotiate any trade \ntreaty in the world and bring it rapidly to this body, without an \nopportunity to offer amendments. Article 1, section 8, of the U.S. \nConstitution gives the Congress responsibility over economic matters. \nThrough fast track, we are effectively abrogating this responsibility.\n  There is no State in this Nation that has a more important role on \nissues of\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\ntrade than the State of California. The stakes are very high.\n  California is the seventh largest economy on Earth. We are the \neconomic powerhouse and the economic engine of the Nation, responsible \nfor 13 percent of the Nation's economy and 20 percent of the Nation's \nexport.\n  Free and fair trade is an integral part of California's economic \nfuture. But free and fair trade can only be brought about through a \nlevel playing field, with everybody playing by the same rules. My job \nas a U.S. Senator is to stand up and articulate my State's interests \nwhen its needs and concerns are not being taken into consideration. \nSimply stated, fast track gives the President total authority to \nnegotiate any trade agreement.\n  Is fast track absolutely necessary? We have heard a great deal of \ncomment and concern, calling for the passage of fast track: ``We have \nto do it, we have to do it, you are un-American if we don't do it.'' \nBut the fact of the matter is this President has concluded 220 trade \nagreements, and only 2 of them, the GATT Uruguay round and the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, have required fast-track authority.\n  In fact, other than GATT and NAFTA, there have only been three \nadditional agreements in the Nation's history that have been adopted \nthrough the fast-track process: the Tokyo round of GATT in 1975, the \nUnited States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement in 1998 and the United \nStates-Israel Free Trade Agreement in 1989. These are the only five \nagreements in the history of our Nation that have been passed using the \nfast-track process.\n  Yet we have seen exports increase in our country by 50 percent since \n1991, without fast-track. Today, exports are 30 percent higher than \nthey were in 1993. The trade growth and the trade agreements are \noccurring without fast-track authority.\n  Now, it may well be if I were the President of the United States, I \nwould want to have fast track, too. It would make my life simpler. I \nwould not have to deal with a Congress that can sometimes be \nrecalcitrant or difficult and, at our best, obstreperous, and at our \nworst, an actual impediment.\n  However, the Senate is supposed to be a deliberative body and I feel \nsometimes no legislation is better than just any legislation. Yet with \nthis fast track matter, we have seen a great rush. We are told we can't \nwait until next session or next year to have more thoughtful \nconsideration on this issue. We have to do it right now.\n  I must tell you, the stakes are very big for my State. Fast track \nforces me to give my authority to offer changes. I give up my ability \nto pick up the phone and tell the administration, ``Hey, if you \nnegotiate this, I'm going to try to amend it on the floor because it \ndisadvantages industries in my State.''\n  The bottom line is, I think, the argument that the United States \ncan't negotiate trade agreements without fast track, based on the \nrecord, are incorrect. Senator Byron Dorgan has ably pointed out that \nthe agreements that have been the subject of fast track, have been \nfollowed by a growing negative trade balance. Yet we can't do anything \nabout it so we don't talk about it.\n  Under NAFTA, a $1.7 billion trade surplus in 1993, after NAFTA's \npassage, grew to a record trade imbalance of $16.3 billion by 1996. Our \ntrade deficit with Canada has also grown, more than doubling from $11 \nto $23 billion annually.\n  We can't amend NAFTA, we can't change NAFTA. All we can do is give 6 \nmonths' notice and withdraw. The stakes are very big now, and \nwithdrawal is not apt to happen politically.\n  The GATT agreement, which I voted for, has contributed to the largest \nmerchandise trade deficit in U.S. history, rising in each of the last 4 \nyears to an all-time high of $165 billion today.\n  I think these mounting trade deficits should be a loud and clear \nmessage that America should negotiate better trade deals rather than \ngive up congressional responsibility through fast track. To me, these \nexperiences say, ``Go slow. Fast track may well backfire.''\n  Yet, through fast track, we are saying we have to proceed quickly, we \nhave to give up all scrutiny, we have to give up all right of \namendment: do it fast, do it fast.\n  I would like to discuss one area where we face significant concerns. \nRight now, the international financial markets are more complex than \never. Today's international trading picture is more diverse and \ncomplicated than ever before. Take, for example, the currency problems \nsome Southeast Asian nations are experiencing, which may well create a \nvery unanticipated result.\n  Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund announced it is \npreparing an emergency line of credit for Indonesia. The Indonesian \nrupiah has dropped more than 18 percent against the dollar since late \nSeptember. Thailand received a $17 billion loan from an IMF-led \nconsortium in August, which represents the second largest IMF rescue \npackage ever.\n  Indonesia and Thailand now join the Philippines as Asia's former \n``economic tigers'' who have looked for IMF emergency help due to \nfinancial crisis. As you may recall, following NAFTA, the United States \nextended the largest loan package to Mexico when it faced financial \ncrisis and the peso was devalued. Much to Mexico's credit, this loan \nwas promptly and fully repaid.\n  Many knowledgeable people involved in the Pacific rim trading theater \nbelieve these currency fluctuations are very serious harbingers of \nthings to come. In many of these countries, banking practices may also \nbe a subject of concern, with loans extended to those with political \nclout, rather than the most worthy. These currency fluctuations may \nforeshadow major banking scandals in the future.\n  If you combine questionable banking practices with currency \nfluctuations, we may see a scenario in which the only course open to \nsome of these nations is for them to press harder to increase their \nexports and erect import barriers, regardless of what the trade \nagreements say. Further, the United States does not have a great record \nin enforcing many of the agreements that are on the books. As a result, \nU.S. manufacturers would lose exports and market share.\n  Free and fair trade is an integral part of California's economic \nfuture. But under fast track, California's two Senators could very \neasily get rolled despite the State's enormous economic stake. Many \nStates, each with two Senators, don't have nearly the economic \ninterests that we do. My State could face an agreement that very much \ndisadvantages California's industries, and I would have no opportunity \nto try to correct that.\n  We are the leading agricultural State in the Union, home to 10 \npercent of the Nation's food processing employment.\n  The California wine industry is the Nation's leader, producing 75 \npercent of the wine and 90 percent of the wine exports.\n  We are the leading high-technology State, providing 20 percent of the \nNation's jobs in high technology.\n  We lead the Nation in entertainment, providing 50 percent of the \nNation's production.\n  We are home to 5 of the Nation's 10 largest software firms. We are \nthe Nation's leader in biotechnical and pharmaceutical products, \nproviding as much as 30 percent of the Nation's output. Yet, under fast \ntrack, I am asked to give up any opportunity to fight for my State's \ninterests on the floor of the U.S. Senate if they are disadvantaged by \na trade agreement negotiated by the administration. I cannot agree to \nthose restrictions.\n  Let me talk for a moment about specific concerns with S. 1269, the \nFinance Committee bill. I have listened intently to the debate other \nthe past several weeks. I have scrutinized amendments which may be \noffered to this legislation. In my view, the major deficiencies in the \nfast-track legislation before the Senate have not been addressed. In \nsome ways, the legislation before the Senate today is weaker in \naddressing those concerns than in prior fast-track laws.\n  Under S. 1269, trade negotiations that involve issues such as \nprotecting U.S. manufacturing, labor, or environmental standards, \ncannot be included in the fast-track process but will have to be dealt \nwith separately where they could be the target of amendments, Senate \nfilibusters, or bottled up in committee and never see the light of day.\n  Let me give an example. Unlike previous fast-track laws, S. 1269 \nrequires\n\n[[Page S11727]]\n\nthat a provision of a trade agreement, to be entitled to receive the \nprotection of fast track, must be ``directly related to trade.''\n  Previous fast-track laws have provided fast-track benefits to those \nprovisions of an agreement that ``serve the interests of U.S. \ncommerce'' and are ``necessary and appropriate'' to carry out the \nagreement.\n  So what is the practical effect of the changes? If a trade agreement \nincluded a component to fund border cleanup, these cleanup provisions \ncould not be protected by fast-track rules because they are not \nconsidered ``directly related to trade.'' They would have to proceed \nthrough the regular legislative process, subject to amendments, \nfilibusters, with no certainty the provisions would ever receive a \nvote.\n  For example, NAFTA implementing legislation reduced tariffs in \nMexico, Canada, and the United States and created the Border \nEnvironmental Cooperation Commission and the North American Development \nBank to fund environmental cleanup. Although adopted in the NAFTA fast-\ntrack approval process, these two entities would not be eligible for \nfast-track if they were included in a future trade agreement brought \nunder S. 1269's fast-track authority.\n  S. 1269 limits congressional opportunity to remedy worker safety, \nwage, and environmental concerns. Section (2)(b)(15) of the bill seeks \nto prevent foreign governments from ``derogating,'' or reducing, a \ncountry's laws or regulations to provide a competitive advantage to its \ndomestic companies or to attract investment to the country.\n  That sounds good, but what about those countries who have weak or \neven no environmental or labor standards in the first place? There is \nno provision in this legislation that would obligate countries to enact \nfair labor or environmental laws or to remedy serious inequities that \nalready exist between the United States and other countries.\n  Furthermore, because efforts to address these inequities would not be \nconsidered ``directly related to trade,'' any agreement addressing \nthese issues would not be protected under fast-track rules but would be \nsubject to amendment, filibuster, and other procedural rules that could \nprevent them from ever seeing the light of day.\n  Additionally, even in those cases where a country has derogated or \nfailed to enforce environmental or labor laws, S. 1269 sets up an \nimpossible enforcement standard. Not only must the United States prove \nthat a country waived or reduced a law or regulation, but it must also \nprove that it did so to obtain a competitive advantage. Under this \nlegislation, the onus is on the United States to prove a country's \nmotives.\n  Let me give you some examples of the competitive disadvantage U.S. \nmanufacturers would face, disadvantages the United States would be \nunable to require other countries to correct:\n  PCB's and benzene are prohibited in the United States in order to \nprotect public health and safety, but they remain legal, low-cost \nsolvents in Mexico. This reduces a Mexican company's manufacturing and \ncleanup/disposal costs to the disadvantage of United States companies, \nbut raises significant health risks.\n  Mexico has a significant problem monitoring and controlling hazardous \nwaste. Less than 20 percent of the industries producing hazardous waste \nin Mexico, 70 out of 352 industries, report proper hazardous waste \ndisposal. Fewer than 20 percent of those industries meet their \nobligations. A 1995 report indicates that up to a quarter of all \nhazardous waste, about 44 tons daily, originating in the industrial \nborder area in Mexico, the maquiladora area, simply disappears with no \ndocumented end point. No U.S. companies could get away with that. But \ncompanies in Mexico are able to get away with, undermining public \nhealth and safety, and gaining a cost advantage along the way.\n  In Tijuana, 7 miles south of California, lead and arsenic is, today, \ncollecting in an uncontrolled pile. In the United States, these \nmaterials, which are found in every battery, can only be handled in a \n``contained or controlled'' environment to protect against leakage, and \nthey are buried in clay or porcelain-lined pits. In Tijuana, no cleanup \nhas occurred.\n  I would like to offer another example. Molded plastic, such as the \nsimple types of chairs or tables in many backyards, emits toxic fumes \nduring the molding process. In the United States, the fumes must be \ncaptured during manufacturing under what's called an exhaust hood. But \nin Mexico, the cheaper manufacturing process is conducted in open air \nwithout an exhaust system, allowing for the release of the harmful \ntoxins.\n  Now, these are specific, ongoing examples of disparities in \nenvironmental standards that serve as either an inducement for \nmanufacturers to lower their standards, or a competitive disadvantage \nto U.S. manufacturers who are required to meet higher standards to \nprotect public health and safety. They also are part of the sucking \nsound that Ross Perot described, in which U.S. industries are drawn to \nMexico to manufacture, because they don't have to abide by the higher \nstandards in the United States. There is no remedy for this under this \nfast-track law.\n  Without a remedy available as part of trade negotiations, these \ndisparities in standards only encourage the flow of more jobs to areas \nwith the lowest standards and, hence, the lowest manufacturing cost. \nThe low-cost areas will include many Asian countries in the future.\n  Now, I would also like to give you a specific example illustrating \nthe problems and why I feel so strongly. The example involves the \nCalifornia wine industry, which represents 75 percent of the Nation's \noutput of wine and 90 percent of the Nation's wine export products.\n  NAFTA had an immediate negative impact on the California wine \nindustry. Coincident with NAFTA, Mexico gave Chilean wines an immediate \ntariff reduction, from 20 to 8 percent, and a guarantee of duty-free \nstatus within 1 year. By contrast, United States wines face a 10-year \nphaseout of a much higher Mexican tariff, disadvantaging them in the \nMexican market.\n  The result was predictable: United States wine exports to Mexico, \nfollowing NAFTA, dropped by one-third, while Chilean wine exports to \nMexico nearly doubled. Chilean wine picked up the market share lost by \nUnited States wineries dominated by California.\n  During the NAFTA debate, the administration pledged, in writing, to \ncorrect inequities within 120 days of NAFTA's approval. I would like to \nquote from a letter from the U.S. Trade Representative:\n\n       . . . I will personally negotiate the immediate reduction \n     of Mexican tariffs on U.S. wines to the level of Mexican \n     tariffs on Chilean wines and, thereafter, have hem fall \n     parallel with future reductions in such tariffs.\n\n  You would think that at least by today, 3\\1/2\\ years later, the \ntariffs would be equal. Not so. Three and one-half years later, they \nremain enshrined in law and there seems to be nothing we can do about \nit.\n  As a matter of fact, as a result of an unrelated trade dispute, \nMexico actually raised tariffs on United States wine to the pre-NAFTA \nlevel of 20 percent, an increase above the 14 percent rate it had \nreached. The 20-percent tariff remains in effect today, representing a \nwipeout of United States market share to the Chilean wine entering \nMexico.\n  From Mexico's standpoint, the strategy is clear. You keep the tariffs \nup for a period of time, eliminate United States market share, and \nanother country comes in that doesn't face those tariffs and builds up \nsales and market share. That is exactly what has happened, chapter and \nverse.\n  GATT, which I supported, also contained monumental inequities for \nthis important industry. This time, the problem was in the European \nUnion, and this is how it worked. Even though the United States had the \nlowest tariffs of any major wine producer, United States negotiators \nagreed in the Uruguay round to drop our tariffs by 36 percent over 6 \nyears, while the world's largest wine producer, the European Union, \ndropped its tariffs by only 10 percent.\n  As a result, the current U.S. tariff on all wine products is an \naverage of 2.4 percent, compared to the EU's current average tariff is \n13 percent.\n\n  GATT also disadvantaged California's entertainment industry, which \nallowed European restrictions on U.S. programming to persist. Europe \ndidn't accept the GATT commitments on the audio-visual services. \nInstead, the EU\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\nmaintained its 1989 European Union Broadcast Directive, which limits \nthe market for U.S. movies and television broadcasting. France, for \nexample, requires that 40 percent of all feature films and transmission \ntime must be of French origin, while 60 percent must be of EU origin, \nleaving only 40 percent of the market open for United States \ncompetition.\n  So, you see, GATT and NAFTA, both the product of fast-track during my \ntime here in the Senate, left California industries with significant \ndisadvantages. During those negotiations, I called the administration \nand I said, ``These are huge industries in my State and they will be \nhurt under this agreement.'' And I was effectively rolled. Why should \nI, or any Member of this body, give up our opportunity to stand on this \nSenate floor and move an amendment to protect an industry within our \nState?\n  That is what fast-track does, ladies and gentlemen. That is what \nfast-track does.\n  Through fast-track, we knowingly abrogate our responsibility, despite \nthe requirements of the Constitution of the United States, article I, \nsection 8, which gives that authority to the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  As I said earlier, if I were President, I might want fast-track \nauthority. I am not; I am a U.S. Senator. I am elected to protect the \npeople and the industries and the workers in my State.\n  Now, there are ways that the legislation can be strengthened. One is \nto require that tariffs in other countries be reduced first, before we \ncommit to deeper reductions in already lower United States tariff \nlevels. All too often, the price of modest tariff reductions abroad is \ndeeper reductions in the United States. U.S. producers need a level \nplaying field.\n  Another important area for improvement is stronger enforcement. We \nneed stronger enforcement tools, if trade barriers are not lowered as \nprovided for in the agreement. A recent report from the American \nChamber of Commerce in Japan said more effort must be dedicated to \nenforcement of existing trade agreements.\n  We can have appropriate environment and labor incentives built into \nthese agreements.\n  I have always believed that the American dream was that workers on a \nplant production line, by dint of his or her work, could buy a home, \nbuy a car and earn enough to send his or her kids to school. The \nAmerican dream, to me, has always been that, by dint of labor, you can \nhave all of the opportunities in this great country.\n  I didn't run for the U.S. Senate to preside over the diminution of \nthe California worker or the American worker. I didn't run for the U.S. \nSenate to see that a 60 cents an hour minimum wage standard would \nprevail. I ran for the U.S. Senate to try to see that this American \ndream enables somebody, by the dint of their labor, to buy a home, buy \na car and send their kids to good schools, so that the next generation \ncan do better than the previous generation. I don't think that is an \nunrealistic dream. It has always been the dream of America. We can have \nappropriate environment and labor incentives.\n  Another area for reform is an effective dispute-resolution process. \nFarmers face phytosanitary disputes on the border all the time. \nArbitrarily, countries and border agents can deny access to products \nlike wheat in China or grapes in Australia or citrus in another country \nbecause of some claim somewhere. These barriers may have little basis \nin science or public health, but may reflect political judgments.\n  In conclusion, let me only say that I represent a huge State. I don't \nserve on the Finance Committee. The only opportunity I have to protect \nthe industries and people of my State is the ability to stand up on \nthis floor and introduce an amendment and say to the administration, \n``If you do this, I am going to filibuster the bill, I am going to \namend the bill, and I am going to protect the people of my State.''\n  Fast track is a total surrendering of this ability, without knowing \nwhat agreements are coming down the pike, without knowing what I am \ngoing to be asked to accept, or the industries are going to be asked to \ndo. Fast track has to be reviewed in that framework because that is the \ntrue framework in which this decision is going to be made.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I speak on behalf of the passage of the \nlegislation which will soon be before us which will authorize the \nPresident to enter into negotiations on behalf of this Nation as it \nrelates to trade and trade-related matters.\n  Mr. President, we refer to this legislation as fast track. As with a \nnumber of other policy issues here in Washington, I consider these \nwords to be nondescript. They do not convey what it is we are being \nasked to vote upon.\n  This legislation first establishes a framework within which the \nPresident of the United States can conduct negotiations. In essence, it \nis analogous to a board of directors of an organization telling its \nexecutive that it can negotiate a particular contract but stipulating \nwhat the conditions of that contract must be and what the limits of the \nnegotiating authority are. When that negotiation reaches a conclusion, \nand if that conclusion is a trade agreement, when that agreement is \nreturned to the Congress where the Congress has a single ``yes'' or \n``no'' vote but cannot modify the agreement, and in the case of the \nSenate surrender some of the prerogatives relative to extension of \ndebate and other procedural advantages which are normally available to \nus as individual Members of the Senate, the question is, why will the \nCongress today be willing to do this? Why have Congresses over the past \ntwo or three decades been willing to pass such legislation and transfer \na portion of their authority to the President? The answer is very \nsimple. That is, if we do not do this, we don't have the opportunity to \nenter into trade negotiations because our trading partners will not \ncome to the table.\n  Why would countries like Great Britain, France, Argentina, and Japan \nnot want to come to negotiate with the United States unless the \nPresident had this authority? Most of those countries have some form of \na parliamentary form of government in which the executive branch and \nthe legislative branch are effectively merged. Therefore, when the \nPrime Minister speaks on behalf of the Government of the United \nKingdom, as an example, he or she is not only speaking as the head of \nthe executive branch but speaking as the head of the legislative branch \nand as the head of the political coalition which controls the \nGovernment. So what the Prime Minister says at the negotiating table \nthere is the political capability and expectation of his or her ability \nto deliver on behalf of the Government of the United Kingdom.\n  In the case of the United States, we don't have this integration of \nthe executive and the legislative branch, and frequently the President \nis not the head of a coalition that effectively controls Government. We \nhave one of those examples today in which the President is of one \npolitical party, the leadership of the Congress is of another. So our \ntrading partners would say, why should I sit down with the President to \nnegotiate the best agreement that I can? And, like all agreements, \ntrade agreements contain a heavy component of compromise. You gain some \nbenefits in area A, and you give some benefits in area B in order to \nreach an agreement that both sides will feel is advantageous. Our \ntrading partners would say, why would we agree to such a treaty knowing \nthat then Congress is going to come back, and in area B where we got \nour principal benefits they will try to offer a series of amendments to \nstrip us of those benefits?\n\n  So the product that would finally emerge would not be one that both \nsides would feel is balanced and that can be supported.\n  So, the reason that we have this process is because without it we \nnever get to the question of whether we would have a negotiated \nagreement because the other parties would not sit with us to enter into \nthat discussion.\n  So, this is fundamentally a question of does the United States wish \nto negotiate trade agreements, or do we wish to sit in the stands while \nthe other nations of the world negotiate trade agreements that will \nhave an impact upon us?\n  I know that this debate is heavily affected by history. Much of that \nhistory\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\nis a result of the North American Free-Trade Agreement and negative \nexperiences that people have had under the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement.\n  I come from a State that has felt that sting of the North American \nFree-Trade Agreement, particularly as it relates to agriculture. Our \ncongressional delegation was very concerned about this in the days \nleading up to the final vote on the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement. We secured what we thought were some protective \nunderstandings from the administration. And I am sad to say that \nthrough a combination of inadequate enforcement and a failure to keep \ncommitments we were very disappointed, and many sectors of our \nagricultural industry were adversely affected. Learning from this \nlesson--not what some have learned, which is we should wash our hands \nof this process and have nothing more to do with attempting to \nnegotiate trade agreements, or to be involved when other people are \nnegotiating trade agreements--the lesson that I and others have learned \nis this time we are going to put these concerns into writing in the \nlegislation which sets the parameters for the negotiation and not \ndepend upon promises of what will happen after the negotiation has been \nconcluded.\n  So, in this fast-track legislation as passed by the Senate Finance \nCommittee there are a number of provisions that are intended to provide \nthat enhanced level of confidence that agreements reached will be \nagreements enforced, that commitments made will be commitments \nrealized.\n  Let me just quote from page 8 of the Finance Committee's version of \nthis legislation beginning on line 6:\n\n       Agriculture: The principal negotiating objectives of the \n     United States with respect to agriculture are in addition to \n     those set forth in various sections of the Food Security Act \n     of 1985 to achieve on an expedited basis to the maximum \n     extent feasible more open and fair conditions of trade in \n     agricultural commodities by . . .\n\n  And then a series of specific points are mentioned. Let me refer to \nthree of those specific points.\n\n       Specific requirements for negotiators to account for the \n     unique problems of perishable agricultural products, \n     including disciplines on restrictive or trade distorting \n     import and export practices;\n       Two: Requirements to address market access for the United \n     States agricultural products, including removing unjustified \n     sanitary and phytosanitary restrictions;\n       Three: Protection against unfair trade practices, including \n     State subsidies, dumping, and export targeting practices.\n\n  All of those, Mr. President, and more are listed in the fast-track \nlegislation that is before us.\n  In addition to that, in the report language submitted by the Senate \nFinance Committee, there is a requirement for the President to account \nfor foreign unfair or trade distorting practices for specific sectors, \nparticularly perishable agricultural products, citrus fruit, and fruit \njuices.\n  So, we have learned some of the lessons of the recent past and are \nnow applying those lessons in terms of the parameters of \nthe negotiation in this fast-track agreement.\n\n  Why do we need to be there in the first place? We had this experience \nin the recent past. Why not just step back, defend our position in \nAmerica, and let the rest of the world take its place?\n  I believe, Mr. President, that we are facing a stark choice; that is, \na choice as to whether the United States is to maintain its leadership \nposition in the world, to be at the table writing the rules of \ninternational trade so that those rules will take into consideration \nour circumstances, our expectations, and our economic interests. Or, \nare we to retreat from the world, and allow others to write the rules \nto their advantage?\n  Mr. President, we represent only 4 percent of the customers of the \nworld. Ninety-six percent of the people on this planet are not \nresidents of the United States of America. We cannot maintain our \ngrowing economy and its standard of living unless we reach out to that \n96 percent of our fellow human beings who do not live in our country. \nWe cannot maintain our current record level of economic growth and \nexpansion and prosperity and full employment without active trade. The \nUnited States has already opened its borders to foreign goods. We have \nrecognized the benefit to our people of having access to goods and \nservices that are produced outside the United States. We have done so \nmost dramatically by reducing our tariffs to an average level of 2 \npercent. That is the average level of tariff on products coming into \nthe United States. But our products going out of the United States \ntrying to reach that 96 percent of mankind who are not U.S. residents \nface tariffs that exceed 10 percent on average.\n  As an example, the country which is specifically mentioned in this \nlegislation as being authorized for the President to negotiate \nmembership in the North American Free-Trade Agreement is Chile. In \nFebruary of last year, I visited Santiago. We learned from the United \nStates-Chilean Chamber of Commerce that the average tariff against \nUnited States products in Chile is 11 percent. The average United \nStates tariff against Chilean products is the 2 percent, which is the \nworldwide average.\n  In a discussion with several businesses, some of which are United \nStates, some of which are non-United States, as to what would be the \neffect of the United States entering into an agreement which would \nreduce Chilean tariffs against United States products, the answer was \nuniversally that it would lead to a substantial increase in the Chilean \npurchase of United States products.\n  As an example, one firm that was in the boat building and boat repair \nbusiness said that they bought their sheet steel and their machine \ntools from Europe because at the current level of tariffs Europe was \nmore economically competitive, but that with a lowering of Chilean \ntariffs against United States products, the opening of a free trade \nrelationship between the United States and Chile, they would shift \ntheir purchases of those products to the United States to the \nsubstantial benefit of our country.\n  Chile is a relatively small country, a population of about 15 \nmillion. It is about the same size as my State of Florida. But it is a \ncountry which has had a dynamic market-driven economic growth over \nrecent years. It has had a powerful influence on other developing \ncountries in South America, and in the world. Establishing this \nrelationship with Chile would be a strong United States recognition of \nthe progress that this country has made, and an encouragement for \nothers to follow Chile's example.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, most of the debate about fast track has \nin fact focused on our own hemisphere, and specifically on the \nexpansion of the North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n  That is certainly an important part of this fast-track authority, but \nit may be secondary in its importance to the U.S. economy to a series \nof important sectoral negotiations which are going to commence under \nthe GATT agreement to which we have already agreed.\n  Under the GATT agreement beginning in the next few years, there will \nbe a series of negotiations on specific economic sectors. I would like \nto focus on one of those sectors which will be the topic of \nnegotiations in 1999. And that is agriculture. This is important to us \nbecause agriculture represents the area of trade in which the United \nStates has the greatest surplus with the world. The largest area in \nwhich the United States has an advantage in terms of export over import \nis in agricultural products.\n  What are we going to be trying to accomplish at the 1999 agricultural \nsectoral negotiations? Some of the objectives of the United States will \ninclude reducing foreign tariffs in consultation with the U.S. \nagricultural industry on fruits and vegetables. Today, for example, \nJapan imposes a tariff on oranges which is as high as 40 percent. Other \ncountries have similarly high tariffs on citrus products and other \nprocessed fruits and vegetables. One of our principal negotiating \nobjectives will be to drive down those barriers to U.S. agricultural \nproducts in important markets.\n  Another objective will be to increase or eliminate tariff rate \nquotas. These are the limits on the amount of goods that the United \nStates can export to a country before it faces high and often \npreventive levels of tariffs. We want to see those quota limits as high \nas possible or totally eliminated. This is another important objective \nof our negotiations.\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\n  Mr. President, our distinguished chairman has asked to have the floor \nreturned to him, and I shall do so by just summarizing to say that two \nother important agricultural objectives are to eliminate export \nsubsidies and to eliminate state trading enterprises which have both \ndistorted the agricultural market. If we do not pass this legislation, \nthe United States will not be at the table in 1999. We will not have \nthe opportunity to advance our goals.\n  There are risks involved in extending to this President the same \nauthority that we have granted to Presidents over the last two decades, \nbut I believe the greater risk for the United States is to stand on the \nsidelines and let others write the rules that will determine our \neconomic well-being. I believe the United States needs to be there. We \nneed to be there with a sense of strength, pride, and confidence in our \nability to negotiate an agreement. And if the President is found to \nhave acted in a foolish way that is contrary to U.S. interests, we have \nthe responsibility and the power to reject that agreement with a \ndecisive ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership which our chairman has \ngiven on this matter. I know what a strong supporter he has been on the \nissues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the draft of an \namendment which I intend to offer, assuming that we move to proceed to \nthis matter, which relates to increased enforcement responsibility for \nthe executive branch relative to any treaties that it might negotiate.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            amendment no. --\n\n (Purpose: To require a plan for the implementation and enforcement of \n trade agreements implemented pursuant to the trade agreement approval \n                              procedures)\n\n       On page 41, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following \n     new section and redesignate the remaining sections and cross \n     references thereto accordingly.\n\n     SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       At the time the President submits the final text of the \n     agreement pursuant to section 5(a)(1)(C), the President shall \n     also submit a plan for implementing and enforcing the \n     agreement.

Mr. President, with that, I again express my appreciation \nto our chairman for his leadership and urge our colleagues to follow \nthat leadership by supporting this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the distinguished Senator for his words of support.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, might I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the presentation by the Senator from South Dakota, I be \nallowed to yield up to 20 minutes to the Senator from Colorado?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and thank him for his leadership on this extraordinarily \nimportant issue for our Nation.\n  I rise in support of the motion to proceed on fast-track negotiating \nauthority, and I rise as one who as a Member of the other body cast a \nvote ``no'' on NAFTA and ``yes'' on GATT, and one who appreciates that \nthe judgment on the final merits of negotiated trade agreements is \nsomething that comes next; that what we have at hand here is a critical \nprocedural issue about whether in fact this administration, as past \nadministrations, will have the authority to go forward to at least be \nat the table on trade arrangements.\n  So I am very mindful that today we are talking about process and not \na final trade agreement, and that all of us as Members of this Senate \nwill reserve our judgment on the merits of whatever negotiated \nagreement comes back to us for our ratification.\n  The Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1997 simply provides the same \nbasic structure and authority for this President as has been provided \nfor past Presidents of both political parties back to President Ford. \nAnd if anything, this act strengthens the hand of Congress. It provides \nfor more notification, more consultation, and in fact explicitly \nrestricts Presidential authority in areas not specified in the act. The \nability to negotiate under fast track has in fact expired with the \napproval of the Uruguay round of 1994, and we find ourselves now with \ngreat urgency having to deal with this procedural issue.\n  I think we need to understand, Mr. President, that we go forward or \nbackward on trade. There is no such thing as the status quo. We live in \na nation that historically has had very few restrictions on the import \nof products into our Nation. Most of the trade barriers that need to be \ndealt with in this world are barriers to the export of our goods \nabroad. If the United States does not lead on trade, the harsh reality \nis that others will displace our role with arrangements of their own \nthat may very likely be harmful to the American economy, to American \nworkers, to American jobs, and certainly to American agriculture.\n  Even in this hemisphere there are others who seek to displace the \nAmerican leadership role. The European Union currently is attempting to \nnegotiate trade agreements with leading South American nations by 1990, \nclaiming that their future is with Europe rather than with the United \nStates. Other bilateral, other regional arrangements are in the process \nof being negotiated. All of this goes forward with the United States on \nthe sideline unless we extend this authority to the President because \nit is only by being engaged in international trade that we can expect \nto lead toward not only our economic prosperity but democracy, \nsecurity, and improvement of the environment, dealing with drugs, \ndealing with terrorism, dealing with weapons of mass destruction.\n  The United States cannot be a leader for human rights but neglect its \nrole on trade. I think it is important for the Members of this body to \nrecognize that what we have before us is not a referendum on NAFTA. It \nis not a referendum on any previous trade agreement. It is, in fact, an \nacknowledgement that we live, however, in an interglobal economy, that \nwe live in that reality, and that reality requires us to become \ninvolved in engagement and in a leadership role. Cowering behind walls \nof fear about trade does a disservice to us all, including workers, the \nenvironment and human rights.\n  The United States represents only 4 percent of the world's population \nbut 21 percent of the world's gross domestic product. It ought to be \nobvious to us all how critically important trade is to the United \nStates.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, 1 of every 3 acres of land \nthroughout the State planted to crops is in effect planted for the \nexport market. We simply cannot allow other nations to forge regional \nand bilateral trade arrangements without the United States even being \nat the table. And that is the question, that is the fundamental \nquestion before this Senate: will we bring the United States to the \ntable to be a player, to be a leader, or will the United States cower \non the sidelines and allow other nations to go forward with \narrangements that may or may not be beneficial to American workers and \nthe American economy?\n  Fast track is not about a particular trade agreement. It is not about \npolitics, although there are, admittedly, some in the other body who \nwould tie this agreement to collateral, unrelated issues involving \ninternational family planning or even antipublic school agendas, and so \non. Hopefully, this will not be brought down by those kinds of\n\n[[Page S11731]]\n\nirrelevant side issues. We should not be involved in ideology. What in \nfact we have here is an issue that is about jobs, about economic \ngrowth, about world competitiveness.\n  Other nations simply will not put forth their best offers at the \ntable with our trade representatives if they know they will then have \nto renegotiate the entire matter with coalitions of Members of Congress \nand unending domestic political turmoil in our own Nation.\n  Trade is critically important to my own State of South Dakota. Its \nexport trade has increased from $700 million to $1.2 billion in the \npast 5 years. Demand continues to grow. But, in fact, so does \ncompetition from suppliers, and the need for fair trade and fair access \ncontinues to be great. I am pleased with the administration's \nagricultural initiatives. I am pleased with their support for S. 219, \nof which I am a cosponsor, the Value Added Agricultural Products Market \nAccess Act of 1997, which would allow for the U.S. Trade Representative \non a annual basis to identify nations that deny market access for value \nadded U.S. agricultural products or that apply standards for import \nfrom the United States not related to protecting human, animal, or \nplant life or health and not based on science.\n  Our red meat exports are now at a record level of $2.4 billion. I am \npleased that the administration has directed the Secretary of \nAgriculture to improve the availability of livestock import data, and \nthe Secretary of Agriculture, in cooperation with the livestock \nindustry, to work on guidelines for voluntary labeling of meat and meat \nfood products.\n  Agricultural exports nationally have grown 50 percent from 1990 to \n1996, from $40 billion to a now record $60 billion. And in the current \nenvironment where we no longer have a farm price support system in \nplace, it is all the more important that every possible tool be brought \nto bear to expand farm income, farm prices, and the competitiveness of \none of America's great economic sectors.\n  I am pleased that agriculture will, in fact, be an explicit goal of \nthe President's negotiating authority.\n  So again, Mr. President, this is not a referendum on past trade \nagreements, but it is a referendum on whether the United States will \ncontinue to be a leader or even a participant in international trade or \nwhether we will succumb to fear, whether we will in fact enter the 21st \ncentury in retreat rather than as the global leader in economic issues, \nwhich this Nation deserves and which this Nation needs.\n  I yield back my time to the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, as we debate whether to proceed to the \nconsideration of S. 1269, and on the larger question whether to provide \nthe administration with fast-track authority, we have heard a number of \narguments for and against this issue. As the debate continues, I \nsuppose we will hear some things repeated over and over from different \ncolleagues. I don't know a Senator, though--I think I can honestly say \nI don't know a Senator in this body who does not want to do what is \nbest for American workers, American families, American farmers, \nAmerican consumers, and the Nation at large.\n  I think most of us, certainly me, certainly Senator Dorgan, believe \nthat we are protrade. We believe that international trade is important. \nWe know that we would like to see a time when there are very few \nbarriers, very few tariffs, very few quotas--if any. I know, as many of \nmy colleagues do, that if we had no barriers whatsoever, American \nmanufacturers, farmers, producers could compete with anyone and in fact \nwin in that competition on a level playing field. It seems ironic to me \nthat we will go through this effort on legislation that, if it \nultimately does pass both the House and Senate, will limit the \ndeliberative and representative processes that are now at the heart of \nthe legislative branch of Government.\n  Essentially, fast track provides the administration with the \nassurance that any trade agreement it negotiates will come to Congress \nas a privileged piece of legislation. That means Congress must consider \na trade agreement within 90 days of when the administration formally \nsubmits it to this body. In addition, there will be no hearings, no \nmarkups. The enacting bill will go to the floors of both the House and \nthe Senate where debate is limited to 20 hours and no amendments are \nallowed.\n  Mr. President, 20 hours of debate is not very long for an important \nissue such as international trade, when you consider there are 100 \nSenators whose States are heavily impacted by an extensive agreement, \nsuch as NAFTA was. It seems even more ludicrous to believe that the 20 \nhours of debate in the other body, the House, with 435 Members, would \nprovide a fair hearing. That would come out to about 3 minutes per \nMember, as I understand it. Finally, after the debate is finished, the \nHouse and the Senate would only be able to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on \nthe entire agreement. For such an agreement, such as NAFTA, that \ntranslates into a vote on a document of about 1,000 pages long with no \npublic input whatsoever.\n  Fast-track authority is truly a unique procedure. If this authority \nis granted to the administration, Congress is essentially giving the \nPresident powers that I believe are supposed to be reserved for this \nbody in our Constitution. First, it allows the President to control the \nagenda and determine when trade agreements are considered. More \nimportant, and second, it gives the President the authority to actually \nwrite the legislation upon which Congress will act. Added on top of \nthis is the fact that I, as just one Member of the Senate, would not be \nallowed to offer any amendments on the final enacting bill, whether I \nliked it or disliked it. I am sure many of our colleagues have not yet \ndecided how they will vote, and I certainly can count as well as \nanybody, and I think probably the tide might be going against us. But I \nfor one do not believe we were elected to be rubber stamps for the \nadministration, and on fast track that simply reduces this body to \nrubberstamp status.\n  Article I, section 8, of the Constitution of the United States of \nAmerica provides Congress with the authority to regulate commerce with \nforeign nations. The Constitution also gives the President the \nauthority to negotiate with foreign countries. So let's not be misled \nwhen people say the President needs fast-track authority in order to \nnegotiate. He can do that at any time. This is simply not true. Fast-\ntrack authority gives the President additional powers which our \nFounding Fathers had reserved solely for the Congress.\n  I don't believe most of us are isolationists. I believe in free \ntrade. In fact, in this day and age I think we all understand and agree \nthat free trade is an important direction to go. But, quite frankly, I \nthink many us do not support these pell-mell rushes to judgment. We get \ntired of the old argument that anyone who opposes fast track must be a \nprotectionist and that the opponents of fast track are trying to hinder \nfree trade.\n  I have to tell you, if it got right down to who we are supposed to \nprotect, whether it's the CEO's of multinational corporations or \nforeign-owned corporations or American corporations and American jobs, \nI would have to plead guilty that I prefer to protect our jobs and our \ncorporations and our country. But these kinds of claims sound like \nsomething from a tabloid, designed to stir the emotions of the American \npublic.\n  I think, more important, when we talk about free trade we also have \nto link it to what is fair. We often hear that bandied around--fair \ntrade. Like many of my colleagues, I am sorely disappointed in some of \nour past trade agreements that this country has entered into because I \ndon't think they were, basically, fair to us. Before we continue to \noffer this extraordinary power to the administration, I think Congress \nhas a responsibility to review past policies. Senator Dorgan has done a \nmarvelous job. I think he has done it very well, pointing out the trade \ndeficit, as an example. With every trade agreement we have made under \nfast track in the past, the trade deficit has actually gone up for \nAmerica and not down. We got the worst end of every single agreement \nthat was negotiated under fast track.\n  For those who argue that if we fail to grant fast-track authority to \nthe President, other countries will refuse to negotiate with the United \nStates and the United States won't even be allowed to\n\n[[Page S11732]]\n\nsit at the negotiating table, that is absolutely ludicrous. This is the \nlargest economy in the world. There will always be a place at the table \nfor any international agreements.\n  Let's consider that fast track has been used only five times. Yet \nwithout it, the Clinton administration, as an example, has successfully \nnegotiated 198 agreements. I think that speaks for itself whether fast \ntrack is needed. We are an economic powerhouse. The world knows that. \nIt is in the best interests of other countries throughout the world to \nnegotiate with us. That is evidenced by the 198 agreements that our \ntrade representatives are so proud of that did not need fast track. So \nwe really ought to do away with these scare tactics that are kind of \ndesigned to stampede us like sheep to voting for something in the last \nwaning days of Congress without giving it a slow, deliberative \nunderstanding of what we are going to do and what we are going to put \nin place.\n  Supporters say we need the agreements so we don't get bogged down in \nCongress and load it with amendments. I understand this is a slow \nprocess, and we are often accused of taking too much time. We often do \nadd many things to the amendments. But I think most of those amendments \nare done in good faith. But if we are sent here to try to deal with \ngood, fair trade agreements, I don't think there is a big problem. I \ndon't think we should have to worry about it that much without fast \ntrack. The bottom line is we are here to represent this Nation and our \nown constituents from the States from which we were elected.\n\n  I know my constituents did not vote for me to send me here to this \ngreat institution to give away their voice, to not let them be involved \nin it. I think most Senators feel the same way. We didn't get elected \nto represent Mexico or Chile or Japan or some other country. We got \nelected primarily to represent this Nation and our own States.\n  I realize that this debate over granting fast-track authority to the \nadministration is not to be a critique of NAFTA. But if fast track has \nbeen used only five times, then we have no choice but to bring up NAFTA \nif we are going to consider the merits of fast track. Just about 4 \nyears ago, Congress passed NAFTA implementing legislation, and that was \nan over-1,000-page document. It was hailed as a major achievement that \nwould create jobs and not cost jobs in America. I concede that NAFTA \nhas benefited several segments of our society. There is no question \nabout that. But I think, looking at it in toto, it has cost more than \nit has gained.\n  Jobs is the perfect example. In October, 1993, I sent a letter with \nseveral other Senators to the U.S. Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, \nin which I asked about the potential loss of jobs and what the \nadministration planned to do about displaced workers.\n  In his response to me in November, 1993, Mr. Kantor replied that \n``NAFTA would account for no more than 400,000 jobs lost over 15 \nyears.'' I quote that directly from his letter. Perhaps those 400,000 \njobs aren't important to some people--unless it's your job or unless \nit's the breadwinner of your household. Then it becomes very important.\n  While I heard a whole number of figures on the number of jobs created \nby NAFTA used as evidence of NAFTA's success, many of those figures \nseem to discuss jobs that have been created basically as a result of \nincreased U.S. growth that would have happened with or without NAFTA. \nMany of them dealt with the service industry jobs, too, but not hard, \nwell-paying manufacturing jobs. I know that we need to increase our \nexports, and I think that we are trying to do that. We need to look at \nthat in balance, about our imports, too.\n  The Economic Policy Institute did just that. According to the \nInstitute's recently released study, 394,835 jobs have been lost as a \nresult of NAFTA. That was a net loss of jobs. I don't hardly consider \nthat a success in our negotiating deals with foreign countries. I \nbelieve we simply cannot have a strong nation if we do not have a \nstrong manufacturing base. Those jobs that left primarily were \nmanufacturing jobs. If, Heaven forbid, we should get into some major \ninternational conflict, there is simply no way we are going to field \nstrong military might from America if we have to import all of our \nparts for our apparatus from foreign countries.\n  In effect, we might ask the question: Did it help workers anywhere? \nIn my opinion it certainly didn't help the workers in Mexico under the \nNAFTA that we did pass. The maquiladora factories that sprang up \novernight across the border are still paying poor wages, a dollar an \nhour or less in most jobs. Many of the workers live in substandard \nhousing. Their children drink contaminated water. There is still a high \nincidence of sickness among those children. So it didn't help workers \non our side of the border, and it didn't help workers on the other side \nof the border either.\n  The problem is, we are coming close, now, to our targeted adjournment \ndate, perhaps this Friday. And to meet that date, we may be forced to \nconsider fast track within a more limited amount of time than we should \nto be dealing with this issue.\n  But I think Senators will do the right thing. They will do what they \ncan. Those of us who disagree with it, as he does, certainly commend \nSenator Dorgan for the leadership role he has taken. I believe it is \ntime America stopped being referred to around the world as ``Uncle \nSucker'' and return to that status that we had at one time being Uncle \nSam, a nation of proud workers, manufacturing good-quality material for \nthe rest of the world.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes \nto introduce a bill as in morning business at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1373 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the time, I understand, is winding down \nuntil 5 o'clock when we have a vote this afternoon on the motion to \nproceed. I wanted to take just a few minutes to comment on some of the \nthings that we have heard in the last couple of hours. I believe \nSenator Hollings is on his way to the floor. He will be taking some \ntime. We have several other speakers on this side. But I would like to \ntake a moment to respond to a couple of the things that we have heard.\n  First of all, I feel this is a good debate. It is about time we had \nthis debate in this Chamber. Many of us have wanted to have a \ndiscussion about trade and trade issues for some long while. But the \nopportunity to do that has been limited. Now that fast track has been \nbrought to the floor of the Senate is a very good and useful \nopportunity for that debate.\n  A speaker a couple of hours ago came to the floor of the Senate and \nsaid the problem that he has on this issue is the American people don't \nunderstand trade. It occurs to me that the American people understand \ntrade. They well understand the trade issue. It occurs to me that some \nof the people here in Washington, DC--yes, maybe even in Congress--\ndon't understand trade.\n  When the American people see a trade strategy that results in 21 \nstraight years of trade deficits, getting worse year after year, \nsetting new records year after year, I think the American people \nunderstand that there is a problem. That is just lost, apparently, on \nsome Members of this Chamber, and perhaps some administrations who are \nengaged in trade policies that are not working.\n\n  So I think it is not accurate to suggest that the American people \ndon't understand trade. Oh, they understand it all right. They \nunderstand it when they see factories close and move to Mexico or move \nto Indonesia or move to Sri Lanka. They understand it when they see \ntheir jobs leaving. They understand it when they can't compete with \nproducts that are produced at 12-cents-an-hour labor or without the \nrequirement to clean up their emissions or without the requirement to \nhave a safe workplace. The American people understand that. And, that \nis precisely what drives a lot of this discussion.\n  We are told there are 50 chief executive officers of major \ncorporations on\n\n[[Page S11733]]\n\nCapitol Hill today lobbying and discussing with Members of Congress why \nfast track is important. The point I would like to make is that there \nis not necessarily a parallel interest between our country's interest \nand the interests of the American people and these 50 CEO's who have an \ninterest in maximizing profits for their stockholders.\n  It is likely, in fact, it is certain, that in a number of board rooms \nand executive offices in this country that the chief executive officers \nmust evaluate where can they produce more cheaply. Each of these CEO's \nis asking, ``Where can I move my manufacturing jobs? Where can I and \nhow can I shut my factory here and move the jobs overseas in order to \naccess cheaper labor, in order to escape the requirements of air \npollution and water pollution laws, or in order to escape OSHA and the \nrequirements of a safe workplace? Where can I do that, without giving \nmuch thought as to whether it benefits the American economy, but in \norder to maximize my corporate profits?''\n  That would be the interest, it seems to me, of most CEO's: the return \nto the shareholder and the maximization of corporate profits. That is \nnot necessarily parallel with the interests of our country. It might \nwell be that the parochial interests of a corporation to move its \nproduction facilities to Indonesia or to move its production facilities \nto Thailand or Sri Lanka is in the company's best interest, but \ncertainly not in our country's best interest.\n  So we will, I assume, hear from CEO's today with many of them on \nCapitol Hill helping President Clinton push for fast-track trade \nauthority.\n  The point I make is that their interest is not necessarily parallel \nto the interests of this country. I am not saying they are un-American. \nI am just saying they have an interest in disconnecting from American \nmanufacturing where they can maximize profits by moving their \nmanufacturing elsewhere, and that is not necessarily in this country's \ninterest.\n  A statement earlier this morning brought a smile to me. It was a \nstatement by one of the speakers who said, ``What we have here are two \nsides: One believes in free trade.'' It is like ``We are on that \nside,'' they say, ``and we believe in free trade, motherhood and \ntourism. So we are good guys.''\n  You can't wear hats in the Senate or whomever said that would \ncertainly have put on a huge white hat. It undoubtedly would be a very \nlarge white hat. Then he would have thrown dark hats somewhere to the \nother side of the Senate, because this speaker said that you believe in \nfree trade and expanded American economic opportunity, or you believe \nin going to a kind of North Korea, building a wall around your country \nand then going to hide under a rock. That was the example.\n  That is, obviously, the first argument one hears in a debate about \ntrade by someone who wants to describe the opponents as being unworthy \nand possessing arguments totally without merit: ``We are for free \ntrade; you're a North Korea kind of person, you want to put up a wall \nand go hide under a rock.''\n  The fact is, no one that I have heard speak is talking about putting \nup walls around our country. I voted against fast track previously. I \nbelieve in expanded trade. I don't believe in putting up walls. I \nbelieve our economic health is tied to our ability to expand economic \nopportunity through trade. I just happen to believe our current trade \nstrategy doesn't do that nearly as effectively as we could if we as a \ncountry had a little bit of nerve and some will to say to our trading \npartners, ``You have a responsibility to us, and that responsibility is \nto open your market to American producers.''\n\n  The Washington Post editorial is not a surprise, obviously. The \nWashington Post has been blowing a trumpet for this trade strategy all \nthe way up the trade deficit chart, year after year, as bigger deficits \ngrew. Year after year, the Post has given merits to this failed trade \nstrategy. The Washington Post says the following about the position of \nthose of us who have opposed fast track:\n\n       To a large extent, this is simply putting new clothes on \n     old-fashioned protectionism, but fast-track opponents also \n     make an argument geared to the changing conditions of a \n     globalizing economy in which companies are freer than ever to \n     locate across borders, and so workers find themselves more \n     than ever competing across borders.\n\n  I always find it interesting that there is no journalist I am aware \nof--certainly no politician--but no journalist who ever lost their job \nbecause of a bad trade agreement. But they sure do give us a great deal \nof advice on trade, and for that we are very thankful.\n  There is one song, one note that comes from the Washington Post. It \nis that you are either for the current trade strategy and, therefore, \nfast track, or you are a protectionist. The Washington Post, in my \njudgment, in its editorial, errs by suggesting that those who don't \nsupport the current trade strategy are protectionists.\n  Is it being a protectionist to decide that a trade strategy that \nresults in the largest trade deficits in history year after year isn't \nworking? Is it protectionist to be concerned about a trade strategy \nthat results in an increasing, a mushrooming trade deficit with China, \nratcheting up now we expect it close to $50 billion, or a trade \nstrategy that results in mushrooming trade deficits with Japan this \nyear, expected to reach $60 billion this year? Incidentally, that means \nthat every year as far as the eye can see, backward and forward, we can \ntalk about a trade imbalance with Japan of $45 billion, $55 billion or \n$65 billion a year. Is it really the case that those of us who believe \nthat this does not serve our country's interest are protectionists? Or \ncould it be possible that those of us who believe that trade deficits \nhurt our country and trade deficits detract from our economic \nopportunity are those who are supporting change, positive change that \nwould help this country and assist this country in improving its \neconomic future?\n  I don't expect that those in this town who have only one note to \nsound on trade will ever concede the point. It seems to me that they \nthink the proof is in the economy. We have a decent economy in this \ncountry. I don't deny that. Unemployment is down some. Inflation is way \ndown. Deficits are down, way down. There is no question that the \nAmerican economy has improved.\n  But, I would make this point. You can live in a neighborhood and see \na neighbor who looks wonderfully prosperous, not understanding that all \nof those cars in the driveway, the house, the clothes, the jewelry are \nall on a credit card or some mortgage instrument somewhere and that \nperson, while looking very prosperous, is not far from real trouble.\n  The point I have made repeatedly is these ballooning trade deficits, \nthe largest in our country's history, are troublesome. You don't hear \none word on the Senate floor about them.\n  I heard a presentation today I thought was a good presentation in \nfavor of fast track. I thought it was well-constructed, well-delivered \nand persuasive. But, there was not one word about the trade deficit, \nnot one word about the imbalance in our trade relations with our \ntrading partners, with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with Canada. Not \none word. Why? Because they only talk about one side of the issue.\n\n  Can you imagine a business that says, ``I want you to evaluate me, \nand here is how I want you to evaluate me. I want you to evaluate me \nbased on my revenues, and I will not tell you about my expenditures \nbecause that is irrelevant. Just look at my revenues. Aren't I healthy? \nAren't I doing well?''\n  You could probably conclude that if you only look at the revenue \nside. But what if you look at the expenditure side and see they far \nexceed revenues? Would you then not conclude that the business is \nrunning toward trouble? I would think so. That is exactly what happens \non this issue of international trade on the floor of the Senate. They \ntalk about exports and ignore imports.\n  I heard a description of how many additional automobiles we send to \nMexico. What a wonderful opportunity, we are told, to send automobiles \nto Mexico under the United States-Mexican free-trade agreement. They \nsay, ``Did you know that we have gotten more cars into Mexico?'' Yet \nthe number of cars coming from Mexico into this country dwarfed that \nexport number by so much you can hardly describe it. We now import more \ncars from Mexico into the United States of America than this country \nexports to all the rest of the world.\n  Let me say that again because it is important. We now, after NAFTA, \nimport more automobiles manufactured\n\n[[Page S11734]]\n\nin Mexico than we export to the entire rest of the world. How can \nanyone brag about NAFTA producing an accelerated opportunity for us to \nsend cars to Mexico when, in fact, that quantity is totally dwarfed by \nthe number of new automobiles now manufactured in Mexico that used to \nbe manufactured in this country, and are shipped from there to here?\n  Despite the attempts of some to portray it as such, the question is \nnot whether we are involved in international trade. It is how we are \ninvolved in international trade. Will this country continue to \ncountenance a system in which we accept less than fair treatment from \nour trading partners?\n  Another person on the Senate floor within the last hour said the \nfollowing: ``If we are not involved through fast track in trade \nnegotiations, there will be trade agreements going on around the world \nand we won't be a part of them.''\n  I would like one person in the U.S. Senate to describe to me a \nsubstitute for the American economy, the American marketplace. Is there \nanother place on Earth? Spin the globe, look at all of them. Look at \nevery country, every city. Is there another place on the globe that has \nthe power and the potential of this marketplace? The answer clearly is \nno.\n  Do you really believe that if we defeat fast track that those \ncountries that desire to access the American marketplace are going to \nsay, ``Well, all right, if we can't access the American marketplace, we \nchoose Kenya.''\n  ``OK, if we can't access the American marketplace, now we're going to \nset our sights on Nairobi.''\n  ``We are going to set up an office in Kinshasa; that is our future.''\n  Does anybody really believe that? There is no substitute for the \nAmerican marketplace. Why is it that we are the country that must be \ndangled on the end of a string? Why is it that those of us who stand up \nand say it is time for us to demand and require fair trade with respect \nto China, fair trade with respect to Japan, and, yes, with Mexico and \nCanada and others--why is it that we are subject to being called \nprotectionists? Is it because the interests of the international \neconomic empires now are to construct a trade regime in which you have \nno economic nationalism? Is it because if you exert some sort of \neconomic nationalism, you are a protectionist?\n  They construct a trade regime in which they proscribe for our country \na circumstance where they want to produce elsewhere and sell here. Why? \nProfits. Is that wrong? No, it is not wrong from their standpoint, but \nis it always in our country's interest to say what is in the corporate \ninterest is in the American interest? Not necessarily.\n  There are circumstances where we should say that it is not fair \ncompetition for those businesses that stayed here in America. They \ndidn't move anywhere. They stayed here. And they produce here. It is \nnot fair for them to have to compete in circumstances where they cannot \nget their product into a foreign country because that market is closed \nto us, but the foreign country can get its product into our market to \ncompete with that business that stayed here. By the way, that producer \nin the foreign country can produce that garage door opener, that \nbicycle, or those shoes, paying 12 cents an hour, and put them on the \nstore shelves of America and drive the American businesses out of \nbusiness.\n  One of the Senators earlier said, ``Well, if that is the way it is, \nthat is tough luck. Let them hang on the walls of Wal-Mart. That is \nwhat America is all about. Let them hang the cheaper product there, and \nit's good for the consumer to be able to access a cheaper product.''\n  I ask, how is that consumer going to pay for that cheaper product \nwithout good jobs? And where are the good jobs in this country going to \nbe unless this country demands on behalf of its business and its \nemployees, its workers, that when we trade, our agreement to trade with \nother countries and our desire to trade with other countries be \nconstructed on a set of rules that are fair. We need a set of rules \nthat says, no, not that you are to mirror exactly what we do in all of \nthese areas, but a set of rules that would say to those countries, \n``There's an obligation that you have in your trade relationship with \nour country. And that obligation is to have fairness and access to \nmarketplaces. If our market is open to you, your market must be open to \nus.''\n  If we don't have the nerve and the will to do that, what on Earth \nwill our future be?\n  If I read these articles--one printed recently by one of the major \nnewspapers by a fellow who is describing the trade deficit. He said, \n``Trade deficit. What does that matter? I have talked to economists. It \ndoesn't matter. Let me explain what a trade deficit is.'' He said, \n``That's like somebody saying to you, `I will trade you $10,000 worth \nof pears for your $5,000 worth of apples.' ''\n  That uninteresting and irrelevant example in this article, describing \nwhy the trade deficit is just fine, I guess, represents a view in this \ntown that as long as you are trading more, it does not matter. Its a \nview that as long as you are exporting more, it doesn't matter if your \nimports increase fiftyfold, and that somehow we are better off as \nresult.\n  At the end of the day, you are better off when this country has \nretained a strong manufacturing base and has required, through the \nexertion of some nerve and some will to say to its trading partners, \n``You have a responsibility to the United States of America. And that \nresponsibility is to treat us fairly in international trade. And this \ncountry will not sit around and will no longer take any closed markets \nto our products when our markets are open to your products.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from North Dakota is making an extremely \nimportant point. The assumption is trade, by definition, is good; but \nthe focus is all on exports and not on the balance of trade.\n  This is what has happened to our trade balance since 1975. You can \nsee this incredible deterioration that has taken place. We are running \nnegative trade deficits year in and year out. And the consequence of \ndoing this, I say to my distinguished colleague, is this is what has \nhappened to the American net foreign investment position.\n  The United States, in 1980, was a creditor nation to the tune of \nabout $400 billion. In other words, we had claims on others. We were a \ncreditor nation. And now that has deteriorated so that the United \nStates now, when we add in what the trade imbalance will be this year, \nwill be about a $1 trillion debtor nation. We have gone from being the \nworld's largest creditor nation to being the world's largest debtor \nnation. And then everyone comes along and says, ``Well, no one wants to \nfocus on this issue. No one wants to pay any attention to it.''\n\n  I mean, the Senator from North Dakota has been absolutely right. He \nsaid, ``Look, there are two sides to this thing. There are your exports \nand there are your imports.'' Yes, we are getting additional exports, \nbut we are getting far more imports.\n  As we get these imports, and we get this deterioration in our trade \nbalance--look at that. Since World War II, we have been running a \npositive trade balance, modest but positive, year in and year out. And \nthis is the deterioration that has taken place in it over the last 20 \nyears.\n  And, of course, each year we run these large trade deficits --$100 \nbillion, $150 billion, $120 billion trade deficits year after year \nafter year. It is offset somewhat by the service, but not enough. I \nmean, the net is reflected in this chart, which is not quite as bad as \nthe previous level but still shows us year after year showing these \ndeficits.\n  The consequence of that--these amount to about $1.5 trillion over \nthat period of time. We have been running a trade balance deficit since \n1975 of $1.5 trillion. And the consequence of doing that is that our \nnet asset position is absolutely deteriorating.\n  Look at this chart. This is what has happened. This is the U.S. net \nforeign investment position. In 1980, before we got this tremendous \ndecline, we were a creditor nation, the world's largest creditor \nnation; in other words, others owed us. And now we are the world's \nlargest debtor nation. And by the end of this year, it will be to the \ntune of $1 trillion--$1 trillion.\n  Now, you cannot go on doing this indefinitely. You can do it for a \nperiod of time, but you cannot do it indefinitely. In any event, the \nwhole time you are\n\n[[Page S11735]]\n\ndoing it, we are taking on an increase in volume of foreign \nindebtedness through these large and persistent trade deficits--the \nlosses sustained every year by buying more goods from others than they \nare buying from us.\n  And we are undercutting the Nation's capacity for mass consumption by \ndeclining wages and loss of high-income employment. As the Senator from \nNorth Dakota said, they said, ``Well, your consumers can buy cheaper \nproducts.'' But then the question is, ``Well, suppose they're not \nworking? Suppose they've been thrown out of a job by these \nimportations?'' They can't buy anything. They can't buy anything.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator from Maryland would just yield. I guess I \nhave the floor. I am yielding to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Let me understand what you are saying. I held up the Washington Post \nand I cited the discussion on the floor of the Senate. The Senator from \nMaryland now comes to us and says, ``You know, we've got these huge \ndeficits,'' and all these other folks say, ``Gee, we're moving in the \nright direction. What we need to do is more of what we've been doing.'' \nDid the Senator graduate in the bottom of his high school class? Is he \na protectionist? Is that all this means? Or does the Senator from \nMaryland understand what the rest of these folks don't, that deficits \nin the long term have to be repaid?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right. We are not driving the right trade \nbargains. Something is wrong with a trade policy that gives you this \ndeterioration in your net foreign investment position. Something is \nwrong with a trade policy that takes the United States, in less than 20 \nyears, from being the largest creditor nation in the world, in other \nwords, people owe us, and in 20 years makes the United States the \nlargest debtor nation in the world. Something is wrong.\n  The Senator is absolutely right to focus on it. Everyone says, \n``Well, we succeeded in selling $3 billion worth of airplanes to China \non this visit that they had.'' Our trade imbalance with China is over \n$40 billion and increasing all the time. It is increasing all the time. \nIt may soon surpass the trade deficit with Japan. The consequence is \nthat we are selling to them far less--far, far, far less--than they are \nselling to us.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. On the question of Chinese airplanes--which is an \ninteresting departure point--the Chinese are going to need 2,000 \nairplanes. They bought a few from us, but the fact is they have been \nbuying from Europe as well, even as their trade surplus with us \nmushrooms way, way up.\n  What they have been saying to this country--I know some of the \ncorporate folks won't like me to say this because they are all nervous \nabout this--but the Chinese say, ``Yes, we'd like to consider buying \nsome of your airplanes, but you must manufacture them in China.''\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a country that has a huge surplus with us. \nInstead of buying what they need that we produce here in this country \nwith American jobs, they have been saying, ``Well, we'd like you to \nconsider manufacturing that in China.''\n  That is not the way trade works.\n  Mr. SARBANES. ``Consider'' is not the right word. They do not say, \n``We would like you to consider.'' The Washington Post ran an article \njust the other week, and here is the heading of the article: ``China \nPlays Rough. Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market Access.'' And \nthat article then described how China forces U.S. companies to transfer \njobs and technology as a price for getting export sales. So, in effect, \nwhat they say is, ``We won't take any of your exports if you don't give \nus the investment and the technology so we can then produce them \nourselves.''\n  So what are our people doing? In order to get these short-run \nexports, they give away the capacity to maintain a long-run position. \nAnd the Chinese, in effect, extract that capacity out of them. So, yes, \nthey make a short-run purchase, but at the same time they are getting \nthe investment and technology so they do not have to make long-run--not \nonly will they not make long-run purchases, but, mark my word, they \nwill be exporting these products themselves elsewhere in the world.\n  Not only will they, in effect, close our people out from getting into \nthe Chinese market; they will become their competitors in other markets \non the basis of the investment and the technology that our people \ntransferred to China in order to get these short-term sales.\n  That is exactly what is going to happen. And the consequence of that \nis our trade position will continue to deteriorate, and we will go on \nto become an even bigger debtor nation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I really appreciate the distinguished Senator bringing \nthe issue into sharp, sharp focus. It so happens that I had been \nlooking at the Investor's Business Daily. Just reading a sentence:\n\n       The surge in imports prompted economists to revise down \n     their first-quarter growth statistics.\n\n  And, again, just here in Business Week, dated November 3, on page 32:\n\n       Because of the widening in the August trade deficit for \n     goods and services to $10.4 billion, from $10 billion in \n     July, trade is likely to have subtracted a full percentage \n     point from overall demand growth.\n\n  The distinguished Senator has chaired the Joint Economic Committee \nfor years and understands this. That is why we are losing our own \ngrowth. We are trying to invest, trying to bring about economic growth, \nbut not looking at the import side, as the distinguished Senator has so \nclearly brought to the attention of all the colleagues here, that we \nactually should be growing much faster, and saving, excepting these \ncancerous deficits in the balance of trade.\n  I really appreciate the Senator from Maryland, and I apologize for \ninterrupting, but I hope he will continue.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely on point.\n  Just let me read you two quotes from two very able authors. One is \nBenjamin Friedman, who is a professor of economics at Harvard, and his \nbook called ``Day of Reckoning.''\n  I again want to go back and emphasize the fact that we have gone from \nbeing the world's largest creditor nation to now being the world's \nlargest debtor nation. This is the deterioration that has taken place \nin the U.S. net foreign investment position.\n  This is what Professor Friedman says about that:\n\n       World power and influence have historically accrued to \n     creditor countries. It is not coincidental that America \n     emerged as a world power simultaneously with our transition \n     from a debtor nation, dependent on foreign capital for our \n     initial industrialization, to a creditor nation supplying \n     investment capital to the rest of the world. But we are now a \n     debtor again, and our future role in world affairs is in \n     question. People simply do not regard their workers, their \n     tenants and their debtors in the same light as their \n     employers, their landlords and their creditors. Over time, \n     the respect and even deference that America has earned as \n     world banker will gradually shift to the new creditor \n     countries that are able to supply resources where we cannot, \n     and America's influence over nations and events will ebb.\n\n  That is the big issue that is behind all of this. That is the issue \nwe really ought to be debating. The whole direction in which--everyone \ncomes out here and says--you know, I listened to the President \nyesterday. He said, ``We've got trade.'' I will not quarrel with that. \n``I'm trying to negotiate good trade agreements with other \ncountries.'' But look what is happening to us. We have had this \nincredible deterioration in our trade balance and this represents $1.5 \ntrillion dollars of deficits over the last 20 years. This is what has \nhappened to our net foreign investment position.\n\n  This is a devastating chart when you think about what it has done to \nthe United States. William Wolman, chief economist at Business Week, \nhad this to say, and it ties right in with the Senator's comments about \neconomic growth, ``The Implication of Debtor State for U.S. Economic \nGrowth.''\n\n       The transformation of the United States from a major \n     international creditor to an international debtor has major \n     implications for future United States economic growth. It is \n     no accident that back in the 1950's and 1960s when the United \n     States was a creditor nation interest rates were lower here \n     than they were abroad and the dollar was a strong currency. \n     But since the United States has become a debtor nation U.S. \n     interest rates are higher than those in the other industrial \n     countries, and the dollar, despite its revival in 1996, has \n     become a weak currency. The effect is, of course, to squeeze \n     the average\n\n[[Page S11736]]\n\n     American standard of living both because Americans are forced \n     to pay high real interest rates for what they borrow and \n     because a weak dollar means that America must produce and \n     export more goods to earn foreign currencies than it had to \n     when the dollar was a stronger currency. Debtor status has \n     the same effect on a country as on citizens of that country. \n     What is in effect the disposable income of the United States \n     is under downward pressure, just as surely as the disposable \n     income of its highly indebted citizens.\n\n  You can't get people to focus on this. Trade has two sides to it: \nWhat you export and what you import. If you import more than you \nexport, you will be running trade deficits. If you are running trade \ndeficits, that means people abroad are accumulating claims against us \nthat we have to pay off over time. So we have now gone from being a \ncreditor country to being the world's largest debtor country. We \ncontinue to be a world power but how long can you sustain that \nposition? It is not as though we have stopped the hemorrhaging.\n  If we run a $125 billion trade deficit, our net position will \ndeteriorate another $125 billion. This line will continue to go down as \nlong as we are running a negative trade debt. Suppose we cut it in \nhalf, suppose we reduce it from $120 billion to $60 billion, which \nwould be a terrific accomplishment. Say you do that in a year's time, \nyou reduce it from $120 billion to $60 billion, the net position \ndeteriorates another $60 billion, another $60 billion. The next year \nyou cut it to $30 billion, it deteriorates another $30 billion. We are \ngetting ourselves deeper and deeper into the hole. We can't get anyone \nto focus on this.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota I think has brought our \nattention back to an exceedingly important point, and I thank him very \nmuch for yielding to me to make these points.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate very much the comments of the Senator from \nMaryland. As always, he is on point. I chided him a bit about his \nposition in his high school class, but I suspect he was right at the \ntop.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank our distinguished colleague for continuing \nalong with the very thought that the Senator from Maryland provokes \nhere which is so important to this particular debate, the fact that we \nshould realize the arithmetic of import jobs as well as export jobs. \nThe cumulative sum total, that 1975, 22 years, is right at $1.90 \ntrillion.\n  Now, they like to use 20,000 jobs created for every $1 billion in \nexports. The Department of Commerce changed that to 14,000 some 2 years \nago and that has been their figure. Using the same figure--because I \nwant to refer specifically here to the special study the Presidential \nCommission on the United States Pacific Trade and Investment Policy \nrecently released its final report and it stated ``from 1979 to 1994, \ntwice as many high-paying jobs in the United States economy were lost \nto imports as were gained from exports.''\n\n  Now, using the arithmetic of $1 billion equals 20,000 jobs, that \nwould be some 38 million jobs that were lost over that time period, or \nusing the lower figure of 14,000, it would be some 27 million lost \njobs.\n  Yes, we can talk that the economy is up and going but you get right \nto the point of understanding why we have 2.8 percent unemployment in \nGreenville County but 14 percent unemployment in Williamsburg County, \nand the people back home understand this trade problem better than many \non the floor of the national Congress. They continue to see 6,375 jobs \nleave. Levi Strauss fired one-third of their employees, 11 plants in 5 \nStates making jeans. Where have they gone? They are going offshore. \nThey have been transferring them offshore, and after they let them go, \nthey have to announce, as they do under the plants closing notice--they \nnever announce it during the middle of the debate on the House side, \nbut the lawyers had to comply with the plant closing notice. That is \nwhat is happening. We are getting Honda, I am getting BMW in South \nCarolina, I have Hoffmann-La Roche. I appreciate it and I am working \nhard, but I am looking at the basic jobs here paying $7 an hour. As I \nwas pointing out with the Oneida plant they are closing in Andrews, and \nthey have some 487 workers, the average age is 47 years old. Washington \ntells them, ``Retrain, retrain, retrain.'' Well, tomorrow morning, say \nwe have 487 skilled computer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-\nyear-old skilled computer operator or the 21-year-old? You are not \ntaking on the health costs and the retirement costs for the 47-year-\nold, so this little rural town is high and dry.\n  They understand at home that we are losing out. We are making great \ngains, but all this downsizing and everything else like that has \nstagnated wages in our economy. In that sense, we are going out of \nbusiness. We have been giving away the store. We have Senators running \naround here, ``If we are going to continue to lead''--we are not \nleading, my dear Senator. We are not leading in this thing.\n  I wish they would have adopted Adam Smith and free markets but they \nhave adopted Friedrich List, that the strength of a nation is measured \nnot by what it can consume but by what it can produce. We have to have \nthe economic strength if we are to be a world leader. That is what we \nare losing. That is what is at stake. That is what is in the \nconversation here.\n  These colleagues that come and say the President can't get at the \ntable--come on. He has been at the table in 200 agreements.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. When you talk about \ntrade you have to talk about trade balance. Now, we ran a trade balance \nfrom the end of World War II until 1975. We were exporting a little \nmore than we were importing. The imports that were coming in were \ncausing dislocation in our economy, no question about it. But at the \nsame time we were gaining a plus from the exports. In fact, there were \na little more exports than there were imports.\n  What has happened, as the Senator from South Carolina points out, we \nare now importing far, far, far more than we are exporting. In fact, as \nhe points out with respect to trade goods it has been an almost $2 \ntrillion deficit since 1975. Everyone comes along and says, ``Look, we \nhave a little more exports.'' Look at how many more imports we have. \nAll of those imports are costing people jobs. So the displacement of \njobs taking place by the increase in imports far, far, far exceeds the \nadditional jobs gained from the expansion of exports.\n  That is what people have to understand and they are not understanding \nit. To the extent we run these trade deficits then we end up losing our \nposition as a creditor nation.\n  This is a devastating chart, showing the United States in a creditor \nposition in 1980, and look what has happened to us. We have come down \njust like this, and by the end of the year we will be at $1 trillion \ndeficit debtor status. Debtor status, $1 trillion, the United States. \nIn 1980, less than 20 years ago, we were in a creditor status to the \ntune of $400 billion. So there has been an almost $1.5 trillion \ndeterioration in our international position in less than 20 years. It \nis the very thing the Senator from South Carolina is talking about.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And that is not leading. That is not leadership. You \nand I as Senators are concerned with the economic strength of the \nUnited States, with the work force and otherwise. We want to get back \nwhere we are leading.\n  The people should understand global competition, ``You ignorant \nSenators, you protectionists.'' They better understand when China \norders $3 billion they order one-half for themselves and from countries \nlike Japan that make the electronics. That Boeing 777, they make the \ntail section--they don't give you the order unless you put the \nmanufacturing facility in country. I know, I had a GE turbine plant \nwhen I was Governor. Brazil told them they would not order those \nturbines unless, they put the plants down in Brazil. So the GE plant at \nGadsden, SC, has closed down and gone to Brazil. We are speaking from \nactual experience.\n  It is not any fanciful conjuncture here about leading and not being \nat the table. Yesterday, Senator, right in the Committee of Commerce, \nwe passed the shipbuilding agreement, the OECD shipbuilding agreement \nthat has been negotiated with some 13 countries in Europe and in the \nPacific, and we did that without fast track. We had an\n\n[[Page S11737]]\n\ninternational telecommunications treaty earlier this year, with 123 \ncountries, without fast track.\n  What we are trying to do is get them to have a chance to stop, look, \nlisten, debate the things like we did with the most important arms \ntreaty, SALT I, and the intermediate missile treaty. All of those were \nwithout fast track but they act as if our poor President is not allowed \nto come to the table. He is at the table. We want him at the table. But \nwe just want to have a chance to look and see before we vote.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The American market is still the most lucrative market \nin the world. They want access into the American market.\n  I cannot accept for a moment in these bilateral dealings, countries \nwon't negotiate a trade agreement with the President which could then \nbe submitted to the Congress for the Congress to consider, to amend if \nit deemed it advisable, and to vote on. We have done that consistently, \nas the Senator pointed out, including the telecommunications agreement, \na very complicated measure. We do it in arms control agreements. They \nare open to amendment and are a far more serious matter than a trade \nagreement.\n  I want to say one other thing to the Senator because he talked about \nthe Chinese getting the investment and the plants in their own country, \nand he uses the example that occurred in Brazil. The Chinese don't make \nany bones about it. They don't like to conceal it. The Washington Post \nhad an article last week, and here is the heading to the article, \n``China Plays Rough: Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market \nAccess.'' Invest and transfer technology or no market access.\n  The article went on to describe how China forces United States \ncompanies to transfer jobs and technology as a price for getting \nexports sales. They say, ``We will take the exports but you have to \ngive us the investment and the technology,'' and that means in the \nfuture they won't take other exports because they won't need them. They \nwill have the investment and the technology to produce the goods \nthemselves, and I predict not only will they do it for themselves they \nwill then be producing and selling them internationally, and they will \ngo from being an importer of American high-technology products to being \nan exporter themselves of high-technology products from the investment \ntechnology that we are compelled to give to them.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. You go right to the point.\n  In Shanghai, General Motors agreed not only to build a plant there in \norder to produce and sell cars in the People's Republic of China, but \nmore particularly, to design the most modern computer equipment that is \ngoing to Shanghai, as we speak, to design the automobiles. They have \ntaken it out of Detroit and are putting it into downtown Shanghai so \nall our brain power and our wonderful technology is being exported like \ngangbusters, and they talk about us leading and the President can't get \nat the table.\n  Come on, they have to get with the program here and understand that \nas Senators and Congressmen we have a responsibility with respect to \nthis economy, and the work force that is the highest, most productive \nin the entire world. You can go over to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \neconomic section of the United Nations, and No. 1 for the last 20 years \nhas been the United States, not Japan. Japan is down there at No. 6 or \n7 now. So our workers have been the most productive. Who hasn't \nproduced, Senator, is you and I up here. That is what I am trying to \nget over to our fellow Senators so they will understand the problem we \nare confronting.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a moment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. There is this blame America strategy that has been around \nfor years that, if you can't compete, whatever the situations are, \ntough luck. That means in a free-trade circumstance, jobs might go \nelsewhere, but consumers benefit by cheaper imports.\n  The interesting thing about this is, most of our large trading \npartners--especially, for example, Japan and China--are engaged in \nmanaged trade, not free trade. We, on the other hand, have always been \na leader in what is called free trade.\n  I described yesterday watching two people dance at a wedding dance \nwhen I was a kid. He was dancing a waltz and she was dancing a two-\nstep. It didn't work out well. They were dancing different dances. In \ninternational trade, what is happening to us is, we are confronting \nJapan, for example, with whom we have an abiding yearly massive trade \ndeficit of $40 to $60 billion every year, as far as you can see back \nand as far as you can see forward. We have that kind of trade deficit. \nWhy? Because Japan has a managed trade strategy, and that is the method \nby which they trade with us.\n  We, apparently, are perfectly content to say, ``Well, if that is the \nway it is, there is nothing we can do about that.'' But there is \nsomething we can do about that. We can provide a little real \nleadership, with a little nerve and will, and say to Japan that part of \nthe price for this trade agreement and for their ability to access the \nAmerican marketplace, a marketplace that has no substitute anywhere on \nthis Earth, is to open their markets completely to American goods and \nnot to do it tomorrow, or next month, or next year, or even the next \nbiennium--do it now.\n  But this country doesn't have the nerve or the will to do that. In \nfact, it was left to some little maritime commission, finally, to raise \nthis issue on a $5 million fine and say, ``That is fine. If you want to \nplay that game and you won't pay your fines, then you can't dock your \nship in this country.'' One little commission--an unelected \ncommission--was the only body I know of that finally had the will and \nnerve to say that is not the way we do business here. Fair is fair. In \ntrade, we demand and require fair trade and fair access.\n  So, the comments that both the Senator from Maryland and the Senator \nfrom South Carolina have made are right on point. The thing that \nbaffles me is that those of us who desire to force open foreign \nmarkets, to reinforce open markets, and do more than just chant about \nfree trade, but really seek to force open foreign markets and unlock \nthe opportunities in this country for our producers and our workers, we \nare the ones that are called protectionists. What on Earth are they \ntalking about?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will never forget the second inauguration of Ronald \nWilson Reagan. It was in the rotunda, and you and I were there, \nSenator. President Reagan said, ``I solemnly swear that I will \nfaithfully execute the office of the President of the United States and \nwill, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States.''\n  We have the armies who protect us from enemies from without, and the \nFBI protects us from enemies within. We have Social Security to protect \nus from the ravages of old age. We have Medicare to protect us from ill \nhealth. We have clean air and clean water to protect our environment. \nWe have safe working places and safe machinery.\n  Our fundamental duties here are to protect. Be invited, if you \nplease, to the Council of Foreign Relations, run for President of the \ntrilateral commission. They asked, ``Are you a protectionist, \nSenator?'' I had to say, ``Yes, the truth of it is, I believe that is \nmy fundamental responsibility here.'' They say, ``If you are a \nprotectionist, you are not enlightened, you can't see the world and \nunderstand competition.'' When you are losing your shirt, as the \nSenator from Maryland said--through 22 years of negative trade \nbalances--all they want to talk about is the exports and not the \nnegative side of the equation.\n  I cited on yesterday our experience with President Kennedy and the \nextreme action that he took when 10 percent of domestic consumption of \ntextiles, clothing, was represented in imports, and he thought it was a \ncrisis, and he put in his seven-point practice. Now two-thirds of the \nclothing within the sight of my debate here this afternoon is imported, \n83 percent of the shoes, 53 percent of the ferroalloys, 59 percent of \nthe cooking and kitchenware, 64 percent of the mineral processing \nmachinery, 61.4 percent of the machine tools for metal forming, and \n44.1 percent of nonmetal working machine\n\n[[Page S11738]]\n\ntools--you can go right on down the list. There is the majority of \nautomatic data processing machines, diodes, electrical capacitors and \nresistors. That is at 70 percent right now. I remember having the \ncapacitor plant of GE, and I have lost it now. It has gone overseas. \nYou have 100 percent of tape recorders, tape players, VCR's, and CD \nplayers. You can go right on down. I remember that we could not engage \nin Desert Storm, the gulf war, unless we got the displays from Japan. \nThat is why I had to put the ``buy America first'' provision for ball \nbearings in the defense bill. We are fighting a rear guard action so \nthat we would be able to defend the country, much less be economically \nstrong.\n  The NAFTA tent is being pitched on the front lawn of the White House, \nand the corporate jets are descending on National Airport offloading \nthe Nation's top-paid CEO's to lobby for the administration's effort to \nrenew fast-track trade authority. Of course it is no longer referred to \nas fast track. Instead the administration has offered a clumsy \neuphemism--normal trade authority--to obscure the fact that the sole \npurpose of fast-track is to stifle debate by subverting the Congress' \nconstitutional obligation to regulate foreign commerce. Yet there is \nnothing normal about a $100 billion plus trade deficit, nothing normal \nabout Congress abandoning its constitutional responsibilities, nothing \nnormal about stagnant wages and an erosion of our manufacturing base.\n  The administration argues that they need fast-track authority because \nno one will negotiate with the United States unless they have fast \ntrack. A more likely scenario is that the administration would prefer \nthat Congress not review a legacy of poor trade deals; eroding \nmanufacturing strength and a trade policy that puts the interests of \nthe multinational corporation before working-class Americans. While the \nadministration embraces the Fortune 500's agenda, it has turned a cold \nshoulder to those who have been left behind by globalization, the \nworking men and women of this country.\n  The end of the cold war has created a seismic shift in the global \neconomy. The American worker has now been thrown into bare knuckle \ncompetition against the new entrants to the global economy: countries \nwhose productive and motivated work force will accept much less than \nour workers. As globalization has increased world trade, the American \nworker has faced an all out assault on their wages, benefits, and \noverall standard of living.\n  Instead of engaging in a debate on the impact of this changed world, \nour trade policy remains a prisoner to a cold war mentality, treating \ntrade as a stepchild to foreign policy, continuing to serve up \nunilateral concession after unilateral concession in the hope that our \ntrading partners will be converted by the persuasiveness of our elegant \neconomic models and focusing exclusively on export statistics, failing \nto consider the impact of imports or even the nature of the exports \nthemselves.\n  Rather than facing this new era of fierce economic competition with \nthe hard edge realism that places the national interest in our own \nhands, we will be relying on multilateral institutions like the WTO to \nprotect our national interest. Now we will be asked to embark upon a \ncourse which is bound to produce asymmetrical market openings and in \nwhich the people, through their elected representatives, will be shut \nout.\n  The sad truth, however, is that it is impossible to have an honest \ndebate about trade policy, the trade deficit, or the erosion of our \nmanufacturing sector. Instead of focusing on the present and future, \npictures of Smoot and Hawley will be dusted off and put on display. The \nproponents of fast track will unleash a barrage of hyperbolic rhetoric \ndeclaring an end to civilization as we know it if we fail to pass fast \ntrack.\n\n\n                                 NAFTA\n\n  If the proponents of fast track insist on engaging in a debate about \nthe past, then let us examine how the rhetoric and the agreement has \nstood the test of time. During the NAFTA debate we were told that a \nfailure to pass NAFTA would have a devastating consequences for the \nUnited States and Mexico. If NAFTA failed, Mexico's economy would \ncollapse, drugs would flood across the border, immigration would \nincrease, and dangerous leftists, who were denied the presidency thanks \nto massive electoral fraud, would replace Carlos Salinas, a man \nvirtually canonized both by United States officials and by a \nsynchophatic press blind to the endemic corruption that permeated his \nregime.\n  Three years later what has NAFTA wrought? The Mexican economy \ncollapsed, wages fell by 40 percent, two million Mexicans sank further \ninto poverty, and America's trade surplus with Mexico disappeared, \nreplaced by a $15 billion annual deficit. United States factories \naccelerated a move to Mexico, not to supply a Mexican consumer market, \nwhich even the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico concedes does not \nexist, but to ship products into the United States. Of our $54 billion \nin exports to Mexico in 1996, more than 50 percent were components sent \nto the mequiladora region alone. Those exports will never see the \nMexican consumer market. Rather, the overwhelming majority, over 98 \npercent according to the Mexico Department of Commerce--[SECOFI] will \nreturn to the United States as finished products. Moreover, according \nto Cornell professor Kate Bromfenbremmer, United States employers \ncontinue to use the possibility of movement to Mexico as leverage to \nlimit wage gains.\n  Meanwhile, the Asians and Europeans, the ones that were supposed to \nbe the losers as a result of NAFTA, have maintained trade surpluses \nwith Mexico. They poured money into building new factories in Mexico \ntaking advantage of Mexico's cheap labor force and duty-free access to \nthe United States market.\n  As for the political situation in Mexico, since NAFTA was passed \nMexico has suffered a peasant rebellion, a wave of assassinations and \nkidnappings, and an explosion in drug trafficking and money laundering. \nCarlos Salinas, the American Enterprise Institute's Man of the Year, is \nliving in exile while the popular leftist opposition leader Cuauhtemoc \nCardenas is elected mayor of Mexico City and an anti-NAFTA opposition \ncoalition took control of Mexico's Congress. Just Friday, Salinas' \nbrother confessed to widespread corruption in the New York Times.\n\n\n                            OTHER AGREEMENTS\n\n  It is not just the NAFTA claims that fail to stand the test of time, \noverstating the benefits of trade agreements is a time-honored \ntradition. When we ratified the Tokyo round of the GATT it was hailed \nas a significant achievement that would open markets and create \nmillions of new jobs in manufacturing. In the end, the only market that \nopened was ours, and the results were disastrous. From the end of the \nTokyo round to the Uruguay round we lost two million manufacturing jobs \nand posted over $1.5 trillion worth of trade deficits.\n  A generation later the Uruguay round has delivered the same \ndisastrous results as the Tokyo round. Since passage of the WTO, we \nhave recorded two of the largest trade deficits in our history. Last \nyear alone, the United trade deficit in goods was $191 billion. In 1995 \nour deficit was $173 billion. If this trend continues this year, the \n1997 trade deficit could exceed $200 billion.\n  Moreover, our trade deficits with the so-called big emerging markets \n[BEMs]--markets that this administration has targeted for future \ngrowth--are appalling. The big emerging markets include: Argentina, \nMexico, Brazil, Poland, Turkey, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, \nPhillippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, \nIndonesia, India, and South Africa. Since the completion of the Uruguay \nround, the trade deficits with these countries have exploded. In 1993, \nthe United trade deficit with these countries was $43 billion. After \nbeing the subject of focus by the Clinton administration, the trade \ndeficits with these countries had widened to $77 billion in 1996. \nMoreover, with the recent Asian currency devaluation these deficits are \npoised to explode.\n  The countries themselves recognize the value of devalued currency. On \nOctober 17, Taiwan devalued its currency not because it was under \nattack, not because the country's fiscal policies were unsound, but \nmerely to remain competitive with the other Asian tigers as an \nexporter.\n  Multinational companies also recognize this. Cheap currency, along \nwith cheap labor, encourage U.S.-based multinationals to locate new \nfactories\n\n[[Page S11739]]\n\nabroad. The results are devastating for the American worker. The New \nYork Times recently published a chart showing that the majority of GM's \nnew component factories are outside the United States. Many of these \nfacilities are located in Mexico. These factories won't supply the \nMexican consumer market. Rather they will employ cheaper labor for \nimports into the United States.\n  At the same time that GM opened these new plants across the globe, \nits U.S. employment declined by over 25 percent. This decline did not \noccur during a devastating recession. Rather it occurred during a \nperiod of sustained growth. GM is not alone. In 1985, General Electric \nemployed 243,000 Americans, by 1995 it employed only 150,000 and \naccording to executive vice president Frank Doyle, ``We did a lot of \nviolence to the expectations of the American work force.'' Another \nleading U.S. company IBM, now employs more people outside the United \nStates than here in America and has shrunk to half its former size. Yet \nthese are the companies that are lobbying for fast track. The same \ncompanies are asking for fast track are the ones that are cutting jobs. \nIn fact our largest exporters have not created a net new job in the \n1990's.\n  While our trade deficits continue their unabated rise, domestic wages \nstagnate, and job security vanishes, the administration and its \ncorporate allies continue to tout export-led growth as if it were a \nwonder drug that will cure our economic ills. Unfortunately, the only \nwonder about export-led growth is how a handful of our largest \ncompanies account for 80 percent of our total exports. These are the \nsame companies who have spent most of the 1990's downsizing their work \nforces and moving production off shore. This off-shore shift is \nreflected in trade balance deficits as far as the eye can see. Is it \nany wonder that these companies are paying up to $100,000 a piece to \npush fast track. This small investment will enable them to save \nmillions by taking advantage of an abundant supply of cheap labor. The \nreal fast track is how quickly manufacturing jobs can be moved abroad.\n  So in this era of free trade, what kind of jobs are we creating? Are \nthey the high-technology, high-wage jobs of the future? Not according \nto the Department of Labor. In cataloging the occupations with the \ngreatest growth in the future, Labor believes that the following \noccupations offer the best opportunity for growth: cashiers; janitors \nand cleaners; retail salespeople; waiters and waitress; registered \nnurses; general managers and top executives; systems analysts; home \nhealth aids; guards; and nursing aids.\n\n  Only one high technology job on the list and no occupations related \nto exports. Moreover, a recent study suggested that our best paying \njobs are the ones that are subject to the most competition from \nimports. That makes perfect sense. Manufacturing jobs pay better than \nservice industry jobs. Is there any doubt that our trade policy should \nbe designed to expand these opportunities?\n\n\n                  II. LABOR AND ENVIRONMENT STANDARDS\n\n  During this limited fast-track debate, we have heard time and time \nagain that it is inappropriate for the United States to dictate changes \nin other country's domestic laws. This argument is heard most \nfrequently when labor and environment standards are suggested as \nappropriate topics for trade negotiations. In fact, Ambassador \nBarshefsky has stated, ``it is not realistic to suggest that countries \nwill rewrite their domestic labor and environmental laws for the \nprivilege of buying more of our goods.'' Yet apparently these \ncountries, including the United States, have no trouble changing their \ndomestic copyright and patent laws for just that purpose.\n  Moreover, the recent IMF bailout of Indonesia, like many IMF rescue \npackages, contained a number of provisions affecting domestic rules \nthat have an economic impact, including banking laws, domestic \ncorruption rules, and government spending decisions. In an example \ncloser to home, the United States, in the United States-Japan framework \nnegotiations, agreed to reduce its budget deficit, as part of that \noverarching trade agreement. In fact, that's what fast track is all \nabout, changing domestic laws as a result of trade agreements.\n  In addition, U.S.T.R. recently concluded negotiations designed to \nharmonize drug and medical device standards and the administration is \nseeking authorization to begin the process of harmonizing \ntransportation and automotive environmental standards. If it is \nacceptable to harmonize vehicle standards, what is wrong with \nharmonizing labor rules and industrial environmental standards?\n  The question then is not whether domestic laws can be changed as a \nresult of trade negotiations, it is whether labor and environmental \nstandards have an impact on trade, competitiveness, and the overall \neconomic standing of the United States. To that question the answer is \nundoubtably yes. Permitting products made under substandard working \nconditions to enter the United States, gives those products an unfair \nadvantage. The result is pressure to U.S. wage rates, with tacit \napproval of substandard labor rules abroad.\n  These imported products come from countries with no minimum wage, \nsocial security, environmental rules, worker compensation, or \nunemployment insurance and they pressure U.S. wage rates which continue \nto decline. Median U.S. family income is 2.7 percent below 1989 levels. \nMoreover, when adjusted for inflation, the incomes for the bottom 60 \npercent of households have fallen over the past 7 years. In addition, \nlast year, during what is generally considered to be a good economic \nyear, the median earnings of full-time male workers fell. Can there be \nany doubt as to why the OECD declared that the United States had the \nwidest pay disparity in the industrialized world between the highest \nand lowest paid employees?\n  Failure to address this issue, offers tacit approval for unsafe \nconditions around the world. In his recent book, ``One World Ready or \nNot,'' Bill Greider discussed devastating industrial accidents around \nthe world resulting from a failure to enforce basic workplace \nstandards. Perhaps the most chilling example involved a fire in \nThailand at the Kader industrial toy factory that officially killed 188 \nand injured 469. The actual toll was undoubtedly higher. This death \ntoll far surpassed the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. fire of 1911. The United \nStates' unwillingness to address this issue, by requiring that products \nentering the country be produced in a safe and humane manner, must \nultimately bear some of the responsibility for this tragedy.\n  We must begin addressing these issues. Without labor reform abroad, \nwe are destined to merely create export platforms designed to provide \nthe United States with cheap products produced in a fashion that has \nnot been acceptable to the United States for nearly a century. The end \nresult will be to first reduce U.S. wages and then, in time, our labor \nand environmental protections.\n  However, history offers us a simple solution. Like Henry Ford earlier \nthis century, the United States can seek to raise wage rates and \nprovide workers with the opportunity to purchase the products they \nmanufacture. Moving others higher is an infinitely better choice than \nthe United States moving lower.\n\n\n             iii. QUALITY OF PREVIOUS FAST-TRACK AGREEMENTS\n\n  The administration claims that fast-track authority is normal trade \nnegotiating authority. However in the 221 years since the drafting of \nthe Declaration of Independence, only five trade agreements have been \napproved through the use of fast-track authority: first, the Tokyo \nround 1979 trade agreement; second, the United States-Israel free trade \nagreement; third, the Canada-United States Free-Trade Agreement; \nfourth, the North American free trade agreement; and fifth, the Uruguay \nround trade agreement in 1994. It is now appropriate to review what has \nhappened in the aftermath of each of these agreements to determine \nwhether U.S.T.R. was successful in their negotiations. Unfortunately, I \nbelieve the answer to this question is that these negotiations have \nresulted in poor agreements and in poor results for the United States. \nAfter each of these agreements, the United States' trade deficit with \neach of the targeted countries degraded, in many instances \nsignificantly. Moreover, after the two multilateral trade agreements, \nthe overall U.S. merchandise trade deficit has increased.\n\n[[Page S11740]]\n\n  The 1979 Tokyo round agreement was designed to eliminate worldwide \nnon-tariff trade barriers with a specific emphasis on the Japanese. In \n1978, before the agreement was reached, the United States-Japan trade \ndeficit was $11.7 billion. The U.S. merchandise trade deficit with all \nof our trading partners was $5.8 billion. By 1996, the United States-\nJapan deficit had reached $47 billion and was $191 billion, before \ntechnical adjustments, with the rest of the world. This sad story is \ncontinued in each of the subsequent fast track agreements. Prior to the \nUnited States-Israel trade agreement in 1985, the United States \nmaintained a surplus of several hundred million dollars with Israel. \nThat surplus began to degrade immediately following the agreement and \nby 1996, the United States had a $400 million deficit with Israel. The \nsame pattern has become apparent in our free-trade agreements with \nMexico and Canada. With Canada a $10 billion deficit became a $21 \nbillion deficit by 1996. The Mexican situation is equally poor. A $3 \nbillion deficit with Mexico became an approximately $17 billion deficit \nby 1996. Last, following the Uruguay round, the American trade deficit \nhas moved from $166 billion in 1994 to $191 billion in 1996 and with \nthe Asian currency crisis could easily top $200 billion in 1997. Now we \nare being asked to approve fast-track free trade negotiations with \nChile. How long will the 1996 U.S. trade surplus of $1.8 billion last?\n\n\n                        CONGRESSIONAL AUTHORITY\n\n  Clearly our trade policy has failed to yield tangible results, but as \nJack Kennedy once said, ``Our task is not to set the blame for the \npast, it is to set the course for the future.'' It is time we \narticulated a trade policy that promotes the interest of working \nAmericans. The first step is to give the people a voice in trade policy \nby taking back Congress' constitutional authority to regulate foreign \ncommerce.\n  If we can be trusted to ratify arms control treaties and the chemical \nweapons convention, what is it about trade agreements that make them so \nsignificant that the Constitution must be suspended and debate and \namendments limited?\n  We have been told time and again that agreements would unravel if \nCongress was allowed into the process. Yet, when an administration \nneeds to garner votes to secure passage of a trade agreement, the \nbazaar is opened and the agreements are amended.\n  It is of course untrue to say that fast track precludes any \namendments. Trade agreements cannot be amended on the Senate floor. \nInstead, amendments to agreements are cut during the process of putting \ntogether implementing legislation. This is a procedure in which the \nFinance Committee takes on the aura of the College of Cardinals. Behind \nclosed doors deals are cut, three puffs of white smoke appears and a \ntrade agreement secures enough votes for final passage. This is a \nwonderful process if you happen to benefit from it, like the sugar \nindustry or the citrus farmers who secured last minute changes to the \nNAFTA. It is not, however, what our Founding Fathers envisioned.\n  Instead of trying to stifle debate we should be encouraging it, \ndebating who the winners and losers are as a result of our trade \npolicy, both at home and abroad. Debating what we gain and what we \nlose, the proponents of fast track want to frame this debate as a test \nof American leadership. In one sense it is about leadership. Real \nleadership would be to break with the failed policies of the past while \nstanding up for the principles that are the foundation of our \ndemocracy. Real leadership would be to show confidence that the \nagreements that are negotiated are able to stand up to full and \nvigorous debate, rather than being negotiated removed from review.\n  Real leadership would be to stand up for the children who toil in the \nsweatshops of the world turning out products bearing the logos of our \ngreat consumer products companies. Real leadership would be to \nacknowledge that the world has changed, that Asia has embarked on a \ndifferent model of development and that we are not going to convert \nthem into clones of America. Most of all, real leadership would be to \nstand up to predatory trade practices that are laying waste to our \nmanufacturing sector, not just with rhetoric, but with deeds.\n  The hope and promise of America is that an ever-rising tide will lift \nall boats. Those that are pushing for fast track have been tossing \nAmericans overboard to gain ballast in the global economy. We in the \nCongress see it every week when we go into the communities that have \nbeen ravaged by the global economy. I see in my own backyard; the \nshattered dreams of the workers at Oneita Mills and United \nTechnologies. They deserve a voice, which is the birthright of all \nAmericans, and fast track takes that voice away.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article and a chart on this subject \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Trade on Wrong Track\n\n                            (By Pat Choate)\n\n       The question is not whether we will live with more \n     globalization, for we surely will, but to what purpose, under \n     what rules, and determined by whom.\n       As to purpose, trade is not a religion, as actions of the \n     Clinton administration seem to suggest.\n       Rather, trade is a tool of macroeconomics, no greater or \n     lesser than fiscal, monetary or exchange-rate policy.\n       Simply put, we trade for the benefit it brings--more and \n     better jobs and a higher living standard.\n       Yet current U.S. trade policies are generating precisely \n     the opposite result.\n       Indeed, even as trade is becoming a growing portion of our \n     gross domestic product (GDP), it also is a growing drag on \n     GDP growth by 1.6%.\n       In short, our current trade policies are harming the \n     nation, including its consumers and workers.\n       The goal of trade negotiation is to set rules by which \n     global commerce operates.\n       But this administration and the Republican congressional \n     majority are openly advocating little more than 19th century \n     laisez-faire capitalism.\n       No trade-related protection for the environment or worker \n     rights.\n       No guaranteed workplace health and safety standards.\n       No prohibitions against child labor.\n       Such rules do nothing but create a race to the bottom \n     between developed and underdeveloped countries.\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the fast-track \n     battle now before Congress raises the question of who will \n     decide the rules of globalization--the president and his \n     corporate trade advisers or the American people through their \n     elected congressional representatives.\n       Contrary to administration assertions, President Clinton \n     already has the authority to negotiate additional trade \n     deals.\n       Other nations will negotiate.\n       Over the past four years, for instance, the United States \n     concluded 200 trade deals without fast-track.\n       What the president really is seeking is a truncated \n     legislative procedure by which Congress virtually preapproves \n     any trade agreement that he makes.\n       Correctly, the administration emphasizes the importance of \n     trade to the nation.\n       For this very reason, Congress should consider proposed \n     trade agreements under its normal constitutional \n     congressional procedures.\n       This alone guarantees a full and open consideration of \n     whether these deals truly are in our national interest.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               1966 Data\n\n\n

I yield now to our distinguished colleague from \nMaryland the remaining time that I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to get into the Record the \nfigures that underlie this chart on the deterioration in the U.S. net \nforeign investment position.\n  In 1976, the United States had a $180 billion positive net position. \nWe were a creditor nation, to the extent of $180 billion. That rose \nuntil, in 1980, it hit its peak at just under $400 billion. That is \nnet. That is in our favor, $400 billion. Since 1980, that has begun to \ndeteriorate, as we can see. It crossed into the minus figures in 1986, \nat minus $13 billion. In 1986, 11 years ago, we were at $13 billion \nminus. Since then, it has come down and we were at $870 billion in \n1996, and it is estimated that the 1997 figures will go to $1 trillion \nin debt, in a debtor position.\n  This is incredible that, in just over 10 years, we have gone from \nbalance in our net foreign investment position to a $1 trillion debtor \nposition. I mean, we have been adding it at the rate of $100 billion, \n$120 billion, and $150 billion a year because of what happened to our \ntrade balance, which the able Senator from South Carolina pointed out. \nSo we have now come down to the point where we are $1 trillion in a \ndebtor position--the world's largest debtor country.\n  Now, these are the issues we ought to be addressing. Fast track \ndoesn't begin to address that issue. All fast track is trying to do is \nget the Congress to give up its right to review these agreements. \nEveryone says, well, we ought to do that. Look at how we have been \ndoing on the trade front. Well, how have we been doing on the trade \nfront? Look at this deterioration over the last 20 years. By \ncoincidence--perhaps not so much by coincidence--ever since we started \ndoing fast track, we started getting deterioration in the trade \nbalance, year after year. I think these trade agreements need to be \nbrought back to the Senate to give us a chance to review them. If they \nhad to come back here and be reviewed, not on a ``take all or nothing'' \nbasis, which, of course, is a loaded deck because as soon as that \nhappens, then the argument they make to you is not economic; it is \npolitical.\n  If the President negotiates a trade agreement, let's say, with Chile, \nand then he brings it to the Congress on fast track, all or nothing, \nthen we start asking economic questions about the trade agreement. We \nsay, well, you know, this balance here doesn't seem to work. You don't \nopen up their market the way you should and so forth. The next thing \nthey say to you is, oh, well, we have to approve it; otherwise, the \npolitical relationship will go to pieces. That is what we were told on \nthe Mexico agreement. We had debate on the floor of the Senate, and \npiercing remarks were made about the economics of that Mexican \nagreement and how it would not work and how disadvantageous it was. \nWell, then the argument shifted in order to try to push it through. The \nadministration didn't talk anymore about the economics of it; they \nstarted talking about the politics of it. They said: Well, Mexico is \nour next-door neighbor. If we don't approve this trade agreement, we \nwill have a crisis in our relationship.\n  In effect, that was probably true. But that's the argument that then \nis used, not the economic argument. So I think these agreements ought \nto be brought to the Senate. We ought to have a chance to amend them, \nif we choose to do so, not give away or derogate our authority in that \nimportant regard. Frankly, I think if the agreements have to come to \nthe Senate in that form, they are going to negotiate tougher \nagreements.\n  If the administration knows that those agreements are going to be \nsubmitted to the Congress and subject not only to the up-or-down vote \nof the Congress, but also subject to amendment, they are going to have \nto negotiate a much tighter agreement that will withstand scrutiny. And \nI think it will achieve a better balance, a better balance between our \nopportunity to go into the other countries' markets and their \nopportunity to come into our market because, clearly, what has been \nhappening for the last 20 years is that our market has been opened up \nfar more than other nations have reciprocated.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point, with respect to how \nyou make your agreements and the charge now that this is not a \nreferendum on NAFTA and Mexico, at the time NAFTA came up with respect \nto Mexico--I had voted for the free-trade agreement, the North American \nFree Trade Agreement with Canada, because we had similar economies: \nindividual rights, appeal processes, open markets, those kinds of \nthings, and a revered judiciary.\n  I will never forget that my colleague from New York, the \ndistinguished senior Senator, Senator Moynihan, said, ``How can you \nhave free trade when you\n\n[[Page S11742]]\n\ndon't even have free elections?'' Well, we look to the European \nexperience. The Europeans found out that the free-trade approach did \nnot work. They taxed themselves $5 billion to build up the entities of \na free market in Greece and Portugal before they admitted Greece and \nPortugal into the Common Market, and they did just exactly that.\n  Instead, we were told, no, Mexico was a prototype, said the Secretary \nof the Treasury and the Vice President of the United States. We went \npell-mell headlong, and everything they contended has gone awry the \nother way. They said that Mexican wages would be up. They have gone \nfrom $1 an hour down to 70 cents an hour. The American Chamber of \nCommerce in Mexico City says that 60 million Mexicans are living in \npoverty, and 25 Mexicans make as much as 25 million Mexicans. They said \nthat we would have a plus balance of trade. Instead we went from the \nplus balance to a negative balance. They said immigration would be \nbetter. It is worse now. They said drugs would be better. It has gotten \nworse. Just look at the morning Washington Post.\n  You could go right on down. Everything they said happened the other \nway. As a result, we never have really built up the entities of a free \nmarket like, for example, we have in Chile. I said 4 years ago I would \nbe glad to vote for a free-trade agreement with Chile. They have a \nrevered judiciary, they do have free-market rights. They have labor \nrights, they have rights of appeal. So there it is. When they say NAFTA \nreferendum, yes, it is. There is no education in the second kick of a \nmule, Mr. President.\n  We understand when they gave us that fast track on it that we were \ngetting in trouble. But they wouldn't listen. Now is the time to stop, \nlook, and listen, and deliberate and consider the agreement itself and \nnot fall for this parliamentary booby trap of the White House just \nopening up the bazaar and selling off line-item vetoes over on the \nHouse side as fast as they can trying to change that CBI vote they got \non last evening over in the House of Representatives. So the bazaar is \nopen. They are trying to buy off the votes. They are amending while we \nare talking about having hopefully the right to amend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, more than almost any other debate in this \nSenate this year, this one seems to me to pit hope versus fear, to pit \nthe lessons of history against the blindness to those lessons. One \nSenator, who will remain nameless, this morning made the statement that \nfree-trade arrangements arising out of fast-track proposals like this \nwould harm not only the people of the United States, but the people of \nthe other nations entering into such a free-trade proposition.\n  Mr. President, that exhibits a blindness to what history has shown us \nfor more than half a century. Without exception, each liberalization of \ntrade policies on the part of the United States that had been met by a \nliberalization on the part of our trading partners has benefited the \npeople of both countries. We are in an extended and significant period \nof economic gains today, as we speak here, in the aftermath of a series \nof policies carried out by administrations, both Republican and \nDemocratic, to free trade across the entire world. The North American \nFree-Trade Agreement and the most recent General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade all reflect the increasing dependence of all of the nations \nof the world on trade and the fact that all can prosper from a greater \ndegree of free trade.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think it's possible to find examples in \nhistory, perhaps to find a few examples of the present day, of nations \nthat have tried to create a sense of self-sufficiency with little, if \nany, foreign trade of any commodity whatsoever. When one searches out \nsuch examples, however, Mr. President, one finds, in every case, that \nthose countries are poverty-stricken and show no particular movement \nout of that poverty-stricken nature. It is only when these nations free \ntheir economy and tend to free their trade policies that they begin to \nprosper.\n  It's also possible, I suppose, to imagine a United States which, in \nevery single commodity consumed in the country, was a more efficient \nproducer than any of its trading partners and, therefore, would have no \nneed for imports at all. But, of course, that doesn't happen in the \nreal world. One's very success would create fields in which we continue \nthat domination and other fields in which countries begin to catch up \nwith us.\n  Trade is a two-way street. Trade is a benefit not just to those who \nwork in the trade field, but to consumers who are permitted a greater \nchoice of higher quality goods at lower prices than would be the case \nif trade were restricted. That, of course, does inevitably result in \nlosers in our economy because, as we export more, as we produce more \nfor export, we also, as a prosperous American society, have more money \nto spend and often choose to purchase imported goods in some areas.\n  There are many occasions on which it can be argued that there isn't a \nhuge increase in employment resulting in freer and greater trade. But \nit is extremely difficult to argue the proposition that export-oriented \nindustries, generally speaking, in the fields in which American \nproduction is most efficient and effective, whether industrial or \nagricultural, pays its employees far more than do those unskilled \ntrades that are affected by foreign competition, and which jobs are \nmore likely to be lost because someone else can do a better job than we \ndo.\n  So even if total employment is a zero-sum game, which it is not, the \nwages and salaries of those involved in trade-oriented occupations will \nbe much higher than those occupied in fields that are artificially \nprotected from foreign competition.\n  Now, does that mean, Mr. President, that under any and all \ncircumstances we should be indifferent to the antitrade activities of \nsome of our trading partners? Certainly not. As this body knows, I have \nbeen highly critical of some of the trade policies of this \nadministration with respect to China, with respect to Japan, and \nsometimes with respect to the European Community, when those policies \nhave imposed artificial restrictions on American producers. I wish that \nthis administration took a much stronger stance last week with respect \nto Chinese restrictions on our goods, given the huge nature of our \nbilateral trade deficit. But the fact that we can criticize the \nadministration for not having more eloquently and more decisively \nsupported American interests is not an argument against granting our \nadministration the opportunity to negotiate free-trade agreements. It \nis, if anything, an argument for it because, without exception, Mr. \nPresident, the nations, particularly in Latin America, with whom we are \nlikely to negotiate free-trade agreements, have greater tariffs and \ngreater restrictions against our goods than we do against theirs at the \npresent time. So it is clear that a reciprocal lowering of those \nbarriers at both ends will benefit a wide range of exporting industries \nin the United States.\n  Now, should we provide the President, at the same time, with more \ntools to defend American interests? We certainly should. For example, I \nsupport the efforts of my colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator \nDaschle, in proposing to amend this legislation with the text of S. \n219, the Agricultural Products Market Access Act of 1997. That bill \nwould set up a system for agricultural trade identical to that used to \nidentify violations of intellectual property rights, the special 301 \nprocedure. The bill would require the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, annually, to designate as priority countries those \ntrading partners having the most egregious trade barriers to American \nagricultural products. The USTR would then have the power to \ninvestigate those countries to determine whether countervailing \nmeasures are merited.\n  My State, Mr. President, is a great producer of agricultural products \nfor export, just as it is of intellectual properties and of aircraft. \nWe believe in the prosperity that comes from free trade. We want that \nfree trade to be truly free in both directions, and no power that we \ncould grant the President is more likely to lead to that free trade in \nboth directions than the fast-track legislation that is before us now. \nThat legislation, Mr. President, should be passed.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 41 minutes and\n\n[[Page S11743]]\n\n50 seconds. The Senator from Delaware as 77 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, in view of that, I think the other side \nshould now use some of its time since we are down now to 40 minutes and \nthey have almost double as much.\n  How much is on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventy-seven minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They have about twice as much time as we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, the time will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go into \na quorum call and the time to be charged to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I object.\n  Mr. ROTH. I object.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am glad to see the chairman of committee. We are down \nto 40 minutes and there are almost 80 minutes on the other side. And as \nwe approach the conclusion of the debate I think it would be reasonable \nat this point for the other side to use some of its time.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, my understanding is that the other side \nmay not use all of its time and would then perhaps want to yield \nwhatever they don't use and have a vote earlier than 5. I understand \nthat the unanimous-consent request that was entered into calls for a \nvote no later than 5 o'clock. So presumably, if all of our time is used \nand they yield back whatever time they don't use on that side, they \nwould expect to have a vote earlier than 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we have about four Members on our side \nthat still desire to speak on this matter. We have alerted their \noffices. We expect some of them to be here momentarily and expect to \nuse the remaining time. I think that is the purpose of the Senator from \nMaryland asking to reserve the 40 minutes. I certainly have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. SARBANES. All I am trying to protect again is the situation in \nwhich all time is used up on this side and then there are 80 minutes \nleft on the other side.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the distinguished Senator from Maryland that at \nthis time we only have one request. So we probably are going to yield \nback time. We are waiting to see if anybody else wants to speak.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Maryland is simply asking if we could \npreserve 40 some minutes that we have. Will the Presiding Officer \nindicate to us the time available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amount of time remaining is 38 minutes and \n48 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We will not seek to delay the vote. If the Senator's \nexpectation is to try to get to a vote before 5 we would not seek to \ndelay that but we would like very much to have a couple of minutes to \ntry to make sure we get the speakers here so we have the 38 minutes \navailable for the remaining speakers. If it turns out we don't need \nthat, we would be happy to yield that back as well. We have now \nrequests for speakers that are available to use the time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Why don't we just go ahead and call for a quorum, and take \nit from both sides equally? We are now checking to see if we need to \npreserve time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The problem about that solution is it will then use up \npart of the 40 minutes that we have left which the Senator has \ncalculated is needed in order to complete the remainder of his speakers \nthat we have.\n  Mr. ROTH. How much time do you need for that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Forty minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We desire to use all of the 40 minutes. As I understand \nthe Senator from Delaware, he is now checking to preserve that. It \nwould not be our intention to delay the vote to the extent he is going \nto yield time. We certainly understand the vote can be held earlier. We \nare now making certain that those who asked to speak come to the floor \nto have the opportunity to do so. If that gets substantially delayed, \nwe would understand the Senator's desire to proceed. I do not want to \nlose, at least to the extent we can prevent it, the 40 minutes that is \navailable.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, our people are not here \nbecause we had calculated that the time would go back to your side. And \nthe fact there is so much of an unbalance, I think demonstrates that.\n  Mr. ROTH. I have a request from the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. I will yield him 5 minutes of my time. I yield 5 minutes \nto the junior Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Madam President. Hopefully this will provide \nan opportunity for the chairman to get some of the Members to the \nfloor, and break up this discussion which is using all of your time.\n  Let me first rise, having sat in the chair for the last hour. I \nlistened to much of the debate. As someone who has been listening and \nwho voted against NAFTA, someone who had some of the same concerns that \nthe Senator from South Carolina voiced about the structure of the \nGovernment, judicial system, and other things, and as a result I felt \nvery comfortable voting against NAFTA. But in the House I voted for \nfast track because I believe that it is important for us to continue to \nexpand our trade horizons. We are not debating the trade agreement. We \nhave seen lots of things about the trade deficit, balance of trade, and \nall of these other things. But that is not really at issue here because \nwe are not debating a trade agreement. We are debating really a \nprocess--not an agreement.\n  And the process is for the ability of the President to be able to sit \ndown and negotiate a deal that is going to open up markets around the \nworld, hopefully in South America. The Senator from South Carolina said \nhe was ready to vote for an expansion of NAFTA to Chile possibly. We \nmay have that opportunity. I don't think we get to that opportunity, \nwhich I think is an important one for this country, unless we have \nfast-track authority for this President. I would like to see the same \nfrankly for Argentina and Brazil. I think it would be a tremendous \nopportunity for this country to expand our markets in the hemisphere to \ncountries that are capable of competing on a fair basis with this \ncountry. Those are great opportunities for American workers as well as \nfor better economic and diplomatic relationships between the countries \nin North and South America.\n  So, I see this not only as economic but also as a cultural and \ndiplomatic opportunity for us. But it does not happen unless we put the \nprocess in place for the President to negotiate these agreements.\n  I know the Senator said there are lots of other agreements that have \nbeen negotiated. That is true. But these are major negotiations. These \nare negotiations that without a structure such as fast track I don't \nbelieve you are going to get an honest negotiation with one side \nsitting across from the other and saying, ``Let's put together our best \nagreement. Let's work on give and take. You give. I give. We work on \nall of the details on how we structure a formalization of free trade \nbetween to two countries.'' And say, ``Oh, by the way, after I have \ngiven up some and you have given up some, and we have been able to \nnegotiate as best we can to a final agreement, I am going to take it \nback to the Congress, and they can change it and put it all back in our \nfavor.''\n  I don't know of too many countries that are going to be willing to do \nthat, who are going to be willing to sit down in the first place and \nsay, ``We are going to negotiate with you in good faith, and, by the \nway, your good faith means nothing because you cannot stand behind your \nword because the Congress can come, amend, and change what we \nnegotiated in a final agreement.''\n\n  That is what makes this debate somewhat vexing in my mind because we \nare talking about all of these horrible inequities that have resulted \nas a result of our trade policy. The people who are arguing against \nfast track want to continue our trade policy. This policy they say is \nso bad, they want to keep it in place by not allowing the President to \nnegotiate better agreements with other countries or in the\n\n[[Page S11744]]\n\nworld bodies to be able to open up trade to create a better trade \nopportunity for us around the world.\n  So I don't understand, and frankly, I am a little disturbed that we \nkeep hearing the rhetoric of bad trade and horrible agreements at the \nsame time not wanting to change those to make them better for this \ncountry. I think fast track is the opportunity to do that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Certainly. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In 1975 we first provided fast track. On this chart, \nthis is 1975. Look at what happened with the trade balance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am accepting the Senator's arguments as true--that in \nfact what you are signifying happened is true. By staying there and not \nchanging things does the Senator think things would get better? To me \nthat is the sin of when you believe that you tried the same thing, and \nyou are going to get a different result by trying the same thing. Then \nyou start to wonder what the thinking is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, if he is supporting fast track, \nhe is the one who wants to try the same thing because this was all \nunder fast track.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I voted against NAFTA. So I think I have some \nlegitimacy here. I am not debating that some of the agreements we have \nentered into in this country--you can't say only the ones entered into \nunder fast track. We have entered into a lot of other agreements that \nhave had an impact. But I am not debating that there are agreements \nthat have not been beneficial to the balance of trade to this country. \nWhat I am debating is that by not changing any of those agreements \nsomehow things are going to get better. That is really the argument \nhere--unless we make change in those agreements things will not get \nbetter. We cannot make those changes unless we have fast track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, will the distinguished chairman yield \nto me 3 minutes?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the distinguished Senator 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I simply would wish to say that I have \nlistened with great respect to the Senator from Maryland as regards the \ntime sequenced in which the fast-track legislation went into effect and \nthe foreign trade deficit began to grow.\n  I say two things.\n  The first is that the essentials of the fast-track negotiations have \nbeen in place since 1934. Nothing that discontinuous occurred in 1974. \nWhat simply was required was at that time the trade negotiations turned \nfrom tariffs on things--machines, iron ore, oil, whatever--to the \nquestion of the more complex but growing area of services, intellectual \nproperty, and matters like that. That is what impels us to give the \nPresident negotiating authority beyond the simple reduction of tariffs.\n  The reciprocal trade agreements that began back in 1934 said the \nPresident may cut these tariffs up to 50 percent, and proclaim it after \nhe has reached it to his satisfaction and agreement. The increase in \nthe trade deficit corresponds precisely to the onset of enormous \nbudgetary deficits by the Federal Government. It is elemental \nbookkeeping of economics--that unless you have a very high savings \nrate, which we do not have, you will finance a Federal deficit by \nborrowing from abroad, and that borrowing will take the form of \nimports. In economics this is a fixed equation. One side equals the \nother. And at just that moment, as the Senator from Maryland pointed \nout, deficits begin to grow, we have the second oil shock followed by \nthe huge deficits of the 1980's. They are an equivalence which comes \nalmost at a level of bookkeeping. They have to happen.\n\n  Now, we have on point where our deficits are disappearing and we \nshould have every reason in the world to think that trade deficit will \ndisappear as well--it need not do--if our savings remain at the low \nlevel they are. But if they return to a normal level, which we hope \nthey will, now that the deficit is not using them up, or now that more \nresources are available, that deficit will shrink dramatically, or we \nwill have to write all the textbooks over again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield? Will the Senator yield me 2 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, in light of the comments, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a press release from \nthe Economic Strategy Institute entitled ``New ESI Study Finds Causes \nand Costs of Trade Deficit More Complex Than Traditional Economic \nRhetoric.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nNew ESI Study Finds Causes and Costs of Trade Deficit More Complex Than \n                     Traditional Economic Rhetoric\n\n       Washington, DC.--For years mainstream economists and \n     economic journalists explained away public concern over the \n     U.S. trade deficit by arguing the true cause of the deficit \n     was the huge U.S. federal budget deficit and, more recently, \n     low U.S. savings. However, a new study released today by the \n     Economic Strategy Institute refutes these traditional \n     explanations and argues they are no longer adequate to \n     explain what is, in reality, a significantly more complex \n     problem negatively affecting a wide variety of economic \n     statistics, including aggregate demand, gross domestic \n     product, the budget deficit, business financed research and \n     development, wage rates, and exchange rates.\n       Titled The Trade Deficit: Where Does It Come From and What \n     Does It Do?, the study examines the recent trends in the U.S. \n     federal budget deficit and the U.S. savings rate over the \n     past decade and uses an economic model to examine the costs \n     of these deficits to the U.S. economy.\n       In contrast to a decade ago, private savings now exceed \n     private investment, the U.S. economy continues to grow at a \n     slower pace than the global economy, and net inflows of \n     foreign private investment are smaller. From 1986 to 1996, \n     the United States achieved a $92 billion improvement in the \n     sum of its private savings balance and government deficits; \n     yet, the trade deficit and the broader current account \n     balance only improved by $29 billion and $5 billion, \n     respectively. In 1997, the combined federal and state deficit \n     continues to fall, yet the trade deficit will again exceed \n     $100 billion, while the current account deficit will be about \n     $150 billion.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                            Net foreign                                         \n                                                              Private savings   Federal and State     U.S. growth       Global growth         private          Net exports      Current account \n                                                              less investment      deficits \\1\\        (percent)          (percent)        investment \\2\\    (billions of $)    (billions of $) \n                                                              (billions of $)    (billions of $)                                          (billions of $)                                       \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1986.......................................................              -12.4             -152.6                2.9                3.4               89.5             -140.0             -153.2\n1996.......................................................                9.0              -82.0                2.4                3.8               66.8             -111.0             -148.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ These figures include both government current spending and receipts, and governmental capital spending and borrowing for roads, schools, equipment, etc. The federal current spending       \n  deficit and the combined federal/state current balances are the figures cited in daily news accounts and political discussions of taxes, spending and deficits. The federal/state current     \n  deficit fell from $82.6 billion to $5.1 billion from 1986 to 1996, and should be in surplus in 1997.                                                                                          \nThe capital spending deficit represents the addition of new capital assets (roads, buildings, etc.) and new liabilities (bonds) on the government's balance sheet, and it is not an item on the \n  government's current income and expenditure statement; however, it is part of the nation's combined public and private capital financing needs and is an element in the national savings      \n  balance. Notably, the government capital deficit increased only $12.1 billion from 1986 to 1996, and the marked improvement in federal and state finances was attributable to genuine progress\n  in federal/state current spending deficit.                                                                                                                                                    \n\\2\\ See Footnote 1.                                                                                                                                                                             \n\n       Authored by Dr. Peter Morici, director of the Center for \n     International Business at the University of Maryland and an \n     adjunct senior fellow at the Economic Strategy Institute, the \n     study examines the old chestnut that the current account is \n     simply the other side of an immutable accounting identity--\n     the difference between domestic savings and investment--and \n     finds that is becoming increasingly clear that trade and \n     current account deficits are strongly influenced by forces \n     quite separate from U.S. fiscal policies and domestic savings \n     and investment behavior.\n\n[[Page S11745]]\n\n       Morici argues that most economists overlook the fact the \n     accounting identity can and does work in reverse. Increased \n     foreign demand for U.S. securities, instigated by events \n     independent of U.S. government policies and business \n     conditions, can powerfully influence the U.S. current account \n     deficit and domestic economy.\n       For example, in the 1990s, the Japanese, the Chinese, and \n     other governments have dramatically increased their purchases \n     of U.S. government securities, propping up the value of the \n     dollar against other currencies. This has helped to sustain \n     both their trade surpluses and U.S. trade deficits, even as \n     the United States has put its fiscal house in order. In most \n     cases, he argues, these purchases are not market-driven \n     decisions made in response to higher U.S. interest rates. \n     Rather they often reflect policy decisions to block exchange \n     rate adjustments, and reduce internal pressures on national \n     governments to revise protectionist trade polices and the \n     reliance on export-driven growth.\n       ``Other things being equal, one would expect U.S. \n     government budget balances and trade and current accounts to \n     be correlated,'' Morici argues. ``This is not the case, \n     however, which reflects the strong influence of other, \n     offsetting factors. Significantly, these statistics do not \n     imply that government deficits have little consequence for \n     U.S. external balances. Rather, they illustrate that simple \n     accounting identities do not justify blind assertions of \n     causality.''\n       To analyze how U.S. fiscal policies, the actions of foreign \n     governments, or abrupt shifts in private investor sentiment \n     may affect trade current account deficits and the domestic \n     economy, Morici constructed a model of 1996 macroeconomics \n     activity and potential GDP for the study and analyzed the \n     trade and current account deficits may instigate in markets \n     for domestic goods and services, capital, and foreign \n     exchange. He found trade deficits impose costs on the U.S. \n     economy in several ways:\n       In the near term, trade deficits may reduce aggregate \n     demand, and lower real GDP by redirecting labor and capital \n     away from export and import-competing activities, where these \n     resources are generally more productive.\n       Eliminating the trade deficit, through a combination of \n     reduced government deficits and foreign government purchases \n     of U.S. securities, would increase real GDP by $44 billion or \n     about 0.6 percent.\n       Eliminating the trade deficit would increase business-\n     financed R by an estimated 3 percent. Production function \n     studies indicate that the R elasticity of output-\n     per-hour in the private business sector is about 0.19. This \n     implies that persistent trades deficits have lowered the \n     growth of labor productivity and potential real GDP in the \n     United States by about 0.5 to 0.6 percentage points per year. \n     Trade deficits appear to be responsible for a significant \n     share of the slow down in the growth of U.S. productivity and \n     GDP in recent years.\n       In addition to these dead-weight losses, persistent trade \n     deficits impose other, distributional consequences. The same \n     forces that give rise to trade deficits also raise the \n     exchange rate for the dollar by about 7 percent. This lowers \n     the prices received for exports and import-competing \n     products, and lowers the wages and profits earned by workers \n     and firms in these industries. In turn, prices, wages, and \n     profits are higher elsewhere in the domestic economy.\n       Given an estimate of the share of the economy whose wages \n     and other factor prices are substantially influenced by the \n     prices of traded goods and services, the amount of income \n     redistributed may be estimated. In 1996, exports plus imports \n     were about 24 percent of GDP. By these estimates, 1.6 percent \n     of GDP is being transferred through reduced wages and \n     payments to other factors. If a much more conservative \n     estimate of the share of factor markets affected by trade is \n     applied, this estimate of income transferred become 0.6 \n     percent of GDP, which is still a formidable figure.\n       ``These estimates,'' Morici argues,'' go a long way toward \n     explaining the fierce resistance to continued globalization \n     encountered from workers and firms whose present and \n     prospective incomes have been adversely affected by this \n     process.''\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. It says:\n\n       For years mainstream economists and economic journalists \n     explained away public concern over the U.S. trade deficit by \n     arguing the true cause of the deficit was the huge U.S. \n     Federal budget deficit and, more recently, low U.S. savings.\n\n  Exactly the argument the Senator from New York has just made.\n\n       However, a new study released today by the Economic \n     Strategy Institute refutes these traditional explanations and \n     argues they are no longer adequate to explain what is, in \n     reality, a significantly more complex problem negatively \n     affecting a wide variety of economic statistics, including \n     aggregate demand, gross domestic product, the budget deficit, \n     business-financed research and development, wage rates, and \n     exchange rates.\n\n  And then it goes on in effect to say that this traditional analysis \nis really simplistic; it doesn't really answer the situation. It is \nalmost dismissive of any trade deficit problem. In fact, if you look at \nthe movements here, there is not a direct correlation between the \nvarious factors the Senator talked about. I mean you have a decline in \nthe goods trade balance here at the time the trade deficit is still \ngoing up.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We held tightly.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am sorry. You have an improvement in the trade \ndeficit when the deficit was going up. Then here the deficit has been \ncoming down, the domestic deficit, yet the trade deficit has been \nworsening.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I simply say to my friend that I admit the \ncomplexity of this matter.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I do no more than argue what economists now believe, \nthat they may have to change their mind. I don't in any way contest. \nBut I am just saying tomorrow when we have more time I wish to discuss \nthis at greater length.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator see any problem with running trade \ndeficits?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. There is no alternative when you have a huge budget \ndeficit, sir.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What do you do when you don't have a budget deficit and \nyou are still running large trade deficits?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Then you better rewrite your textbooks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That's what I think needs to be done.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That has not happened yet.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is why I wanted to submit that study for the \nRecord.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That hasn't happened yet.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The real world may be ahead of the textbook writers.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That's been known to happen.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in \nrelation to the motion to proceed to S. 1269 at 4:20 today, with \nSenator Dorgan or his designee in control of 40 minutes, and Senator \nRoth or his designee in control of the remaining time, with the 5 \nminutes prior to the vote in control of Senator Roth and the 5 minutes \nprior to Senator Roth's time in control of Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, thank you. I thank the chairman for \nyielding me this time.\n  Madam President, some have argued that fast-track procedures are \neither unnecessary or that they are a threat to Congress' \nconstitutional authority, or both.\n  The answer to that is fast track is none of the above. It is both \nnecessary and constitutional. First of all, fast track is absolutely \ncritical if the United States is to continue to expand global market \nopportunities for American manufacturers and service providers and \ntheir workers. Without fast track, no President can assure our trading \npartners that the terms of a hard-won agreement will not be rewritten \nby Congress. That is the problem.\n  Now, sometimes it is worthwhile to look at history. In 1934, Congress \napproved the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which gave the President \nauthority to lower tariffs with our trading partners. That worked fine \nfor several decades. This was when we still had an emerging global \ntrading system which primarily relied on tariffs. Between 1934 and 1945 \nthe United States concluded 29 bilateral agreements for tariff \nreductions. When the GATT system came into being in 1948, the system \nstill worked. Tariff reductions were the main focus of five successful \nnegotiating rounds between 1947 and 1962.\n  But here comes the modern system. By the 1960's, the world trading \nsystem had become much more sophisticated and so had trade barriers. In \n1962, the Kennedy round began, and for the first time the negotiations \naddressed not just tariffs but nontariff problems such as antidumping \nmeasures. When the negotiations concluded on the Kennedy round in 1967, \nthe Johnson administration brought the agreement back home, but \nCongress promptly passed legislation nullifying part of the Kennedy \nround agreement, effectively\n\n[[Page S11746]]\n\namending the deal that had been so carefully worked out with the GATT \nnations.\n  The result. What happened? The Kennedy round went into effect without \nour participation. The message which that sent to our trading partners \nwas obvious. Hard-fought trade deals with the United States will not \nstick. And the corollary lesson to the United States was equally clear. \nBefore the United States will be allowed back at the negotiating table, \nit must restore its credibility by demonstrating its ability to stick \nto a deal.\n  Therefore, when the Tokyo round began, President Ford appealed to a \nDemocratic Congress for a solution. The dilemma was noted that our \nnegotiators cannot expect to accomplish the negotiating goals if there \nis no reasonable assurances that the negotiated agreements would be \nvoted up or down on their merits. So a set of procedures was developed, \nthe so-called fast track. As has been noted here many times, that fast-\ntrack authority has been extended to every President, Democrat or \nRepublican. It has been authorized or reauthorized or extended four \ntimes, and it is the means by which every major trade agreement since \nthe 1970's has been implemented.\n  In mid-1994, fast-track lapsed, and since then our trading partners, \nquite rightly, have questioned our ability to stick by a deal, and they \nhave been reluctant to deal with us. Some have cited the fact that the \nadministration has concluded all but a handful of 222 trade agreements \nwithout fast track. ``You don't need fast track. Why, we had 222 \nagreements without it.''\n  That is misleading. There are 200 plus agreements listed by the \nadministration as accomplishments, but look at the list. Most of the \nagreements tend to be small, product-specific arrangements like an \nagreement on ultra-high-temperature milk or the List of Principles for \nMedical Devices. They are certainly important, but they hardly qualify \nas major stimuli to our national economy.\n  In contrast, the handful of agreements that require fast track are \nthe critical, comprehensive, multisector agreements that address both \ntariff and nontariff barriers.\n  Now, let's get to this constitutional argument that has been tossed \naround. Fast track represents, it is said, a surrender of Congress' \nconstitutional duty under article I of our Constitution, which says \nthat ``The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce with \nforeign Nations. . . .''\n  Under fast track, Congress' role in trade negotiations has not been \ndiminished or disregarded. Clearly it would be impossible for 435 \nRepresentatives or 100 Senators, all of whom believe they are qualified \nto be President--indeed, I believe there has been a terrible \noverlooking that they are not chosen as President--each of these \nindividuals could not carry out at the same time our trade \nnegotiations. Now, what fast track does is it allows the President to \ncarry out the negotiations but imposes strict requirements for ongoing \nconsultations to ensure that Congress' voice is heard.\n  Madam President, it has been my privilege to have served on the \nFinance Committee for 19 years now. When we have a fast-track measure \ncome up, there is constant consultation with that committee and other \nSenators on the negotiations that are taking place that subsequently \nfast track will be asked for. So the Israel, Canada, Mexico, and \nUruguay Round Agreements were guided by thousands, literally thousands, \nof briefings and discussions between the negotiators and Members of \nCongress or their staffs. Congress will continue to be consulted. So, \nindeed, we do write the legislation to implement these agreements, and \nCongress' authority is not being constitutionally revoked or the \nConstitution is not being overridden.\n  Madam President, the fast-track partnership has guaranteed Congress' \ncontinued fulfillment of its constitutional role in international \nnegotiations.\n  Now, is every Member of Congress going to be satisfied? No, \napparently not, as we have heard this afternoon and yesterday. But will \nthe partnership produce agreements that have taken into account a broad \nvariety of U.S. interests and views? That is absolutely true.\n  I would just briefly like to touch on what happens if we do not \napprove fast track. That is the argument in the Chamber here. Do not \nhave it. I know that it is always prefaced by the opponents saying, \n``I'm not against free trade,'' and then they proceed to inveigh \nagainst fast track.\n  The United States is the world's largest trading nation, the largest \nexporter and the largest importer. We are the giant of the world trade \narea. We enjoy prosperity today in large part because of our trading \nactivities.\n  This is what Dr. Alan Greenspan said a week ago, on October 29:\n\n       The quite marked expansion in trade has really had a \n     pronounced positive impact on rising living standards. Since \n     1992, exports have been responsible for one-third of our \n     economic growth. Trade now represents a solid 30 percent of \n     our GDP, and our exports continue to rise. This export \n     activity supports some 11.5 million well-paying jobs across \n     the Nation.\n\n  They certainly do in my State where we are very, very grateful for \nour trade and where we believe the opportunities for trade should \nincrease. Our exports from small Rhode Island hit $1 billion last year, \nwith projections for this year estimated at $1.2 billion. State \nofficials in my State count on exports as a key element in our economic \ngrowth and are aiming to reach $2 billion in exports by the year 2000, \nwhich is only what, 3\\1/2\\ years from now.\n  If we want to continue this prosperity, we must continue to advance \ntrade liberalization worldwide. In order to do this, we must have fast \ntrack.\n  Now, there is urgency to this. We are seeing the southern nations of \nthis hemisphere--Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay--mount an \naggressive effort to develop a free-trade region throughout the Western \nHemisphere. Chile, which is more than a little tired of waiting for us, \nhas completed separate trade agreements with Canada and Mexico as well \nas Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, and they are reaching out to Central \nAmerica and Asia likewise. Mexico has concluded agreements with \nColombia, Venezuela, and Costa Rica, and are talking to the other \nnations including the Caribbean nations.\n\n  The European and Asian nations are getting in on this. Both the \nEuropean Union and the Southeastern Asian nations are courting the \nSouth American countries. Chinese and Japanese officials are eyeing the \nmajor Latin American nations.\n  The United States is in real danger of falling behind all of this. \nThat has ramifications for American workers and their families.\n  One example that hits close to home for Rhode Islanders is Quaker \nFabric Co., a Fall River, MA, textile firm employing 1,800 workers--\nmany of them Rhode Islanders. Quaker recently lost a $1.8 million \nannual contract in Chile to a Mexican competitor whose product is \nexempt from Chile's 11-percent tariff thanks to the Chile-Mexico trade \npact. And Quaker was told by an Argentine buyer that he was switching \nto a Brazilian fabric supplier whose product, while of lesser quality, \nis not subject to a 25-percent tariff. Quaker's president tells me that \nif Quaker could just gain equal footing in the region with its Latin \ncompetitors, the company could boost export sales and add 200 more \njobs.\n  It is examples like these that have spurred the National Governors' \nAssociation and the U.S. Conference of Mayors--whose members are keenly \ninterested in economic growth--to strongly endorse fast track \nreauthorization.\n  Opponents of fast track would have one believe that there are other \noptions than fast track. That is not true. If we want to play in the \ntrade game, if we want to make agreements with trading partners, if we \nwant to continue to engage in the world of trade, we must have fast \ntrack. If not, we cannot enter into significant agreements with our \npartners, and others will quickly move in to fill the vacuum--and reap \nthe jobs--we have left behind.\n  In sum, fast track is in the best interests of the United States. It \nis a necessary prerequisite for negotiations; it is constitutional; and \nit is critical for economic and job growth in our nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the pending legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to Senator Reed.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n[[Page S11747]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I am here today to comment once again on \nnot only the fast-track agreement but also the overall context of U.S. \ntrading. The discussion between the Senator from Maryland and the \nSenator from New York pointed out the complexity of looking at the \ntrade deficit. But there are some things that are quite clear despite \nthe complexity.\n  In 1980, we had a surplus of roughly $2.3 billion. By 1996--we have \nnow a deficit of $165 billion. That is the time in which fast track has \nbeen operative. That is the time in which fast track has been the \ncenterpiece of our legislative efforts, our international efforts to \nincrease trade in the world.\n  This deficit right now is a result of many things. It is a result of, \nin some respects, our fast-track policy. But it is a result also of our \ninability, I think, to deal with some of the more basic issues in \ninternational trade, dealing with some countries that utilize access to \nour market but at the same time deny us access to their market. It is a \nphenomenon also caused by the proliferation of multinational \ncorporations that move their operations, in many cases, out of the \nUnited States because of our environmental laws, because of our labor \nlaws, because of many stringent requirements that raise and maintain \nthe quality of life and the standard of living here in the United \nStates. And they have gone to other countries. In fact, some of our \npolicies have encouraged their departure.\n  One of the striking differences between this fast-track bill today, \n1997, and the fast-track bill that was adopted in 1988, is that we have \nneglected to include within the principal negotiating objectives \nattention to the rights of workers of our potential trading partners. \nWe have also neglected to include currency coordination, which is an \nimportant aspect of ensuring that a free-trade system operates \nappropriately and correctly. We have also narrowed significantly the \nscope of concerns which we can address with respect to the environment.\n  Regardless of our budget situation, we will have contributed to the \nfurther deterioration, if this bill passes, of our trade position, \nbecause we have included increased incentives to deploy capital from \nthe United States from other parts of the world to developing \ncountries, which effectively will mean that they will be our \ncompetitors.\n  I know, when the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from New York \nwere talking, they were talking about the overall trade balance, making \nthe distinction between our trade balance and our Federal deficit. But \nI think if you just aggregate that trade balance, you will see clearly \nthat in terms of manufactured goods we are consistently losing. And \nthat is the most prescient, tangible point with respect to the \narguments that, because of some of these trading rules, literally our \ngood manufacturing jobs are going overseas.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. REED. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Since 1974, our trade deficit on merchandise goods is \n$1.8 trillion. In just over 20 years, $1.8 trillion. Up until 1975 we \nhad been running modest surpluses every year in our merchandise trade \ndeficit. So there has been a dramatic deterioration.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is quite correct--reclaiming my time. It \nillustrates his point, that there may be, in fact, countervailing \nforeign investments in this country to make up for our budget deficits, \nbut that does not explain the phenomenon of losing consistently and \npersistently the battle for the sale of manufactured goods from our \nsuppliers to other countries around the world.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further? To the extent there \nare such investments, those then become claims which foreigners hold \nagainst us. So what has happened is we have gone from being a creditor \nnation in 1980, where we were a creditor nation to the tune of $400 \nbillion, to today where we are a debtor nation to the tune of $1 \ntrillion. So, because they sell more to us than we sell to them, they \nbuild up claims against us and we become a debtor. Now we are the \nbiggest debtor nation in the world.\n  Mr. REED. Again, the Senator is absolutely correct. Frankly, to move \nto an analogy which is a little more colloquial but perhaps just as \ncompelling, if we were managing a professional baseball team and we \nlost every year for 10 or 15 years, I don't think we would be managing \nthat baseball team.\n  That is essentially, if you charge us as managers of our \ninternational trade policy, we have lost every year for the last \nseveral decades. The trade policy has to be changed. Frankly, I don't \nbelieve anyone here is advocating that we could not use a good fast-\ntrack procedure. The argument is this is not a good fast-track \nprocedure; that we are neglecting several of the most critical items \nwhen it comes to realistic competition between countries in the world \ntoday for international trade. We are totally neglecting the \ndifferential between our wage structure, particularly our manufacturing \nwage structure, and the wage structures overseas. We are neglecting it \nby simply saying that is not important to us, we don't care if workers \nin Third World countries are making 2 or 3 cents an hour or 20 cents an \nhour, when our workers are making $6 or $7 an hour or more. We don't \ncare about that.\n  We should care about that because, frankly, that is one of the \nreasons why we have a huge trade deficit, particularly in manufactured \ngoods. Because there are incentives now, huge incentives, to deploy \ncapital from the United States into these countries so that they can \nset up manufacturing plants. And we have seen it consistently. We have \nseen it even deliberately, blatantly, in the sense of finding places \nwhere the labor laws are so lax that there are incentives for companies \nto move in.\n  In Malaysia it was an explicit condition of the movement of many \nAmerican manufacturers into that country that Malaysia would not have, \nor enforce, strong labor laws. They would not give their workers the \nright to benefit from these new industries coming in and developing and \nselling successfully in the world economy.\n  Is that wrong? It's wrong for those workers, which is a concern. But \nwhat is more of a concern for me, it is wrong for our workers because \nhow can we expect to be competing against workers with new, modern \ntechnology based on new capital investments, workers who are as well \nskilled as ours may be, in a world in which they are paid a fraction of \nwhat is the minimum wage here in the United States?\n  Then you can also look at the issue of environmental quality, which \nis so important. It is not important in just a touchy-feely sense; we \nwant to make sure there are forests and the streams are filled with \nfish, et cetera. It is really a very practical sense.\n  When a group of multinational countries now can go into Mexico, set \nup new manufacturing plants and literally take all their effluent and \njust pour it into the local sewer--something they could never do in \ntheir home country, not in the United States, not in Europe--that is an \nadvantage for them to go there. We have to recognize that. We can't be \nnaive and sloganize here on the floor and say it's just free trade, and \nfree trade. Free trade makes sense if there are the conditions for free \ntrade: That there are, in fact, complementary monetary and fiscal \npolicies in each country; that there is, in fact, respect for workers' \nrights and workers' ability to organize.\n  One of the assumptions underlying free trade is that when workers are \ndisplaced by imports in one sector of the economy, they move to a more \nefficient job in another sector of the economy. And we know that is not \nthe case. It doesn't happen. Maybe it will happen in 50 or 100 years. \nBut in the lives of Americans today, and their children's lives, that \ndoesn't happen. We see dislocation. And we see dislocation that can be \navoided, at least minimized, if we adopt strategies in this fast-track \nlegislation that will direct the President to deal with these issues, \nto deal with them aggressively and to come back to us with an agreement \nthat does talk about how we are going to raise the standard of living, \nthrough trade, of individuals in our trading partners' countries; of \nhow we are going to deal with environmental issues in those countries; \nhow are we going to make sure that currency valuations changes, \nmanipulations, don't undercut all that we think we have gained at the \nbargaining table.\n\n  The classic example of course is Mexico. We went in and reduced \nsignificantly, we thought, the tariffs that the\n\n[[Page S11748]]\n\nMexicans would charge us, the tariffs that we would charge them, \nthinking that now our goods would move back and forth freely. All of \nthat was wiped out by a 40-percent reduction in the value of the peso; \nthe purchasing power of Mexican citizens who might want our goods. And \nto not be concerned about that, to not elevate that issue of currency \ncoordination to a major negotiating objective is absurd. It is \nparticularly absurd within the last 2 weeks when all we have read about \nis the currency attacks in the Far East and Thailand, in all of these \ncountries, leading to a shock wave on Wall Street.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. REED. I request an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield an additional 3 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Let me just, in the remaining 3 minutes, say that \nindividuals, colleagues who come to the floor and just talk slogans \nabout free trade have not, I think, understood what is going on. Why \ndoes Japan run a $47 billion a year surplus with the United States? \nBecause they exclude our goods. Why does China run a multibillion-\ndollar surplus with the United States? Because they exclude our goods; \nand because they manipulate their currency to reduce the wages, \neffectively, of their workers; because they are insensitive to \nenvironmental quality; because they claim, for cultural reasons, \nhistorical reasons, they don't have to abide by intellectual property \nrules or anything else.\n  Those are the real issues that we face concerning our ability to \ncompete in the world economy. What does this legislation do about those \nthings? Ignores workers' rights; ignores environmental quality; and to \na great degree it ignores currency coordination as major negotiating \nobjectives. In effect what we said is: Listen, we are going to give the \nPresident fast-track power to do everything except what is most \nimportant to be done. And that is our objection. No one is here on the \nfloor saying that we can withdraw from the world trade economy or we \nshould withdraw from the world trade economy. What we are saying is \nlet's negotiate agreements that will benefit all the citizens of this \ncountry; that will benefit working men and women throughout this \ncountry; that will ensure that they have a fair opportunity to work and \nearn wages that are decent. And that is not going to happen under this \nagreement.\n  What we have to do, I believe--and I hope we can--is ensure that the \nnegotiating objectives are changed; that we do provide the President \nwith the directions, with the incentives, with the authority to go out \nthere and talk seriously about all these issues. Frankly, there was \nsome discussion before that our trading partners won't take us \nseriously. What they won't take seriously is any President of the \nUnited States talking about workers' rights, about environmental \nquality, and about a strong stable currency coordination in the world, \nif we pass this fast-track agreement. Because we basically told them we \nare not interested. What we are interested in here is promoting capital \ndeployment from the United States into areas of the world that don't \ntreat workers properly, that don't care about the environment, and may \nor may not manipulate their currency to maintain the advantage they \nhave against the United States.\n  This is not an agreement that we should support. If we want fast \ntrack, let's get it right, let's do it right. This is not the right way \nto go.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I compliment my colleague, Senator Reed, \nfor his very astute remarks. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nputting together what I think is a very excellent presentation. He has \nbeen carrying it through and I am proud to stand with him and the \nothers who feel that we should not grant fast-track authority in this \nparticular case.\n  Madam President, as a student of economics, I learned that if you \nlisten to an economics debate you will find that people generally fall \ninto categories.\n  When it comes to trade, I believe there are three categories. First, \nit is the free-trade-or-nothing category where you can't tell them \nanything about the evils that could come. They don't want to see the \nstatistics about what happens to the downward pressure on wages. They \ndon't want you to tell them even that there is any degradation to the \nenvironment. I call it the see-no-evil category. They don't want to \nknow.\n  Then there is another category which is the no-trade-no-matter-what \ncategory. I think those are the ones who don't want to hear any of the \nbenefits that can come from trade. Maybe they are a little long run \nthey say, or maybe we need to work more closely to make sure that the \nproblems are resolved, but they don't want to hear that. That is the \nhear-no-evil category.\n  Then there is this third category that I think a lot of my colleagues \nare in, and I certainly put myself in that category. And that third \ncategory is the fair-trade category, not the free-trade-at-any-cost \ncategory, not the no-trade-no-matter-what category, but the fair-trade \ncategory.\n  I want you to know, Madam President, I have voted for fast-track \nauthority several times. When it came to Canada, when it came to \nIsrael, when it came to the GATT, I was there, because I felt when our \nadministration, whoever it is, Republican or Democratic President, \nnegotiates with countries who have similar standards of living, similar \nenvironmental laws, I don't fear downward pressure on wages, I don't \nfear downward standards for the environment, I don't fear downward \nstandards on food safety, because when we are dealing with countries \nwho care about what we pay, who have the same values in terms of worker \nrights and environmental rights, I feel comfortable giving fast-track \nauthority to the President.\n  I have to say that in this case, I feel very uncomfortable about \ngiving this authority. I have been trying to find out what is the \nminimum wage or the wage paid for a manufacturing job in Indonesia, in \nMalaysia which are countries that, as members of APEC, may very well \nwill be part of this authority. I have not been able to find out the \nminimum wage or the average wage for manufacturing jobs is in those \ncountries. I am told that a statistical abstract put out by the \nDepartment of Labor does not contain the average hourly wage for \nmanufacturing jobs in those countries. I am also told that the \nDepartment of Labor's statistical abstract does not contain the hourly \nmanufacturing wage for Chile either. Rather, someone at CRS \nextrapolated from other available information to come up with an \napproximate hourly wage in Chile of $2.32. This compares to an \napproximate average hourly salary of $17.74 in the United States for \nmanufacturing jobs.\n  So here we have colleagues willing to hand over authority to make \nagreements with countries that we don't even know what they pay their \nworkers, let alone what their environmental laws are.\n  It seems to me there has to be a better way. I was listening to \nSenator Byrd's speech, and when he said, ``Why are we here?'' I think \nthat is a reasonable question, because if you read article I, section 8 \nof the Constitution, it grants Congress the sole power to regulate \ntrade and commerce with foreign nations and to make all laws which are \nnecessary to carry out that power.\n  Once in a while, we cede away our power. As I said, there have been \ntimes when I felt it was OK to do that. But in this case, when you \ndon't even know who it is you are dealing with, what they pay their \npeople, what their environmental laws are, it makes very little sense, \nand I think it puts our workers and our environment at great risk. The \nbenefits of trade, under these circumstances, will certainly not \noutweigh the disadvantages.\n  I represent the largest State in the Union, along with Senator \nFeinstein. I have watched the NAFTA. It was a close call for me on the \nNAFTA. I wound up saying no, because I believed the same problems \nexisted then: the downward pressure on wages; the lack of environmental \nlaws.\n  I have to say that as you look at the different analyses as to \nwhether NAFTA has worked--did it do better or\n\n[[Page S11749]]\n\nnot--as we have already heard today, we went from a trade surplus of \nabout $5.4 billion with Mexico in 1992 to a trade deficit of more than \n$17 billion in 1996.\n\n  Increased trade. Who benefited? Ask the California wine industry, I \nsay to my friends. I represent the proudest wine industry maybe in the \nworld. Those wines that are made in California are world renowned. Yet \nUnited States wine exports to Mexico have dropped by approximate one-\nthird. United States wines face a 20 percent tariff in Mexico.\n  However, coincident with NAFTA, Mexico gave Chilean wines a tariff \nreduction from 20 percent to 8 percent and guaranteed duty-free status \nwithin a year. But U.S. wines were subject to a 10 year phase-out of \nthe 20 percent tariff. Ambassador Kantor, who I believe really wanted \nto make something good happen, promised to negotiate, within 120 days \nof NAFTA coming into force, a reduction of Mexican tariffs on United \nStates wines--it did not happen. In fact, Mexican tariffs on United \nStates wine and brandy are still at their pre-NAFTA levels, as a result \nof an unrelated dispute regarding corn brooms.\n  So as my kids used to say when they were younger, it is time to take \na time out. Take a deep breath, see where we are on the agreements we \nhave already signed that haven't lived up to their promises.\n  Sometimes when my colleagues--and I just heard one of them on the \nfloor--talk about fast track, they get this energy. It is almost an \nout-of-control enthusiasm. I think sometimes when you go on a fast \ntrack, you go too fast. What is the rush? Why not allow this Congress \nto do our work? I didn't come here to exert downward pressure on \nworkers' wages. I came here to make life better for the people of \nCalifornia. I didn't come here to see our environmental laws degraded, \nyet we have already seen examples of trade policy pressuring the United \nStates to lower its environmental protections. Look at what recently \nhappened with our dolphin protection laws. A trade deal with Mexico \nprevailed over our law and resulted in our law being weakened. In 1999, \nthe definition of our beloved ``dolphin safe'' label could change \nbecause of trade pressures--not because we love dolphins any less. They \njust take a back seat.\n  We saw shipments of poisoned berries come into our country. If we had \nenough inspectors there would probably be a better chance that these \nsituations would not occur. Time out, folks, before we see that kind of \nsituation expand. Sure, there will be more trade. But is that the kind \nof trade we want, where we have to recall berries because we don't have \nenough inspectors?\n  I invite my colleagues to go down to the San Diego border. The border \ninfrastructure is inadequate for the amount of trade. The new trade \nwith Mexico as a result of NAFTA has placed severe stress on our \nsouthern border transportation infrastructure. According to the \nCalifornia State World Trade Commission, the result has been \nbottlenecks and traffic jams at border crossings, safety hazards, and \ndeclining environmental quality in the areas around the ports of entry. \nWhy don't we do first things first? Why don't we bring these agreements \nto the Senate, to the House, let us debate and, to my colleague who \nsays, ``Well, every Senator wants to be President so it would be \nimpossible because we are all so,'' I assume he meant ``egotists that \nwe would write it our way,'' I say I know a few Senators who don't want \nto be President. As a matter of fact, most of them don't. Most of them \nwant to be Senators.\n  I have seen this U.S. Senate work on chemical weapons treaties, all \nkinds of treaties that were difficult, and do you know what, Madam \nPresident? We did the job. That is what we are sent here to do, not to \nthrow the ball over to the Executive and say, ``It's yours, we don't \ncare about wages, we don't care about the environment, we're just for \ntrade at any cost.'' I hope that we don't take that course.\n  If you want to look at the jobs lost through NAFTA, the Department of \nLabor certified that there were 116,418 workers who notified them in \nApril 1997 that they would lose their jobs as a result of NAFTA. There \nare estimates that go as high as 400,000 job losses. That is just job \nlosses. What about the downward pressure? What about those who leave \nmanufacturing jobs and have to go to service-sector jobs which pay \nless? That is the kind of disparity we see.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the Senator 3 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for the additional time.\n  So when we look at the issue of trade, there are some who say the \nmost important thing is the efficient flow of capital. Capital will \nflow to the low-wage countries, and that is the only thing we should be \nconcerned about.\n  But it seems to me in the United States of America, going into the \nnext century, we have to value not only the flow of capital, which I \nbelieve ultimately will flow to the most efficient place, but we have \nto value the workers, we have to value the environment and we have to \nvalue our quality of life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these documents from environmental \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     [News Release From National Wildlife Federation, Oct. 8, 1997]\n\n    Environmentalists Unified on Fast Track: Change It or Reject It\n\n       Washington, DC.--Today, the National Wildlife Federation, \n     National Audubon Society and Defenders of Wildlife called on \n     Congress to reject fast-track trade bills currently under \n     consideration until they guarantee that meaningful \n     environmental safeguards become part of future international \n     trade agreements.\n       Despite rhetoric to the contrary, neither of the fast-track \n     bills offered by the Senate Finance or House Ways and Means \n     Committees satisfies the objectives for green trade \n     negotiations recommended by the groups. One key problem with \n     these bills is that they establish new and stringent \n     restrictions on the President's ability to negotiate \n     environmental safeguards in future trade agreements. \n     ``Instead of merely including the word `environment' in the \n     fast-track proposals as a way of appeasing our concerns, we \n     urge Congress and the Administration to begin addressing \n     strong environmental standards among our trading partners,'' \n     said Barbara Bramble, Senior Director for International \n     Affairs at the National Wildlife Federation.\n       The environmental groups assert that neither bill offers a \n     comprehensive agenda for the environment in trade \n     negotiations. They both fail to insist that negotiators \n     create a level playing field to ensure that trading partners \n     compete fairly by enforcing environmental laws. They provide \n     no specific objectives for improving the transparency of the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO). And they fail to ensure that \n     environmental agencies like the Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) are active participants in trade policy \n     negotiations. ``We must find a stronger voice for the \n     environment during trade negotiations, which are now \n     dominated purely by commercial interests,'' said Dan Beard, \n     Vice-President for the National Audubon Society.\n       Also extremely troubling is the fact that none of the bills \n     explicitly exclude the so-called Multilateral Agreement on \n     Investment (MAI) from fast-track consideration. The MAI would \n     make it much easier for multinational corporations to freely \n     move capital and production facilities without responsibility \n     for environmental performance, and would create new \n     litigation hooks for corporations to sue national governments \n     over environmental standards. Already under NAFTA, the U.S.-\n     based Ethyl Corporation has filed a $251 million lawsuit \n     against Canada because the Parliament banned the import and \n     interprovincial transport of a toxic gasoline additive. ``We \n     must ensure that international trade pressures such as the \n     MAI and NAFTA do not accelerate the `race to the bottom' for \n     investments in poorer areas of the globe,'' said William \n     Snape, Legal Director for Defenders of Wildlife.\n       Strong economies and clean environments are two sides of \n     the same coin, assert the three conservation groups. ``Our \n     vital national interests are best served when trade \n     negotiators bring home agreements that simultaneously \n     strengthen our economy and protect our environment'' said \n     John Audley, Trade and Environment Program Coordinator for \n     National Wildlife Federation. ``The fast-track bills offered \n     by Congress fail this test and we must accordingly reject \n     them.''\n       The National Wildlife Federation is the nation's largest \n     conservation group, with over 4 million members and \n     supporters across the United States. The National Audubon \n     Society, with approximately 600,000 members nationwide, is \n     dedicated to protecting birds, wildlife and their habitat. \n     Defenders of Wildlife has over 200,000 members and \n     supporters, and seeks to protect all native plants and \n     animals in their natural habitats.\n\n[[Page S11750]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1997.\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re: H.R. 2621, the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Authorities Act \n         of 1997--Oppose Anti-Environmental Fast Track Trade \n         Negotiating Authority\n       Dear Representative: The League of Conservation Voters is \n     the bipartisan, political arm of the national environmental \n     movement.

The bill \n     establishes new and stringent restrictions on the President's \n     ability to negotiate environmental safeguards in future trade \n     agreements.

In particular, H.R. 2621:\n       fails to require that trade rules do not undermine \n     legitimate environmental, health, and safety standards;\n       fails to insist that our trading partners enforce strong \n     environmental laws in order to establish a high, level \n     playing field as a basis for international economic \n     competition;\n       fails to mandate increased opportunities for public \n     participation in World Trade Organization deliberations and \n     dispute resolution that might affect environmental, health, \n     and safety safeguards;\n       fails to ensure that US government agencies with \n     responsibilities for environmental protection, resource \n     conservation, and public health and safety are active \n     participants in trade negotiations which could effect policy \n     matters under their authority;\n       does not explicitly exclude the Multilateral Agreement on \n     Investment (MAI) from fast-track consideration, an agreement \n     that would allow investors to sue for compensation before \n     international tribunals if pollution laws are alleged to \n     reduce their property values;\n       fails to provide for environmental assessments of trade \n     agreements early enough in negotiations to influence the \n     outcome of those negotiations and\n       does not provide Congress sufficient leverage to ensure \n     that trade agreements serve the broad public interest.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on H.R. 2621, The Reciprocal Trade Agreement \n     Authorities Act of 1997, in computing LCV's 1997 Scorecard. \n     Thank you for consideration of this issue.

Madam President, you will find a huge number opposing \nthis fast-track legislation. The National Wildlife Federation basically \nsays that they are against it for one reason. They have no assurances \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency of America will be active \nparticipants in the trade negotiations. There are many other \norganizations which I don't have the time to name at this point.\n  We have to make a choice. We have to decide, if we value our workers \nas much as we value the free flow of capital, we have to ask ourselves, \ndo we value clean air and clean water as much as we value the free flow \nof capital?\n  We have to say, do we value our safe food supply as much as we value \nthe free flow of capital? And do we feel that it is important to have \nan adequate infrastructure in place of inspectors at the border to make \nsure the food supply is safe, to make sure that our products are being \ntreated fairly? And should we even care about a positive trade balance? \nSure, you open up the doors, but what has happened to us, as my \ncolleagues brilliantly pointed out, is the balance of trade has \nflipped, and where we used to be predominant and we sent more exports \nthan we took in imports, we see a reverse. We now have negative \nnumbers.\n  So I believe, again, in summing up, that we do have three choices: \nFree trade at any cost; see no evil; don't tell me about the problems; \nno trade at any cost; don't tell me about the good parts of trade; and \nthe middle course that my colleagues are taking, which is fair trade. \nYes, trade is crucial, it is important. We are part of one world, but \nwe in the U.S. Senate who care about values and American jobs and an \nAmerican environment, who care about clean and safe food, who want food \nsafety laws in place, also want to have an opportunity to alter or \namend trade agreements as we deem appropriate and necessary.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator's additional time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. I yield myself 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today the United States is unilaterally \ndisarmed in the intense global competition for new markets. For the \nfirst time since 1974, the President lacks fast-track authority to \nnegotiate agreements that would help open up new markets and reduce \ninternational barriers to U.S. exports.\n  This failure means slower economic growth, lost markets overseas, and \nfewer opportunities for high-paying jobs. Fast-track authority allows \nthe President to submit to Congress a clean vote on trade agreements \nnegotiated with other countries.\n  Under our Constitution, the Congress alone has the power to ``lay and \ncollect . . . Duties'' and ``To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations. \n. .''\n  The Constitution, however, uniquely empowers the President to send \nand receive ambassadors and negotiate with foreign powers. Over 20 \nyears ago, the fast-track mechanism was created to accommodate this \ndivided authority. Renewal of fast-track authority will enable our \nNation to continue pressing for world economic systems based on free \nmarkets, free trade and free people.\n  As a nation, the continued growth of our economy depends on trade. In \nthe past 50 years, trade share of the world's gross domestic product \ngrew from 7 percent to 21 percent. Today, trade makes up 24 percent of \nthe U.S. economy.\n  This decade, export growth has created 23 percent of all new U.S. \njobs, and those export-related jobs pay 13 percent more than the \nnational average.\n  Clearly, our economy will suffer without the ability to continue to \nnegotiate timely new agreements to further open foreign markets to U.S. \ngoods, commodities and services.\n  Those opposed to renewing the President's fast-track authority argue \nthat the lack of such authority does nothing to hinder the President's \nability to negotiate new trade agreements. Unfortunately, this is not \nthe case.\n  No nation will enter into a major new trade negotiation with the \nUnited States if the product of those negotiations can be picked apart \nin the U.S. Congress. With any agreement that can later be unilaterally \nchanged or amended by the Congress, we run the risk of having no \nagreement at all.\n  As long as the President lacks the ability to present such agreements \nto the Congress for our clean approval or disapproval--and bad \nagreements deserve to be defeated--our Nation will be endangering its \nability to compete in today's competitive global economy.\n  Our Nation should be working aggressively to reach new agreements \nthat will expand free trade and open up the emerging economies of Asia, \nLatin America, Eastern Europe to American exports. We should be \nbuilding on the major achievements of the last global trade talks. \nThese talks, the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade, for the first time, established rules for services and \nagriculture goods, two areas where the United States leads the world in \nglobal competitiveness.\n  Instead, the United States is losing opportunities for economic \ngrowth and job creation. It is time to do what is right for American \nworkers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses. It is time to restore fast-\ntrack negotiating authority for the President.\n  I hope that my colleagues take a good look at this and do support \nfast-track authority for the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Could the Chair inform me of the circumstances with time \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota controls the \ntime from now until 4:15; and then at 4:15, the Senator from Delaware \nwill control the last 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me then use the remainder of my time \nand begin by quoting from a letter written by Mr. Kevin Kearns, the \npresident of the United States Business and Industrial Council. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11751]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        United States Business and\n\n\n                                           Industrial Council,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: I understand that Members of Congress \n     will be lobbied intensively over the next several days by \n     Chief Executive Officers of major multinational corporations \n     belonging to The Business Roundtable as part of their \n     campaign to pass the fast track trade bill.\n       I am writing to emphasize to you and to other Members of \n     Congress that these companies do not speak for the entire \n     American business community. Far from it. In fact, they \n     represent only the tiny handful of giant multinational firms \n     that have monopolized the benefits of current trade policy, \n     and that now seek to further extend their advantages at the \n     expense of smaller American companies and their employees. \n     Over the last two decades these large multinational companies \n     have done much more to send good jobs and valuable \n     technologies overseas than to create them here at home.\n       In fact--and I find this quite ironic--many of these large \n     multinationals no longer consider themselves American \n     corporations. Their CEOs make this point openly and proudly. \n     One therefore wonders what business they have lobbying the \n     U.S. Congress at all, since they are apparently not American \n     corporate citizens but citizens of the world. Perhaps they \n     should be up in New York lobbying the United Nations rather \n     than in Washington lobbying the U.S. Congress. In fact, the \n     first question Members of Congress should ask them during \n     their lobbying visits is, ``Do you represent an American \n     company?''\n       I can assure you that the 1,500 members of the U.S. \n     Business and Industrial Council are American-owned and \n     managed companies. They typify the vast majority of American \n     businesses that have been impacted negatively by U.S. trade \n     policy. Since they are run day in and day out by their \n     owners, many are not large enough to, nor are they interested \n     in, moving the bulk of their manufacturing overseas. They are \n     interested, however, in preserving the American manufacturing \n     base and in creating additional wealth for themselves, their \n     employees, and their communities here in the United States.\n       Some have been victimized by predatory foreign trade \n     practices such as dumping and subsidization--and by the U.S. \n     Government's neglect of their problems. Still others find \n     themselves under pressure to cut wages and benefits in \n     response to the slave-labor wage rates or adversarial \n     practices of foreign competitors. Many that are engaged in \n     international trade have been pressured by foreign \n     governments to source abroad or to transfer key technologies \n     as the price of doing business in that foreign country.\n       But most important, they have been hurt--as have most of \n     our citizens--by years of poorly run trade policies that have \n     given us massive, growing trade deficits year after year. \n     These deficits, in turn, cut the U.S. economic growth rate \n     significantly--by as much as 2 percentage points in recent \n     years.\n       The Census Bureau's latest figures show dramatically just \n     how few American companies have profited from recent trade \n     agreements. At last count, only 6 percent of the nation's \n     690,000 manufacturers exported at all, and the percentages \n     are much lower for service companies. Large companies--with \n     500 or more workers--accounted for fully 71 percent of export \n     value, even though these firms comprised only 4 percent of \n     total exporters. And fully 11 percent of U.S. exports were \n     generated by just four individual companies.\n       Yet despite this domination of trade flows by the big \n     multinationals, these firms have not created a single net new \n     American job in some 25 years. Another way of looking at job \n     creation is this: all the net new employment in the U.S. \n     economy in recent years has been created by companies with \n     fewer than 100 employees--the overwhelming majority of which \n     do not export at all. Although fast track proponents tout the \n     job-creating benefits of international trade, those jobs on a \n     net basis are not being created in the United States.\n       USBIC's members and their counterparts don't have plush \n     Washington offices. They do not maintain large public \n     relations staffs. They can't hire expensive lobbyists, and \n     they're too busy running their companies to jet in and out of \n     the nation's capital themselves, like the corporate elite. \n     All these owner-operators do is try to turn a profit, support \n     their families, create jobs, and help sustain the local \n     communities they have been a part of for generations. In \n     opposing fast track, they are acting first not as business \n     interests but as citizens dismayed at the nationwide cost of \n     25 years of falling living standards and rapidly growing \n     income inequality. They are well aware that these latter two \n     facts of modern American life cannot promote a stable \n     business environment or a stable country over the longer run.\n       These businessmen understand that the nation urgently needs \n     a new trade and international economic strategy that lifts \n     incomes, strengthens families and communities, allows \n     entrepreneurs to make a profit here at home, and ensures \n     America's future prosperity. They strongly oppose fast track \n     renewal, and hope that members of Congress will distinguish \n     the special interests of the multinational corporations from \n     this overriding national interest.\n       Please feel free to have Members or their staffs contact us \n     directly for the small and mid-size business point of view on \n     fast track. We will be pleased to try to answer any questions \n     promptly and forthrightly.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kevin L. Kearns,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me quote from this letter. I will not \nread it all, but, Mr. Kearns, who heads an organization called the \nUnited States Business and Industrial Council says:\n\n       I can assure you that the 1,500 members of the U.S. \n     Business and Industrial Council are American-owned and \n     managed companies. They typify the vast majority of American \n     businesses that have been impacted negatively by U.S. trade \n     policy. Since they are run day in and day out by their \n     owners, many are not large enough to, nor are they interested \n     in, moving the bulk of their manufacturing overseas.

Many that are engaged in \n     international trade have been pressured by foreign \n     governments to source abroad or to transfer key technologies \n     as the price of doing business in that foreign country.\n\n  And then he goes on in his letter. Let me read the conclusion:\n\n       USBIC's [the Business and Industrial Council] members and \n     their counterparts don't have plush Washington offices.\n\n  He is pointing out the large number of CEOs who have flown into \nWashington to lobby on behalf of fast track. He said:\n\n       [Our businesses] don't have plush Washington offices. They \n     do not maintain large public relations staffs. They can't \n     hire expensive lobbyists, and they're too busy running their \n     companies to jet in and out of the nation's capital \n     themselves, like the corporate elite. All these owner-\n     operators do is try to turn a profit, support their families, \n     create jobs, and help sustain [their] local communities they \n     have been a part of for generations. In opposing fast track, \n     they are acting first not as business interests but as \n     citizens dismayed at the nationwide cost of 25 years of \n     falling living standards and rapidly growing income \n     inequality. They are well aware that these latter two facts \n     of modern American life cannot promote a stable business \n     environment or a stable country over the longer run.\n\n  Mr. President, this has been a rather interesting discussion. I \nlistened to much of the debate with great interest. As I mentioned, \nthere have been a number of, I think, good presentations today. I do \nsay that there are differences of opinion that are very substantial.\n  There are some who think that the current trade strategy is just \nfine, and that it works very smartly. They think it is a wonderful \nthing for our country, and we just need to do more of it. That is the \ngroup that says, ``Let us pass fast track. If we don't, somehow America \nis headed for trouble. But things are going fine. We like the way \nthings are. Our trade policy works. Let's continue it.''\n  Others of us think that swollen and bloated trade deficits, that \nreach record levels year after year, are heading this country toward \ntrouble.\n  General Custer, incidentally, lived for 2 years near Bismarck, ND, \nbefore he left for what is now Montana to meet Sitting Bull and Chief \nCrazy Horse. And because I am from North Dakota, we know a great deal \nabout the history of that campaign.\n  We know by reading the book, ``Son of Morning Star,'' for example, \nthat General Custer sent his scouts ahead to try to figure out what was \nahead of him. And the scouts really reported, ``Gee, things look pretty \ngood. Things are going pretty well here. Things look pretty good around \nthe next hill or the next bend.''\n  Of course, we now know from historical accounts things really did not \ngo very well for General Custer and the 7th Cavalry. I find today an \ninteresting group of colleagues who might well qualify for that \nscouting assignment. ``Things are going pretty good. The road up ahead \nlooks pretty bright. If we just keep doing what we're doing, our \ncountry is going to be just fine.''\n\n  I have observed, during other discussions, especially in fiscal \npolicy, people came to the floor of the Senate and said, ``Let's run \nthings like you would run a business.'' I would ask my colleagues this: \nAfter hours and hours of\n\n[[Page S11752]]\n\ndebate about trade, is there anyone here who would stand up and tell \nme, if you ran a business the way this country runs its trade policy \nthat you would be doing fine? Wouldn't everybody in this Chamber \nunderstand and agree that if you ran a business the way this country is \nrunning its trade policy, you would be broke?\n  How many CEO's would go to their boardrooms and say, ``Listen, I \nwould like to have a talk with you. I want to talk about our receipts. \nI want to talk about all the sales we have and all the money that is \ncoming in.'' And the board says, ``Well, that's fine, Mr. CEO or Mrs. \nCEO, but could you tell us a little about your expenditures?''\n  The CEO knows the expenditures far exceed the receipts, but the CEO \nsays, ``No, no, we're not going to talk about expenditures. Are you \ncrazy? We're going to talk about receipts. We're going to talk about \nhow well I'm doing.''\n  That is the message we have been hearing out here on the floor of the \nSenate for hours. ``Gee, look how well we're doing. Look at these \nexports. Look at these exports, sales.'' They are ignoring, of course, \nthe massive quantity of imports coming in, displacing American \nmanufacturing capacity in this country, and putting us in a swollen and \nmushrooming trade deficit situation, that if judged as a business would \nrender us unable to continue. And yet we have people say, ``Gee, this \nis going just fine. This is just the right road for us.''\n  It is not the right road for us. The right road isn't protectionism. \nThe right road isn't to put walls around our country. The right road \nisn't to retreat from the global economy.\n  But the right road is to insist in this country that we have some \ncourage to stand up and tell, yes, the Japanese and the Chinese and the \nMexicans and the Canadians, and so many others, that we expect and \ndemand more of you. We expect fair trade.\n  Is there someone in this Chamber who wants to stand up and tell us \nthey are opposed to fair trade? Does that person exist? Is there \nsomeone willing to do that? Who here is opposed to fair trade? Maybe I \nneed to ask it when more Members are present in the Chamber. But is \nthere someone who will say, ``No. Me, I'm opposed to fair trade.'' I \ndon't think so. I don't think there is one person in this Chamber who \nwill volunteer to say, on behalf of their constituents, they oppose \nfair trade.\n  Why then do they insist that those of us who believe that we ought to \nexpect fair trade in our trade relationships, why do they insist that \nsomehow we don't act in the best interests of this country and in the \nbest interests of this country's future economy? I do not understand \nthat.\n  With respect to whether it would be Japan or China, or many other \ntrading partners, who are worthy partners and good trading partners of \nours, it would seem to me to be in this country's best interests to say \nto those countries, which expect a balance in trade that is a fair \nbalance, ``You cannot run $50 billion, $60 billion a year, every year, \nin trade deficits with us.''\n  Now, they will continue to do it as long as we allow them. You can \nonly expect that someplace in these other countries those folks are \nsitting around saying, ``We don't understand why they let us keep doing \nthis, but it's a wonderful thing. It strengthens us and weakens them.'' \nThey would say that I presume. Because when they have big surpluses \nwith us, we become a cash cow for their hard currency needs and it \nweakens our country.\n  They must surely be puzzled why no one in this country has the nerve \nand the will to say, ``Stop it. We won't allow that. We won't allow \nthese huge trade imbalances. We expect and demand, not only reciprocal \ntrading opportunities with you, open markets from you, but we demand \nsome reasonable balance of trade.''\n\n  Now, we were told just a few minutes ago that the reason we had a \ntrade deficit is because we had a budget deficit. Simple, except that \ndoes not work. Our budget deficit is going way down, and our trade \ndeficit is going way up. I know that is what they used to teach in \neconomics. I used to teach economics. As I said this morning, I \novercame that experience.\n  But as the budget deficit has been going way down; the trade deficit \nis going way up. So how does it work then with those who have been \nclaiming now for years that we simply have a trade deficit as a matter \nof calculation because we have had a fiscal policy deficit?\n  Stephen Goldfeld once said that, ``An economist is someone who sees \nsomething working in practice and then asks whether it can work in \ntheory.''\n  Can we fail to observe here that the budget deficits are going down, \nway down. They are down 5 years in a row, but the trade deficit is \ngoing up? Can we fail to notice that or fail to explain it? Or do we \nsimply cling to the same tired economic doctrine about trade that has \nbeen proven wrong?\n  When I was a young boy, I had a neighbor who was a retired person. \nHis name was Herman. And Herman used to order everything through the \nmail that he could get that promised him one thing or another. Now \nHerman had rheumatism. And I went over to Herman's one day, and he was \nsitting there with a box that was plugged into the wall with a cord. It \nwas a wooden box with some wires leading to two metal handles. And he \nexplained that he had purchased this from a catalog because it was \nsupposed to cure his rheumatism. He was sitting in his chair there \nholding on to these handles. He held on to them for 6 or 8 months, I \nguess. It did nothing to help him with his rheumatism, but that was a \nbox he bought because that he thought it would deal with his \nrheumatism.\n  We have a lot of folks around here sitting with those metal handles \nbecause someone claimed that this trade strategy we have works. All the \nevidence suggests it does not.\n  One of these days, one way or another, we ought to take a look at the \nevidence and decide when something doesn't work you ought to change it.\n  The first law of holes is that when you are in a hole, you might want \nto stop the digging. When you see trade deficit after trade deficit, \nyear after year, that reaches record levels--and this year the \nmerchandise trade deficit will be very close to $200 billion--it is \nfair for us to ask on the floor of the Senate, does this trade policy \nwork? Is this trade policy in the best interests of this country? Or \ncan we, with more nerve, will, and courage, stand up for the economic \ninterests of this country and demand and expect more of our trading \npartners, more in the manner of policies that will benefit and \nstrengthen this country?\n  Mr. President, I have consumed my time. The Senator from Delaware and \nthe Senator from New York have both been courteous during this \ndiscussion. And we have had the opportunity to have a lengthy and, I \nthink, good debate. And more will follow. We will have a vote on the \nmotion to proceed, at which point, if that prevails, we will be on the \nbill itself. And those of us who care a great deal about this will be, \nat that point, allowed to continue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, at the outset of this debate I set out my \nreasons for supporting fast-track authority. Having heard the debate \nand the point made by my esteemed colleagues, I want to distill what, I \nbelieve today, our vote is about.\n  First, I submit that the question before this body is whether we will \nshape our own economic future or leave our fate in the hands of others. \nWe must decide whether we will allow the President to take a seat at \nthe negotiating table or force him to stand outside the room while \nothers write the rules for the international economy.\n  A vote for fast track is a vote for a brighter American future. \nToward that end, this bill arms the President with the authority to \nopen foreign markets and allow our firms to do what they do better than \nanywhere else on Earth: That is, compete.\n  Second, the making of trade policy must be a full partnership between \nCongress and the President. The bill before this House ensures that \nCongress is, in fact, a full partner in the process. Indeed, it is \ndifficult to concede of any other measure where we subject the \nPresident's action to such scrutiny and constraints. The bill requires \nthe President to notify us in advance of his intent to make use of this \nauthority. He must then consult prior to and throughout the \nnegotiations up to and including comprehensive consultations \nimmediately before initialing an agreement. If the agreement is\n\n[[Page S11753]]\n\nsigned, we then proceed to develop the implementing legislation in \nconsultation with the President.\n  After all that, Congress still exercises a veto over the President's \naction by voting on the agreement and implementing bill. Those \nconditions are necessary to ensure the President fulfills the \nobjectives set by Congress. They are also needed to ensure that \nCongress and the President do, in fact, speak with one voice on trade \nmatters.\n  I firmly believe that bill strengthens the role of Congress and the \ntrade agreements process to an unprecedented extent and lets our \ntrading partners know that the President is answerable to Congress for \nany agreement he may reach.\n  Third, laying the foundation for our economic future will require a \npartnership here in Congress, as well. We will not make progress toward \nour common goal of providing for America's economic future without \nstrong bipartisan support for our trade policy.\n  I was extremely heartened by the vote yesterday and expect to see the \nsame bipartisan support for the motion under consideration and for the \nbill itself. At the same time, the debate identified important issues \nthat must be fully examined in order to sustain that bipartisan future.\n  As chairman of the Finance Committee, I intend to ensure that the \ncommittee addresses those issues of critical importance to the well-\nbeing of every American. I look forward to working with my colleagues \ntoward this end. Nonetheless, I believe we must take the first step now \nto exert the leadership on trade that only the United States can \nprovide. The President must have fast-track negotiating authority. I \nurge my colleagues strongly to support the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply to affirm in the strongest \nterms that the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has been \nfaithful to his duties. He has kept a committee united, minus one vote, \nin an otherwise unanimous decision. He has been meticulous in his \nconcern that American workers will have their interests pursued here, \nthe environment will be looked after, but ladening these matters on \ntrade negotiations will only ensure they will fail and not bring the \nbenefits we desire.\n  I want to congratulate him. We cannot do any better than we did \nyesterday, but let's hope we do as well.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a longstanding tradition in the \nSenate to recognize and honor those Senators who serve as Presiding \nOfficers of the Senate for 100 hours in a single session of Congress. \nToday, we add to the list of Golden Gavel recipients Senator Allard of \nColorado, whose presiding hours total 100 hours today.\n  November 5 is a very significant date for Senator Allard and his \nfamily, as on November 5, 1996, 1 year ago today, Senator Allard was \nelected to the U.S. Senate. Therefore, it is an appropriate date to \nrecognize his contributions as a Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  With respect to presiding, Senator Allard has been extremely generous \nwith his time and has often rearranged his schedule at a moment's \nnotice--and, I might add, with the assistance of his very courteous \nstaff--to assist in presiding when difficulties arise. As a Presiding \nOfficer, his dedication and dependability are to be commended. It is a \ngreat pleasure to announce Senator Wayne Allard of Colorado as \nrecipient of the Senate's Golden Gavel Award.\n  My compliments to my friend, my colleague, and the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11753-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11753-S11754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nwill now have a period of morning business until the hour of 6 p.m. \nwith Senators to be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma \ncould inform us of the unanimous-consent request that affects business \non the floor of the Senate tomorrow. My understanding is the pending \nunanimous consent request deals with the DOD authorization bill. The \nreason I ask the question is I am interested in learning when we will \ncome back to the regular order, which will be the fast-track \nconsideration of the fast-track proposal.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to my colleague, the Senate has already \nagreed to a unanimous-consent request that would call for the DOD \nauthorization bill to be voted on tomorrow at some time, at 2 p.m. I \nthink the order calls for 4 hours of debate. We will go on it at 10, \nand vote at 2.\n  That is on the DOD conference report.\n  Beyond that, I am not prepared to tell my colleague what--I know the \nHouse is planning on voting on the fast-track authorization on Friday. \nThere is some discussion that since that is a House bill and we are \nworking on the Senate bill, we might entertain taking up the House bill \nwhen it passes so we wouldn't be working on two different bills.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, my understanding is \nthe\n\n[[Page S11754]]\n\nmotion to proceed prevailed by the most recent vote, and the result is \nnow the regular order of the Senate would be the fast-track \nlegislation. The Senator asked unanimous consent to go to morning \nbusiness. I didn't object to that. We also have a unanimous consent for \ntomorrow's proceedings dealing with DOD authorization. At that point, \ndoes the Senator expect to go back to the legislation pending, or can \nthe Senator inform us whether he will be propounding additional \nunanimous-consent requests with respect to Senate business?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To respond to my friend and colleague, I think the next \norder, after we pass the DOD authorization bill, would be to take up \nthe District of Columbia appropriations conference report, or \nappropriations bill. In addition to that, we may well be taking up \nAmtrak reform legislation, which has also been working its way through, \nnot exactly on a fast track, but it has been working its way through, \nand hopefully we can get it done as well.\n  Mr. DORGAN. When does the Senator expect us to get back to the fast-\ntrack legislation?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That remains to be seen. That is really Senator Lott's \ncall. It may well be Thursday. It may well be Friday. It may well be \nafter the House would take it up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Further inquiry. I will appreciate the Senator's \nresponse.\n  As I understand it, conference reports are privileged matters.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. They can be brought to the floor of the Senate at any \ntime. Amtrak and other intervening legislation will require unanimous \nconsent, is that correct?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would have to ask the Presiding Officer on Amtrak. My \ncolleague is correct on the conference reports on appropriations bills. \nYes, they could.\n  We have four appropriations bills that we are trying to get through. \nIt happens to be that we are at a deadline by November 7, so our \nhighest priority is try to complete the various authorization bills.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might just inquire further, the reason I ask the \nquestion is that because we are on the legislation dealing with fast \ntrack, there are a number of Senators who will be wanting to offer \namendments. It will not be a pleasant experience to learn that we move \nto other things and then come back to fast track with some \nunderstanding there is no time for amendments. I am just inquiring to \ntry to determine what the expectation of the leadership is with respect \nto the fast-track legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, would the acting leader yield for a minute?\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, let me respond to my colleague, Senator Dorgan. I \nhear what the Senator is saying. I know that the Senator has some \namendments he wishes to offer on fast track. I know that we wish to \npass fast track. We also wish to pass Amtrak reform and we also wish to \npass all the appropriations bills, and we only have a couple of days. \nSo we are going to try to accommodate everybody's requests. But the \nhighest priority I believe will be to pass the appropriations \nconference reports as soon as possible. I believe the D.C. bill will be \nthe first one up. That is not a conference report. It is a bill. But I \nthink we have an agreement on D.C., so we will get that one \naccomplished. Hopefully then we will have three other conference \nreports we will be able to do in the next day or two, and we will have, \nI am sure, some additional time for my colleague to spend on fast track \nas well.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I might share with my friend from North \nDakota information with respect to at least Amtrak. We have an \nagreement now reached with respect to Amtrak. The language is now in \nprint, and I believe it is being hotlined on both sides.\n  So with respect to the Amtrak effort in terms of any interruption, we \nwould anticipate that going through here in a minimal amount of time. I \nam not sure how much the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, \nwants, but I would not imagine it will take more than half an hour or \nso. And so I do not think that will interrupt the course of business \nwith respect to fast track in any significant way.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, an agreement on Amtrak would \nbe welcome news I think to all Members of the Senate, and it would not \nbe my intention to try to obstruct that. I am simply trying to \ndetermine when we might get back to fast track so that we might \nentertain amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11753-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11754-S11756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF BILL LANN LEE TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR CIVIL \n                                 RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights. I have reached this conclusion only after much thought \nand careful consideration. But I am certain that this is the right \ncourse. I commend Senator Hatch for his leadership and the excellent \nstatement he delivered on the floor yesterday in this regard.\n  When the possibility that Mr. Lee would be nominated for this \nposition was first brought to my attention, I was impressed by what I \nheard. Mr. Lee was born to a hard-working, determined family of Chinese \nimmigrants. His success at Yale and Columbia University Law School \nreflects that he inherited a commitment to succeed. I was also assured \nthen, and continue to believe, that he is a man of character, honesty, \nand intellect. I relayed that impression to the White House.\n  After Mr. Lee was nominated, I met with him and made clear that I had \nan open mind regarding his nomination. I told him that his positions on \nthe issues would be critical, and that the committee was eager to hear \nhis answers to questions.\n  Before the hearing, some expressed alarm at many of the cases and \npositions that Mr. Lee had taken during his leadership in activist \ncivil rights organizations. They were concerned about whether he would \nuse his job and army of attorneys in the Justice Department to advance \nthe same agenda he had pursued for the Legal Defense Fund. I understood \nthis. But, at the same time, I have known since my days as a small town \nlawyer that a good attorney is a strong advocate for his client, \nregardless of whether he agrees with everything the client wants.\n  Mr. Lee had an obligation to convince us at the hearing that he could \ntransfer from the role of creative advocate for activist civil rights \norganizations to neutral and objective enforcer of the Nation's civil \nrights laws. This he failed to do. He would not give any cases or \npositions that he had brought on behalf of the Legal Defense Fund that \nhe would not bring as head of the Civil Rights Division. He would not \ncite any difference between himself and the last civil rights chief, \nDeval Patrick, who was an unwavering proponent of the civil rights \nagenda of the left. Unfortunately, it became clear during the hearing \nthat Mr. Lee's advocacy is guided by a dedicated personal commitment to \nthe positions he has advanced over the years.\n  Mr. Lee started by proclaiming that proposition 209 is \nunconstitutional. In proposition 209, the people of California voted to \nend all government preferences and set-asides on the basis of race, \nsex, or national origin. Then, with the active support of Mr. Lee and \nhis organization, a Federal judge blocked the will of the people, \nsaying the referendum was unconstitutional. The claim was that \nproposition 209 violated the 14th amendment, when in reality it \nmirrored the 14th amendment. Far from violating the Constitution, \nproposition 209 essentially states what the Constitution requires. The \nNinth Circuit recognized this simple fact on appeal. Regardless, Mr. \nLee is steadfast in his view that it was unconstitutional for the \npeople of California to bring preferences to an end.\n  Another disturbing but related issue involves judicial taxation. I \nfirmly believe that Federal judges do not have the Constitutional power \nto raises taxes or order legislative authorities to raise taxes. It is \na simple issue of separation of powers. Taxes are a matter for the \nlegislative branch, the branch that is responsive to the people. The \norganization for which Mr. Lee works was instrumental in the decision \nof a Federal judge in Missouri to order that taxes be raised. Mr. Lee \nwould not disavow this approach. Although he stated that if confirmed \nhe would not ask\n\n[[Page S11755]]\n\na Federal judge to order a legislative authority to raise taxes in the \nschool desegregation context, he refused to rule out such a request in \nother civil rights contexts. He fails to recognize that fundamental \nprinciples of separation of powers prohibit judicial taxation.\n  Mr. Lee's views on proposition 209 and judicial taxation represent \nsupport for a dangerous tactic of legal activists. They use the \nunelected, unaccountable Federal judiciary to accomplish what they \ncannot achieve through the democratic process. When they lost at the \nballot box on proposition 209, they got a lone Federal judge to block \nthe will of the people. When they wanted to implement their lavish \ndesegregation experiment in Missouri, they got a lone Federal judge to \nraise taxes. They have pursued their solutions in utter disregard of \nthe people.\n  Today, Mr. Lee and his allies are failing to find support even in the \ncourts. The Federal judiciary, led by the Supreme Court, is fashioning \na civil rights jurisprudence based on the merit of the individual \nrather than preferential treatment for groups. Mr. Lee has fought \nagainst and continues to be uneasy with this constructive, solidifying \nlaw. It is clear that he would use his position and arsenal of \nattorneys to dilute or circumvent this progress toward ending \npreferential treatment.\n  An excellent example of the failed approach of the past is forced \nbusing of school children. At the hearing, Mr. Lee continued to express \nsupport for the use of forced busing in some circumstances, even in the \n1990's. He would not back away from his unbelievable assertion in a \nSupreme Court brief that ``the term `forced busing' is a misnomer.''\n  Mr. President, many of us in the Senate are concerned about judicial \nactivism on the bench, and we have every reason to be. We must keep in \nmind that a judicial activist decision starts with a proposal by a \nlegal activist. We cannot and should not stop private organizations \nfrom advocating legal activism if they wish. However, we have a duty to \nreject legal activism as the guiding principle for our Nation's top \ncivil rights law enforcement officer.\n  I must strongly oppose this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ndissatisfaction with the misguided views of President Clinton's nominee \nfor Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n  As many of my colleagues have made clear, Mr. Lee is a fine man, with \naccomplished legal credentials. His story of hard work and success is \ntruly inspiring. But, Mr. President, the position of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights should not be filled based on an inspiring \nstory, but rather, on a nominee's commitment to the bedrock principle \nthat every American should be seen as equal in the eyes of the law.\n  The nomination of Bill Lann Lee is in serious peril, and for good \nreason. Mr. Lee has a long, well-documented, and disturbing allegiance \nto the policy of government-mandated racial preferences. In spite of \nthe Constitution and recent court decisions, Mr. Lee continues to \nassert that government jobs and contracts should be handed out based on \nthe immutable traits of race and gender.\n  Mr. Lee's views, however, go one giant leap beyond simply allowing \nracial preferences. Mr. lee has argued that the Constitution, in fact, \nrequires racial preferences. Let me restate that. Bill Lann Lee has \nfiled papers in Federal court asserting that the very Constitution \nwhich prohibits discrimination based on race and gender, in fact, \nrequires the government to engage in discrimination based on race and \ngender.\n  As absurd as this theory sounds that is what Bill Lann Lee argued in \ncourt briefs this year as he fought the will of the California voters \nin proposition 209. Thankfully, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nunanimously rejected the Lee theory. In simple, straightforward \nlanguage, the court explained, ``the 14th Amendment, lest we lose sight \nof the forest for the trees, does not require what it barely permits.''\n  And, as expected, the Supreme Court this week refused to validate the \nLee theory and allowed the ninth circuit ruling to stand.\n\n\n            the constitution does not require discrimination\n\n  Throughout Mr. Lee's lifetime of advocacy, he has consistently \noverlooked one profound point, that is: Every time the government hands \nout a job or a contract to one person based on race or gender, it \ndiscriminates against another person based on race or gender.\n  Mr. Michael Cornelius recently spoke poignantly to this point before \nthe Constitution Subcommittee in the House of Representatives. He \nexplained that his firm was denied a Government contract under ISTEA, \neven though his bid was $3 million lower than the nearest competitor. \nMr. Cornelius' bid was rejected because the Government felt that the \nbid did not use enough minority or women-owned subcontractors.\n  If you think that's bad, think about this: The Cornelius bid proposed \nto subcontract 26.5 percent of the work to firms owned by minorities \nand women. Yet, 26.5 percent was not enough in the world of so-called \ngoals and timetables that Mr. Lee thinks the Constitution requires. Mr. \nLee's goals and timetables are more appropriately called quotas and \nset-asides.\n  You see, the Government took the contract away from Mr. Cornelius and \nawarded it to a bidder that proposed to contract 29 percent of the work \nto minority firms, and who charged the Government $3 million more than \nMr. Cornelius.\n  And, unfortunately, it doesn't end there. When the Government denied \nthe job to Mr. Cornelius, it also denied the job to all of Mr. \nCornelius' employees--over 80 percent of whom are minorities.\n  So the Government, in its infinite wisdom, not only committed \ndiscrimination, but it paid $3 million in the process.\n  I have filed an amendment to ISTEA that would remove this pernicious \npractice of awarding jobs and contracts based on skin color. Racial \npreferences are discriminatory, unfair, and unconstitutional. This \nprinciple is being reaffirmed courtroom by courtroom, State by State \nall across this country.\n  But what does Mr. Lee think? Does he think the Constitution bars \nthese kind of racial preferences? Absolutely not. So, I think it's fair \nto say that Mr. Lee's message to Mr. Cornelius is: ``Sorry about the \ndiscrimination against you, your family, and your employees. But, the \nConstitution requires it.''\n\n\n             joining the clinton corps of social engineers\n\n  The Clinton administration is all too eager to add Mr. Lee to its \narmy corps of social engineers. Civil rights lawyers like Norma Cantu \nand Judith Winston undoubtedly relish the opportunity to add a lawyer \nwith the misguided views of Bill Lann Lee to their brigade.\n  Cantu and Winston, have helped lead the administration's battle \nagainst the courts and the Constitution. These lawyers, like Lee, have \nbecome skilled at establishing racial preferences behind the scenes \nthrough the jungle of Federal regulations and by way of the quiet \ncamouflage of consent decrees.\n  Cantu and Winston, recently launched a politically motivated \ninvestigation of the University of California graduate schools. As you \nmay remember, Mr. President, in 1995, the regents of the University of \nCalifornia voted to end heavy-handed racial preference policies in \nstudent admissions, opting instead to base admissions solely on merit. \nThese policies had for years resulted in a two-tiered admissions \nsystem, by which students of preferred racial and ethnic backgrounds \nwere admitted with inferior qualifications than those of other racial \nand ethnic backgrounds.\n  The regents recognized that this system embodied unconscionable \ndiscrimination which hurt not only those better-qualified applicants \nthat were denied admission, including many Asian-American applicants \nwho suffered severely under the preference policy, but it also hurt \nminority students who faced stigmatization as racial preference \nadmittees.\n  Now, as a result of the regents' decision, the University of \nCalifornia will no longer punish or reward applicants based on their \nrace, but will rely on widely accepted, long-standing admissions \ncriteria that focus on individual achievements, such as grades, test \nscores, and life accomplishments.\n\n[[Page S11756]]\n\n  Most Americans would applaud the regents for their prudent decision. \nBut not Cantu and Winston. They are using their civil rights positions \nat the Department of Education to launch a Federal taxpayer-funded \ninvestigation to determine whether schools are discriminating by \nrefusing to discriminate.\n  The Los Angeles Times reported that Winston has asserted that:\n\n       The University of California may have violated federal \n     civil rights law by dropping its affirmative action rules and \n     relying on test scores and grades as a basis for selecting \n     new students.\n\n  This baseless investigation turns the principle of nondiscrimination \non its head by threatening schools that use race-blind admissions \npolicies and objective measures of merit. This investigation has \nprovoked criticism even from those who typically defend race \npreferences. For example, University of Texas Law School professor \nSamuel Issacharoff, recently stated that ``[Ms. Winston] is voicing a \ntheory that does not have support in the courts.'' Professor \nIssacharoff went on to explain that he was ``not aware of any legal \nsupport for the idea that would say the Harvard Law School, for \nexample, cannot accept only the cream of the crop if doing so would \nhave an impact on a minority group.''\n  And in an editorial, the Sacramento Bee, a newspaper I might add that \nsupports race preferences, referred to the administration's legal \ntheory as ``an Orwellian misreading of the law.'' ``Equally \nimportant,'' the Bee concluded, ``the investigation is an abuse of \nfederal power, designed to punish California and its citizens for [its] \ndecision on affirmative action. * * *''\n  So where did this investigation originate? Who could muster the \ncontorted legal arguments to justify these threats and these \nexpenditures of taxpayer dollars?\n  Were these complaints filed by a student who alleged discrimination? \nA student organization? A family in California? No. I'll tell you who \nfiled the complaint that launched this Federal investigation: Bill Lann \nLee, as head of the Western Office of the NAACP Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund.\n  And, it does not end there. The Labor Department has also joined the \npile-on to punish California for its decision to push for a colorblind \nsociety. DOL is investigating the charge that U.C. graduate schools are \ncommitting employment discrimination against the minorities who are not \naccepted into U.C. graduate schools, and thus, not able to apply for \ncampus jobs.\n  And where did this complaint originate? Again, it wasn't a student. \nIt was Bill Lann Lee and his legal defense fund filing another \ncomplaint launching yet another federally funded investigation of race-\nneutral policies based on yet another legal theory that is outside the \nboundaries of both the Commission and the courts.\n  And, what is the administration's threatened sanction against the \nUniversity of California for its race-neutral approach? The termination \nof hundreds of thousands of dollars in Federal funds.\n  And what does this pattern and practice tell us that Mr. Lee will do \nwith an army of lawyers at the Justice Department? He will bring down \nthe power of the Federal Government upon State and local governments \nthat refuse to mandate racial preferences. This, Mr. President, is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  Mr. Lee's views are neither moderate nor mainstream. And, his views \nare not isolated incidents. They are not glib, off-handed statements \nmade during his youth. They are not dusty law review articles written \nby a starry-eyed graduate student. And, they are not creative theories \nespoused in the ivory tower of academia.\n  Mr. Lee's well-documented views are the voice of a man who exhibits \nan alarming allegiance to racial preferences and a disturbing disregard \nfor the Constitution. This voice--this man--should not be entrusted \nwith the noble task of upholding the equal protection clause of the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  Several days ago, I placed a hold on Mr. Lee's nomination, and today, \nI respectfully announce my formal opposition to his nomination. We must \nend the divisive practice of awarding Government jobs and contracts and \nopportunities based on the immutable trait of skin color and ethnicity. \nRespect for our Constitution, our courts, and--most importantly--our \nindividual citizens, demands no less.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, the position of Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights is important to our Nation. The most important \nreason is what it signals about the direction the President plans to \ntake on key civil rights issues of the day.\n  In my opinion, this Nation is moving in the right direction on civil \nrights. We have gone through a turbulent period where legal segregation \nhas now been ended, and we are now ending a period during which the \ncourts have used racial preferences and remedies to cure certain \naspects of past discrimination.\n  While this procedure can be defended perhaps in the short run, \nparticularly when it is directly attached to a specific prior \ndiscriminatory act, such a policy cannot be a part of a permanent legal \nand political system.\n  Our Supreme Court, which has led the drive to eliminate legal \ndiscrimination on a variety of fronts, is wisely taking a long-term \nview of the impact of racial preferences in America. After thoughtfully \nconsidering our future, the Supreme Court, in the Adarand case and in \nrejecting just this week the idea that California's civil rights \ninitiative is unconstitutional and in other cases has clearly stated \nthat this Nation must not establish a governmental system which \nattempts to allocate goods, services and wealth of this Nation on the \nbasis of one's race, on the basis of the color of their skin. The \nresult will be contrary to the equal protection clause of the great \n14th amendment to our Constitution, and contrary to our goal of a \nunified America in which people are judged on the contents of their \ncharacter and not on the color of their skin.\n  Mr. President, with regard to the nomination of Bill Lann Lee of \nCalifornia to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, I want to \nsay with confidence that he is a skilled and able attorney, an honest \nman, a man who appears to have integrity and the kind of \ncharacteristics that make for a good attorney.\n  His entire career has been spent in skilled advocacy in the civil \nrights arena. He is a Columbia Law School graduate who could have \npracticed on Wall Street but chose public interest law instead, and he \nshould be commended for that. Sadly, however, I must join the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, and the former \nchairman of that committee, Senator Thurmond, who is here tonight and \njust made an excellent series of comments on this issue, to announce my \nopposition to Mr. Lee. Simply put, Bill Lee, like President Clinton, is \noutside the mainstream of American civil rights law, the very laws he \nwould be charged with enforcing.\n  While the American people and the Federal judiciary have steadily \nmoved toward a color-blind ideal, Bill Lee has clung to a policy of \nracial preferences and spoils. Bill Lann Lee strongly advocates racial \nand gender preferences which are, in effect, virtually quotas in \nvirtually every area of our society, including college admissions, \ncongressional voting districts and employment.\n  I believe a nation that draws voting districts on the basis of race, \nthat uses race as a factor in college admissions and hiring and \npromotion decisions is, in fact, destined to have unnecessary racial \nstrife and hostility and it does not bind us together as a nation.\n  In my opinion, it would be unwise for the Senate to confirm Mr. Lee \nas Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. The Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights is one of the most\n\n[[Page S11757]]\n\nimportant law enforcement positions in the Federal Government. If \nconfirmed, Mr. Lee would have a powerful arsenal of more than 250 \nlawyers at his disposal.\n  After our hearings that I participated in and participated in his \nquestioning, and after review of his record, I have concluded that Mr. \nLee will continue to push for lawsuits, consent decrees and other legal \nactions that are outside the mainstream of current American legal \nthought. He sets the civil rights policy for the United States, and \nsince his views are not in accord with the people, the Congress and the \ncourts, he should not be confirmed in that position.\n  Let me give you several examples. Last fall, the people of \nCalifornia, after full debate, passed proposition 209, California's \ncivil rights initiative, which simply prohibits the State from \ndiscriminating against or granting preferences to anyone on the basis \nof race or gender.\n  The very day after--he opposed that referendum--he lost that issue at \nthe ballot box, Mr. Lee and his organization, the legal defense fund, \nfiled suit arguing that proposition 209 was unconstitutional. This is a \ncurious, even bizarre argument, because proposition 209 mirrors the \nlanguage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, one of the great civil rights \nacts that changed race relations in America. It also mirrors the 14th \namendment.\n  Even the ninth circuit, the most liberal circuit in America, \nunanimously rejected Mr. Lee's position. Moreover, on request for a \nrehearing, the full ninth circuit voted to deny a rehearing en banc. \nBut even the most liberal circuit--it is considered the most liberal \ncircuit in the country--rejected Mr. Lee's argument that proposition \n209, passed by the people of California to eliminate racial \npreferences, was unconstitutional. This is what the court said:\n\n       As a matter of conventional equal protection analysis --\n\n  That is the 14th amendment, the equal protection clause they are \nreferring to----\n\n       As a matter of conventional equal protection analysis, \n     there is simply no doubt that Proposition 209 is \n     constitutional . . . After all, the goal of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment to which this Nation continues to aspire, is a \n     political system in which race no longer matters. The \n     Fourteenth Amendment, lest we lose sight of the forest for \n     the trees, does not require what it barely permits.\n\n  That means that the 14th amendment certainly does not require quotas \nand preferences and it certainly, if anything, will only permit them if \nthey meet the strict test of scrutiny.\n  A lawsuit against proposition 209 is another example of those who, \nwhen they lose their issue at the ballot box, have taken to the habit \nof going to Federal courts to ask the courts to overrule the will of \nthe people through the elected representatives or through the \ninitiative process.\n  At his confirmation hearing, Lee again stated his odd argument that \nproposition 209 is unconstitutional. As Senator Hatch said, this is not \nan itty-bitty issue whether or not proposition 209 is constitutional.\n  This initiative was a good initiative, carefully drawn, fully \nconsidered by the people of California. And Mr. Lee continues to assert \nto this day that it is violative of the Constitution of the United \nStates. This is not fair to California, and we should not subject this \nNation to those kinds of views.\n  Not surprising, just this week the Supreme Court of the United States \nrejected his position on proposition 209 when it denied certiorari. It \nrefused to review the ruling of the California court, the ninth circuit \ncourt, and held the ninth circuit opinion intact.\n  It is important to note, I think, for the Members of this body, that \nthis is the position of President Clinton. He adheres to the same view \nabout proposition 209 being unconstitutional. And his Justice \nDepartment joined the ACLU and Bill Lee's legal defense fund and filed \nan appeal arguing that 209 was unconstitutional. In effect, the \nPresident of the United States is asking the unelected judiciary to \noverrule the well-debated and well-considered initiative of the people \nof California.\n  So I think it is important for this body, as we consider this \nnomination, to consider what kind of message we are sending when we \neither confirm or reject Mr. Lee.\n  I think we need to send a message that this body stands with the \npeople and the courts and not this strained view of proposition 209.\n  There are a couple of other examples that I think point out the \nposition of Mr. Lee on racial preferences that indicate that he would \nnot be a fit nominee for this position.\n  In recent years, the Supreme Court, in the Croson decision and the \nAdarand decision clearly held that racial preferences are \nunconstitutional. The Supreme Court now subjects all Government racial \npreferences to what is called strict judicial scrutiny. As you know, it \nis very difficult, Mr. President, for a government program to withstand \nstrict scrutiny.\n  At his confirmation hearing however, Mr. Lee badly mischaracterized \nthe spirit of these cases. He stated that the Croson and Adarand \ndecisions stand for the proposition that ``affirmative action programs \nare appropriate if they are conducted in a limited and measured way.''\n  This is not the position that the Supreme Court stated in Adarand. It \ngreatly undermines that important decision. And it would be unwise for \nthis body to confirm a nominee who would not faithfully follow the \nAdarand decision.\n  As Senator Hatch, who chaired the committee, said so eloquently \nyesterday on the Senate floor, Bill Lee's description of Adarand \npurposely misses the mark of the Court's fundamental holding that such \nprograms are presumptively unconstitutional.\n  Moreover, Bill Lann Lee testified in his confirmation hearings that \nhe was opposed personally to the holding in Adarand. I asked him what \nhis personal view was. He said he personally opposed that ruling. \nSenator John Ashcroft asked Mr. Lee whether the set-aside program at \nissue in Adarand is unconstitutional, where a set-aside was given to a \ncontractor simply because of their race or sex.\n  In response, Mr. Lee noted that the Supreme Court in Adarand had \nremanded the case to the district court, which promptly, by the way, \nruled the program unconstitutional. And in so doing, the district court \nstated:\n\n       I find it difficult to envisage a race-based classification \n     that is narrowly tailored.\n\n  But despite the district court's strong holding, Lee, like the \nClinton Department of Justice, continues to state and continues to \nbelieve that ``this program is sufficiently narrowly tailored to \nsatisfy the strict scrutiny test.''\n  Mr. Lee simply refuses to accept the fact that strict scrutiny is an \nexceedingly difficult and high standard for a government agent to meet \nbefore it can establish racial preferences, that is, before it can give \npreferences to somebody for no other reason than their race.\n  Under Mr. Lee's interpretation, all of the approximately 160 Federal \nracial preference programs that now exist would continue to be \nconstitutional, although most scholars would say that under the Adarand \ndecision, many of them, if not most of them, would fail to meet \nconstitutional muster.\n  So, Mr. Lee's interpretation of Croson and Adarand would make these \nseminal decisions virtually irrelevant. Almost any program could \nsurvive his definition of the strict scrutiny standard.\n  Mr. President, America needs an Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights who will honestly, soberly, and accurately read and apply the \nlaw--even when he disagrees with it.\n  Unfortunately, as his confirmation hearing and followup answers \nindicate, he has been unable to shed his role as an activist, a \npartisan civil rights litigator. If confirmed, Lee would support the \nconstitutionality of racial preferences and use his team of some 250 \nlawyers to further an agenda that is not in keeping with the current \nstate of American law.\n  Let me talk about another example that is important for us to \nconsider.\n  Forced busing. Mr. Lee sued extensively over the years on issues \ninvolving busing. And once, for example, in Brown versus Califano, in \n1980, a Supreme Court case, Lee challenged the constitutionality of a \ncongressionally passed statute, passed by this Senate and the House, \nthat prohibited the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare from \nrequiring States to bus children for racial purposes.\n\n[[Page S11758]]\n\n  Of course, under the statute, States could adopt forced busing if \nthey wanted, and the Federal courts could still order busing. The \nstatute merely prohibited the Department of HEW from forcing States to \nbus children on its own motion.\n  In his brief challenging that law, Mr. Lee stated that the \ncongressional amendments ``demonstrate discriminatory intent to \ninterfere with desegregation.''\n  Of course, that is an unfounded and unfair charge to make. Many \npeople--I know Senator Byrd, on the other side of the aisle, had led \nthe fight for that statute. He was not trying to undue and return to \nsegregation. He simply was concerned, as millions of Americans have \nbeen, that the experiment with busing was not working. And he did not \nwant the Department of Education, on its own, requiring it, and since, \nas years have gone by, it has been well-recognized that the experiment \nwith busing has not achieved the goals that were intended, and is, in \nessence, for all practical purposes, a failure.\n  Parents of all races oppose mandatory busing, and the law in Brown \nversus Califano reflected this. Again, the Federal courts rejected \nLee's argument and upheld the statute. But that is just another example \nof where Mr. Lee has sued to implement a political agenda that he lost \nduring the democratic process. That is, he lost it in the hearts and \nminds of the people and through their elected representatives. And he, \ntherefore, sought to have the courts overturn that.\n  In another forced busing case, Mr. Lee wrote the following in his \nbrief. This is what he wrote:\n\n       The term ``forced busing'' is a misnomer. School districts \n     do not force children to ride a bus, but only to arrive on \n     time at their assigned schools.\n\n  I think many people feel that that is the kind of comment that shows \narrogance and insensitivity to those who are concerned about children \nwho have no way to go to school but by bus, to be told, ``Well, you \ndon't have to ride a bus. You just have to show up at a certain school \non time.''\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, America is at a crossroads in the civil \nrights debate. The American people believe overwhelmingly that \ngovernment services and benefits should be administered in a color-\nblind fashion. As a nation we have made tremendous progress toward \nracial harmony, and though our work to eradicate racism is not finished \nand much bias and prejudice still exists in our land that we should not \ntolerate and should seek to eliminate, we should be proud of the great \nprogress that has been made in the past 30 years.\n  Mr. President, it gives me no pleasure to announce this vote against \nMr. Lee. He is an admirable person, a fine lawyer. Please make no \nmistake, my opposition to him is in no way an attack on his integrity \nand character. However, his positions, particularly his tendency to \nfile lawsuits to promote his agenda and his misreading of Supreme Court \nprecedents, simply make him the wrong person at the wrong time to be \nthe Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I wish to commend the able Senator from Alabama for the \nexcellent remarks he has made on this subject.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for his \nleadership as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and his comments \nearlier this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11756-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11758-S11759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REACTION TO LEACH/MCKINNEY LOGGING PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, legislation was recently introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives that would ban all commercial logging on \nFederal lands. This legislation would be devastating not only for the \nPacific Northwest, which is highly dependent on its forest products \nindustries, but disastrous for the entire Nation as well.\n  I'm appalled. Let me state that the bill introduced by \nRepresentatives McKinney, Leach, McDermott, and others has absolutely \nno chance of passage. None. Yet, it's another confirmation of the \nradical nature of our opponents in this debate about managing our \nnational resources. After years of talking about compromise and \nbalance, it's clear by the introduction of this bill that their view is \nthat one of our greatest renewable natural resources shouldn't be used \nfor any constructive economic purpose. The sponsors of this bill are \nclearly indifferent to human costs and economic disruption this radical \npolicy would impose on our Nation's economy, and particularly on our \ntimber dependent communities.\n  Support for this bill--which I repeat, has no chance of passage--\ncomes from the Sierra Club and other environmental organizations that \nearlier this year endorsed a policy of zero cut of timber on public \nlands. More recently, during debate on the Interior appropriations \nbill, many of these same groups supported an amendment substantially \nreducing the budget for Forest Service roads. Had these groups \nsucceeded, the Federal Timber Sale Program, which already has been \nreduced by two-thirds over the past decade, would have been reduced by \nanother 50 percent. This was clearly a tactic employed by radical \nenvironmental groups with the ultimate goal of eliminating all Federal \ntimber harvests.\n  Proponents of a zero cut policy on Federal lands lead an effort to \nfurther erode the economic backbone of rural Americans. It is an effort \nby mostly urban environmentalists--armchair environmentalists--who have \nforgotten, or who never knew, what it takes to produce fiber and \nshelter, and are indifferent to the communities and jobs that produce \nthese commodities.\n  Published reports about this legislation fail to mention that Federal \ntimber sales are already in severe decline, primarily from the \nlimitations placed on the Forest Service by the Clinton \nadministration's environmental considerations and species protection \nefforts. In 1987, the Federal Timber Sale Program provided nearly 12 \nbillion board feet of timber. Now, 10 years later, less than 4 billion \nboard feet were sold. This translates to double-digit unemployment in \nWashington State's timber dependent communities. I cannot imagine how \nterrible it would be for these already depressed communities if timber \nharvests were banned on public lands.\n  For the record, I would like to note that 23 of Washington's 39 \ncounties have been designated as ``distressed'' counties under State \nguidelines, meaning that their unemployment rates have been 20 percent \nabove the State average for 3 years and median household incomes less \nthan 75 percent of the State median. This is, to a great extent, the \ndirect result of economic devastation in our timber dependent \ncommunities.\n  These are counties with towns like Port Angeles. A pulp mill closure \nin February resulted in about $17 million in direct payroll losses and \nhundreds of jobs. As I speak today, representatives from the Port \nAngeles community are hosting a summit for similarly distressed \ncommunities that are finding it hard to survive in an era of declining \ntimber sales.\n  These areas of the State do not share the wealth of the booming \nSeattle economy. In 1996, 75 percent of the timber sold by the U.S. \nForest Service was to small businesses. These small operations are \npredominately headquartered in rural areas; in places such as Forks, \nWA, where jobs and the community's stability are dependent upon the \ntimber industry. These are communities struggling under existing \nenvironmental restrictions and species protection efforts. The recent \nHouse proposal would serve as a death blow to these struggling \ncommunities.\n  Proponents of the zero-cut scheme also erroneously claim it will \nbenefit the Federal Treasury. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nDespite the fact that annual timber sale revenues dropped by over $462 \nmillion due to logging restrictions, the Forest Service Federal Timber \nSale Program generates annual net revenues of $59 million to the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  In addition, due to declining timber harvests, imports of softwood \nlumber between 1992 and 1995 increased by 4 billion board feet. As a \nresult, the average price of an 1,800 square foot new home has gone up \n$2,000. The environmentalists don't like to talk about the\n\n[[Page S11759]]\n\ninflationary results of their anti-timber campaigns--where is their \nrighteous indignation when working Americans and families find it \nincreasingly difficult to put a roof over their heads?\n  What is most disappointing in this debate is that news articles and \nextreme environmental organizations fail to mention the greatest loser \nif such a proposal was ever enacted: our public education system. Some \n25 percent of the revenue from Federal timber sales goes directly to \ncounties to be used for roads and schools. These counties rely on these \nFederal revenues. In addition to providing essential local services as \nschools and roads, these counties also provide direct and indirect \nservices to national forests, national parks, wilderness areas, fish \nand wildlife refuges, and reclamation areas. Without some timber \nharvests in these financially-strapped counties, the public education \nof our children will suffer.\n\n  The argument that the only good harvest is no harvest at all \noverlooks the fact that up to 10,000 acres of Federal timber lands fall \nvictim to forest fires every year. This does not even take into account \nthe insect and disease outbreaks which ravage thousands of acres of \npublic lands.\n  In 1994, devastating wildfires ravaged forests in Washington State. \nThe fires were fueled by the excessive buildup on the forest floor. The \nforest floor was composed of dead, dying, insect infested, and diseased \ntimber which had built up due to a lack of active management on Federal \nforest lands, including thinning and removal of insect-infested trees.\n  The health of our forests will deteriorate under the status quo, as \ndead and dying trees are left untouched.\n  Thinning, on the other hand will create a desired condition in which \nmore trees will survive because of less competition for a limited \namount of available moisture. By reducing natural fuel loads through \nthinning, removal of underbrush, and dead and dying trees, we will be \ncreating a win-win situation in which our forests will be healthier and \nour mills will be stronger.\n  I think it is also important to note that as I heap scorn on the \nproposed legislation in the House and its supporters, we are beginning \nto see a rejection of this extreme approach by dedicated \nenvironmentalists who live in timber-dependent communities. Unlike \ntheir counterparts in Washington DC, and other urban areas who are busy \nturning out fundraising letters, these true conservationists send their \nchildren to the local schools, see the devastating impact of these \nradical policies on the local economy, and fear for their lives, \nlivelihood, and homes due to the severe wildfire threat.\n  As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, it \nwas encouraging to see the progress that is being made at the local \nlevel in northeastern California. There, local environmentalists, \ntimber workers, and public officials have crafted a reasonable land \nmanagement plan that resores balance to our forests known as the Quincy \nLibrary Group approach.\n  Unlike this approach--a balanced, responsible approach to forest \nhealth and forest management--the zero-cut proposal introduced last \nweek in the House does nothing more than carry out the agenda of \nextreme national environmental organizations. I urge moderate, \nresponsible environmental organizations to join me in soundly defeating \nthe proposal in the House and here, if and when the bill is ever \nbrought before either chamber.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding naval officer and good friend, Rear \nAdm. (select) Jay M. Cohen. For the past 4\\1/2\\ years, Rear Admiral \n(select) Cohen has served with distinction as the Navy's Deputy Chief \nof Legislative Affairs, and it is my privilege to recognize his many \naccomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has \nprovided this legislative body, the Navy, and the Nation.\n  A native of New York City, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen was \ncommissioned as an ensign upon graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy \nin 1968. Since then, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen has spent the majority \nof his career patrolling the ocean depths as a Navy submariner. \nFollowing submarine training, he began his submarine service aboard \nU.S.S. Diodon (SS 349) in San Diego. Nuclear power trained, he has \nserved in the engineering departments of U.S.S. Nathaniel Greene (SSBN \n636) and U.S.S. Nathan Hall (SSBN 623), and as the executive officer \naboard U.S.S. George Washington Carver (SSBN 656). In 1985, Rear \nAdmiral (select) Cohen took command of U.S.S. Hyman G. Rickover (SSN \n709) and skippered the ship on three deployments.\n  When not underwater, Rear Admiral (select) Cohen has likewise served \nwith distinction on the staff of Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic \nFleet, as senior member of the Nuclear Propulsion Examining Board and \non the staff of the Director of Naval Intelligence. He also commanded \nU.S.S. L.Y. Spear (AS 36), a submarine tender in Norfolk, VA. Following \nthis command tour, he reported, in April 1993, to the Secretary of the \nNavy's staff as the Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs. Among Rear \nAdmiral(select) Cohen's many awards and decorations are five Legions of \nMerit and three Meritorious Service Medals. He is both submarine and \nsurface warfare qualified.\n  During his tenure as the Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs, Rear \nAdmiral (select) Cohen provided the Senate with timely support and \naccurate information on Navy plans and programs. His close work with \nthe Congress and steadfast devotion to the Navy mission helped ensure \nthat the U.S. Navy remained the best-trained, best-equipped, and best-\nprepared naval force in the world. Faced with countless challenges and \na multitude of complex and sensitive issues, Rear Admiral (select) \nCohen's unflappable leadership, integrity, and limitless energy had a \nprofound and positive impact on the U.S. Naval Service.\n  As a testament to his extremely valuable contributions to the \nnational security of this country, the Navy recently selected him to \nflag rank and I am pleased to say that the Senate recently confirmed \nhis nomination. The Chief of Naval Operations will pin on his star \nFriday, November 7, in the Pentagon. With this well-deserved promotion, \nAdmiral Cohen will continue his outstanding service to the Navy and the \nNation as he moves on to positions of even greater responsibility. On \nbehalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish Rear Adm. \n(select) Jay Cohen fair winds and following seas. I know we will see \nand hear from him again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11759-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11759-S11760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last week the First Lady visited Dublin \nand Belfast. When the President and the First Lady visited those cities \n2 years ago, they received a warm welcome from the people of Ireland \nand Northern Ireland, and Mrs. Clinton was warmly received on her \nreturn visit last week.\n  During her visit, she emphasized the President's commitment to peace \nin Northern Ireland. All friends of Ireland in the United States are \ngrateful for the continuing interest and involvement of the President \nand the First Lady in this issue, which is of such great importance to \nso many Americans.\n  In Dublin on October 30, Mrs. Clinton spoke warmly of her previous \nvisit in 1995 and the continuing strong commitment of the United States \nto the peace process.\n  At the University of Ulster in Belfast on October 31, Mrs. Clinton \ndelivered a lecture named in honor and in memory of Joyce McCartan, a \ncourageous woman of peace whom the First Lady had met during her visit \n2 years ago, and who had inspired many other women in Northern Ireland \nto take up the cause of reconciliation.\n  I believe my colleagues will be interested in Mrs. Clinton's eloquent \nremarks about the positive role of women in Northern Ireland and around \nthe world in the search for peace and hope and opportunity. I ask \nunanimous consent that the First Lady's remarks in Dublin and Belfast \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Remarks of the First Lady\n\n\n                     dublin castle; dublin, ireland\n\n                            October 30, 1997\n\n       Thank you very much, it is such a great pleasure for me to \n     be back and I must tell you that although my visit is far too \n     brief, my husband is very jealous. He is green with jealousy, \n     and as I left this morning, he said ``tell everyone''--as \n     though I would have a chance to tell the entire populace--how \n     much he wishes he could be here as well.\n       It has been as, we have heard, nearly two years since we \n     were here, and I don't think we will ever have a better time \n     anywhere than we did here. The warmth of the greeting and the \n     outpouring at College Green are images that we think about \n     and talk about in our house all the time. It is wonderful to \n     be back here in this Castle, and I am especially pleased that \n     since our visit, Ireland hosted here, the European Union \n     leaders, to such success.\n       Much has happened in the Northern Ireland peace process \n     since my husband was here. An IRA cease-fire broke down but \n     was restored, and in this precious peace almost all the key \n     parties of the conflict are sitting down to discuss \n     substantive issues. There is a new government in Ireland, led \n     by the Taoiseach, and this government has built on the \n     determination of its predecessor to keep the political \n     momentum moving toward a negotiated settlement.\n       But I've been especially pleased to see, since my visit, \n     how Ireland has continued to prosper. It has been wonderful \n     to read, as I have, of the important progress that has been \n     made, not only in the peace process but in the move toward \n     prosperity, on this island. I was very moved to have a visit \n     just a few days ago in the White House from Mary Robinson, \n     and I know that the polls have closed and you are about to \n     elect her successor. She has moved from being your President \n     to being in the forefront of human rights, another example of \n     Irish leadership.\n       Dublin as you know has an important critical role in \n     producing a settlement. As my husband said two years ago on \n     College Green, America will be with you as you walk the road \n     of peace. We know from our own experience that making peace \n     among people of different cultures is the work of a lifetime. \n     My husband and I, and all who stand with you, are under no \n     illusions that reaching an agreement will be easy. There are \n     centuries of feelings behind each side's arguments, and \n     events of the past 27 years have left wounds that are still \n     raw.\n       I would like to highlight two themes on this short visit \n     here and then tomorrow in Belfast--compromise and \n     reconciliation. When the people want peace, it is the \n     obligation of political leaders to find the common ground \n     where it can thrive. It involves postponing or even giving up \n     cherished ideals in the belief that others will do the same \n     to end conflict and build a better future. All sides must \n     compromise and seek this common ground in the weeks and \n     months ahead.\n       I want, on behalf of the President, to pay tribute to both \n     sides of the border and the community divide, who have worked \n     so hard in recent years to bring about reconciliation in the \n     wake of this bitter conflict, and I want to mention women in \n     particular. Women have paid a heavy price for the social \n     turmoil generated by the troubles, and it therefore comes as \n     no surprise that women are leading the efforts towards a \n     lasting peace. Tomorrow, in Belfast, I will honor one such \n     woman, Joyce McCartan, whom I was privileged to meet on my \n     visit. The National Women's Council of Ireland has launched a \n     project in collaboration with partners in Northern Ireland \n     called ``Making Women Seen and Heard.'' It features workshops \n     designed to empower women who are politically and socially \n     marginalized. These workshops held on both sides of the \n     border are a tangible example of what can be done to foster \n     communication and reconciliation.\n       The United States will continue to do its part to support \n     the peace process. My husband remains personally committed to \n     this effort and to those who take risks to make peace happen. \n     We are also fortunate to have Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, \n     who has contributed so much to the relationship between our \n     countries, to Ireland, and to the peace process. Be assured \n     that the United States is your partner for the long haul.\n       I want to thank you also for the warm hospitality extended \n     to my daughter during her private visit in June. She was able \n     to come with a friend and just a few other keepers, and enjoy \n     the people and the beauty of your country, and I am grateful \n     to you for that. I also must tell you that my husband has \n     been practicing his golf, looking at his calendar searching \n     for a date that will enable him to return here with a seven-\n     iron in hand. I hope that that is not too far off in the \n     distance, and that he will have the opportunity that I have \n     now to greet you personally, to thank you for your friendship \n     and your support, and to wish you Godspeed in the many \n     important efforts that you are undertaking today.\n       Thank you very much.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n      Remarks of the First Lady at Joyce McCartan Memorial Lecture\n\n\n            university of ulster; belfast, northern ireland\n\n                            October 31, 1997\n\n       Thank you, Thank you very much, Chancellor. I am delighted \n     to be here at this university. I want to thank the university \n     for this invitation, Robert Hanna, Professor Sir Trevor \n     Smith, Pro Vice Chancellor, and Provost Ann Tate. And I'm \n     especially pleased that I could be joined today by the United \n     States Ambassador to the Court of St. James Philip Lader, \n     U.S. Counsel General Kathleen Stevens, and Senator George \n     Mitchell, who is here in the room with us.\n       I want to welcome all of you because I feel so very welcome \n     here, but particularly, a special welcome to the family, \n     friends and associates of Joyce McCartan who have joined us \n     today.\n       It is a great personal pleasure and honor for me to be back \n     in Northern Ireland and to reunited with some of the \n     courageous women and men I first met when I came here two \n     years ago with my husband. The sights and sounds and emotions \n     of that visit, the lighting of the Christmas Tree outside \n     City Hall, our walk from Guild Hall Square to Shipquay \n     Street, Protestants and Catholics working side by side at the \n     Mackey Metal\n\n[[Page S11761]]\n\n     Plant--all of that and so much more hold special places in my \n     husband's heart and in my own.\n       And I will always treasure my visit to Ye Olde Lamplighter \n     on Lower Ormeau Road, for it was there that I shared a cup of \n     tea with Joyce McCartan and her colleagues. It is, therefore, \n     a signal honor to give this, first of a series of lectures \n     dedicated in her memory, and in recognition of the important \n     role women have played, are playing and will play in building \n     peace.\n       I am very delighted that the university, with the support \n     of corporate sponsorship from Cable Tel, will honor Joyce \n     McCartan's work even further by establishing bursaries to \n     assist women who are studying conflict resolution and \n     community reconciliation.\n       This is a hopeful moment, as it was two years ago. But it \n     is even more promising now. For the first time in more than \n     25 years, leaders of Northern Ireland's Catholic and \n     Protestants communities are meeting, and the world is \n     watching to see whether they will be able to end a generation \n     of senseless killing and forge a lasting peace.\n       When the people want peace, it is the obligation of \n     political leaders to find the common ground where it can \n     thrive. That requires compromise and reconciliation. That \n     involves postponing or even giving up one's cherished ideals \n     in the belief that others will do the same to end the \n     conflict and build a better future.\n       All sides must compromise and seek this common ground in \n     the weeks and months ahead. The United States will continue \n     to do its part to support the peace process, and my husband \n     remains personally committed to this effort and to those who \n     take risks for peace.\n       Joyce McCartan was one of those risk-takers. I want to pay \n     tribute to her and to the men and women on both sides of the \n     border and the community divide who have worked so hard in \n     recent years to bring about reconciliation in the wake of \n     this bitter conflict. We would never have arrived at this \n     hopeful moment without the countless acts of courage and \n     faith of people like the women we honor today.\n       I have many memories of my visit, and I even have a \n     souvenir. I have the teapot. (Laughter and applause.) As you \n     can see, it is a rather ordinary, stainless steel teapot, one \n     easily found in many Belfast kitchens. But as I told Joyce \n     during our conversation, this teapot was so much better at \n     keeping the tea hot than the ones I had back in the White \n     House. So she gave it to me as a present.\n       I use this teapot every day in my private kitchen on the \n     second floor of the White House. And whenever I look at it, I \n     am reminded of Joyce's ability to warm hearts, to keep alive \n     hope for a better world and a better time, despite tragedy \n     after heart-breaking tragedy.\n       As we sipped our tea together, the women told me how they \n     had worked over the years, how both Catholic and Protestant, \n     they had realized so much more united than divided them. \n     While they may have attended different churches on Sunday, \n     seven days a week they all said a silent prayer for the safe \n     return of a child from school or a husband from an errand in \n     town. Seven days a week their families struggled with the \n     same deep-rooted causes of the violence--the terrors of \n     sectarianism, the burdens of poverty, the shackles of \n     limited education, the despair of unemployment.\n       And while they may have held different views of the past, \n     they had learned that together they could build a better \n     present and hope for an even brighter future, by promoting \n     understanding, saving lives, preserving families, nurturing \n     hope, and defying history. Because, in the end, for them and \n     for so many other women across Northern Ireland, love of \n     family ran deeper than calls to hatred.\n       I had never met Joyce before we gathered together, but I \n     had seen her compassion, courage and commitment in many other \n     eyes--her yearning for a more peaceful and democratic would \n     resonates through the ages and stretches across the globe. \n     Mothers, wives, daughters, ordinary citizens--their insistent \n     voices for peace raised sometimes in a roar, but more often \n     in a whispered prayer--have inspired women and entire \n     societies around the world to build more open, just, \n     democratic and peaceful communities. This chorus of \n     courageous voices can be heard today from Belfast to Bosnia, \n     wherever women are working to end the violence and begin the \n     healing.\n       Although I have been privileged to travel widely and meet \n     many of the world's leaders, I often find that it is in small \n     groups, sitting around a kitchen table, sipping tea with \n     women like Joyce, sharing concerns and talking about our \n     families, where I've learned the most valuable lessons. And \n     one of those lessons is that an extraordinary power is \n     unleashed when women reach out to their neighbors and find \n     common ground--when they began to lift themselves up, and by \n     doing so, lift up their families, their neighbors, and their \n     communities.\n       I know that Joyce liked to call herself a family feminist \n     because saving families was at the root of all her efforts. \n     This is a brilliant term, and one that I have quoted \n     throughout the globe, because it captures the very important \n     idea that when women are empowered to make the most of their \n     own potential, then their families will thrive, and when \n     families thrive, communities and nations thrive as well. \n     Women who are acting to protect and strengthen their families \n     are playing a central role in the building and sustaining of \n     peace and democracy around the world.\n       Now, often when we talk about democracy, or when classes \n     and lectures are held about it, we talk about our highest \n     ideals--freedom of religion, freedom of association, freedom \n     of speech and of the press, freedom to participate fully in \n     the civic and political life of one's country. But democracy \n     is also about ensuring equal access to quality education, \n     health care, jobs and credit. Democracy is about respecting \n     human dignity and allowing people the opportunity to take \n     responsibility for composing their own lives that will allow \n     them to live up to their God-given promise.\n       What we've learned over the years is that these lofty \n     ideals can be made real only through the everyday efforts of \n     ordinary citizens. Yes, we need laws and a system of justice \n     to uphold them, but democracy is nurtured and sustained in \n     the hearts of people, in the principles they honor, in the \n     way they live their daily lives and how they treat their \n     fellow citizens, in the lessons they teach their children \n     before they tuck them into bed at night.\n       One of the great observers of American democracy, Alexis de \n     Tocqueville, wrote about what it was that he though made \n     American democracy work. He talked about the way men and \n     women felt they could participate in making their own lives \n     better, how they formed associations, how they worked for \n     some common good. And he referred to the habits of the heart \n     that are necessary for any democracy to flourish. It is these \n     habits of the heart that must be nurtured, and that \n     countless, unheralded women around the world are quietly \n     doing so every day.\n       I have tried in my travels to shine a spotlight on their \n     achievements because I stand in awe of women like Joyce \n     McCartan--women who through their own personal tragedies find \n     the strength to go on, but more than that, to reach out and \n     try to prevent the conditions from occurring that causes them \n     such heartbreak. Women, like so many of you here who have \n     endured the loss of loved ones--fathers, brothers, husbands, \n     sons and others--to the Troubles, but have refused to give in \n     to bitterness or to dwell in the past.\n       You have been working through community organizations, such \n     as the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition to break the cycle \n     of hatred and save other people's fathers, brothers, husbands \n     and sons. Your efforts to share grief across sectarian lines \n     have blossomed into dynamic alliances to end poverty and the \n     causes of violence. And you have helped to lay a solid \n     foundation for permanent peace.\n       I want you to know that you should never feel alone in your \n     efforts. You are part of a powerful movement of family \n     feminists, working to strengthen democracy across the globe. \n     Your partners are everywhere. They're the women in South \n     Africa who lost loved ones and were victimized by apartheid. \n     But they have been willing to participate in the work of the \n     Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and to find in their \n     hearts the capacity for forgiveness of those who did violence \n     to them--because what does freedom mean if people remain \n     imprisoned by their own bitterness?\n       They are women who are starting small community banks in \n     poor rural villages or inner city neighborhoods from Chile to \n     Chicago--because what does freedom mean if people don't have \n     the opportunity and the income to help them gain independence \n     and self-sufficiency?\n       They are women in countries like Pakistan who have agitated \n     against domestic violence--because what does freedom mean if \n     a woman is afraid to sleep in her own home or protect her \n     children because of a violent husband?\n       They are women in Zimbabwe and Bolivia who are running \n     rural health clinics and are working in the inner cities to \n     immunize children an provide services--because what does \n     freedom mean if families are denied access to basic health \n     care, and women are denied the right to plan their own \n     families?\n       They are the women in Romania and Estonia who are leading \n     voter education projects--because what does freedom mean if \n     people do not know how to exercise their right to choose \n     their own leaders?\n       They are women from the Philippines to Paraguay who are \n     campaigning for the rights of girls to receive the same \n     education as their brothers--because what does freedom mean \n     if women do not gain the skills and knowledge to make the \n     most of their God-given gifts?\n       Women are not only critical to advancing peace and freedom, \n     they are redefining the very notion of what we mean by a \n     democratic society. Democracy cannot flourish if women are \n     not full partners in the social, economic, political and \n     civic lives of their communities and nations. Societies will \n     only address the issues closest to the hearts of women when \n     women themselves claim their rights as citizens.\n       That message has come to life in my own country. Suddenly, \n     the debates about politics and our future are not only about \n     defense or diplomacy. They are also about how to balance work \n     and family, about improving public schools, about keeping \n     health insurance after leaving a job or sending a child off \n     to college for an education.\n       These issues have become central to our political life \n     because thousands of American women have become organized and \n     demanded changes, and insisted that our democracy respond to \n     their concerns. They've helped all\n\n[[Page S11762]]\n\n     Americans understand that strengthening families and \n     cherishing children are not just women's issues, but issues \n     of vital importance to everyone concerned about our common \n     future.\n       Now, there were some observers who were perplexed that \n     during the last presidential campaign, these kitchen table \n     issues had become so important. They, in fact, derided the \n     phenomenon as the feminization of politics. I prefer to think \n     of it as the humanization of politics--because how we raise \n     our children, care for our sick, train our workers will \n     determine the strength and prosperity of all our people in \n     the days to come. And how we learn to live together across \n     religious, ethnic and racial lines will determine the peace \n     and security of our children's lives.\n       That's why I believe encouraging more women's voices to be \n     heard is important for the overall effort that many of you \n     are making to assure that your children, your grandchildren, \n     these young people in this audience will be able to live out \n     their lives in a peaceful, secure Northern Ireland. It is \n     important that these women's issues that affect our deepest \n     concerns as human beings are part of the political debate.\n       Most women, like Joyce McCartan, don't become involved in \n     politics because they have any grand philosophy about how \n     they intend to strengthen democracy. Instead, they see how \n     politics--especially politics practiced by those who are \n     engendering conflict between people--are hurting their \n     families. They get fed up with the posturing; they get fed up \n     with the speech making. When jobs are scarce and hope is in \n     very short supply, they take matters into their own hands. \n     They decide, as Joyce memorably said, ``You can't fry flags \n     in a pan.'' And they get to work on setting things right.\n       I am told that years ago, Joyce borrowed a couple of cows \n     from a farmer and led a group of women to City Hall to \n     protest the removal of free school milk for children. Another \n     time, she attended a city council meeting and refused to \n     leave until they discussed an increase in the bus fare. And \n     while she had to be carried out of that meeting, she \n     eventually forced the council to hear her grievance and \n     convinced them to introduce a lower fare for children. It is \n     the stuff of life. It is those issues we talk about around \n     our kitchen tables that help to develop those habits of the \n     heart that sustain democracy.\n       I thought often about the Troubles here as I have thought \n     about Joyce McCartan and the women I met as I have fixed \n     myself a pot of tea. I don't know whether a Catholic or a \n     Protestant made this teapot. I don't know whether a Catholic \n     or a Protestant sold this teapot. I only know that this \n     teapot serves me very well. And this teapot stands for all \n     those conversations around those thousands of kitchen tables \n     where mothers and fathers look at one another with despair \n     because they cannot imagine that the future will be any \n     better for their children. But this teapot also is on the \n     kitchen table where mothers and fathers look at one another \n     and say, we have to do better. We cannot permit this to go \n     on. We have to take a stand for our children.\n       There is no room for illusion in the difficulty that \n     confronts the peace process. The President and all of us who \n     support you in this effort know how difficult it will be to \n     overcome the past when the wounds still seem so raw. But the \n     children deserve all the work, all the prayers, all the \n     strength, courage and commitment that can be brought to bear.\n       There will be more bumps on the road. There will be those \n     who would rather smash the teapot than to fill it with piping \n     hot tea to sit down to have a conversation. And the women and \n     the men who believe, as Joyce McCartan believed with all her \n     heart, that there is a better way, who saw as she sat around \n     so many kitchen tables talking across the division that \n     everyone was concerned about the same issues deep down, that \n     we all worried about our lives, our relationships, our jobs, \n     our education, our children, our health--she understood that \n     if we could just get enough people around some great kitchen \n     table, where they'd have to sit down and look at one another \n     honestly, share their fears, their hopes, their dreams, that \n     we could make progress.\n       Well, now, finally, we have men and women around a table. I \n     hope they have lots of tea. I hope that they are not only \n     talking about all of the difficult political issues, but in \n     quiet asides, sharing some of what is in their heart with one \n     another. And as they do so, I hope the faces of so many women \n     and men who have given all they could give over the years to \n     bring this moment to pass, will be seen in the mind's eye.\n       Joyce McCartan deserves as her real legacy that the peace \n     process move forward. She and all the brave women who, for \n     more than 20 years, marched, begged, prayed, cried, shouted \n     that they wanted peace deserve to be heard.\n       It is no longer in Joyce's hands. The burden has been \n     passed to others. And I hope and I pray that those to whom it \n     has been entrusted will pick up that burden and carry it \n     forward. Joyce's work is done. But to honor her memory, we \n     should all press forward with her work--to build peace here \n     and around the world.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11760-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11762-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11762-S11763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:37 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 672) to make \ntechnical amendments to certain provisions of title 17, United States \nCode.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 587.

A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that a monthly insurance benefit thereunder shall be paid for \nthe month in which the recipient dies, subject to a reduction of 50 \npercent if the recipient dies, during the first 15 days of such month, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               THE SOCIAL SECURITY FAMILY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about an issue \nthat is very important to me, very important to my constituents in \nMaryland and very important to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  For the second Congress in a row, I am joining in a bipartisan effort \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, to end an unfair \npolicy of the Social Security System.\n  Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Social Security Family \nProtection Act. This bill addresses retirement security and family \nsecurity. We want the middle class of this Nation to know that we are \ngoing to give help to those who practice self-help.\n  What is it I am talking about? We have found that Social Security \ndoes not pay benefits for the last month of life. If a Social Security \nretiree dies on the 18th of the month or even on the 30th of the month, \nthe surviving spouse or family members must send back the Social \nSecurity check for that month.\n  I think that is an harsh and heartless rule. That individual worked \nfor Social Security benefits, earned those benefits, and paid into the \nSocial Security trust fund. The system should allow the surviving \nspouse or the estate of the family to use that Social Security check \nfor the last month of life.\n  This legislation has an urgency, Mr. President. When a loved one \ndies, there are expenses that the family must take care of. People have \ncalled my office in tears. Very often it is a son or a daughter that is \ngrieving the death of a parent. They are clearing up the paperwork for \ntheir mom or dad, and there is the Social Security check. And they say, \n``Senator, the check says for the month of May. Mom died on May 28. Why \ndo we have to send the Social Security check back? We have bills to \npay. We have utility coverage that we need to wrap up, mom's rent, or \nher mortgage, or health expenses. Why is Social Security telling me, \n`Send the check back or we're going to come and get you'?''\n  With all the problems in our country today, we ought to be going \nafter drug dealers and tax dodgers, not honest people who have paid \ninto Social Security, and not the surviving spouse or the family who \nhave been left with the bills for the last month of their loved one's \nlife. They are absolutely right when they call me and say that Social \nSecurity was supposed to be there for them.\n  I've listened to my constituents and to the stories of their lives. \nWhat they say is this: ``Senator Mikulski, we don't want anything for \nfree. But our family does want what our parents worked for. We do want \nwhat we feel we deserve and what has been paid for in the trust fund in \nour loved one's name. Please make sure that our family gets the Social \nSecurity check for the last month of our life.''\n  That is what our bill is going to do. That is why Senator Snowe and I \nare introducing the Family Social Security Protection Act. When we talk \nabout retirement security, the most important part of that is income \nsecurity. And the safety net for most Americans is Social Security.\n  We know that as Senators we have to make sure that Social Security \nremains solvent, and we are working to do that. We also don't want to \ncreate an undue administrative burden at the Social Security \nAdministration--a burden that might affect today's retirees. But it is \nabsolutely crucial that we provide a Social Security check for the last \nmonth of life.\n  How do we propose to do that? We have a very simple, straightforward \nway of dealing with this problem. Our legislation says that if you die \nbefore the 15th of the month, you will get a check for half the month. \nIf you die after the 15th of the month, your surviving spouse or the \nfamily estate would get a check for the full month.\n  We think this bill is fundamentally fair. Senator Snowe and I are \nold-fashioned in our belief in family values. We believe you honor your \nfather and your mother. We believe that it is not only a good religious \nand moral principle, but it is good public policy as well.\n  The way to honor your father and mother is to have a strong Social \nSecurity System and to make sure the system is fair in every way. That \nmeans fair for the retiree and fair for the spouse and family. That is \nwhy we support making sure that the surviving spouse or family can keep \nthe Social Security check for the last month of life.\n  Mr. President, we urge our colleagues to join us in this effort and \nsupport the Social Security Family Protection Act.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague and \nfriend, the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing \nlegislation to correct an inequity that exists in our Social Security \nsystem.\n  Currently, when a Social Security beneficiary dies, his or her last \nmonthly benefit check must be returned to the Social Security \nAdministration. This provision often causes problems for the surviving \nfamily members because they are unable to financially subsidize the \nexpenses accrued by the late beneficiary in their last month of life. \nThe bill we are introducing today is based on legislation I have \nintroduced during the last four Congresses. My original legislation \nprorated the Social Security benefit based on the date of death. If the \nbeneficiary died before the 15th, the surviving spouse received 50 \npercent of the benefit, if the beneficiary died after the 15th, the \nsurviving spouse received the entire\n\n[[Page S11765]]\n\ncheck. The bill Senator Mikulski and I are introducing today expands on \nthis bill by making other family members eligible to receive the check \nif there is not a surviving spouse.\n  Current law makes an inappropriate assumption that a beneficiary has \nnot incurred expenses during his or her last month of life. I know that \nmy colleagues have heard, as have Senator Mikulski and I, from \nconstituents who have lost a husband or wife, father or mother, toward \nthe end of the month, received the Social Security check and spent all \nor part of it to pay the bills, only to receive a notice from Social \nSecurity that the check must be returned. For many of these people, \nthat check was the only income they had and they are left struggling to \nfind the money to pay back the Social Security Administration and pay \nthe rest of the expense their family member incurred in their last \nmonth.\n  I would like to read a part of a letter I received from a constituent \nabout the experience of his family when his brother-in-law died. This \nletter, along with Senator Mikulski's own experience when she lost a \nloved one, serves to highlight why this bill is necessary.\n\n       On February 29, 1996, at 9:20 p.m. he passed away. . . . he \n     was alive for 99.99617% of the month missing a full month by \n     0.0038314%. With this evidence in hand, the SSA then decided \n     that his check for the month of Feburary had to be returned \n     to them. Unfortunately, his debts for the month didn't \n     disappear just because he failed to live the extra 0.0038315% \n     of the month. . . . it would be nice to see some kind of pro-\n     rating system put into place for the rest of the people who \n     are going to encounter this ghoulish practice.\n\n  I know that my colleagues have all received letters like this. For \nmany of these people, that Social Security check is the only financial \nresource available to deal with the costs incurred during their loved \none's last day of life. Without it, they are left struggling to find \nthe money to pay back the Social Security Administration.\n  I believe that this legislation provides a fair solution to an unfair \nsituation and I hope my colleagues will join un in supporting this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1372. A bill to provide for the protection of farmland at the \nPoint Reyes National Seashore, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   THE POINT REYES NATIONAL SEASHORE FARMLAND PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. As with many of our national parks, monuments, and other \nprotected treasures, the character and beauty of the Point Reyes \nNational Seashore are threatened--not by development or environmental \ndegradation within the national seashore--but by proposed development \noutside the boundary line over which the Park Service has no control.\n  The Point Reyes National Seashore Farmland Protection Act of 1997, \nwhich I am introducing today, is an innovative proposal which will \nensure that the ecological integrity of the Point Reyes National \nSeashore is protected for future generations, while also preserving the \nproperty rights and historic agricultural use of the farmland in the \narea.\n  The legislation establishes a Farmland Protection Area adjacent to \nthe Point Reyes National Seashore within which willing farmers and \nranchers will have the opportunity to sell conservation easements for \ntheir land. The Farmland Protection Area includes 38,000 acres of the \neastern shore of Tomales Bay visible from within Point Reyes. Property \nowners within that area will be available, but not required, to sell \nconservation easements to their land.\n  Conservation easements are legal agreements between a land-owner and \na land trust, non-profit, conservation organization. The conservation \neasements restrict development on the land which is incompatible with \nthe agricultural uses of the land. The easements would not expand \npublic access, pesticide regulations, or hunting rights. Furthermore, \nthe easements will remain with the land in perpetuity providing \nsecurity for ranchers as well as continued protection for the national \nseashore.\n  The easements will allow existing agricultural activities to continue \nand will preserve the pastoral nature of the land adjacent to Point \nReyes National Seashore and the Golden Gate National Recreation Areas \nby guaranteeing no new development.\n  This bill will not allow the Secretary to acquire land without the \nconsent of the owner.\n  I believe this legislation will become a model for land conservation \nacross the Nation as Governments lack the funds to purchase fee title \nto protect valuable properties from development. This approach may be \nused to address similar problems at other parks, wildlife refuges, and \nmarine sanctuaries by preserving compatible land use areas that protect \nview sheds and prevent environmental damage.\n  This legislation will allow the National Park Service, working with \nthe Marin Agricultural Land Trust [MALT], the Sonoma Land Trust [SLT], \nand the Sonoma County Agricultural Preservation and Open Space District \n[SCAPOSD] to protect this beautiful area at a fraction of the cost of \nacquiring title to the properties within the new boundaries. In \naddition, those properties would be maintained on Marin County's tax \nrolls.\n  Without this legislation, almost 40,000 acres of scenic ranch land \nwill be vulnerable to development. This bill has the strong support of \nthe local farmers and ranchers within the area to be protected, local \nenvironmental groups including the Marin Conservation League, effected \nlocal governments and the local chamber of commerce.\n  I commend Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey for her hard work and dedication \nto the House companion legislation. She has been working closely with \ninterested parties in an effort to find this innovative approach to \nconservation which benefits ranchers, environmentalists, the county, \nand the Park Service alike.\n  Last week, the House Resources Committee National Parks and Public \nLands Subcommittee held a hearing on this legislation. In that hearing, \nconcerns were raised over the Department of Interior's involvement in \nthe conservation easements and the creation of a boundary around \nprivate agricultural lands.\n  While I understand that the National Park Service is not usually \ninvolved in agricultural conservation easements I believe it is the \nmost suitable agency in this case. The United States Department of \nAgriculture [USDA] does have a program whereby ranchers can sell \nconservation easements. These farmlands may not be critical \nagricultural lands at a national level, but they are critical to the \nNation's investment in the Point Reyes National Seashore. A simple \nincrease in funding for USDA's Farmland Protection Program would not \nensure any new funding for the Farmland Protection Area.\n  That also leads to the need for a boundary. While I believe it would \nbe beneficial to authorize conservation easements for the entire \nagricultural area, we must first concentrate on the most critical \nlands. The boundary will ensure that the funding is used on these \ncritical lands--lands closest to the national park which the Federal \nGovernment has the most interest in protecting.\n  Currently, there are 18 operating ranches within the existing Point \nReyes National Seashore. It is my understanding that these ranchers are \npleased with their relationship with the National Park Service. All the \nlandowners who wanted to continue ranching when the Point Reyes \nNational Seashore was formed are still operating ranches. In fact, \nevery single rancher has signed a statement affirming their \nsatisfaction with the continuing cooperation and support they receive \nfrom the National Park Service as they continue their ranching \noperations.\n  This legislation creates a completely voluntary program. Landowners \nwho wish to sell their land to developers, continue to have that right. \nWhile I don't encourage such actions, this legislation does nothing to \nimpede it. We have an opportunity here to take an important step toward \nprotecting farmers and enhancing a national park. It is not often that \nwe have such an occasion where often competing interests can co-exist. \nThis legislation provides that opening. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation and I am hopeful that we can pass it quickly.\n\n[[Page S11766]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect the pastoral nature of the land adjacent to \n     the Point Reyes National Seashore from development that would \n     be incompatible with the character, integrity, and visitor \n     experience of the park;\n       (2) to create a model public/private partnership among the \n     Federal, State, and local governments, and as organizations \n     and citizens that will preserve and enhance the agricultural \n     land along Tomales and Bodega Bay Watersheds;\n       (3) to protect the substantial Federal investment in Point \n     Reyes National Seashore by protecting land and water \n     resources and maintaining the relatively undeveloped nature \n     of the land surrounding Tomales and Bodega Bays; and\n       (4) to preserve productive uses of land and waters in Marin \n     and Sonoma counties adjacent to Point Reyes National \n     Seashore, primarily by maintaining the land in private \n     ownership restricted by conservation easements.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Commonwealth of Guam, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       THE GUAM COMMONWEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk, for appropriate \nreference, legislation to establish the Commonwealth of Guam. This \nmeasure is identical to H.R. 100 which was introduced by Congressman \nUnderwood. I am introducing this measure at the request of Congressman \nUnderwood and Governor Gutierrez of Guam.\n  The quest for self-government and recognition of the authority to \ndetermine the laws and programs that facilitate or impede our social, \npolitical, and economic growth are an integral part of the territorial \nhistory of this Nation. Even before the Constitution had been ratified, \nthe Northwest Ordinance set the pattern for the territory subject to \nthe new Federal Government. The ordinance set a policy that the \nterritory would be settled as soon as possible and admitted into the \nUnion with the other States. That policy, of full self-government and \nlimited governance from the Federal Establishment, marked territorial \npolicy until the beginning of this century.\n  While this century has seen the admission of States such as Arizona \nand New Mexico, as well as the more recent admission of Alaska and \nHawaii, the progress of full self-government has been slower for most \nof the areas acquired as a result of the Spanish-American War or since \nthat time. In 1898, a century ago, the United States acquired the \nPhilippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico. In 1900 and 1904 treaties of \ncession confirmed the extension of sovereignty over American Samoa. In \n1916\n\n[[Page S11767]]\n\nwe acquired the Virgin Islands. In 1976 the covenant that provided the \nbasis for the acquisition of the Northern Mariana Islands was enacted \nfollowing a plebiscite in the islands.\n  These areas, with the exception of the Philippines, have not followed \nthe path taken by the other territories of the United States. The \nPhilippines achieved commonwealth and independence, although World War \nII delayed full implementation. Shortly after World War II, Puerto Rico \nwas permitted to replace the local government provisions of federal \norganic legislation with a locally drafted Constitution and to elect \nits Governor. Not until the 1970's were Guam, the Virgin Islands, and \nAmerican Samoa afforded the opportunity to popularly elect their own \nGovernor. Also, during that period, Guam and the Virgin Islands were \nprovided the opportunity to develop a constitution to govern local \nmatters.\n  The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa \nare in a slightly different situation. American Samoa has a locally \ndeveloped constitution promulgated by secretarial order and the \nNorthern Marianas operate under the local constitution authorized under \nthe covenant.\n  The process of local self-government and improvements in Federal-\nterritorial relations has not stopped for any of these areas. This \nCongress has already seen as much attention as has occurred over the \npast decade. The Senate has passed legislation that provides the Virgin \nIslands with the same flexibility to issue short-and long-term bonds as \nthe States enjoy. The Senate has also passed legislation that would \nreform the way surplus Federal lands are disposed of in Guam, providing \nthe Government of Guam with an effective voice in decisions with \nrespect to future land use management. We have also considered \nmodifications requested by the executives in Guam and the Virgin \nIslands to the powers of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor. Both the \nSenate and the House have pending legislation to provide a referendum \nin Puerto Rico on future political status. In that context we are \nconsidering status in the larger constitutional context of Statehood or \nindependence as well as possible refinements to the present \nrelationship. We also have pending in the Senate legislation forwarded \nby the administration that would revise Federal-territorial relations \nwith the Northern Marianas in the areas of minimum wage, immigration, \nand trade.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today is a very broad approach \nto Federal relations with Guam. The provisions address several \ndifferent issues ranging from problems over resource allocation and use \nto operations of government to social and cultural issues. In the past \ndecade since the voters in Guam approved the present draft, some of the \nprovisions, such as judicial reform or disposal of excess Federal \nlands, have been addressed individually. Others may no longer be \nrelevant due to other changes. The central issue, however, is as \ncurrent and relevant as it was in 1982 when the voters in Guam decided \nto seek commonwealth as a means to obtain greater self-government.\n  The central issue is the proper role and authority of Federal versus \nlocal government. Where should decisions be made, be they right or \nwrong, and who should bear the burden of providing for the future? \nShould the Federal or local government have the authority to safeguard \nand manage local resources and provide for the health, safety, \neducation, and welfare of the local residents? Should noncontiguous \nareas bear the burden of regulations crafted to meet the needs of the \ncontiguous United States and for the administrative convenience of \nbureaucrats in Washington? I use the word noncontiguous because the \nconcerns that led Guam to seek the provisions of this legislation are \nequally applicable to areas in Alaska or Hawaii. Status, in the \nconstitutional sense, is not the problem or the answer, but rather the \nallocation of power and authority under the Constitution between \nFederal and local government.\n  An example of this would be the application of provisions of the \nClean Air Act to Guam. Notwithstanding the fact that Guam is a \nrelatively small island located in the western Pacific in the middle of \nthe trade winds, it had to comply with the same emission requirements \nas did places like Los Angeles or Washington. My colleagues should \nremember that what made Guam so valuable to the Spanish was that the \ngalleons leaving Acapulco were blown by the trade winds to Guam, where \nthey reprovisioned prior to heading to Manila. The powerplants in Guam \nwere required to install expensive scrubbers even though the nearest \npoint of land was the Philippines. Eventually we managed to obtain a \nwaiver for Guam, but it was only after years of effort by our \ncommittee, with the help I would note of my colleagues on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, to convince EPA that granting a \nwaiver for Guam was not a precedent for exempting the State of \nNebraska. Alaska and Hawaii have not been as successful, I would note. \nAnother example is the visa waiver that we finally managed to obtain \nfor Guam for tourists.\n  These are not unique problems. Administrative convenience seems to \nalways outweigh the realities of life in the noncontiguous areas, nor \nare our provisions uniform. In some instances, the difference in \ntreatment aggravates the local unhappiness with Washington. Guam is the \nsouthernmost of the Mariana Islands. The Northern Mariana Islands, \nwhich can be seen from Guam, are not subject to the Jones Act, but Guam \nis. The Virgin Islands has an exception, but Guam does not. While I \nwould never argue for uniformity as an inflexible principle, I do think \nthat Washington can be considerably more creative than it has been, and \ncertainly can be more understanding of the uniqueness of the \nnoncontiguous areas.\n  Insensitivity is also a reason underlying some of the provisions of \nthe legislation. The most recent example is the actions of the Fish and \nWildlife Service in carrying out its land grab in Guam. Rather than \ndevoting resources to the eradication of the brown tree snake, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service rushed to use the depredation caused by the snake \nas a reason for creating a refuge and overlay covering almost one-third \nof Guam. Well know habitat such as runways were covered. The reason for \nthe rush to create the refuge is understandable since several of the \nnative species are already extinct and the rest are scurrying for what \nlittle remains of their existence from the snake. If the Fish and \nWildlife Service had not moved quickly, they would have had to defend \ncreating the only refuge for non-existent species. I suppose they could \nhave used it as a precedent for creating a refuge for dinosaurs in Utah \nand locking up whatever lands the President and Secretary Babbitt \nmissed last year. In that context, I would suggest that at the next \nmeeting of the Western Governors, the Governors of Guam and Utah swap \nstories of Federal land grabs.\n\n  I am in full sympathy with the objectives of this legislation. The \nGovernor of Guam may feel that he is alone, but we in Alaska know full \nwell what dealing with Washington entails. We also must deal with \ninsensitive bureaucrats, acquisitive Secretaries, irrelevant stateside \nstandards, and a wealth of officious and fussy Federal agencies who \nseem to have as their sole mission making life as difficult, expensive, \nand complex as possible. Guam at least has a central road system and \nthe possibility of developing the southern end of the island--an option \nthat Federal managers are committed to denying Alaska. I fully \nunderstand the frustrations that led the U.S. citizens in Guam to \ndevelop this legislation. Unfortunately, I must say that the problem is \nnot the plenary authority of Congress under the Territorial Clause.\n  As I stated, this legislation is a companion measure to one \nintroduced by Congressman Underwood and I am introducing it at his \nrequest and at the request of the Governor of Guam. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of the letter be included in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I do not necessarily support every \nprovision in this legislation as drafted, but I do support the \nunderlying objective of redressing the balance of power and authority \nbetween Washington and Agana. As a result of my trip to Guam last year, \nI introduced legislation to deal with the disposal of surplus Federal \nproperty and prevent any future\n\n[[Page S11768]]\n\nland grabs such as the one engaged in by the Fish and Wildlife Service. \nThat legislation was not everything that either the Governor or I would \nhave preferred, but I think that the end result of the Senate action, \nif finally enacted, will be a significant improvement in Federal-\nterritorial relations. I intend to take the same constructive approach \nto the provisions of this legislation.\n  I appreciate that questions have been raised over some of the \nprovisions from constitutional as well as policy grounds, but that \nshould not be an excuse to avoid addressing the underlying concerns \nthat led to the drafting and approval of those provisions by the voters \nin Guam. As I said before, we have a lot of experience with foolish and \npetty restrictions from Federal agencies. As a percentage, far more of \nAlaska is subject to Federal land domination and our communities suffer \nthe consequences of an inability to obtain transportation and utility \ncorridors across the Federal lands. I have sympathy and sensitivity to \nlocal cultural concerns as well because we also see Federal agencies \ntrying to frustrate the benefits and protections afforded our Native \nAlaskans. Guam is concerned over the loss of the economic potential of \nits marine resources and Alaska holds the single most promising \npetroleum area on the continent.\n  I hope to meet shortly with the Governor and with members of the Guam \nLegislature to discuss the provisions of this legislation. I fully \nexpect that the next few years will be particularly active for our \nCommittee as we consider not only how to improve and strengthen local \nself-government in and revise Federal relations with Guam, but also \ndeal with concerns that have arisen with some of the expectations and \nimplementation of provisions of the Northern Marianas Covenant, \npolitical status in Puerto Rico, and renegotiation and extension of \ncertain provisions of the Compacts of Free Association with the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of \nMicronesia. Much has happened in the north Pacific since World War II \nand it is our responsibility to be as sensitive and responsible as \npossible to the needs and aspirations of the local governments who are \neither within or in free association with the United States. I \nencourage my colleagues to take the time to become more familiar with \nthese areas and to take their particular needs and problems into \nconsideration when crafting legislation.

A bill to clarify that unmarried adult children of \nVietnamese reeducation camp internees are eligible for refugee status \nunder the Orderly Departure Program; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n        THE ORDERLY DEPARTURE PROGRAM CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that is \nbasically a technical correction to language that I had included in the \nfiscal year 1997 Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. That \nlanguage, and the legislation I offer today, are designed to make \nhumanitarian exceptions for the unmarried adult children of former \nreeducation camp detainees seeking to emigrate to the United States \nunder the Orderly Departure Program [ODP]. Despite what I considered to \nhave been pretty unambiguous legislation in both word and intent, the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service and Department of State \ninterpreted my amendment to the 1997 bill so as to exclude the very \npeople to whom the provision was targeted.\n  An amendment identical to the bill I am introducing today was \nincluded, without objection, to the State Department authorization bill \nfor fiscal year 1998. Because that bill is hung-up over an unrelated \nissue, and because the State Department ceased accepting new \napplications for the ODP at the end of September, it was imperative \nthat another avenue be sought for attaining passage of this important \nlegislation. I wish to reiterate that this is an uncontroversial bill, \nsupported earlier this year by the Senate, and which enjoys the backing \nof the Department of State.\n  Prior to April 1995, the adult unmarried children of former \nVietnamese re-education camp prisoners were granted derivative refugee \nstatus and were permitted to accompany their parents to the United \nStates under a subprogram of the Orderly Departure Program.\n  This policy changed in April 1995. My amendment to fiscal year 1997 \nforeign operations appropriations bill, which comprises part of the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act, was intended to restore the status quo ante \nregarding the adult unmarried children of former prisoners. My comments \nin the Congressional Record from July 25, 1996, clearly spelled this \nout.\n  Unfortunately, certain categories of children who, prior to April \n1995, had received derivative refugee status and whom Congress intended \nto be covered by last year's amendment, are now considered ineligible \nto benefit from that legislation.\n  First, prior to April 1995 the widows of prisoners who died in re-\neducation camps were permitted to be resettled in the United States \nunder this subprogram of the ODP, and their unmarried adult children \nwere allowed to accompany them. These children are now considered \nineligible to benefit from last year's legislation.\n  To ask these widows to come to the United States without their \nchildren is equal to denying them entry under the program. Many of \nthese women are elderly and in poor health, and the presence of their \nchildren is essential to providing the semblance of a family unit with \nthe care that includes.\n  The second problem stemming from INS and the State Department's \ninterpretation of the 1997 language involves the roughly 20 percent of \nformer Vietnamese re-education camp prisoners resettled in the United \nStates who were processed as immigrants, at the convenience of the \nUnited States Government.\n  Their unmarried adult children, prior to April 1995, were still given \nderivative refugee status; however, the position of INS and State is \nthat these children are now ineligible because the language in the \nfiscal year 1997 bill included the phrase ``processed as refugees for \nresettlement in the United States.''\n  That phrase was intended to identify the children of former prisoners \nbeing brought to the United States under the subprogram of the ODP and \neligible to be processed as a refugee--which all clearly were--as \ndistinct from the children of former prisoners who were not being \nprocessed for resettlement in the United States.\n  The fact that a former prisoner, eligible to be processed as a \nrefugee under the ODP subprogram, was processed as an immigrant had no \neffect prior to April 1995, and their children were granted refugee \nstatus. The intention of last year s legislation was to restore the \nstatus quo ante, including for the unmarried adult children of former \nprisoners eligible for and included in this subprogram but resettled as \nmigrants.\n  Mr. President, I urge support for this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11769]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote energy conservation investments in Federal \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                  the federal energy bank act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KOHL.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation entitled ``the \nFederal Energy Bank Act.'' The purpose of this legislation is to \nprovide a stable long-term source of funding for energy efficiency \nprojects throughout the Federal Government. If we are to start the \nNation on the road toward increased energy conservation we must begin \nwith the Federal Government. This bill will help provide the necessary \ninvestments to make this first step toward long-term energy \nconservation possible.\n  I have long believed that our Nation must implement a sensible \nnational energy policy which emphasizes greater energy conservation and \nefficiency, as well as the development of renewable resources. This \nbill is just one step of many that need to be taken to reduce our \nenergy consumption problems. The events in the Middle East, coupled \nwith the environmental problems associated with the use of fossil \nfuels, have only increased the need for improved energy conservation. \nSimply put, we cannot continue to rely on imported oil to meet such a \nlarge part of our Nation's energy needs. This dependence places our \neconomic security at great risk. At present, petroleum imports account \nfor fully one-half of our trade deficit. In addition, the use of oil \nand other fossil fuels contributes to global climate change, air \npollution, and acid rain.\n  Mr. President our attempts to remedy this situation are nothing new. \nIn fact, the laws requiring significant energy use reductions are \nalready in place. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 mandated that Federal \nagencies use cost-effective measures, with less than a 10-year payback, \nto reduce energy consumption in their facilities by 20 percent by the \nyear 2000 compared to 1985 levels. President Clinton, with Executive \nOrder 12902, extended the mandate by requiring Federal agencies to \nreduce energy consumption by 30 percent by the year 2005 compared to \n1985 energy uses. If accomplished, this would save the American \ntaxpayer millions in annual energy costs and in turn put us on the road \nto future energy savings. This would also improve our environment, our \nbalance of trade, and our national security.\n  But the road toward energy efficiency or even self-sufficiency is not \nan easy one and requires capital investment. The administration and \nCongress must back their policies with real dollars for investment in \nenergy efficiency projects. According to the recent Federal energy \nefficiency and water conservation study, drafted by the Department of \nEnergy, an investment of $5.7 billion is required through 1996 to 2005 \nto meet National Energy Policy and Conservation Act and Executive order \ngoals. The best estimate of the total funding available has resulted in \na shortfall of $2 billion. Without significant funding the goals as set \nforth by the President will not be met. Laws and mandates alone will \nnot solve our energy problems. It requires long-term capital \ninvestment.\n  Mr. President, my business background has taught me that most large \npaybacks come from positive long-term investments. Unfortunately, the \nFederal Government does not traditionally take this approach. More \noften that not, it seeks short-term savings and cuts which do not \naddress the problem of energy consumption or encourage future energy \nconservation.\n  Mr. President, my bill will help address this funding shortfall. The \nbill creates a bank to fund the purchase of energy efficiency projects \nby Federal agencies and in the long run will reduce the overall amount \nof money spent on energy consumption by the Federal Government. For \neach of the fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, each Federal agency will \ncontribute an amount equal to 5 percent of its previous year's utility \ncosts into a fund or bank managed by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The Secretary of Energy will authorize loans from the bank to any \nFederal agency for use toward investment in energy efficiency projects. \nThe agency will then repay the loan, making the bank self-supporting \nafter a few years. The Secretary of Energy will also establish \nselection criteria for each energy efficiency project, determining the \nproject is cost-effective and produces a payback in 3 years or less. \nAgencies will be required to report the progress of each project with a \ncost of more than $1 million to the Secretary 1 year after \ninstallation. The Secretary will then report to Congress each year on \nall the operations of the bank.\n  Mr. President, this bill will provide the real dollars required to \nmake the Executive order goals a reality. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has projected a 5-year savings for the bill at $3 million. Our \nenergy savings will be even greater over the long term.\n  Mr. President, in closing I would like to thank Johnson Controls, the \nlargest public company in Wisconsin, for their continued leadership and \ninput on this bill. As a maker of energy conservation systems, Johnson \nhas provided me with the real world insights that have helped me draft \na bill that attempts to address our energy conservation needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the full text of the bill be \nprinted in full in the Record. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill and will push for its early enactment.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1375\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] as an original \nco-sponsor of the Federal Energy Bank Act.\n  The idea of the Federal Government leading by example in the area of \nenergy efficiency has made sense to me for a long time, so much so, in \nfact, that in campaigning for the Senate in 1992, I included energy \nefficiency in my campaign platform. I proposed an 82-point plan to \nreduce the deficit, a series of specific spending reductions and \nrevenue changes which, if enacted in sum total, would have eliminated \nthe deficit.\n  Among those items, as I was a candidate for office after the passage \nof the 1992 Energy Policy Act and after the United States' signing of \nthe Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, \nwas one to encourage the Federal Government to implement a \ncomprehensive energy savings program for the Federal Government through \nenergy efficiency investments.\n  After all, I believe that if Wisconsin consumers and business have \nbeen converted to the wisdom of compact fluorescent light bulbs, \nefficient heating and cooling systems, weatherization, and energy \nsaving computers, among the wide range of potential efficiency \nimprovements, that the Federal Government promoting those actions \nshould also make the same investments to the taxpayers' benefit.\n  Section 152 of the Energy Policy Act mandated that Federal agencies \nuse all cost-effective measures that could be implemented with less \nthan a 10-year payback to reduce energy consumption in their facilities \nby 20 percent by the year 2000 compared to 1985 consumption levels.\n  On March 8, 1994, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12902. \nThis order was an even more aggressive mandate to improve energy \nefficiency in Federal buildings nationwide by requiring agencies to use \ncost-effective measures to reduce energy use by fiscal year 2005 by 30 \npercent compared with the agency's 1985 energy use.\n  After taking office, I have learned that among the most significant \nconstraints to implementing more energy efficient practices in the \nFederal Government is the lack of sufficient funds to invest in energy \nefficient equipment.\n  Section 162 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the Secretary \nof Energy to conduct a detailed study of options for financing energy \nand water conservation measures in Federal facilities as required under \nthe act and by subsequent Executive orders. On June 3, 1997, the \nSecretary of Energy, Mr. Pena released that study. It documents a need \nfor a $5.7 billion financial investment between 1996 and 2005 to meet \nthe Energy Policy Act and Executive order goals, a value which could \nvary from a low of $4.4 billion to a high of $7.1 billion given \nvariability in both energy and water investment requirements.\n  The best estimate, according to the same study of the total Federal \nfunding available to spend on energy and water efficiency improvements \nfrom various sources, including direct agency appropriations, energy \nsavings performance contracts, and utility demand-side management \nprograms, and appropriations to the Federal energy efficiency fund, to \nthe Federal Government to meet those needs over the same time period is \n$3.7 billion. Thus, under DOE's best estimate, at the Federal level we \nface a potential shortfall of funds necessary to achieve our Federal \nenergy and water conservation objectives of $2 billion.\n\n[[Page S11771]]\n\n  In order to address this shortfall, I am pleased joining as a \ncosponsor of this legislation to create a Federal energy revolving fund \nor ``energy bank.''\n  Some in this body may be concerned that the existence of the current \nFederal energy efficiency fund alleviates the need for additional \nFederal conservation investment. The problem with the current fund, \nwhich operates as a grant program for agencies to make efficiency \nimprovements, is that it does not contribute to the replenishment of \ncapital resources because it does not have to be paid back and is \ntherefore dependent upon appropriations.\n  Under the legislation, I join in co-sponsoring with my colleague from \nWisconsin today, Federal agencies will be required, in fiscal years \n1998-2000, to deposit an amount equal to 5 percent of their total \nutility payments in the proceeding fiscal year to capitalize the fund. \nAfter 2000, the Secretary of Energy will determine an amount necessary \nto ensure that the fund meets its obligations.\n  Agencies will then be able to get a loan from the fund to finance \nefficiency projects, which they will be responsible for repaying with \ninterest. The projects must use off-the-shelf technologies and must be \ncost effective.\n  The best part of this approach is that the technologies are required \nto have a 3-year pay back period, and, therefore, this legislation \nachieves some modest savings for the taxpayer. CBO scores this measure \nas saving $3 million over 5 years.\n  In addition to savings for the taxpayer, I am also pleased to assist \nthe Federal Government in advancing what I believe to be an important \npart of our overall strategy to combat greenhouse gas emissions. As \nmany in the body are aware, President Clinton announced his plan for \nmeeting the challenge of global climate change on October 22, 1997, in \npreparation for negotiating meetings in Bonn, Germany on a new protocol \nto the Climate Convention. Among the items the President cited was the \nneed to do more in the area of federal energy management. Aggressive \nenergy management can reduce carbon emissions from the activities of \nthe Federal Government, which, the President indicated, has the \nNation's largest energy bill at almost $8 billion per year. The \nPresident specifically stated that there is a need to improve federal \nprocurement of energy efficient technologies, and this measure is a \npositive, proactive measure to ensure that federal agencies \nspecifically set aside funds to achieve this goal. The senior Senator \nfrom Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] and I look forward to working with the \nadministration to advance this legislation as a piece of the country's \noverall greenhouse gas reductions strategy.\n  In conclusion, I look forward to working with my senior Senator on \nthis issue. I believe that this is a unique opportunity for Senate \ncolleagues to support legislation that is both fiscally responsible and \nenvironmentally sound.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1376. A bill to increase the Federal medical assistance percentage \nfor Hawaii to 59.8 percent; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nthe hawaii federal medical assistance percentage adjustment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nadjust the Federal medical assistance percentage [FMAP] rate for Hawaii \nto reflect more fairly the State's ability to bear its share of \nMedicaid payments. I am pleased that my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Hawaii, Senator Inouye, has joined me as a sponsor of this \nmeasure.\n\n  The Federal share of Medicaid payments varies depending on each \nState's ability to pay--wealthier States bear a larger share of the \ncost of the program, and thus have lower FMAP rates. Per capita income \nis used as the measure of State wealth. Because per capita income in \nHawaii is quite high, the State's FMAP rate is at the lowest level--50 \npercent. Hawaii is one of only a dozen States whose FMAP rate is at the \n50 percent level. My bill would increase Hawaii's FMAP rate from 50 \npercent to 59.8 percent.\n  Because of our geographic location and other factors, the cost of \nliving in Hawaii greatly exceeds the cost of living in the mainland \nStates. Per capita income is a poor measure of a State's relative \nability to bear the cost of Medicaid services. An excellent analysis of \nthis issue is included in the 21st edition of ``The Federal Budget and \nthe States'', a joint study conducted by the Taubman Center for State \nand local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment and the office of U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. \nAccording to the study, if per capita income is measured in real terms, \nHawaii ranks 47th at $19,755 compared to the national average of \n$24,231. This sheds a totally different light on the State's financial \nstatus.\n  The cost of living in Honolulu is 83 percent higher than the average \nof the metropolitan areas tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau, based on \n1995 data. Recent studies have shown that for the State as a whole, the \ncost of living is more than one-third higher than the rest of the U.S. \nIn fact, Hawaii's Cost of Living Index ranks it as the highest in the \ncountry. Some government programs take the high cost of living in \nHawaii into account and funding is adjusted accordingly. These include \nMedicare prospective payment rates, food stamp allocations, school \nlunch programs, housing insurance limits, and military living expenses.\n  These examples reflect the recognition that the higher cost of living \nin noncontiguous States should be taken into account in fashioning \ngovernment program policies. It is time for similar recognition of this \nfactor in gauging Hawaii's ability to support its health care \nprograms. During consideration of the Balanced Budget Act this past \nsummer, the Senate included a provision increasing Alaska's FMAP rate \nto 59.8 percent for the next 3 years. Setting a higher match rate as \nwas done for Alaska would still leave Hawaii with a lower FMAP rate \nthan a majority of the States, but would better recognize Hawaii's \nability to pay its fair share of the costs of the Medicaid program.\n\n  Despite the high cost of living, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds \nthat Hawaii also has one of the highest poverty rates in the Nation. \nThe State's 16.9 percent poverty rate is ranked eighth in the country, \ncompared to the national average of 14.7 percent. These higher cost \nlevels are reflected in State government expenditures and State \ntaxation. Thus, on a per capita basis State revenue and expenditures \nare far higher in Hawaii, as well as Alaska, than in the 48 mainland \nStates. The higher expenditure levels are necessary to assure an \nadequate level of public services which are more costly to provide in \nthese States.\n  Of the top 10 States with the highest poverty rates in the country, \nthe Harvard-Moynihan study finds that only 3 others have an FMAP rate \nbetween 50-60 percent. The other six States have FMAP rates of 65 \npercent and higher. Even more astonishing is that of the top 10 States \nwith the lowest real per capita income, only Hawaii has a 50-percent \nFMAP rate.\n  To bring equity to this situation, Hawaii has sought an increase in \nits FMAP rate over the past several years. Just as we did for Alaska \nthis past summer, Hawaii should be included in this long-warranted \nchange, as the same factors justifying an increase for Alaska apply to \nHawaii. Recognition of this point was made by House and Senate \nconferees to the Balanced Budget Act. The conferees, on page 879 of the \nconference report, note that poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii \nare different than those for the rest of the Nation, yet there is no \nvariation from the national calculation in the FMAP. The conferees \ncorrectly noted that comparable adjustments are generally made for \nAlaska and Hawaii.\n  The case for an FMAP increase is especially compelling in Hawaii, \nwhich has a proud history of providing essential health services in an \ninnovative and cost-effective manner. That commitment is not easy to \nfulfill. Unlike most States, for example, Hawaii's Aid to Families with \nDependent Children/ Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [AFDC/TANF] \ncaseloads have been increasing dramatically. In Hawaii, our caseload \nhas risen by 21 percent since 1994 compared to a national decline of 23 \npercent during this same period. Since TANF block grants are based on\n\n[[Page S11772]]\n\nhistorical spending levels, the increased demand has placed extreme \npressure on State resources.\n\n  Hawaii has sought to maintain a social safety net while striving for \nmore efficient delivery of government services. The most striking \nexample is the QUEST Medical Assistance Program, which operates under a \nFederal waiver. QUEST has brought managed care and broader coverage to \nthe State's otherwise uninsured populations. At the same time, Hawaii \nis the only State whose employers guarantee health care coverage to \nevery full-time employee, a further example of Hawaii's commitment to a \nstrong social support system.\n  There is a particularly strong need for a more suitable FMAP rate for \nHawaii now. The State has not participated in the economic growth that \nhas benefitted most of the rest of the Nation. Hawaii's unemployment \nrate is above the national average and State tax revenues have fallen \nshort of projected estimates. The need to fund 50 percent of the cost \nof the Medicaid program puts an increasing strain on the State's \nresources.\n  For all of these reasons, the FMAP rates for Hawaii should be \nadjusted to reflect more equitably the State's ability to support the \nMedicaid program. This will assure that the special problem of the \nnoncontiguous States is dealt with in a principled manner. I believe it \nis also important to point out that based on Hawaii's current Medicaid \nspending level of approximately $700 million, each percentage point \nincrease in our FMAP rate would provide approximately $7 million \nannually in additional Federal funds. Thus, the cost of enhancing the \nState's FMAP rate would be relatively modest.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support an upward adjustment in \nHawaii's Federal medical assistance percentage.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. INCREASED FMAP FOR HAWAII.\n\n       (a) Increased FMAP.--The first sentence of section 1905(b) \n     of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396d(b)), as amended \n     by section 4725 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (Public \n     Law 105-33; 111 Stat. 418), is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and (3)'' and inserting ``, (3)''; and\n       (2) by inserting before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, and (4) for purposes of this title and title \n     XXI, the Federal medical assistance percentage for Hawaii \n     shall be 59.8 percent''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to--\n       (1) items and services furnished on or after October 1, \n     1997, under--\n       (A) a State plan or under a waiver of such plan under title \n     XIX; and\n       (B) a State child health plan under title XXI of such Act;\n       (2) payments made on a capitation or other risk-basis for \n     coverage occurring under plans under such titles on or after \n     such date; and\n       (3) payments attributable to DSH allotments for Hawaii \n     determined under section 1923(f) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396r-4(f)) for fiscal years beginning with fiscal year 1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Hatch, Mr. D'Amato, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Shelby, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1379. A bill to amend section 552 of title 5, United States Code, \nand the National Security Act of 1947 to require disclosure under the \nFreedom of Information Act regarding certain persons, disclose Nazi war \ncriminal records without impairing any investigation or prosecution \nconducted by the Department of Justice or certain intelligence matters, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   The Nazi war crimes disclosure act\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators, led by my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, to \nintroduce the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. Passage of this \nlegislation will lift the last remaining veils of secrecy on one of the \ndarkest periods in human history.\n  the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act represents what I hope will be the \nculmination of work begun in the last Congress to release U.S. \nGovernment-held records of Nazi war criminals, the Nazi Holocaust, and \nthe trafficking of Nazi-held assets.\n  Just 2 years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of \nthe Second World War, and with it, the Nazis' death grip on an entire \ncontinent. Since that time, searingly detailed accounts of the Nazi \nHolocaust have come to our attention.\n  We have learned so much. Yet, if the last few years are any \nindication, we still have so much more to learn.\n  After the fall of Communist rule, Russia and several former Soviet-\nbloc nations opened volumes of secret files on Nazi war crimes. \nArgentina has cooperated in the public release of its files. British \nGovernment records are being declassified and made available for public \nscrutiny. And over the past year, Swiss banks and the Swiss Government \nhave been under intense international pressure to make a full \naccounting of unclaimed funds belonging to Holocaust victims, as well \nas Nazi assets that may have once belonged to Holocaust victims.\n  Mr. President, here at home, our own Government has been gradually \nmaking records available about what it knew of Nazi-related activities \nand atrocities. Earlier this year, a Government-conducted study \nrevealed new information about what the U.S. Government knew regarding \nthe transfer and flow of funds held by Nazi officials. This report \nfound that the U.S. Government was aware that the Nazi mint took gold \nstolen from European central banks and melted it together with gold \nobtained in horrible fashion--from tooth-fillings, wedding bands and \nother items seized from death camp victims. Last Sunday's New York \nTimes detailed newly released Government documents that described how \nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York had melted down and recast \nhundreds of Nazi-held gold bars. According to the released records, the \nU.S. Government knew that a good portion of this gold had been looted \nfrom the Netherlands and Belgium. It is not known if any of these bars \ncontained gold from Holocaust victims, or to what extent the U.S. \nGovernment knew it.\n  Mr. President, earlier today, at a press conference to announce the \nintroduction of this legislation, I had on display several aerial U.S. \nintelligence photographs taken in 1944. The pictures were of Auschwitz, \nwith prisoners being led to the gas chambers. These pictures were \ndiscovered by photo analysts from the Central Intelligence Agency in \n1978. They confirm what we had heard from the Polish underground that a \ndeath camp did in fact exist at Auschwitz. They also demonstrated that \nour Government had photographs of these camps as these atrocities were \noccurring.\n  These pictures tell a grisly story. How many more exist? With our \nlegislation, we intend to answer that question.\n  So, the fact is, the dark tragedy of the Nazi Holocaust, which ended \nmore than 60 years ago, has been unfolding long after these tragic \nevents occurred and is still unfolding with each new release of \ninformation.\n  Both Congress and the President have taken action to promote the \nrelease of Government-held records during this tragic era. On April 17, \n1995, the President issued an Executive order calling for the release \nof national security data and information older than 25 years. Last \nyear, thanks to the tireless efforts of my friend from New York, \nSenator Moynihan and Representative Carolyn Maloney and several others, \nCongress passed a sense-of-the-Congress resolution, which stated that \nany U.S. Government agencies should make public any records in its \npossession about individuals who are alleged to have committed Nazi war \ncrimes. The President agreed, noting that learning the remaining \nsecrets about the Holocaust are in the clear public interest.\n\n  The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act is designed to put the concerns \nexpressed by the last Congress into strong action. What our bill would \ndo is amend the Freedom of Information Act to establish a presumption \nthat Nazi war criminal records are to be made available to the public. \nThis means that all materials would be required to be released in their \nentirety unless a Federal agency head concludes\n\n[[Page S11773]]\n\nthat the release of all or part of these records would compromise \nprivacy or national security interests. The agency head must notify \nCongress of any determination to not release records.\n  To facilitate this process, the bill would establish the Nazi War \nCriminal Records Interagency Working Group. This working group would to \nthe greatest extent possible locate, identify, inventory, declassify, \nand make available for the public all Nazi war records held by the \nUnited States.\n  This pro-active search is necessary because a full Government search \nand inventory has never been completed. For example, some documents \nthat surfaced this spring were found in holdings related to Southeast \nAsia.\n  Our bill would be targeted toward two classes of Nazi-related \nmaterials: First, war crimes information regarding Nazi persecutions; \nand second, any information related to transactions involving assets of \nHolocaust and other Nazi victims.\n  In summary, what we are trying to do with this bill is strike a clear \nbalance between our Government's legitimate privacy and national \nsecurity interests and the people's desire to know the truth about Nazi \natrocities. These records, once released, will be held in a repository \nat the National Archives.\n  This bill is a bipartisan effort to ensure the Federal Government has \ndone all it can to ensure Holocaust victims and their families can \nobtain the answers they need.\n  Again, this bill is the culmination of years of tireless work by a \nnumber of leaders. First, I want to pay special tribute to the Senators \nfrom New York--both have worked tirelessly on Holocaust related \nlegislation for years. Senator Moynihan has been a leader in the drive \nto declassify U.S. Government records and a well-respected historian. \nHe championed the release of the so-called VENONA cables that confirmed \nthat the Soviet Union had an active spy network that had penetrated our \nGovernment. I am pleased to be working with Senator Moynihan on a \nsimilar endeavor--the cataloging and declassification of as many World \nWar II documents on the Holocaust as possible.\n  Senator D'Amato has worked to make public scores of Swiss bank \nrecords and lost accounts of Holocaust victims. His efforts inspired us \nto redraft our legislation to ensure the Federal Government releases \nrecords related to the trafficking of Nazi-held assets.\n  This bill has the support of the chairmen of the Judiciary and \nIntelligence Committees--respectively, my friend from Utah, Senator \nHatch, and my friend from Alabama, Senator Shelby.\n  Mr. President, I also would be remiss if I did not mention my friend \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, who serves with me on the Antitrust \nSubcommittee on the Judiciary Committee. He has brought insight on this \nissue that none of us has.\n  Together, with this kind of bipartisan support, I am hopeful we can \nmove this legislation quickly through Congress and to the President \nearly next year. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I intend to \nmake this a priority issue--so that people from my State and across our \nNation can have access to the most complete inventory of U.S. \nGovernment records on the Holocaust. The clock is running, and time is \nrunning out for so many victims of the Holocaust. They, and history \nitself, deserve to know as much as possible about this tragic chapter \nin the story of humanity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1379\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today we introduce a revised War Crimes \nDisclosure Act which Senators D'Amato, Dodd and I originally sponsored \nin the 104th Congress as a companion to a measure introduced by \nRepresentative Maloney.\n  The measure is a simple one. It requires the disclosure of \ninformation under the Freedom of Information Act regarding individuals \nwho participated in Nazi war crimes. This bill, which Senator DeWine \nhas carefully crafted, builds on our original measure by expanding its \nscope to include information regarding stolen assets of the victims of \nNazi war crimes, and by requiring a Governmentwide search of records to \nensure the release of as many relevant documents as possible. A similar \nsearch for information regarding Nazi assets was recently conducted \nunder the direction of Stuart Eizenstat, with significant results.\n  Ideally, documents regarding Nazi war crimes would be made available \nto the public without further legislation and without having to go \nthrough the slow process involved in getting information through the \nFreedom of Information Act [FOIA]. Unfortunately, this is not the case. \nResearchers seeking information on Nazi war criminals are denied access \nto relevant materials in the possession of the United States \nGovernment, even when the disclosure of these documents no longer poses \na threat to national security--if indeed such disclosure ever did.\n  Perhaps the most important provision contained in the legislation is \nthe balancing test. This requires that ``there shall be a presumption \nthat the public interest in the release of Nazi war criminal records \noutweighs the damage to national security that might reasonably be \nexpected to result from disclosure.'' The provision is in keeping with \nthe report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government \nSecrecy which recommended that such a balancing test be applied in all \nclassification decisions.\n  The Commission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy was the \nsecond statutory examination of Government secrecy. I was honored to \nChair the Commission; Representative Combest served as vice-chairman. \nAlso serving on the Commission were John Deutch, Martin Faga, John \nPodesta, and Samuel Huntington. We presented our report to the \nPresident in March, and the congressional members of the Commission \nintroduced legislation to implement the recommendations of the \nCommission in May.\n  We have welcomed the many editorials and feature articles supporting \nour efforts as, in the words of the Sacramento Bee, a ``sensible, much-\nneeded proposal for reforming runaway classification of secrets by the \nfederal government.'' And Albany's Times Union assessment that our bill \nrepresents a ``bipartisan effort * * * to make more government \ndocuments accessible to the public and, in the process, make government \nmore accountable.''\n  Our's is a report that, I believe, sets out a new framework for how \nto think about Government secrecy. Beginning with the concept that \nsecrecy should be understood as a form of Government regulation. In the \nwords of the German sociologist Max Weber, writing some eight decades \nago:\n\n       Every bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of the \n     professionally informed by keeping their knowledge and \n     intentions secret. Bureaucratic administration always tends \n     to be an administration of ``secret sessions''; in so far as \n     it can, it hides its knowledge and action from criticism.\n       The pure interest of the bureaucracy in power, however, is \n     efficacious far beyond those areas where purely functional \n     interests make for secrecy. The concept of the ``official \n     secret'' is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and \n     nothing is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this \n     attitude, which cannot be substantially defended beyond these \n     specifically qualified areas.\n\n  What we traditionally think of in this country as regulation concerns \nhow citizens are to behave. Whereas public regulation involves what the \ncitizen may do, secrecy concerns what that citizen may know. And the \ncitizen does not know what may not be known. As our Commission stated: \n``Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in other \nareas. What is different with secrecy is that the public cannot know \nthe extent or the content of the regulation.''\n  Thus, secrecy in the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does \nnot even know that he or she is being regulated. It is a parallel \nregulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it \nmalfunctions. In our democracy, where the free exchange of ideas is so \nessential, it can be suffocating.\n  We must develop what might be termed a competing ``culture of \nopenness'' fully consistent with our interests in protecting national \nsecurity, but in which power and authority are no longer derived \nprimarily from one's ability to withhold information from others in \nGovernment and the public at large.\n  The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act is in keeping with the work of the \nCommission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. With the \npassing of time it becomes ever more important to document Nazi war \ncrimes, lest the enormity of those crimes be lost to history. The \ngreater access which this legislation provides will add clarity to this \nimportant effort. I applaud those researchers who continue to pursue \nthis important work.\n  I would like to thank Representative Maloney for her original work on \nthis subject in the House of Representatives and I would also thank \nSenator DeWine for joining me in this effort here in the Senate.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. I want to thank Senator DeWine and \ncommend him for taking the lead on this important issue.\n  This bill demonstrates America's commitment to the same historical \nhonesty that we are demanding of Switzerland and other countries only \nnow facing their role in the atrocities of World War II. It is not \nenough for us to talk about disclosure by others. We need to practice \nit too. If there are secrets relating to the presence of Nazi war \ncriminals in the United States, or\n\n[[Page S11775]]\n\nif there is information that will be helpful in identifying assets of \nHolocaust victims, or even evidence of other governments collaborating \nwith the Nazis, let's open these files and reveal these secrets before \nan entire generation of survivors is gone.\n  This bill creates a presumption in favor of the public interest in \nlearning all there is to learn about Nazi war crimes and requires a \nproactive searching of Government files for relevant documents. We have \nan obligation to find this information and to disseminate it. Although \nthe Holocaust happened more than 50 years ago, we are now seeing \ncountries and individuals caught up in the maelstrom of World War II \ngrappling with this difficult past. Much of the debate on these issues \nhas been triggered by recently released information from Government and \nother archives.\n  For survivors, there is no legislation that can erase the suffering \nthey endured at the hands of the Nazis. As we go about our day-to-day \nbusiness, it is easy to forget the horrific details of what happened in \nEurope: the gruesome torture and deaths, the systematic extermination \nof people. However, for those of us who were directly touched by the \nHolocaust, history is very real. I grew up in the shadow of this \ntragedy. When I was a child, my family worried daily about family \nmembers left behind in Europe during the war. We constantly discussed \nwhat was or wasn't happening, and when the truth finally emerged, and \nall Americans realized the extent of the tragedy, it touched us even \nmore.\n\n  It is only natural for American survivors and their families to \nexpect the American Government to be as forthcoming as possible. \nAlthough many survivors have gone on to live productive lives here in \nthe United States, and around the world, they can never forget. Nor \nshould we.\n  Many emerging democracies are now facing their pasts--through truth \ncommissions and the like. It is tempting to want to look forward and to \nforget events of long ago. But for these fragile democracies, reckoning \nwith the past is the key to ensuring a secure future. We too must \nrecognize that the openness prescribed by this legislation only makes \nour democracy stronger.\n  This legislation maintains protections for individuals from the \nunwarranted invasion of their personal privacy, and it continues to \nprovide exceptions for the most urgent national security and foreign \npolicy interests. The difference between this bill and existing FOIA \nprotections is that this bill firmly sets into law the public's right \nto know about Nazi war crimes and the disposition of Nazi assets, and \nif there is information that agencies insist on keeping secret, the \nrelevant congressional committees must be informed. This will give us \nthe opportunity to determine whether information dating so far back \nshould remain classified. Finally, the bill provides that if an agency \nhead exercises his or her authority to block the release of \ninformation, the decision is subject to judicial review.\n  It is difficult to imagine what knowledge would be subject to these \nprotections so many years after the fact. Yes, there may be information \nwhich makes us feel uncomfortable. There is already information about \nthe extent to which the U.S. Government knew about what was going on \nduring the war in the Nazi death camps. We must not be afraid of what \nwe may learn. The only ones who need fear are the perpetrators of these \nvicious acts who have escaped scrutiny until now, for there are still \nNazi war criminals at large in this country and abroad. Armed with new \ninformation, much like the information which may be available in our \nown files, courts around the world are compelling them to answer for \ntheir despicable acts.\n  This legislation is targeted to information solely related to Nazi \nwar crimes and to transactions involving Nazi victims, yet it sets an \nimportant precedent in codifying a more narrow set of privacy and \nnational security exceptions for the release of Government information \nthrough the Freedom of Information Act. These exceptions are based on \nExecutive Order 12958 which set the criteria for the release of \ninformation more than 25 years old. Unfortunately, we still have a long \nway to go in ensuring that this more open standard is uniformly applied \nto the release of Government information.\n  I am pleased that Senator Moynihan is one of the lead sponsors of \nthis bill because he has been such an eloquent spokesman against \nexcessive secrecy. His work with the Commission on Protecting and \nReducing Government Secrecy is truly commendable and I am pleased that \nthis legislation is consistent with the findings of the Commission. \nBeyond shedding light on a difficult chapter in the history of \nhumanity, this legislation can help foster a greater openness in the \nhandling of Government information.\n  If we succeed, we will have left a legacy of which we can all be \nproud.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COATS (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. D'Amato, and Mr. \n        Kerrey):\n  S. 1380. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 regarding charter schools; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                the charter school expansion act of 1997\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my good friend, \nSenator Lieberman, in introducing another bill which has as its primary \naim the expansion of educational opportunities for children. Senator \nLieberman has been a leader in promoting educational alternatives, and \nhis efforts in the charter school movement have contributed to the \ntremendous growth in the number of charter schools since 1994. I \ncommend him for his work in this area and am honored to join him in \nintroducing the Charter School Expansion Act of 1997.\n  This bill builds on the great success of the original charter school \nlegislation which Senator Lieberman introduced in 1994. The Federal \nCharter School Grant Program provided seed money to charter school \noperators to help them cover the startup costs of beginning a charter \nschool. In the last 3 years, the number of charter schools in operation \naround the country has tripled, with more than 700 charter schools now \nin 23 States.\n  The purpose of this bill is to further encourage the growth of high-\nquality charter schools around the country.\n  This bill provides incentives to encourage States to increase the \nnumber of charter schools in their State. The bill also tightens the \neligibility definitions to better direct funds to those States who are \ncommitted to developing strong charter schools.\n  To ensure that charter schools have enough funding to continue once \ntheir doors are opened, this bill provides that charter schools get \ntheir fair share of Federal programs for which they are eligible, such \nas title 1 and IDEA.\n  This bill also increases the financing options available to charter \nschools and allows them to utilize funds from the title VI block grant \nprogram for startup costs.\n  And finally, the Secretary of Education and each State education \nagency is directed to inform every school district about the charter \nschool option so that this educational alternative will be an option \nfor any parent who is interested.\n\n\n                       what are charter schools?\n\n  Charter schools are independent public schools that have been freed \nfrom onerous bureaucratic and regulatory burdens and able to design and \ndeliver educational programs tailored to meet the needs of their \nstudents and their communities.\n  The individualized education available to students through charter \nschools makes this a very desirable educational alternative. Charter \nschools give families an opportunity to choose the educational setting \nthat best meet their child's needs. For many low-income families in \nparticular, charter schools provide their first opportunity to select \neducational setting which is best for their child.\n  These innovative charter schools are having tremendous academic \nsuccess serving the same population of students who are struggling in \nmore traditional public school settings. Several recent studies have \nhighlighted the success of charter schools around the country in \nserving at-risk students. A study conducted by the Hudson Institute \nfound dramatic improvement for minority and low income students who had \nbeen failing in their previous school. These students are flourishing \nin the smaller, challenging environments found in charter schools.\n  With results like these, it is no wonder that some of the strongest \nsupport\n\n[[Page S11776]]\n\nfor charter legislation comes from low-income families. Low-income \nfamilies not only have real educational choices, but are actually \nneeded in the charter school environment for everything from \nvolunteering, to coaching, for fundraising, and even teaching. This \ndirect involvement of families is helping to build small communities \ncentered around the school.\n  Charter schools can be started by anyone interested in providing a \nquality education: Parents, teachers, school administrators, community \ngroups, businesses, and colleges can all apply for a charter. And, \nimportantly, if these schools fail to deliver a high-quality education, \nthey will be closed--either through a district or State's \naccountability measures or due to lack of customers. Accountability is \nliterally built in to the charter school process--a school's charter \nmust be complied with and unhappy parents and students can leave if \nthey are not satisfied.\n  In addition to the positive impact on the charter's students and \ntheir families, the overall charter movement is serving as a catalyst \nfor change in the public schools. A foundational principle of the \ncharter concept is that fair competition can stimulate improvement. And \nimprovement in public schools has been spurred around the country due \nto the rapid growth of charter schools.\n\n  Recently, several studies have been released highlighting some of the \nsuccess of charter schools around the country. In May, the Department \nof Education released its first formal report on its study of charter \nschools. Key first-year findings include:\n  The two most common reasons for starting public charter schools are \nflexibility from bureaucratic laws and regulations and the chance to \nrealize an educational vision.\n  In most States, charter schools have a racial composition similar to \nstatewide averages or have a higher proportion of minority students.\n  Charter schools enroll roughly the same proportion of low income \nstudents, on average, as other public schools.\n  Over the last 2 years, the Hudson Institute has undertaken its own \nstudy of charter schools, entitled ``Charter Schools in Action.'' Their \nresearch team traveled to 14 States, visited 60 schools, and surveyed \nthousands of parents, teachers, and students.\n  Some of this study's key findings include:\n  Three-fifths of charter school students report that their charter \nschool teachers are better than their previous school's teacher.\n  Over two-thirds of parents say their charter school is better than \ntheir child's previous schools with respect to class size, school size, \nand individual attention.\n  Over 90 percent of teachers are satisfied with their charter school's \neducational philosophy, size, fellow teachers, and students.\n  Among students who said they were failing at their previous school, \nmore than half are now doing excellent or good work. These gains were \ndramatic for minority and low-income youngsters, and were confirmed by \ntheir parents.\n  The example of these schools point to important ways to improve and \nreinvent public education as a whole. The implications from the success \nof charter schools indicate that successful public schools should be \nconsumer-oriented, diverse, results-oriented, and professional places \nthat also function as mediating institutions in their communities.\n  The tremendous success of charter schools in the last 6 years gives \nme great hope for the success of overall education reform. The more \nthan 700 charter schools in this country that have sprung up in such a \nshort period of time provide solid evidence that parents are interested \nin improving their children's educational opportunities and they will \ndo whatever it takes.\n  With the introduction of this bill, the Charter School Expansion Act, \nSenator Lieberman and I hope to send a signal to parents all across \nthis country that they are not alone in their struggle to improve \neducation for their children. We hope to ease their struggle by \nenabling new charter schools to be developed. More charter schools will \nresult in greater accountability, broader flexibility for classroom \ninnovation, and ultimately more choice in public education. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill and to increase educational \nopportunities for all children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1380\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend and \npartner Senator Coats in introducing legislation that would speed the \nprogress of what is arguably the most promising engine of education \nreform in America today, the charter school movement.\n  Before discussing the legislation itself, I think it's important to \ntalk first about the context in which it is being introduced and the \nongoing debates here in Congress over how best to improve our public \nschools and expand educational opportunities for all students. In \nlistening to much of the back and forth recently, particularly about \nefforts to promote a limited school choice program, it seems that too \noften these battles are being waged, in the words of the great John \nGardner, between uncritical lovers and unloving critics, those who \nwould defend the status quo in public education at all costs and those \nwho would attack it at the drop of a hat, with neither side doing much \nlistening.\n  Making matters worse, the uncritical lovers have helped reduce this \nchallenging, vitally important discussion to a simplistic either-or \nequation. Either you are for public education, which means you \nsubscribe to a certain orthodoxy and dare not depart from it, or you \nare against it. Either you subscribe to a small set of educationally \ncorrect methods of reform or you are subverting public education as we \nknow it.\n  In my view, this shortsightedness is shortchanging our children. \nGiven how many students are being served poorly by the status quo, \nparticularly those living in urban areas who are trapped in deadening \nand in some cases deadly public schools, and given the crucial role \nthat education will play in determining whether the American dream can \nbe made real for those kids in the information age, we have an \nobligation to leave no policy stone unturned or untested and judge \nideas by the simple, unalloyed standard of what works. We must be open \nto trying any plan or program that offers the hope of better education \nfor our children.\n  That is why Senator Coats and I have been advocating for some time \nthat we experiment with private school choice, sponsoring a series of \nbills to set up pilot programs in our cities to see if giving low-\nincome students the chance to attend a private or faith-based school \nwill enhance their learning and force those failing public schools to \nimprove.\n  And that is why today we want to take this opportunity to express our \nsupport for the growing public charter school movement and to outline \nour plans to help make these innovative, independent programs the norm \nrather than a novelty in this country.\n  I have been a long-time advocate of the charter approach, which \ngrants educators freedom from top-heavy bureaucracies and their redtape \nin exchange for a commitment to meet high academic standards. After \nvisiting, this week, with a group of passionate charter school \noperators and teachers at a national conference here in town, I am all \nthe more convinced that charter schools represent what may be the \nfuture of public education. These folks are driving a grassroots \nrevolution that is seeking to reinvent the public school and take it \nback to the future, reconnecting public education to some of our \noldest, most basic values--ingenuity, responsibility, accountability--\nand refocusing its mission on doing what's best for the child instead \nof what's best for the system.\n\n  The results speak for themselves. Over the past 3 years, the number \nof public charter schools have more than\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\ntripled, with more than 700 of them operating in 23 different States \nand the District of Columbia, and parents in turn have given these \nprograms overwhelmingly high marks for their responsiveness to them as \nconsumers. Broad-based studies done by the Hudson Institute and the \nEducation Department show that charters are effectively serving diverse \npopulations, particularly many of the disadvantaged and at-risk \nchildren that traditional public schools have struggled to educate. And \nwhile it's too soon to determine what impact charter schools are having \non overall academic performance, the early returns in places like \nMassachusetts suggest that charters are succeeding where it matters \nmost, in the classroom.\n  Perhaps most heartening of all, a recent survey done by the National \nSchool Board Association found that the charter movement is already \nhaving a ripple effect that is being felt in many local school \ndistricts. The NSBA report cites evidence that traditional schools are \nworking harder to please local families so they won't abandon them to \ncompeting charter schools, and that central administrators often see \ncharters as a powerful tool to develop new ideas and programs without \nfearing regulatory roadblocks.\n  The most remarkable aspect of this movement may be that it has \nmanaged to bring together educators, parents, community activists, \nbusiness leaders, and politicians from across the political spectrum on \ncommon ground in support of a common goal to better educate our \nchildren through more choice, more flexibility, and more accountability \nin our public schools. In these grassroots may lie the roots of a \nconsensus for renewing the promise of public education.\n  We want to build on this agreement and the successes of charter \nschools and do what we can at the Federal level to encourage the growth \nof this movement. So today we will be introducing bipartisan \nlegislation that will strengthen the Federal investment in charter \nschools and help remove some of the hurdles preventing charters from \nflourishing in every State.\n  Our bill, the Charter School Expansion Act, would revamp the Federal \nCharter School Grant Program to make it more focused on helping States \nand local groups create new schools and meet the President's goal of \ncreating 3,000 charters by the year 2000. We want to increase funding \nfor grants to new schools, which help charter operators meet the high \ncosts of starting a school from scratch, and better target that aid to \nthe States that are serious about expanding their charter program. Our \nhope is that these changes will give States that have been slow to \nembrace the charter movement an incentive to get on board.\n  In the near term, we feel this bill can be a starting point for \novercoming our partisan and ideological differences and reaching a \nconsensus on how to improve our schools and safeguard the hopes of our \nchildren. This proposal has already generated bipartisan interest both \nhere in the Senate and the House, the administration has expressed its \nsupport, and we are optimistic it will be passed next year \noverwhelmingly.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Senator Kerry and Senator D'Amato \nfor joining Senator Coats and myself as original cosponsors of this \nbill. I would urge the rest of our colleagues, if they have not yet \nalready done so, to take a close look at some of the truly innovative \ncharter school programs being run in your home States and around the \ncountry. And I would ask you to join us in supporting this legislation \nto build on all the great work that's being done at the State and local \nlevel and help us chart a new course in education reform in America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES:\n  S. 1381. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Army to convey lands \nacquired for the Candy Lake project, Osage County, OK; to the Committee \non Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               THE CANDY LAKE LAND CONVEYANCE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Candy Lake \nLand Conveyance Act of 1997. The purpose of this legislation is to \ndirect the Secretary of the Army to convey lands acquired for the Candy \nLake project in Osage County, OK, back to the original landowners.\n  Briefly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers acquired 3,657.45 acres of \nland in Osage County from 21 landowners for the purpose of constructing \nCandy Lake. The project was not constructed, and in December 1996, the \nCorps of Engineers declared the Candy Lake property excess to the needs \nof the Federal Government.\n  My legislation will give each of the 21 landowners the option to \npurchase their original property from the Federal Government at fair \nmarket value. If a landowner, or their descendant, opts not to purchase \ntheir former property, that land will be disposed of in accordance with \nthe Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. \n471 et seq.).\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1381\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1.

Mr. President, today marks the 100th anniversary \nof the Thomas Jefferson Building, the crown jewel of the buildings \noccupied by the Library of Congress. As vice chairman of the Joint \nCommittee on the Library, it is my privilege to mark this important \nday.\n  The Library of Congress occupies a unique place in American history, \nand in the vast flow of information that crosses the globe and drives \nAmerica's economic well-being. The Library is Congress' legislative \nlibrary, our major research arm, and a national library as well as \ncultural institution. Congress has nurtured this Library from its \ncreation in Philadelphia, through the legislature's move to the new \ncapital city of Washington, through the 1814 British invasion of \nWashington that burned the Capitol and the Library of Congress, and \nthrough our purchase of Thomas Jefferson's own extensive library to \nrecommence the Library of Congress as a universal collection of \nknowledge.\n  By the 1870's, the Library of Congress collections had grown to more \nthan 300,000 volumes and had already outgrown the space in the Capitol \nthat it had occupied since its move to Washington. It was the foresight \nof Ainsworth Rand Spofford, the sixth Librarian of Congress, that \nhelped transform the Library of Congress into an institution of \nnational stature, and eventually lead to the building of the Thomas \nJefferson building we celebrate today.\n  Spofford recognized the importance of copyright deposit as a means to \nensure the continued development of the Library's collections. After \nthe 1870 revision of the copyright law, two copies of every book, \npamphlet, map, print, photograph, and piece of music registered for \ncopyright was to be deposited with the Library of Congress. The \ncopyright law today continues to fuel the Library's special \ncollections, including film, television, digital materials, and \ncomputer software.\n  The growth of the collections through copyright deposit created the \nneed for a new building for the Library of Congress. The building, \nlater named for Thomas Jefferson, was authorized in 1886 and completed \nin 1897, on time and under budget and was immediately hailed as a \nnational monument--an imposing structure of the Italian Renaissance \nstyle. Every Member of Congress has had the opportunity to visit the \nmagnificently restored Jefferson Building and admire the extraordinary \nbeauty and grandeur of the Great Hall, the Main Reading Room, and the \nMembers' Room.\n  It is not a simple matter to authorize a new Federal building, let \nalone a building to be constructed immediately adjacent to the Capitol. \nLibrarian of congress Spofford had two staunch allies: Senator Daniel \nW. Voorhees of Indiana and Senator Justin S. Morrill of Vermont. Today, \nSenator Morrill's efforts will be recognized. A plaque honoring his \ncommitment to the Library and construction of the Jefferson Building \nwill be unveiled by our current Librarian of Congress, James \nBillington, and the Vermont congressional delegation. The Morrill \nplaque will flank that recognizing Senator Voorhees so that each \nSenator might be honored by all who enter the Great Hall for their \ndedication to and vision for Congress' Library.\n  This evening, on behalf of the Joint Committee on the Library, I will \njoin the joint committee chairman, Representative Bill Thomas, \nLibrarian James Billington, and Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman \nto light for the very first time the restored Torch of Learning that \ncrowns the Thomas Jefferson Building. The Main Reading Room is the \nheart of the Thomas Jefferson Building. It is covered by a beautiful \ndome, the exterior of which is covered by a great blazing torch and \nflame, marking the center and apex of the Jefferson Building. This \ntorch and flame are symbolic of the learning and knowledge in the \nLibrary of Congress. From now on, the glowing Torch of Learning will \nlight the skyline over the Capitol, a worthy companion to the lighted \ndome of the Capitol.\n  I thank, on behalf of my colleagues on the joint committee, the \nOffice of the Architect of the Capitol which has overseen the \nrestoration of the Jefferson Building we celebrate today. As the \nLibrary of Congress moves toward its Bicentennial in the year 2000, \nCongress will continue to reap the benefits of the Library's \nincomparable collections. In particular, our constituents will benefit \nfrom Librarian James Billington's efforts to extend the Library's \nunique special collections and service nationwide through the Internet.\n  One hundred years ago, the Congress supported the vision of Ainsworth \nRand Spofford and provided the means for the collections to grow and to \nbe housed in a building described as the most beautiful in America. As \nthe Library of Congress approaches the 21st century, it needs and \ndeserves the continued support of Congress as our nation's strategic \ninformation reserve.\n  I ask that a summary of the Library's operations, to date this year, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n\n                                        Librarian of Congress,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: It will be some months before the \n     Library's Annual Report for FY97 is completed and delivered \n     to you. I wanted to take the beginning of a new fiscal year \n     as an occasion to provide you with a summary of the Library's \n     operations. I believe that it is important for you, as a \n     Member of Congress charged with oversight of the Library, to \n     understand the Library's management goals and our progress \n     toward them.\n\n\n                               management\n\n       General Donald Scott has just marked his first anniversary \n     as Deputy Librarian, the Library's Chief Operating Officer. \n     Don's capable handling of the Library's day-to-day operations \n     has enabled me to focus on policy concerns, planning for the \n     Library's Bicentennial (see below), and completing the \n     necessary private-sector fundraising to meet our goal of $45 \n     million for the National Digital Library (NDL).\n       To date, we have $30 million in gifts and pledges. The NDL \n     site continues to be one of the most recognized content sites \n     on the Internet. THOMAS, the American Memory collections, and \n     the Learning Page are used by millions of citizens, \n     legislators, teachers, parents, and students each month.\n       The National Science Foundation will shortly announce a \n     second round of Digital Library research grants. The Library \n     of\n\n[[Page S11784]]\n\n     Congress's NDL and the National Library of Medicine have been \n     invited to participate as user test-bed sites for possible \n     cutting-edge research applications. A recent example may help \n     suggest to you the importance of this invitation from NSF. \n     Compression software, originally developed at the Los Alamos \n     Lab and only recently made available for non-defense \n     applications, was given as a gift to the Library. for the \n     first time, the Library was able to digitize items from our \n     enormous map collections for the NDL. This compression \n     software made it possible to display and search maps for the \n     first time. We hope that other research breakthroughs will \n     help the Library offer even more diverse collections through \n     the NDL.\n       Under the leadership of Chief of Staff, Jo Ann Jenkins, the \n     Library has updated its strategic plan through 2004. We have \n     also established a Directorate for planning, Management and \n     Evaluation (PMED), headed by Thomas Bryant.\n       Finally, the Library's second external audit of its \n     financial operations received a clean option from KPMG. This \n     is an outstanding achievement, in only the second audit \n     cycle, for any government agency.\n\n\n                                security\n\n       In February 1997, the Library hired Kenneth Lopez as its \n     Director of Security. Working under Ken with a team of \n     security professionals, curators, and senior librarians, we \n     have completed the Library's Security Plan, and I have \n     forwarded it to the Library's oversight committees for their \n     review. The Library's external audit process calls for an \n     annual review of the Library's care and control of its \n     ``heritage assets''--the 112 million items in the Library's \n     collections. The audit will, therefore, provide an annual \n     update on the Library's overall security of its collections.\n\n\n                              bicentennial\n\n       As you well know, the Library will celebrate its \n     bicentenary--along with the bicentenary of the Congress' move \n     to Washington--in the year 2000. On October 6th, the Library \n     announced its theme, goals, and overall plans and launched a \n     website for its Bicentennial (http:/www.loc.gov/\n bicentennial). A copy of our announcement is enclosed with \n     this letter.\n       Prior to our public announcement, I wrote to Members of \n     Congress to invite their participation and that of their \n     constituents--particularly libraries--in our plans. I am \n     pleased that we have received over 100 responses to date.\n       On October 7, the Madison Council, the Library's private-\n     sector advisory fundraising group, hosted a gala to launch \n     the Bicentennial and to raise funds for its implementation. \n     The evening, a celebration of Creative America, highlighted \n     the Library's enormously rich music and manuscript \n     collections and raised $800,000 to support Bicentennial \n     programs, bringing the total commitment to date from the \n     Madison Council to $1.5 million. Thanks are due to John \n     Kluge, chair of the Madison Council, and to the gala co-\n     chairs, Buffy Cafritz of Washington, D.C., and Alyne Massey \n     of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n\n                           legislative update\n\n       We are deeply grateful that the Library's FY98 budget was \n     very generously supported by the Congress. In particular, \n     funding for our top priority, an Integrated Library System \n     (ILS), and for the cost of our mandatory pay raises will make \n     an enormous difference in the Library's ability to continue \n     to secure its collection and provide the highest quality \n     service to the Congress and to the nation.\n       The American Folklife Center requires reauthorization. \n     Consistent with the Board's wishes, and with my wholehearted \n     support, we have transmitted the formal request for permanent \n     authorization for the Center to the Library's oversight \n     committees.\n       Particularly as the Library approaches its own Bicentenary, \n     it is essential that this important collection and its \n     curators have assurance of their place in the Library. The \n     collection itself dates from the 1890's The Center was \n     created during the Bicentenary of the American Revolution in \n     1976 as a powerful tool to ensure the place of folklore and \n     local history and customs in our national consciousness. The \n     rich ethnic and regional materials in the Center's Archive \n     comprise the nation's largest and most varied folklore \n     collection--filled with the type of material that is \n     providing of special value for local schools and libraries \n     throughout America on the National Digital Library.\n       The Library is beginning the new fiscal year with strategic \n     goals, sound financial management, significant new staffing, \n     and enormous external and internal enthusiasm and interest in \n     our Bicentenary. I trust that I can count on your continued \n     interest and support. Please feel free to follow up on any \n     topic I have raised. We would be pleased to come brief you \n     further at any time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              James H. Billington,\n                                        The Librarian of Congress.\n       Enclosure.\n\n              Library of Congress--Bicentennial 1800-2000\n\n                     Libraries, Creativity, Liberty\n\n       In a press conference on October 6, 1997, the Librarian of \n     Congress James H. Billington presented preliminary plans for \n     the commemoration of the Library's Bicentennial in the year \n     2000. ``From its earliest days, the Library of Congress has \n     supported the work of libraries everywhere in the spirit of \n     James Madison, who eloquently said that he could not imagine \n     anything more essential for our new republic than `liberty \n     and learning, each leaning on each other for their mutual and \n     surest support' . . . `knowledge will forever govern \n     ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors \n     must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.' We \n     believe that the link between learning and liberty is one of \n     our most basic civic truths. It is our responsibility as the \n     largest library to ensure that the tools of learning are \n     universally accessible.''\n\n\n                 goal of the bicentennial commemoration\n\n       The goal of the Bicentennial commemoration is ``To inspire \n     creativity in the century ahead by stimulating greater use of \n     libraries and other avenues of learning everywhere.''\n       The Bicentennial goal will be achieved through a variety of \n     national, state, and local projects, developed in \n     collaboration with the offices of the Members of Congress, \n     the Library's staff, and special advisory committees.\n\n\n                      bicentennial logo and theme\n\n       The logo for the Bicentennial commemoration features the \n     interior dome of the Library's famous Main Reading Room and \n     the theme ``Libraries, Creativity, Liberty.'' The unseen \n     painting within the circle in the dome's ``eye'' is the image \n     of a woman representing ``Human Understanding.'' In the \n     painting, ``Human Understanding'' is lifting her veil and \n     looking upward toward the future. This logo and theme \n     symbolize what the Bicentennial Commemoration is about: \n     stimulating creativity and ensuring a free society through \n     greater use of libraries everywhere. The Library of Congress \n     looks forward in the months ahead to developing ways for \n     other libraries to share in the use of this logo.\n\n\n                           bicentennial plans\n\n       Libraries of all kinds and sizes are invited to participate \n     in the Bicentennial Commemoration of the Library of Congress, \n     which will celebrate the creative use of knowledge as a \n     function of democracy. At the October 6 press conference, \n     John Y. Cole, the Library's Bicentennial project director and \n     director of the Center for the Book, said ``Libraries are \n     important educational institutions and a natural link between \n     learning and liberty; this is their celebration too.'' Core \n     Bicentennial endeavors include ``Gifts to the Nation,'' \n     ``Frontiers of Knowledge,'' ``Local Legacies'' and ``Favorite \n     Poems.''\n\n                          Gifts to the Nation\n\n       The ``Gifts to the Nation'' program is a reciprocal \n     endeavor. It will include activities such as significant \n     acquisitions for the Library's collections; the Library's \n     commissioning of creative works of music, drama, art and \n     literature; and the Library's effort, through its National \n     Digital Library Program, of making available electronically \n     millions of items from its American historical collections by \n     the end of the year 2000. The idea of Bicentennial ``Gifts to \n     the Nation'' continues the Library's proud tradition of \n     helping local libraries through donating surplus books and by \n     providing cataloging information, services which save \n     libraries millions of dollars each year.\n\n                         Frontiers of Knowledge\n\n       Drawing on the remarkable comprehensiveness and diversity \n     of the Library's collections, the ``Frontiers of Knowledge'' \n     program will present a series of lectures and symposia \n     exploring ideas that shape our lives, especially as we look \n     to the next century. At the June 1999 conference, ``The \n     Frontiers for the Mind in the 21st Century,'' distinguished \n     scholars will summarize significant developments in \n     approximately 20 fields in the past century and look ahead to \n     challenges in the year 2000 and beyond. Interaction between \n     the scholars and young people, the latter representing every \n     Congressional District in the nation, will be an important \n     focus of the conference. Fields of inquiry will include: \n     demography, immunology/epidemiology, economics, political \n     philosophy/law, semiotics, neuroscience, molecular evolution \n     and historical genetics, cosmology, earth and ocean science, \n     ecology, biochemistry, physics/computer science, religion/\n     theology, history as narrative, humanities, literature, \n     ethnomusicology, philosophy, and cultural psychology.\n\n                             Local Legacies\n\n       ``Local Legacies'' will build upon local projects now \n     underway nationally in partnership with Library of Congress \n     offices such as the American Folklife Center and the Center \n     for the Book to highlight the richness of America's heritage \n     at the end of the century and the millennium. These include \n     Montana Heritage, Rivers of America, Literary Maps of \n     America, and Building a Nation of Readers. The Montana \n     Heritage project, funded by the Liz Claiborne and Art \n     Ortenberg Foundation, fosters projects in local schools \n     teaching students how to research and document local cultural \n     heritage. The Rivers of America project examines and \n     celebrates the historical, literary, and environmental \n     heritage of America's rivers. It encourages high school \n     students, such as those taking part in the Montana Heritage \n     project, to focus their field research on a local river, \n     particularly the history of the community in relation to that \n     river. Documentary reports and histories for the collections \n     of local institutions are one product. The Literary Map \n     project encourages learning about local geography and \n     literature--simultaneously. Literary maps depict a state or \n     region's literary heritage, usually through colorful, well-\n     illustrated maps that show where authors live or were born or \n     where novels or well-known books\n\n[[Page S11785]]\n\n     were written. Since 1992, more than 20 such maps have been \n     created and added to the collections of the Library of \n     Congress. To remind Americans of the importance of reading to \n     individuals and to the nation, the Center for the Book of the \n     Library of Congress has chosen Building a Nation of Readers \n     for the Library of Congress's national reading promotion \n     campaign for the years 1997-2000. The Library also wants to \n     identify local historical collections that should be linked \n     with the National Digital Library.\n\n                             Favorite Poems\n\n       Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky will take the lead in the \n     ``favorite poem'' project, which will feature approximately \n     100 Americans from all walks of life choosing and reading \n     aloud a favorite poem. The resulting audio and video \n     archives, in Mr. Pinsky's words, will be ``a record, at the \n     end of the century, of what we choose, and what we do with \n     our voices and faces, when asked to say aloud a poem that we \n     love.''\n\n                      Commemorative Coin and Stamp\n\n       Legislation has been introduced for a Bicentennial \n     commemorative coin. The Library of Congress is also exploring \n     a Bicentennial commemorative stamp series, based on its \n     unparalleled collections, to be issued in the year 2000.\n\n                       Bicentennial Publications\n\n       Between the fall of 1997 and the year 2000, the Library of \n     Congress will produce several major publications as part of \n     fulfilling its Bicentennial goal of stimulating creativity \n     and wisdom through greater understanding of the Library and \n     its remarkable collections. Highlights of the Bicentennial \n     publishing program include:\n\n\n                                  1997\n\n       Eyes of the Nation: A Visual History of the United States\n\n       A pictorial and narrative history published by Alfred A. \n     Knopf, Eyes of the Nation contains more than 500 full-color \n     and duotone illustrations from the Library's collections. The \n     book marks the centennial of four of the Library's major \n     collection divisions: Prints and Photographs, Manuscript, \n     Music and Geography and Map. An Eyes of the Nation CD-ROM is \n     also available.\n\n    The Library of Congress: The Art and Architecture of the Thomas \n                           Jefferson Building\n\n       Published by W. W. Norton, The Art and Architecture of the \n     Thomas Jefferson Building features essays and 280 \n     illustrations, 185 of them in color, depicting the \n     architecture and decorative elements in this magnificent \n     building. The book commemorates the centennial of the \n     building's opening.\n\n\n                                  1998\n\n              The Jefferson Building: A Guide for Visitors\n\n       This publication will provide visitors a compact, but fully \n     illustrated book.\n\n\n                                  1999\n\n            The Library of Congress: A Bicentennial History\n\n       Published by Yale University Press, the volume will be a \n     well-illustrated popular history and interpretation of the \n     Library's 200 years of service to Congress and the nation.\n\n                Encyclopedia of the Library of Congress\n\n       The illustrated, one-volume reference work will contain 12 \n     topical essays and approximately 150 brief entries about the \n     Library and its activities.\n\n\n                                  2000\n\n          The Library of Congress in American Life, 1800-2000\n\n       The Library of Congress in American Life will be a four-\n     volume documentary set, featuring the Library's chronology, \n     biographies of the Librarians of Congress, documents and \n     resources for the study of the Library, and current scholarly \n     research about the Library and its role in American life.\n\n\n             virtual tour of the thomas jefferson building\n\n       A Virtual Tour of the Thomas Jefferson Building, with \n     photographs and moving panoramas of the splendid public \n     spaces and other rooms of this historic building, is \n     currently being prepared for the Library's World Wide Web \n     site.\n\n\n             other bicentennial projects under development\n\n       Among other Bicentennial projects in the early planning \n     stages are major exhibitions, Jefferson Knowledge, and \n     Democratic and America at Play, and national television \n     programming.\n\n             Jefferson, Knowledge, and Democracy Exhibition\n\n       This major exhibition is being planned for April-October \n     2000 and will use Jefferson's personal books that he sold to \n     the Congress in 1815, his personal papers, his architectural \n     drawings, his personal artifacts (such as his original \n     ``reading machine,'' a revolving reading stand which he \n     designed) to examine his ideas. A secondary theme will be how \n     these ideas--in architecture, the arts, law, science, \n     politics, music, geography, agriculture, and other subjects-\n     have influenced America and the world.\n       Jefferson's idea on the relationship between knowledge and \n     democracy are as vital today as when he first enunciated \n     them. This is clearly evident in the intense debate on those \n     ideas among contemporary Jeffersonian scholars, which will be \n     explored in the exhibition. Jefferson's coupling of knowledge \n     and freedom also are at the root of the current impassioned \n     demand for an information ``superhighway'' whereby knowledge \n     can be speedily and universally disseminated.\n       The exhibition will be the centerpiece for a series of \n     events and multi-media projects that will help make \n     Jefferson's ideas (and the Jefferson-Library of Congress \n     connection) understandable to a wide audience. Interpretive \n     brochures, a catalog, educational materials, a summer \n     institute for teachers, a concert of music in Jefferson's \n     time, films, and various videos will enhance the exhibition.\n\n                       America at Play Exhibition\n\n       America at Play is the second exhibition to celebrate the \n     Library's 200th anniversary; through it visitors can see and \n     enjoy how Americans have amused themselves over the past two \n     centuries. Drawing on the Library of Congress's extensive and \n     unique collections, the exhibitions will take its cue from \n     prints, photographs, maps, travel literature, recorded audio \n     and visual materials, manuscripts, and books to cover topics \n     such as the exploration of the west and the rise of tourism; \n     the development of recreational areas in the country; the \n     growth of spectator and recreational sports; the importance \n     of recorded music and film classics; and the golden age of \n     television.\n       To link these separate elements, the exhibition will select \n     from its unparalleled collection of political cartoons and \n     drawings and the writings of American humorists. These visual \n     commentaries will further illustrate and put into context the \n     ``amusements'' covered. The exhibition, on display from the \n     Fall of 2000, will be accompanied by a catalog, and \n     educational and outreach programs, including a series of \n     musical comedy and film presentation and live performances.\n\n\n                     proposed bicentennial projects\n\n       A variety of Bicentennial projects have been proposed, \n     including local newspaper surveys to identify the most \n     influential book and film of the century, an international \n     conference on comparative constitutional law, a Library-\n     related photography contest with an exhibition of winning \n     photographs traveling around the country, a conference about \n     national libraries at the Library of Congress, and the joint \n     celebration of National Library Week and the Library's \n     Bicentennial in April of 2000.\n\n\n                      support for the bicentennial\n\n       The Bicentennial projects will be privately funded, with \n     substantial support from the James Madison Council. The \n     Madison Council will established in 1990 to help the Library \n     share its unique resources with the nation and the world.\n\n\n              look for updates to the bicentenial program\n\n       The Library of Congress Bicentennial home page will be \n     changed as the program develops.

Mr. President, I rise today to support a bill \nintroduced by my colleagues Senators Kerry and Coats to protect \nworkplace religious freedom.\n  I have long championed the rights of individuals to freedom of \nreligious observance and practice. I believe individual Christians, \nJews, Muslims, and others should be able to honor their religious \nbeliefs without fear of losing their jobs.\n  For example, employees should be able to observe Good Friday, the \nJewish Sabbath or wear clothing required by one's religion. I've met \nwith many constituents who have expressed their concern to me that they \nhave been discriminated against because of their religious practices.\n  My State of Maryland already has many employers who are sensitive to \nthe needs of religious accommodation. However, there is room for \nimprovement. One Arab-American woman from my State told me she cannot \nwear her traditional Muslim garb at her place of employment. I know \nthere are other stories like this which cut across all faiths.\n  If an employee's religious practice does not cause an undue hardship \non an employer, an employee should be given the freedom to observe or \npractice a religious custom.\n  I am dismayed that many individuals are discriminated against in our \nsociety, because of their religious beliefs. Our country was founded on \nthe premise that everyone has a right to religious freedom. We need to \npreserve this doctrine.\n  Unfortunately, the courts have interpreted title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 very narrowly when it comes to religious practices. \nThis bill would restore the basic tenet of religious freedom to \nthousands of individuals who have met with discrimination at the \nworkplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1164, the Workplace Religious \nFreedom\n\n[[Page S11786]]\n\nRestoration Act. I believe religious accommodation is a cherished right \nthat we must protect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11785-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SITUATION IN IRAQ\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the United States is once again \nfacing a decision about whether and how to respond to Iraqi \nintransigence over the issue of its continued development and \nconcealment of weapons of mass destruction and their associated \ndelivery systems. It is imperative that we not back down, as has \nalready been the case to an alarming degree.\n  All countries act out of their own economic self-interest. The United \nStates is no exception. We should not, however, acquiesce in such \nconduct in the case of Iraq. Russia, which seeks compensation for \nweapons it sold to Baghdad during the Soviet era as well as the hard \ncurrency and access to oil that Iraq represents, and France, which \nsimilarly pursues contracts for the development of Iraqi oil, have led \nthe way in arguing for a relaxation of the economic sanctions levied \nagainst Iraq as a result of its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Countries like \nEgypt and Kenya have demonstrated growing sympathy for Iraq's economic \nsituation.\n  The reason why the United States should stand firm and not continue \nto adopt essentially meaningless positions on the question of sanctions \nis quite simple: Iraq has to a remarkable degree always held its \ndestiny in its own hands. Little was asked of it other than to come \nclean on the extent of its efforts to develop weapon systems capable of \nthreatening stability in the world's most volatile region. And, yet, it \nhas consistently, for more than 6 years now, refused to do that, \nrepeatedly challenging the international community and miscalculating \nthe ramifications of its actions.\n  With regard to its efforts at developing chemical, biological, and \nnuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them, a particularly \nilluminating episode occurred back in August 1995. It was then that \nSaddam Hussein s sons-in-law, one of whom had been in charge of \noverseeing the development of those weapons, defected to Jordan. \nAnticipating the intelligence coup for the United Nations that was to \ncome, the Iraqis decided to preempt the damage the defectors could \ncause by revealing a wealth of documents--over half-a-million pages--\ndetailing their biological weapons program. Mr. President, 150 steel \ntrunks and boxes stuffed with documentation that was to have been \nturned over in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war, yet would likely \nhave remained hidden indefinitely had the defections not occurred, \nsuddenly and miraculously appeared.\n  Iraq's refusal to abide by the rules of civilized society and to test \nthe will of the international community has been manifested in other \nways also. In October 1994, it moved thousands of troops toward the \nKuwaiti border, precipitating a costly but essential deployment of \nUnited States military forces to the region to deter a repeat of the \n1990 invasion. Whether Iraq intended to invade Kuwait at that time is \nhighly unlikely; whether a failure to respond on the part of the United \nStates would have emboldened Saddam is beyond dispute.\n  Two years later, Iraq launched a large-scale concerted ground \ncampaign against Kurdish enclaves in the country s north. Saddam was \nable to exploit longstanding, violent divisions within the Kurdish \npopulation to reestablish a measure of control over territory denied it \nsince the Gulf war. In so doing, it sent a resounding message to the \nKurdish population, including that part to which it allied itself \nduring its military incursion, that it was willing and capable of \nasserting itself within its borders. Particularly disturbing, if \ntotally in character for Saddam, his intelligence service utilized the \nopportunity to hunt down and execute Kurdish factions hostile to his \nbrutal rule, including hundreds of individuals who had cast their lot \nwith the United States.\n  The Clinton administration's response to that incursion into \nterritory supposedly under U.N. protection was to launch a small number \nof embarrassingly ineffectual cruise missile launches in an entirely \ndifferent region and to expand the no-fly zone in the south. If our \nintent was to prevent a horizontal escalation of the conflict, we \nsucceeded. The fact that there was not apparent intent on the part of \nSaddam at that time to conduct military operations in the south was \npurely academic.\n  The most recent incident started out considerably more ambiguous, but \nis no less damaging to the U.N.'s ability to enforce its provisions \nover the protracted periods of time necessary to get results. Iraq \nclearly violated the no-fly zone, but only after Iranian attacks \nagainst bases of the People s Mojahedin of Iran situation on the Iraqi \nside of the border. There is a noticeable dearth of sympathetic parties \nhere, but the bottom line is that the no-fly zone was violated, and the \nadministration was correct to respond. Iraq s apparent retaliatory \nmeasures, in effect, the refusal to permit United States citizens to \nparticipate in the U.N. inspection teams enforcing Security Council \nresolutions, has been appropriately rejected by members of the Council.\n  The problem lies in the political environment Council members France \nand Russia continue to create that encourages Saddam to believe he can \nact with impunity. It is absolutely imperative that the administration \ncommunicate to these countries, as well as to others sympathetic to the \nplight of the Iraqi people, that the sanctions must remain in place \nuntil Iraq finally does what it has resisted doing for 6 years: abide \nby the conditions of the cease fire. Saddam himself holds his country's \nwelfare in his hands. All that is asked of him is to place that welfare \nabove his drive to threaten his neighbors with chemical, biological, \nand nuclear weapons. The fact that he has been unwilling to accept that \nvery basic condition illustrates the need to maintain the sanctions in \nperpetuity if necessary. The international community was willing to \nisolate South Africa for an indefinite period of time until fundamental \nchanges were implemented. It is entirely reasonable, and essential for \nthe future of our friends and allies in the Middle East as well as for \nour own economic well-being, that the international community \ndemonstrate the same steadfastness in the case of Iraq that it did with \nSouth Africa. Morally and practically, it is the only option available \nto us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11786-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROMOTION OF JOHN H.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nenlarging the NATO alliance to include the current invitees of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic during this round, and the Baltic \ncountries of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia during the next round. For \nthe past few weeks, various Senate committees have been reviewing the \ncosts of bringing Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic into NATO. \nThe administration estimates the entire cost for this first round of \nNATO enlargement at $27-$35 billion in the 13-year period from 1997 to \n2009. Opponents suggest that the actual costs might actually be much \nhigher, although we will really not have a clear picture until after \nnew estimates are made early next year based on a commonly agreed-upon \nset of military requirements that NATO ministers will decide on in \nDecember. In any case, two things are clear. First, most of these costs \nwould have to be paid anyway--even if NATO did not enlarge. Second, the \nU.S. share of the total costs will be relatively small.\n  As part of the present effort to enlarge NATO, Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic must restructure and modernize their armed forces. \nHowever, they would need to do this in any case and the costs of doing \nso would probably be much higher without enlargement, since they would \nhave to rely entirely on their own resources to protect themselves. \nAdditionally, current European NATO members must reconfigure their \nforces so they are more flexible and more easily deployed; but these \nchanges result from the requirements of NATO's New Strategic Concept \nagreed on by all alliance members in 1991, and not from enlargement as \nsuch. These enlargement costs will be paid for by our allies and not by \nus. From our perspective, these enlargement costs should really be seen \nas benefits--improvements to NATO's security paid for by our allies, \nnot by us.\n  The only extra costs of the current round of NATO enlargement are the \nso-called direct costs of enlargement, which include such things as \nupgrading communications, air defenses, and infrastructure for rapid \nreinforcement. These costs would be borne jointly by all NATO members \nwith the United States paying roughly one-quarter of the cost. This \nmeans that for every dollar we put toward these direct costs, our \nallies, old an new, would put in three. You can't get better value for \nyour money than that. Thus, the range of costs the United States would \nhave to pay for the present round of enlargement over the next 13 years \nwould be somewhere between $2 billion--if you believe the \nadministration's figures--and $7 billion--if you believe the recent \nreport by the CATO Institute. Given the millions of lives lost in World \nWar I and II, and the billions of dollars spent during these conflicts, \nthe cold war and now in Bosnia, NATO enlargement is the cheapest single \ninvestment we can make.\n  Aside from the costs, we get real benefits from NATO enlargement. As \nSecretary Albright and other administration officials have repeatedly \nand convincingly pointed out, NATO enlargement will deter future \nthreats, prevent the development of a dangerous power vacuum in the \nheart of Europe, make border and ethnic conflicts far less likely and \nsolidify democratic institutions and free markets in Europe. Just as \nimportantly, the United States will be gaining strong new allies in \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, who between them will add \n300,000 troops to the alliance. The costs of enlargement will fall \nheaviest on them, but these countries know the price of freedom. Each \ncountry has been invaded more than once this century and each suffered \nunder Communist domination for over 40 years. They understand that \ntheir own security is indivisible from that of the rest of Europe and \nhave already expressed their commitment to be producers of security, \nand not merely consumers, by cooperating with NATO forces to implement \nthe Dayton accords in Bosnia.\n\n  If we refuse to enlarge NATO, we would have told these countries that \ndespite their epic and inspiring struggle to liberate themselves from \ncommunism, the West had once again turned its back on them. Even worse, \nwe would leave Central Europe without an effective security system, \ncreating a heightened sense of insecurity in these countries, forcing \nthem to devote more resources to military expenditures, and lowering \ntheir potential for economic growth. Under these circumstances, a \nbacklash against Western values might very well develop, yielding a \nvicious cycle of authoritarianism, militarism, economic stagnation, and \ngreater conflict between neighbors--a pattern this region has seen in \nthe past. This would inevitably bring more problems for the United \nStates in Europe.\n  Some have asked what's the hurry over NATO enlargement. Surely, the \nend of the cold war gives us plenty of time to contemplate so momentous \na decision. However, if we don't enlarge now when it's relatively easy \nand inexpensive, how can we be sure that we'll be ready to respond to a \ncrisis in time? We were slow to respond to World War I, World War II, \nand Yugoslavia out of the fear of the costs. If we wait until a crisis \ndevelops, our capacity to deal with it early on will be less, the costs \nwill be higher and our reluctance will be greater. Let's make the \ndecision to enlarge now.\n  I would remind my colleagues that as the debate over this issue draws \nnear, we must also look beyond the present round of enlargement. In \nparticular, we must pay especially close attention to Lithuania, \nLatvia, and Estonia.\n  Given their geography and history, the Baltic countries are a weather \nvane indicating which way the winds from Russia will blow. Any \nambiguity in our commitment to the Baltic countries can only encourage \nthose forces in Russia which have not reconciled themselves to the \ntransformation of the Soviet Union. We must make it clear that Russia \nis welcome to cooperate with the undivided, free, prosperous, and \nsecure Europe that is being built. However, it can only do so if it is \nprepared to recognize one of the cardinal principles of the new Europe, \narticulated by Secretary of State Albright during her visit to \nLithuania last July: that all States, large and small must have the \nright to choose their own alliances and associations.\n  By their actions, the Baltic States have clearly made their choice \nknown. They have applied for membership in NATO and the European Union, \nthey participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program and they are \ncontributing directly to NATO's security by cooperating on a regional \nairspace initiative. By providing troops for NATO-led operations in \nBosnia and by participating in the Vilnius Conference on good \nneighborly relations hosted by Lithuania in September, they have shown \ntheir willingness to be producers, not just consumers, of security. \nHaving been invaded by both Stalin and Hitler and having suffered 50 \nyears of Communist occupation, the people of the Baltic countries, no \nless than the people of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, know \nthe price of freedom and are willing to pay for it.\n  If we are serious about our commitment to create a Europe that is \nwhole and free, than the Baltic countries must be included. For that \nreason, the United States must make it absolutely clear at the earliest \npossible moment that it supports NATO membership for Lithuania, Latvia, \nand Estonia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11787-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11787-S11788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF MADONNA UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to \nMadonna University on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. As a school \nwhich emphasizes academic, social, and spiritual development, Madonna \nhas established a tremendous presence in southeast Michigan, enhancing \nthe quality of life for its students through an excellent array of \ncampus activities and academic programs.\n  Having converted to a 4-year liberal arts college in 1947, Madonna \nrapidly continued its expansion of academic services. It was recognized \nby the Michigan Board of Education in 1954, and just a short time later \nadded nursing, gerontology, religious studies, criminal justice, and \nradiologic technology to its list of 4-year programs. Thereafter other \nprograms have been added, though there are too many to mention by name. \nIn 1975, Madonna College opened special services to students with \nhearing and other disabilities. In 1991, changed its name to Madonna \nUniversity, and 1 year later the\n\n[[Page S11788]]\n\nschool reached an enrollment high of over 4,400 students.\n  Of the university's many accomplishments, the one which Madonna \nachieves year after year is a rapport among students of being a school \nbig enough to offer a vast selection of educational opportunities, but \nsmall enough to offer them in a personal manner. When most universities \nare looking to cut costs through larger class sizes, I'm pleased to say \nMadonna University is one place where the professors still know their \nstudents by name.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, I commemorate the \noutstanding tradition of excellence maintained by the faculty, staff, \nstudents, and alumni of Madonna University.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11787-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RETIREMENT OF DR. HARRIETT G. JENKINS\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I submit for the Record a joint \nstatement by myself and Senator Jeffords on the retirement of Dr. \nHarriett G. Jenkins.\n  The statement follows:\n\nJoint Statement by Senator Patrick Leahy and Senator James Jeffords on \n               the Retirement of Dr. Harriett G. Jenkins\n\n       On September 30, 1997, Dr. Harriett G. Jenkins officially \n     retired after twenty-five years of service in the executive \n     and legislative branches of our government. Her outstanding \n     contributions in the field of education, at the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Office of \n     Senate Fair Employment Practices, the Senate Committees on \n     Agriculture, Labor, and Judiciary, and at the U.S. Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) have won her the \n     respect and admiration of everyone who has been privileged to \n     work with her. Her impressive career in public service \n     spanned 19 years as a public school educator in Berkeley, \n     California, and carried through her most recent and superior \n     performance as Special Assistant to Commissioner Reginald \n     Jones of the EEOC. In appreciation of her outstanding \n     service, we want to recognize her many achievements.\n       Dr. Jenkins was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and received a \n     Bachelor of Arts Degree in Mathematics from Fisk University \n     in Nashville, Tennessee. She earned a Master of Arts Degree \n     in Education and a Doctorate of Education in Policy, Planning \n     and Administration, both from the University of California at \n     Berkeley. She completed the Advanced Management Program of \n     the Harvard Business School; obtained a law degree from \n     Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., and was awarded an \n     Honorary Doctorate of Science Degree from Fisk University.\n       Dr. Jenkins began her career as a public school educator in \n     Berkeley, California, and rose through the ranks to become \n     vice-principal, principal, and Director of Elementary \n     Education before reaching the post of Assistant \n     Superintendent for Instruction in 1971. She assisted with the \n     integration of the school system, fully involving parents and \n     the community, and with the implementation of many exemplary \n     educational programs. In 1973, Dr. Jenkins moved to \n     Washington, D.C., accepting the position of consultant to the \n     District of Columbia school system for the Response to \n     Educational Needs Project.\n       In 1974, Dr. Jenkins joined the staff at NASA. She served \n     for eighteen years as Assistant Administrator for Equal \n     Opportunity Programs at NASA. She helped NASA integrate its \n     workforce and ensure equal opportunity in personnel \n     transactions. During this period, she helped initiate a \n     significant increase in the number of female and minority \n     employees, particularly in the non-traditional positions of \n     engineers, scientists and astronauts. She also assisted with \n     the expansion of educational programs and scientific research \n     for minority universities.\n       In 1992, Harriett Jenkins was chosen by the Majority and \n     Minority Leaders and appointed by the President pro tempore \n     of the United States Senate to be the first Director of the \n     newly established Office of Senate Fair Employment Practice. \n     In 1996-1997, she served as counsel and professional staff \n     member on the Senate Committees on Agriculture, Forestry and \n     Nutrition, Labor and Human Resources, and Judiciary. In June, \n     1997, she was appointed as Special Assistant to Commissioner \n     Reginald Jones of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission until her retirement on September 30, 1997. In \n     this position, she made critical contributions to the report \n     of the EEOC task force on the ``Best'' Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Policies, Programs and Practices in the Private \n     Sector.\n       Dr. Jenkins has received numerous awards throughout her \n     prestigious career. In 1977, Dr. Jenkins received NASA's \n     highest award, the Distinguished Service Medal. Also during \n     1977, she chaired the Task Force on Equal Opportunity and \n     Affirmative Action, one of nine task forces of the Personnel \n     Management Project which led to the Civil Service Reform Act. \n     For this work, she received the Civil Service Commissioner's \n     Award for Distinguished Service. Dr. Jenkins received the \n     President's Meritorious Executive Award in 1980; NASA's \n     Outstanding Leadership Medal in 1981; and the President's \n     Distinguished Executive Award in 1983.\n       In 1986, Dr. Jenkins was elected to the National Academy of \n     Public Administration; and in 1987, she received the Black \n     Engineer of the Year Award for Affirmative Action. In 1988, \n     she received a second Distinguished Service Medal from NASA; \n     in 1990, the Women in Aerospace Lifetime Achievement Award; \n     in 1992, NASA's Equal Employment Opportunity Medal, and the \n     President's Meritorious Executive Award; and in 1994, NASA's \n     Equal Employment Opportunity Medal. In September, 1997, she \n     was awarded a citation by the EEOC for her distinguished \n     service to the Task Force on the ``Best'' Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Policies, Programs and Practices in the Private \n     Sector.\n       Integrity, intelligence, and commitment to doing the best \n     job possible are characteristics that describe Dr. Jenkins. \n     She has worked tirelessly to advance the goals of protecting \n     the American worker from discrimination in the workplace and \n     tear down the barriers preventing women and minorities from \n     reaching full employment potential.\n       Dr. Jenkins is leaving government service, but her legacy \n     of dedication to fairness and equality in the workplace will \n     enrich and enlighten workers for generations to come. We \n     personally want to thank Dr. Jenkins for her long career in \n     government service as a friend and advisor and wish her the \n     very best in her retirement years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11788-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       FISCAL YEAR 1998 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n Mr. McCAIN.

I would like to bring to my colleagues, attention \na recent article in Asian Week by Susan Au Allen, president of the \nUnited States Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce, who points out \nSenator Brownback's significant work on behalf of Asian Pacific \nAmerican families. It was Senator Brownback who stood up in the House \nof Representatives last year and opposed those who wanted to slash \nfamily immigration. If the elimination of the brothers and sisters and \nadult children categories had passed, tens of thousands of Asian \nPacific families would have been unable to reunite with their loved \nones. Ms. Allen writes, ``When the chips were down last year, he came \nthrough to preserve freedom for our close family members to immigrate \nto the United States. And for that Asian Pacific American families \nacross America are grateful to him.''\n  I ask that the text of the article by Susan Au Allen be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  Time to Reconsider `Racist' Rhetoric\n\n                          (By Susan Au Allen)\n\n       No pain, no gain. No money, no talk. No raise money, no get \n     bonus. Are these offensive words? Several Asian Pacific \n     American organizations think so. The Organization of Chinese \n     Americans, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus \n     Institute, and the Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium \n     have been complaining unfairly about a phrase that Sen. \n     Brownback, R-Kan., uttered during a recent Senate \n     Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the Democratic \n     Party's campaign finance scandal.\n       The argument is that the ``So no raise money, no pay \n     bonus'' phrase is racist. I saw the videotape of the occasion \n     and did not find it offensive.\n       Sen. Brownback was speaking to an educated white male, \n     Richard Sullivan, former finance director of the Democratic \n     National Committee. The senator neither mimicked nor changed \n     the tone of his voice. He was drawing a conclusion to a \n     series of questions he asked Sullivan, who was playing \n     escape, evasion, and dissemble. The senator wanted Sullivan \n     to tell the truth about the unusual compensation package that \n     former DNC fundraiser John Huang negotiated with the \n     Democratic Party--the same truth Sullivan told investigators \n     in an earlier deposition.\n\n[[Page S11789]]\n\n       The senator asked, ``If he didn't produce, no more money. \n     You said, ``If things worked out,'' were your terms. Is that \n     correct?\n       But the recalcitrant Sullivan did his best to duck the \n     question and replied incoherently, ``Yes. But, senator, if \n     he--he never raised it, and it was more of a--if he had \n     raised it, we--as I've stated, we had no reason to believe \n     anything was improper or illegal. And if he had raised it in \n     April or May I'm certain that it would have been met.''\n       The truth is that when John Huang took a pay cut to become \n     the Democratic National Committee's top fundraiser, he was \n     paid a base salary of $60,000, plus a bonus based on the \n     amount of money he would raise. To close the circle, Sen. \n     Brownback concluded with a straight face, ``So, no raise \n     money, no get bonus.'' Even Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, \n     said that Brownback ``didn't mean to slight anybody by this \n     remark.''\n       Now, why would these Asian Pacific American organizations \n     get so offended by that remark? Every time they make a public \n     statement about the campaign finance scandal, the leaders of \n     these groups mention the senator's utterance. Why? It's clear \n     that a number of these groups are led by, for the lack of a \n     better word, liberals. As friends of the Clinton-Gore \n     administration, groups like the Organization of Chinese \n     Americans, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus \n     Institute, and the Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium \n     are playing partisan politics and, quite implausibly, \n     becoming more outraged at a single misinterpreted comment by \n     a Republican senator than by Democratic Party individuals, \n     including the president, whose fundraising improprieties have \n     cast aspersions on millions of law-abiding Asian Pacific \n     Americans.\n       Their complaint against Sen. Brownback is out of place and, \n     more importantly, shows a lack of serious interest in the \n     truth. Otherwise, they would have found out that Sen. \n     Brownback is a true friend of the Asian Pacific American \n     community. In 1996, Congress was debating a contentious \n     immigration bill which could cut legal immigration by one-\n     third. The proposed bill would stop American citizens from \n     petitioning for their parents, adult children, brothers, \n     and sisters for immigration.\n       However, the senator introduced the famous Brownback \n     amendment which preserved all these immigrant categories in \n     the law. Not only did he cosponsor the amendment, he worked \n     very hard to persuade two dozen Republicans to fight the cut \n     in legal immigration. He told those who would listen that \n     ``It's wrong for us to turn the clock back to the 1920s when \n     we shut the door to immigrants.'' Because of this, tens of \n     thousands of Asian Pacific Americans are and will be able to \n     petition for their parents, adult children, brothers, and \n     sisters for immigration. Perhaps these Asian Pacific American \n     organizations did not know about his work at the time because \n     they only worked with the Democratic side of Congress.\n       Now all of them should know who their friends are and who \n     their enemies are. As to the enemy? Well, who got them into \n     this campaign finance scandal in the first place? Try \n     President Clinton, Al Gore, and the Democratic National \n     Committee. And who is a true friend to Asian Americans? Try \n     Sen. Brownback. When the chips were down last year he came \n     through to preserve freedom for our close family members to \n     immigrate to the United States. And for that, Asian Pacific \n     American families across America are grateful to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/05/senate-section/article/S11788-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11789-S11790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 318\n\n   Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs reported S. 318, the Homeowners Protection \nAct on Friday, October 31, 1997. The committee report, Senate Report \nNo. 105-129, was filed the same day.\n  The Congressional Budget Office cost estimate required by Senate Rule \nXXVI, section 11(b) of the Standing Rules of the Senate and section 403 \nof the Congressional Budget Impoundment and Control Act, was not \navailable at the time of filing and, therefore, was not included in the \ncommittee report. Instead, the committee indicated the Congressional \nBudget Office cost estimate would be published in the Congressional \nRecord when it became available.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full cost estimate and cover letter \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office regarding S. 318 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 318, the \n     Homeowners Protection Act.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts are Susanne \n     S. Mehlman and Mary Maginniss (for federal costs), Marc \n     Nicole (for the state and local impact), and Patrice Gordon \n     (for the private-sector impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                        June E. O'Neill, Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     S. 318--Homeowners Protection Act\n       Summary: S. 318 would institute certain reforms in the \n     private mortgage insurance industry. First, the bill would \n     require mortgage lenders and loan servicers to notify \n     borrowers of their right to cancel mortgage insurance and of \n     the procedures to do so. For each loan made one year or more \n     after enactment, the bill would provide for the automatic \n     cancellation of mortgage insurance (including coverage \n     provided by state and local governments) when the outstanding \n     principal balance on the loan drops to 78 percent of the \n     value of the home at the time the loan was issued, provided \n     the borrower's payments are current. S. 318 would establish \n     disclosure procedures for the providers of lender-paid \n     mortgage insurance and would impose civil liability on any \n     mortgage servicer who failed to comply with the requirements \n     of this bill. S. 318 also would dissolve the Thrift Depositor \n     Protection Oversight Board and transfer its remaining \n     responsibilities to the Department of the Treasury. In \n     addition, the bill would reduce from four to two the number \n     of annual meetings the Affordable Housing Advisory Board must \n     hold each year.\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 318 would result in savings \n     of about $250,000 a year in outlays from direct spending. \n     Because the bill would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply. We also estimate that enacting this \n     bill would not result in any significant impact on federal \n     spending subject to appropriation.\n       S. 318 would impose both private-sector and \n     intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA). CBO estimates, however, \n     that the direct costs of complying with the mandates would \n     not likely exceed the thresholds specified in UMRA ($100 \n     million for private-sector mandates and $50 million for \n     intergovernmental mandates, in 1996 dollars adjusted annually \n     for inflation).\n     Estimated cost to the Federal Government\n       Direct spending\n       Current law requires the Thrift Depositor Protection \n     Oversight Board to monitor the operations and spending of the \n     Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). The RTC was a temporary \n     agency established to resolve thrift failures beginning in \n     1989. In late 1995 the RTC was dissolved and its remaining \n     assets were transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation. The Oversight Board now retains responsibility \n     for only two functions. The first is to oversee operations of \n     the Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP), which issued \n     bonds totaling $30 billion from 1989 to 1991 as part of RTC's \n     initial funding. Second, the Oversight Board retains a \n     nonvoting membership, through the end of 1998, on the \n     Affordable Housing Advisory Board. By terminating the \n     Oversight Board, the bill would eliminate the annual costs \n     for the one employee of the board who prepares periodic \n     reports required of all distinct entities of the government \n     and performs other routine functions. Based on information \n     from the Treasury, CBO estimates that transferring the \n     statutory responsibilities of the Oversight Board to the \n     Treasury would result in savings of about $250,000 annually \n     in direct spending. Because the Oversight Board has the \n     authority to pay its expenses without appropriation action, \n     these savings would be a reduction in direct spending.\n       This bill also would affect insured depository \n     institutions, including banks, thrifts, and credit unions \n     that hold qualifying mortgage portfolios. As a result, the \n     federal banking regulators--the Federal Reserve, the \n     Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, and \n     the Office of Thrift Supervision--would have some \n     responsibility to monitor and enforce the statute. Spending \n     by these agencies is not subject to the annual appropriation \n     process. However, CBO expects that the additional regulatory \n     costs for these agencies would be small and offset by fees in \n     most cases, resulting in no significant net cost to the \n     federal government.\n       Spending subject to appropriation\n       Spending by the Treasury to carry out the routine functions \n     of the Oversight Board would be subject to appropriation. CBO \n     estimates that any additional spending would be minimal. In \n     addition, reducing the number of times the Affordable Housing \n     Advisory Board must meet annually is not expected to result \n     in any significant savings. Also, CBO estimates that imposing \n     civil liability on mortgage servicers who do not comply with \n     the requirements under the bill would not result in any \n     significant costs to the federal court system because \n     the caseload is expected to be minimal and any cases \n     reaching trial would most likely be tried in state courts.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-\n     as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. Legislation providing funding necessary \n     to meet the government's existing deposit insurance \n     commitment is excluded from these procedures. CBO believes \n     that requiring insured depository institutions to terminate \n     private mortgage insurance would not meet the exemption for\n\n[[Page S11790]]\n\n     full funding of deposit insurance and thus would have pay-as-\n     you-go implications. Spending by the federal banking \n     regulators to monitor and enforce the provisions of the bill \n     is estimated to be small, however, and in most cases would be \n     offset be fees charged to the depository institutions, \n     resulting in no significant net cost to the federal \n     government. Eliminating the Thrift Depositor Protection \n     Oversight Board would reduce direct spending, but these \n     savings would also be insignificant.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 318 would \n     impose both private-sector and intergovernmental mandates as \n     defined in UMRA. The bill contains mandates on mortgage \n     lenders, loan servicers, purchasers of mortgage loans, and \n     private mortgage insurance (PMI) companies in the mortgage \n     industry. Provisions in the bill would be enforced by private \n     law suits. CBO estimates that the annual direct costs of \n     complying with mandates identified in this bill are not \n     likely to exceed the statutory thresholds for private-sector \n     or intergovernmental mandates. Inasmuch as state and local \n     governments finance mortgage loans and service and insure \n     some of the loans extended, they would bear some of the costs \n     of complying with these mandates. CBO estimates that at least \n     95 percent of all identified costs would fall on the private \n     sector, less than 5 percent of the costs would be borne by \n     state and local governments.\n       Private mortgage insurance protects lenders--or the \n     ultimate purchaser of a mortgage loan, such as Fannie Mae or \n     Freddie Mac--against financial loss if a borrower defaults on \n     a mortgage loan. Industry data show that the lower the down \n     payment, as a percentage of the property value, the greater \n     is the risk that the loan will default. Mortgage insurance is \n     generally used when a borrower makes a down payment of less \n     than 20 percent of the value of the home--that is, when the \n     mortgage has a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio greater than 80 \n     percent. In 1996, the eight PMI companies backed nearly one \n     million residential mortgage loans and a total of $127 \n     billion in loans were covered by PMI.\n     Mandates\n       S. 318 would allow borrowers to request cancellation of a \n     PMI policy after paying off 20 percent of the property's \n     original value. To be eligible for policy cancellation at 20 \n     percent equity, the bill would require that a borrower (1) \n     make a written request for cancellation; (2) be current on \n     mortgage payments; (3) certify that he or she holds no second \n     mortgages on the property; and (4) demonstrate that the \n     property's value has not depreciated below its value at \n     closing. S. 318 would require that private mortgage insurance \n     be canceled once a borrower has reached 22 percent equity \n     unless the insurance covers a ``high-risk'' loan. Borrowers \n     with loans deemed to be high risk according to guidelines to \n     be developed by the Federal National Mortgage Association and \n     the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation would not qualify \n     for early cancellation. Such borrowers, however, would have \n     their insurance terminated at the half-life of the loan. Upon \n     termination of PMI insurance, the bill would require that \n     servicers (and PMI companies) refund to the borrower any \n     premiums already paid for the period beyond the termination \n     date.\n       Beginning one year after enactment, S. 318 would require \n     lenders and servicers to provide written disclosures about \n     insurance cancellation rights to borrowers who are required \n     by creditors to obtain private mortgage insurance as a \n     condition for entering into a residential mortgage agreement. \n     S. 318 would require that the lender notify the borrower in \n     writing at or before closing of his cancellation rights under \n     PMI and give the borrower an amortization schedule. The \n     amortization schedule would be used to determine a \n     termination date at which the borrower would no longer be \n     required to pay insurance premiums. The bill also would \n     require, before closing, mandatory disclosures to purchasers \n     of lender-paid mortgage insurance indicating that lender-paid \n     mortgage insurance may not be canceled. After the initial \n     disclosure at loan origination, loan servicers would be \n     required to notify borrowers with ``borrower-paid'' PMI \n     (including existing loans with PMI) of their cancellation \n     rights in an annual written statement.\n     Estimated Costs of Mandates\n       In the first year after enactment, the total costs of the \n     mandates would consist of the costs to lenders and services \n     of modifying systems to accommodate the transmittal and \n     storage of additional data. Lenders and servicers would also \n     have to modify software programs to provide the required \n     additional disclosures to borrowers and to develop the \n     procedures to trigger automatic termination of PMI insurance \n     for eligible borrowers. In total, the initial ``set-up'' \n     costs should be somewhat below $100 million dollars. After an \n     initial set-up period of about one year, costs would likely \n     drop. The bulk of costs in the second year would cover \n     disclosure at or before settlement to roughly one million \n     borrowers required to purchase PMI insurance and annual \n     disclosure to about five million borrowers who already \n     have borrower-paid PMI insurance.\n       CBO estimates that costs to the mortgage industry would \n     gradually start to rise again in a few years as the cost to \n     servicers of terminating PMI policies, and the loss of \n     premium income to PMI companies start to accumulate. Most \n     loans to which automatic termination would apply would not \n     reach an LTV ratio of 78 percent to qualify for termination \n     until well after the five-year period of analysis required by \n     UMRA.\n     Estimated impact on State, local and tribal governments\n       Because state and local governments participate in mortgage \n     financing, they would bear some of the compliance costs of S. \n     318. CBO estimates that the state and local share of such \n     costs would total less than $5 million a year. All 50 states \n     and some local governments finance mortgages (primarily with \n     mortgage revenue bonds), 21 states service at least a portion \n     of their own mortgage portfolio, and seven states insure \n     mortgages. (The definition of private mortgage insurance used \n     in this bill includes insurance provided by state \n     governments. Only insurance provided by the federal \n     government is excluded.) Based on data from the National \n     Council of State Housing Agencies and Standard and Poors, CBO \n     estimates that state and local governments are involved in \n     less than 5 percent of mortgages that have private mortgage \n     insurance. Their share of the costs would thus be relatively \n     small.\n       S. 318 would also impose an additional mandate on state \n     governments by preempting certain state laws pertaining to \n     the termination or cancellation of private mortgage insurance \n     or the disclosure of certain information addressed by the \n     bill. Based on discussions with mortgage industry officials \n     and a review of certain state mortgage insurance laws, CBO \n     estimates that this mandate would impose no significant costs \n     on state governments nor would it result in the loss of any \n     revenue.\n       Previous CBO estimates: On April 7, 1997, CBO provided an \n     estimate for H.R. 607, the Homeowners Insurance Protection \n     Act, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Banking \n     and Financial Services on March 20, 1997. While both H.R. 607 \n     and S. 318 would require that borrowers be notified of their \n     rights to cancel mortgage insurance, these bills differ in \n     their requirements for automatic cancellation of mortgage \n     insurance. H.R. 607 would require automatic cancellation of \n     mortgage insurance when the mortgage has an LTV of 75 percent \n     (or less) while S. 318 would require automatic cancellation \n     of mortgage insurance when the mortgage has an LTV of 78 \n     percent (or less).\n       On September 17, 1997, CBO provided an estimate for H.R. \n     2343, a bill to terminate the Thrift Depositor Protection \n     Oversight Board, as ordered reported by the House Committee \n     on Banking and Financial Services on September 9, 1997. S. \n     318 would also eliminate the Oversight Board and would \n     transfer its remaining responsibilities to the Department of \n     the Treasury.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Susanne S.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on a bill which \nwill amend the act of incorporation of the American Legion. I have \nintroduced this bill with my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Last year, Congress expanded the dates of the Vietnam war for \npurposes of veterans benefits by shifting the official start of the war \nfrom December 22, 1961, to February 28, 1961. The bill before the \nSenate makes a similar change in the Legion's charter. When we pass \nthis into law the Legion will be able to extend membership to those men \nand women who served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces \nduring the early years of the Vietnam war. I am hopeful that we can \npass it by unanimous consent today, and have it signed into law by the \nPresident before we adjourn for the year.\n  Mr. President, this modest change will mean a lot to the veterans \nfrom that period who wanted the opportunity to join the American Legion \nbut never could. They have waited for more than 35 years to have the \nprivilege of becoming Legionnaires. We should not make them wait one \nday longer.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S11792]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
