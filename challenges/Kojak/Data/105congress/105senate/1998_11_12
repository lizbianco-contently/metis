Mr. President, in my floor remarks preceding the passage \nof the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 on October 9, 1998, \nI recognized three persons for their many hours of work and their \nimportant leadership roles in guiding this legislation to passage--\nSteve Moffitt of my\n\n[[Page S12985]]\n\nstaff, John Hanford on the staff of Senator Richard Lugar, and Cecile \nShea with Senator Joseph Leiberman.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to add to this honor roll the \nnames of several additional congressional staff whose efforts were \nessential to the crafting and historic passage of this legislation. \nOften when legislation is passed into law, we, who work in Congress, \nnever have the full benefit of seeing the aid and blessing which our \nefforts bring to others. This will assuredly be the case for this small \ngroup of staff who worked with such dedication and excellence for the \npassage of the International Religious Freedom Act. Their work has now \nreceived the unanimous acclaim of both Houses of Congress, as the \nSenate voted 98-0 in favor of this bill, followed the next day by a \nunanimous voice vote in the House. But, more importantly, I hope that \nthese individuals will rest in the satisfaction that their selfless \nefforts will, for decades to come, redound to the benefit of countless \npersons around the world imprisoned, tortured, or otherwise persecuted \nor restricted in the practice of their religious beliefs. This is an \nextraordinary and noble service which they have rendered to persons of \nfaith throughout the world, and I believe that it is important that we, \nas a congressional body, recognize their role in this historic \nachievement.\n  First, I wish to recognize two House staff members for their \nbrilliant and tireless work, beginning at the very inception of the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act and carrying all the way through to \nits final passage. Laura Bryant of the office of Congressman Bob \nClement and William Inboden, formerly with Congressman Tom DeLay, were \ntwo of the original ``visionaries'' for this bill, and their compassion \nfor suffering believers as well as their expertise on issues of \nreligious persecution are reflected on every page of the bill. I am \ndeeply grateful for their extraordinary contribution to this landmark \nlegislation.\n  In the Senate, I wish to express special commendation to Jim Jatras, \nForeign Affairs Specialist with the Republican Policy Committee. Mr. \nJatras is one of the most distinguished analysts of foreign policy on \nCapitol Hill and is a person to whom I have often turned for expert \ncounsel. In the case of the International Religious Freedom Act, Mr. \nJatras contributed vitally, both to the substance of the bill and to \nthe process of negotiation which led to its passage.\n  I wish, also, to express warmest thanks to Elaine Petty, with the \nstaff of Senator Connie Mack, who was a leading original cosponsor of \nthis act. Ms. Petty contributed many hours of work over the past 6 \nmonths toward the passage of this bill, and her efforts were especially \nimportant in discussions with other Senate offices and outside groups.\n  Special commendation is reserved for the remarkable expertise \ndemonstrated by Art Rynearson, Senior Counsel with the Office of Senate \nLegislative Counsel. Mr. Rynearson labored through numerous drafts of \nthis bill, and distinguished himself by his command of the process of \nlegislative drafting, by his patience and perseverance, and by his \ncommitment to excellence in creation of U.S. law. The Senate staffers \nwhich worked most closely with him have expressed deep gratitude for \nhis spirit of teamwork on this year-long endeavor.\n  In addition, I wish to express gratitude to Polly Craighill, who also \nserves on the staff of Senate Legislative Counsel. Ms. Craighill \nstepped in at a critical moment in the development of this act and \nprovided expert assistance requiring personal sacrifice on her part.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the important contributions made \nby several of the senior staff at Congressional Research Service. Larry \nEig, Legislative Attorney, Joyce Vialet, Refugee Affairs Expert, Vita \nBite, Foreign Affairs Expert, Jeanne Grimmet, Legislative Attorney, and \nDianne Rennack, Foreign Affairs Expert, all made important \ncontributions to the careful work of researching and scrutinizing \nissues involved in the content of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RESOLUTION OF RATIFICATION OF TREATIES\n\n  The text of the resolutions of ratification of treaties passed by the \nSenate on October 21, 1998 are as follows:\n\n       Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein), That the Senate advise and consent to the \n     ratification of the World Intellectual Property Organization \n     Copyright Treaty and the World Intellectual Property \n     Organization Performances and Phonograms Treaty, done at \n     Geneva on December 20, 1996, and signed by the United States \n     on April 12, 1997 (Treaty Doc. 105-17), subject to the \n     reservation of subsection (a), the declarations of subsection \n     (b), and the provisos of subsection (c).\n       (a) Reservation.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty is subject to the \n     following reservation, which shall be included in the \n     instrument of ratification and shall be binding on the \n     President:\n       Remuneration Right Limitation.--Pursuant to Article 15(3) \n     of the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, the United \n     States will apply the provisions of Article 15(1) of the WIPO \n     Performances and Phonograms Treaty only in respect of certain \n     acts of broadcasting and communication to the public by \n     digital means for which a direct or indirect fee is charged \n     for reception, and for other retransmissions and digital \n     phonorecord deliveries, as provided under the United States \n     law.\n       (b) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) Limited Reservations Provisions.--It is the Sense of \n     the Senate that a ``limited reservations'' provision, such as \n     that contained in Article 21 of the Performances and \n     Phonograms Treaty, and a ``no reservations'' provision, such \n     as that contained in Article 22 of the Copyright Treaty, have \n     the effect of inhibiting the Senate in its exercise of its \n     constitutional duty to give advice and consent to \n     ratification of a treaty, and the Senate's approval of these \n     treaties should not be construed as a precedent for \n     acquiescence to future treaties containing such provisions.\n       (2) Treaty Interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and Condition (8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the

Mr. President, during debate on final passage of \nthe Omnibus Appropriations bill, in which the American Competitiveness \nand Workforce Improvement Act was included as Title IV of Subdivision \nC, I asked unanimous consent to have a number of documents printed in \nthe Record. These included two documents I received from the \nAdministration during the negotiations, whose inclusion I was seeking \nto help illuminate the meaning of some of the provisions of the \nlegislation. One of the key points about these documents is the changes \nfrom the July 30 version to the September 14 version. On the copies \nthat I submitted, these changes were marked by redlining markings. \nUnfortunately, however, because I submitted a copy of the only version \nI had, which was a copy of a fax, these markings appear to have had the \neffect of making the September 14 version unintelligible, resulting in \nthe printing of a garbled text that also did not contain the markings \nshowing the changes. Accordingly, I ask that the corrected version of \nthese documents that I am now submitting appear in the final issue of \nthe Record of the 105th Congress. On the copy of the September 14 \ndocument that I am submitting, material that appeared in the July 30 \nversion but was deleted in the September 14 version is in black \nbrackets and material that was not included in the July 30 version and \nwas added in the September 14 version is printed in italic.\n  The corrected version follows:\n\nJuly 30, 1998--Proposed Administration Revisions to H.R. 3736 (the July \n                           29, 1998 Version)\n\n       1.

Strike the provision that ``[n]othing in the \n     [recruitment attestation] shall be construed to prohibit an \n     employer from using selection standards normal or customary \n     to the type of job involved.''\n       b. Clarify that job contractors can be sanctioned for \n     placing an H-1B worker with an employer who subsequently lays \n     off a U.S. worker within the 90 days following placement.\n       c.

I want to take the \nopportunity today to clarify one aspect of that statement to ensure \nthat my words and their import are accurate.\n  I stated on October 8th that the so-called Starr Report failed to \nmention Ms. Lewinsky's testimony ``that when she asked President \nClinton whether she should get rid of his gifts to her in light of the \nJones subpoena, his response was `I don't know' '' and her testimony \nthat the President said he didn't want to see Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit \nwhen she offered to show it to him. The reference in my statement \nshould have been to Mr. Starr's analysis of the evidence which is the \nkey part of his report instead of the overall report. Mr. Starr did \nmake reference to such testimony in the part of the report where he \nsummarized the evidence. My criticism of Mr. Starr's report is that he \nleft such exculpatory evidence out of or dismissed it in the key part \nof his report which analyzes the evidence and explains why he believes \nthe evidence ``may constitute grounds for impeachment.''\n  Otherwise it was the imbalanced analysis of the evidence where Mr. \nStarr failed to address the significance or relevance of exculpatory \nfacts such as these which is so disturbing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S12996-1", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12996-S12997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            APPLICATION OF STATE LAW TO FEDERAL PROSECUTORS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to register serious concern \nover a provision in the Omnibus Appropriations bill, included as I \nunderstand it over the protest of the Senate. This is a legislative \nprovision appended to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nportion of the bill that subjects federal prosecutors and other \n``attorneys for the Government'' to State laws and rules governing \nattorneys ``to the same extent and in the same manner as other \nattorneys in that State.''\n  Now please understand, Mr. President. I think I am as much of a \nbeliever in federalism as anyone here. But federalism does not mean \nthat control of all matters should be ceded to the States. One area \nwhere I think it is pretty clear that the national government should be \nthe principal source of law is in setting rules of professional conduct \nfor its own officers. To leave that question to the States, it seems to \nme, is to cede a very large portion of the control for how federal law \nis to be enforced to the States. That power can then be used to \nfrustrate the enforcement of federal law. The risk that this will \nhappen is significantly greater where the power is being turned over \nnot to the States' elected representatives, but to bar associations \nvested with the States' powers, but without the accountability to the \npeople of the States that elections generate.\n  I believe that we can be pretty sure that this provision imposing \nState laws and rules on federal prosecutors will be used to frustrate \nfederal law simply by looking at the rules the State bars already have \nadopted that will have this effect. I believe this trend will only \naccelerate once those opposed to certain aspects of federal law know, \nas a result of our adoption of this provision, that they have this new \ntool at their disposal.\n  For many years members of the criminal defense bar have been \nsponsoring rules adopted in State codes of professional responsibility \nthat trench upon legitimate and essential practices of federal \nprosecutors. The best known example involves rules of States such as \nCalifornia, Missouri, and New Mexico, as well as the District of \nColumbia, that limit prosecutors' contacts with represented persons in \na way that can seriously complicate undercover investigations. The \nproblem with this prohibition is that a low-level member of an \norganized crime ring may well be represented by counsel retained by the \nleaders of the ring. As a result, counsel's principal interest may be \nin preventing his or her ``client'' from giving useful information \nabout those leaders to law enforcement--even if doing so would be in \nthe client's interest because the client might get less prison time.\n  But the ``represented parties'' context is not the only one where \nState rules governing attorneys raise problems. Colorado, New \nHampshire, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee have ``ethics'' rules requiring \nprior judicial approval of subpoenas of attorneys, even though federal \ncase law has (for good reason) adopted no such requirement. Colorado \nalso has a rule requiring submission of exculpatory evidence to grand \njuries, which it adopted shortly after the Supreme Court found in \nUnited States versus Williams that federal courts could not use their \n``supervisory powers'' to impose such an obligation. And, at least \naccording to the 10th Circuit's vacated Singleton opinion, it is an \n``unethical'' practice, under Kansas state rules, for an Assistant U.S. \nAttorney to offer leniency in exchange for truthful testimony. Even \nassuming the 10th Circuit does not reinstate that portion of the panel \nopinion when it rules en banc, hardly an inevitable outcome, the \nsuggestion the opinion made will continue to chill any federal \nprosecutor practicing in Kansas. It will continue to do so regardless \nof what the 10th Circuit does, since Kansas could adopt this theory \neven if the Tenth Circuit abandons it. Indeed, any State bar will be \nfree to declare that offering leniency to accomplices to obtain their \ntestimony is ``unethical'' and, under the provision we have unwisely \nadopted, that rule will control federal prosecutions. The result will \nbe a drastic reduction in the effectiveness of federal efforts to \ncombat crime.\n  State bar associations have adopted the rules I have described \ndespite previously grave doubt about their legal authority to make \nthese rules binding on federal prosecutors. It seems to me that now \nthat we have established as a matter of federal law that six months \nfrom now, rules like this will indeed govern federal prosecutors' \nconduct, these rules will only multiply further. For example, States \ncould ban as unethical the forfeiture of cash intended to pay a defense \nlawyer--indeed, the ABA came very close to doing just that in an \nattempt effectively to overrule the Supreme Court's holding Caplin & \nDrysdale. States could rule it ``unethical'' to examine a witness in \nthe grand jury room without his attorney being present, or to adduce \nevidence of one party-consent tape recordings--proposals the Senate, of \ncourse, rejected last month during the CJS debate. The potential list \nis limited only by the criminal defense bar's imagination.\n  To be sure, the Department of Justice can argue its case to the bar \nassociations considering such rules. But that is no solution. At best, \nit will require an inordinate expenditure of effort and resources that \ncould instead be used to lock up dangerous criminals. At worst, and \nmore likely in my view, the Department will lose the argument much of \nthe time, and we will end up with constraints on federal officers that \nbear no connection with the federal policies those officers are charged \nwith enforcing.\n  This is not to say that I am opposed to requiring that lawyers who \nwork for the federal government behave professionally. I am not. In \nfact, I am strongly for it. But I believe that it makes no sense to \nhave the judgment about what ``professional conduct'' consists of be\n\n[[Page S12997]]\n\nmade by State bar associations. Of necessity these associations have \nlittle or no stake in securing the enforcement of the federal laws with \nwhich these federal government lawyers are charged; and it is easy to \nimagine instances where a number of their members may have an \naffirmative stake in frustrating that enforcement.\n  Perhaps my concerns will turn out to be misplaced. I understand that \none important concession the Senate obtained in the negotiations \nleading up to the inclusion of this provision in the omnibus \nlegislation is a 6 month delay in the provision's effective date. This \nwill give us some opportunity to see whether the result of the adoption \nof this provision is a greater effort by the State bars to accommodate \nfederal interests, or the opposite. It will also give us a better \nopportunity to assess what the real impact of applying existing State \nrules in the context of federal prosecutions will be. In the long run, \nhowever, it seems to me that the right answer here is not for the \nfederal government to abdicate to State bars the important \nresponsibility of establishing these rules, but, at least with respect \nto its own officers, to perform that responsibility itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S12996-2", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO 1999 MARYLAND TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SARBANES.

Through the use of innovative \nteaching techniques, including learning games and exploration of the \ninternet, Mrs. Younkers has brought a fresh perspective to her \nteachings.\n  It has always been my firm belief that the education and training of \nour young people is one of the most important tasks in a democratic \nsociety. Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the hard work that has led Mrs. Younkers to receive this \nrecognition. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Southern \nMaryland Extra to the Washington Post be inserted into the Record \nimmediately following my remarks, and I yield the floor.\n\n   (From the Washington Post, Southern Maryland Extra, Oct. 22, 1998)\n\n       In Room, 216 at Plum Point Middle School, social studies \n     teacher Rachael Younkers is quizzing her students on the \n     great European explorers: Christopher Columbus, Vasco da \n     Gama, Sir Francis Drake and so forth. You wouldn't think a \n     roomful of 13-year-olds would be interested in a bunch of \n     long-dead strangers, but that's clearly not the case in this \n     class.\n       Hand after hand shoots up in the air, students eager to \n     supply the appropriate answers. Later, when the class \n     adjourns to the library, the youngsters rush about looking \n     for the needed information. There's a certain excitement in \n     the air, a feeling that school and learning and even homework \n     can be, well, fun.\n       Plum Point Principal Michael Reidy sums up the situation \n     this way: ``Mrs. Younkers has a spirit about her that creates \n     magic in the classroom.''\n       That spirit has won Younkers the title of 1999 Maryland \n     Teacher of the Year. Younkers, 27, is the youngest teacher to \n     win the award in its 12-year history and the first from \n     Southern Maryland. She received the award--which includes a \n     $5,000 check and other prizes--at a ceremony Friday evening \n     in Baltimore.\n       Younkers has taught seventh- and eighth-grade social \n     studies at the Huntingtown school for five years, her entire \n     career in education. Younkers, a native of Calvert County, \n     said her inspiration in teaching has been her mother, a \n     social studies teacher at Northern High School. One of the \n     most important lessons her mother passed along was the \n     importance of actively involving students in their education, \n     she said.\n       ``My teaching philosophy is based on an ancient Chinese \n     proverb: `Tell me, I forget. Show me, I remember. Involve me, \n     I understand,' '' Younkers said.\n       And involve her students she does. During a class on \n     Tuesday, Younkers divided her 28 eighth-graders into teams \n     and dispatched them to the library to research a specific \n     explorer. Among their tasks: Finding the explorer's \n     photograph on the Internet, drawing a detailed picture of his \n     ship and writing a daily log of weather conditions during his \n     voyage. The students even had to compose a letter to the king \n     and queen explaining why they should fund the explorer's \n     trip.\n       ``Learning is not a spectator sport,'' Younkers said. ``The \n     kids are the actual players in the game, and they need to be \n     actively involved in their own learning. I see myself as a \n     partner in their education, and that's how we win.''\n       Her students seem to like the technique. ``It's not like \n     we're talking about a lot of dead guys,'' said Nathan Bowen, \n     an eighth-grader from Prince Frederick. ``She really brings \n     it to life.''\n       Nathan said he especially likes all the fun games Younkers \n     comes up with, including baseball and basketball matches that \n     are played in the classroom and adapted to the subject being \n     studied. Treasure hunts and ``Social Studies Jeopardy'' also \n     are frequent occurrences in Room 216.\n       Larkin Jones, also an eighth-grader, said she admires her \n     teacher's personality. ``She's always smiling and happy, and \n     she knows a lot about you.'' And that fact that she's young \n     makes it ``really easy to talk to her,'' Jones said.\n       Indeed, Younkers has made such an impression on Larkin that \n     she recently confided in her mother that she might want to be \n     a social studies teacher when she grows up, ``just like Mrs. \n     Younkers.''\n       ``She's been a tremendous influence on her,'' said Donna \n     Jones, Larkin's mother. Jones, a guidance counselor at Plum \n     Point added that Younkers has a unique ability to help all \n     students--whether they're honor roll or in need of remedial \n     instruction.'' As a counselor, it's very comforting to know \n     that no matter what level a student is, if they have Mrs. \n     Younkers, they'll have a wonderful year.''\n       Younkers beat out 23 state semi-finalists, who were chosen \n     from among Maryland's 49,000 teachers. She now advances to \n     the national Teacher of the Year competition.\n       For the national contest, she must adopt an issue that she \n     will advocate. Younkers said she will work to encourage the \n     best and the brightest students to become teachers. Maryland, \n     like other states, will face a severe teacher shortage in \n     coming years, and, as Younkers said, ``Our students deserve \n     to learn from highly qualified instructors.''\n       The national Teacher of the Year will be selected in the \n     spring. In the meantime, Younkers is maintaining a rigorous \n     speaking tour--talking to other educators, as well as \n     politicians--and her students are getting used to the extra \n     media attention and the parents who stop by with gifts and \n     words of praise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S12997-1", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF ST.

Mr. President, I am very pleased that the \nQuincy Library Group bill has been included in the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill. This legislation embodies the consensus proposal \nof the Quincy Library Group, a coalition of environmentalists, timber \nindustry representatives, and local elected officials in Northern \nCalifornia, who came together to resolve their long-standing conflicts \nover timber management on the national forest lands in their area.\n  The Quincy Library Group legislation is a real victory for local \nconsensus decision making. It proves that even some of the most \nintractable environmental issues can be resolved if people work \ntogether toward a common goal.\n  I first met the Quincy Library Group back in 1992 when I was running \nfor the Senate, and was then very impressed with what they were trying \nto do.\n  The members of the Quincy Library Group had seen first hand the \nconflict between timber harvesting and jobs, environmental laws and \nprotection of their communities and forests, and the devastation of \nmassive forest fires. Their overriding concern was that a catastrophic \nfire could destroy both the natural environment and the potential for \njobs and economic stability in their community. They were also \nconcerned the ongoing stalemate over forest management was ultimately \nharming both the environment and their local economy.\n  The group got together and talked things out. They decided to meet in \na quiet, non-confrontational environment--the main room of the Quincy \nPublic Library. They began their dialogue in the recognition that they \nshared the common goal of fostering forest health, keeping ecological \nintegrity, assuring an adequate timber supply for area mills, and \nproviding economic stability for their community.\n  One of the best articles I have read about the Quincy Library Group \nprocess recently appeared in the Washington Post. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the end \nof my statement.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER: Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, after dozens of meetings and a year \nand a half of negotiation, the Quincy Library Group developed an \nalternative management plan for the Lassen National Forest, Plumas \nNational Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe \nNational Forest.\n  In the last five years, the group has tried to persuade the U.S. \nForest Service to administratively implement the plan they developed. \nWhile the Forest Service was interested in the plan developed, they \nwere unwilling to fully implement it. Negotiations and discussions \nbegan in Congress. This legislation is the result.\n\n\n                  The Quincy Library Group Legislation\n\n  Specifically, the legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \nimplement the Quincy Library Group's forest management proposal on \ndesignated lands in the Plumas, Lassen and Tahoe National Forests for \nfive years as a demonstration of community-based consensus forest \nmanagement. I would like to thank Senators Murkowski, Bumpers, and \nCraig, Representatives Herger and Miller, as well as the Clinton \nAdministration, for the thoughts they contributed to the development of \nthe final bill.\n  The legislation establishes significant new environmental protections \nin the Quincy Library Group project area. It protects hundreds of \nthousands of acres of environmentally sensitive lands, including all \nCalifornia spotted owl habitat, as well as roadless areas. Placing \nthese areas off limits to logging and road construction protects many \nareas that currently are not protected, including areas identified as \nold-growth and sensitive watersheds in the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem \nProject report.\n  However, in the event that any sensitive old growth is not already \nincluded in the legislation's off base areas, the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee provided report language when the \nlegislation was reported last year, as I requested, directing the \nForest Service to avoid conducting timber harvest activities or road \nconstruction in these late successional old-growth areas. The \nlegislation also requires a program of riparian management, including \nwide protection zones and streamside restoration projects.\n  The Quincy Library Group legislation directs the Forest Service to \namend the land and resource management plans for the Plumas, Lassen, \nand Tahoe National Forests to consider adoption of the Quincy Library \nGroup plan in the forest management plans. The legislation does not \nrequire the Forest Service to continue implementing the Quincy Library \nGroup pilot project once the forest plans are revised. The Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee adopted an amendment, which I \nsupported, to ensure that there is no conflict between the pilot \nproject and the most current and best science reflected in any new \nforest plans.\n\n\n                  Misinformation About The Legislation\n\n  There have been a number of inaccurate statements made the Quincy \nLibrary Group legislation. I want to clear up three important points:\n  First, every single environmental law, including the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act and the National Forest Management Act, will \nbe followed as this proposal is implemented. The legislation explicitly \nstates, ``Nothing in this section exempts the pilot project from any \nFederal environmental law.''\n  The legislation requires an environmental impact statement to be \ncompleted before any resource management activities occur. It also \nprovides for full public participation and input throughout the pilot \nproject's implementation.\n  Second, the Quincy Library Group legislation does not double the \nvolume of logging on the affected national forests. The intent of this \nproposal has always been to replace, not supplement, current logging \nactivity, and the legislation will provide for timber harvests similar \nto current levels.\n  In a letter to me dated October 22, 1997, Ronald Stewart, Deputy \nChief of Programs and Legislation for the Forest Service, states, \n``based on the agency's current estimates, the potential timber outputs \nthat would be generated by this bill, if fully funded with additional \nappropriations, would not double but would remain consistent with the \noutputs provided from these forests over the last five years.''\n  Third, the legislation explicitly prohibits the funding of Quincy \nLibrary Group projects through reallocation of funds from other \nnational forests. The legislation explicitly states, ``The Secretary \nmay not conduct the pilot project using funds appropriated for any \nother unit of the National Forest System.''\n  The bottom line is that the Quincy Library Group legislation will \nprovide strong protections for the environment while preserving the job \nbase in the Northern Sierra--not just in one single company, but across \n35 area businesses, many of them small and family-owned.\n  This Quincy Library Group legislation is strongly supported by local \nenvironmentalists, labor unions, elected officials, the timber \nindustry, and 27 California counties. The House approved the Quincy \nLibrary Group legislation by a vote of 429 to one last year. The Senate \nEnergy Committee reported the legislation last October. The legislation \nhas been the subject of Congressional hearings and the focus of \nnationwide public discussion.\n  I thank my colleagues for ensuring that this worthy pilot project has \na chance.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 11, 1998]\n\n                    Grass-Roots Seeds of Compromise\n\n                (By Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer)\n\n       Every month since 1993, about 30 environmentalists, \n     loggers, biologists, union representatives and local \n     government officials have met at the library of Quincy--a \n     timber town in northern California that has been the site of \n     a nasty 15-year battle over logging.\n       Out of these monthly meetings has emerged a plan to manage \n     2.4 million acres of the surrounding national forests. \n     Instead of leaving the forests' ecological fate solely to \n     Washington-based agencies and national interest groups, the \n     once-bitter adversaries have tried to forge a compromise \n     solution on the ground--a green version of Jeffersonian \n     democracy. When the House of Representatives, notorious for \n     its discord on environmental legislation, approved the plan \n     429-1 in July 1997, the Quincy Library Group became the \n     symbol for a promising new means of resolving America's \n     intractable environmental disputes.\n\n[[Page S12999]]\n\n       The Quincy Library Group is one of scores of citizens' \n     associations that in the past decade have brought together \n     people who previously met only in court. Sometimes called \n     ``community-based conservation'' groups, they include the \n     Friends of the Cheat River, a West Virginia coalition working \n     to restore a waterway damaged by mining runoff; the Applegate \n     Partnership, which hopes to restore a watershed in \n     southwestern Oregon while keeping timber jobs alive, and \n     Envision Utah, which tries to foster consensus about how to \n     manage growth in and around Salt Lake City.\n       Like many similar organizations, the Quincy Library Group \n     was born of frustration. In the 1980s, Quincy-based \n     environmental advocates, led by local attorney Michael B. \n     Jackson, attempted with varying success to block more than a \n     dozen U.S. Forest Service timber sales in the surrounding \n     Plumas, Lassen and Tahoe national forests. The constant \n     battles tied the federal agency in knots and almost shut down \n     Sierra Pacific Industries, the biggest timber company there, \n     imperiling many jobs. The atmosphere was ``openly hostile, \n     with agitators on both sides,'' says Linda Blum, a local \n     activist who joined forces with Jackson in 1990 and aroused \n     so much opprobrium that Quincy radio hosts denounced her on \n     the air for taking food from the mouths of the town's \n     children.\n       Worn down and dismayed by the hostility in his community, \n     Jackson was ready to try something different. He got a chance \n     to do so late in 1992, when Bill Coates, a Plumas County \n     supervisor, invited the factions to talk to each other, face \n     to face. Coates suggested that the group work from forest-\n     management plans proposed by several local environmental \n     organizations in the mid-1980s. By early 1993, they were \n     meeting at the library and soon put together a new proposal. \n     (The Forest Service eventually had to drop out because the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act, which places cumbersome \n     requirements on groups who meet with federal agencies.) Under \n     this proposal, timber companies could continue thinning and \n     selectively logging in up to 70,000 acres per year, about the \n     same area being logged in 1993 but drastically lower than the \n     1990 level. Riverbanks and roadless areas, almost half the \n     area covered by the plan, would be off-limits.\n       The Quincy group asked the Forest Service to incorporate \n     its proposal into the official plans for the three national \n     forests, but never got a definite answer. Convinced that the \n     agency was too dysfunctional to respond, in 1996 the group \n     took its plan to their congressman, Wally Herger, a \n     conservative Republican. Herger introduced the Quincy \n     proposal in the House, hoping to instruct the agency to heed \n     the wishes of local communities. It passed overwhelmingly--\n     perhaps the only time that Reps. Helen Chenoweth (R-Idaho), a \n     vehement property-rights advocate, and George Miller (D-\n     Calif.) one of the greenest legislators on Capitol Hill, have \n     agreed on an environmental law. Then the bill went to the \n     Senate--and slammed into resistance from big environmental \n     lobbies.\n       From the start, the Quincy group had kept in touch with the \n     Wilderness Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council and \n     the Sierra Club. The three organizations offered comments, \n     and the Quincy group incorporated some. Still, the national \n     groups continued to balk, instead submitting detailed \n     criteria necessary to ``merit'' their support. When the \n     Quincy plan became proposed legislation, the national groups \n     stepped up their attacks. The Quincy approach, said Sierra \n     Club legal director Debbie Sease, had a ``basic underlying \n     flaw'' using a cooperative, local decision-making process to \n     manage national assets. Jay Watson, regional director of the \n     Wilderness Society, said: ``Just because a group of local \n     people can come to agreement doesn't mean that it is good \n     public policy.'' And because such parochial efforts are \n     inevitably ill-informed and always risk domination by rich, \n     sophisticated industry representatives, the Audubon Society \n     warned, they are ``not necessarily equipped to view the \n     bigger picture.'' Considering this bigger picture, it \n     continued, ``is the job of Congress, and of watchdog groups \n     like the National Audubon Society.''\n       Many local groups regard national organizations as more \n     interested in protecting their turf than in achieving \n     solutions that advance conservation. ``It's interesting to me \n     that it has to be top-down,'' said Jack Shipley, a member of \n     the Applegate Partnership. ``It's a power issue, a control \n     issue.'' The big groups' insistence on veto power over local \n     decision-making ``sounds like the old rhetoric--either their \n     way or no way,'' Shipley says. ``No way'' may be the fate of \n     the Quincy bill. Pressured by environmental lobbies, Sen. \n     Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) placed a hold on it in the Senate.\n       Despite the group's setback, community-based conservation \n     efforts like Quincy provide a glimpse of the future. Under \n     the traditional approach to environmental management, \n     decisions have been delegated to impartial bureaucracies--the \n     Forest Service, for example, for national forests. Based on \n     the scientific evaluations of ecologists and economists, the \n     agencies then formulate the ``right'' policies, preventing \n     what James Madison called ``the mischief of faction.''\n       But today, according to Mark Sagoff of the University of \n     Maryland Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, it is \n     the bureaucrats who are beset by factions; big business and \n     environmental lobbies. For these special-interest groups, he \n     argues, ``deliberating with others to resolve problems \n     undermines the group's mission, which is to press its purpose \n     or concern as far as it can in a zero-sum game with its \n     political adversaries.'' The system ``benefits the lawyers, \n     lobbyists and expert witnesses who serve in various causes as \n     mercenaries,'' he says, ``but it produces no policy worth a \n     damn.''\n       In contrast, community-based conservation depends on all \n     sides acknowledging the legitimacy of each other's values. \n     Participants are not guaranteed to get exactly what they \n     want; no one has the power to stand by and judge the \n     ``merit'' of the results. Although ecology and economics play \n     central roles, ecologists and economists have no special \n     place. Like everyone else, they must sit at the table as \n     citizens, striving to make their community and its \n     environment a better place to live.\n       In short, Quincy's efforts and those like it represent a \n     new type of environmentalism: republican environmentalism, \n     with a small ``r.'' This new approach cannot address global \n     problems like climate change. Nor should it be routinely \n     accepted if a local group decides on irrevocable changes in \n     areas of paramount national interest--filling in the Grand \n     Canyon, say. But even if some small town would be foolish \n     enough to decide to do something destructive, there's a whole \n     framework of national environment laws that would prevent it \n     from happening. And, despite the resistance of the national \n     organizations, the environmental movement should not reject \n     this new approach out of hand. Efforts to protect the \n     environment over the past 25 years have produced substantial \n     gains, but have lately degenerated into a morass of \n     litigation and lobbying. Community-based conservation has the \n     potential to change things on the ground, where it matters \n     most.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S12997-3", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12999-S13001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT\n\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on October 9, 1998, the Senate, by \na vote of 98-0, passed the International Religious Freedom Act. As the \nsponsor of the International Religious Freedom Act, I am providing this \nstatement which gives some guidance as to what I tried to accomplish in \ncrafting this Act.\n\n                               Background\n\n       With enactment of the International Religious Freedom Act, \n     there will be a major increase in the amount of information \n     on the nature and extent of violations of religious freedom \n     in foreign countries, in the actions taken by the U.S. \n     government in response to those violations and in the \n     scrutiny of the steps taken by the U.S. government to combat \n     them. Sadly, events around the world demonstrate the need for \n     the International Religious Freedom Act.\n       It has been reported that more than half of the world's \n     population lives under governments that place restrictions or \n     outright prohibitions on the ability to practice one's \n     religion. While the end of the Cold War saw a significant \n     increase in religious freedom in many countries, in others \n     there has been no change. Totalitarian governments either \n     continue to stamp out religion or subject it to state \n     controls through arrest, torture, beatings, imprisonment and \n     unemployment.\n       One such government has used massacre, starvation, and \n     forced resettlement as a tool in the effort to crush \n     resistance in its mostly Christian region. There have been \n     reports of the crucifixion of Christians, although these \n     reports cannot be confirmed. What has been confirmed is the \n     revival of slavery, abduction and mutilation. Displaced \n     refugees have been confronted with forced conversion or \n     starvation.\n       In other countries, reports abound of attacks by extremists \n     or by government forces on Christians, and on their homes, \n     businesses, and churches. Converts to Christianity are \n     imprisoned and tortured. In several countries no overt \n     practice of any religion but the state religion is permitted, \n     and conversion is illegal. These prohibitions affect \n     virtually every religion around the world.\n\n                The International Religious Freedom Act\n\n       This is the backdrop which led to the International \n     Religious Freedom Act. The International Religious Freedom \n     Act was crafted with four core principles. First, the \n     International Religious Freedom Act is comprehensive both in \n     the scope of covered violations, and in the full range of \n     tools it provides to address the violations. By crafting a \n     definition of violations of religious freedom that focuses on \n     the most common types of violations as well as the most \n     egregious, the Act attempts to resolve the problem before \n     these violations escalate into torture, imprisonment and even \n     death.\n       Second, the International Religious Freedom Act was crafted \n     to require action while preserving necessary flexibility for \n     the President. The International Religious Freedom Act \n     contains a menu of options, including eight diplomatic and \n     seven economic measures, from which the President must choose \n     for each country that engages in violations of religious \n     freedom. The Act also allows the President to calibrate any \n     economic measure. The President can, for instance, suspend or \n     limit foreign assistance, rather than cut it off entirely. \n     The Act gives the President an additional option of taking \n     commensurate action for any of the 15 options if the \n     President determines that by doing so he can further the \n     policy of the United States set forth in this Act. Finally,\n\n[[Page S13000]]\n\n     the President can exercise a waiver if important national \n     interests require it, or if it would be harmful to those the \n     Act seeks to help.\n       The provisions of the International Religious Freedom Act \n     give the President economic and diplomatic tools to use that \n     will best fit the situation and most appropriately deal with \n     the problem. These tools can be modified based on the level \n     of persecution in the country, the country engaging in the \n     persecution and our relationship with that country. This \n     flexibility ensures that the International Religious Freedom \n     Act will be more effective. The goal of the International \n     Religious Freedom Act is not to punish countries but to \n     change behavior.\n       Third, the International Religious Freedom Act promotes \n     long-term change through several means, including \n     comprehensive human rights and religious freedom training for \n     U.S. officials and representatives, both in the Foreign \n     Service and in the Immigration and Naturalization Service. \n     The Act authorizes U.S. assistance for the development of \n     legal protections abroad, broadcasting and scholarly \n     exchanges to promote religious freedom, and awards for \n     meritorious Foreign Service Officers.\n       Fourth, the International Religious Freedom Act establishes \n     several positions to ensure a permanent profile on and \n     attention to religious freedom. It establishes an Ambassador \n     at Large for International Religious Freedom which is a \n     permanent diplomatic position to spearhead U.S. advocacy for \n     religious freedom internationally. The Act also establishes a \n     Commission for International Religious Freedom to ensure \n     accountability, and to provide independent policy \n     recommendations as the Act is implemented. The Annual Report \n     further provides accountability by reporting the actions of \n     the U.S. government.\n\n  The following is a commentary on several sections of the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act.\n\n       Section 101. Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Liberty: \n     This section creates a high-profile diplomat under the \n     Secretary of State, vested with the authority to continually \n     and forcefully raise the issue of religious persecution in \n     bilateral and multilateral forums. The Ambassador is \n     responsible for ensuring advocacy for, and high-quality \n     reporting on, religious freedom by American Embassies around \n     the world. The Ambassador also is to make policy \n     recommendations to the President and the Secretary of State \n     to advance the right to religious freedom abroad.\n       Section 102. Reporting: This section strengthens existing \n     reporting requirements. The Ambassador is to assist in the \n     preparation of the sections on religious freedom in the State \n     Department Human Rights Country Reports, and embassy \n     personnel are directed to seek out and investigate reports of \n     violations of religious freedom.\n       This section also creates an Annual Report on International \n     Religious Freedom. This report details the status of \n     religious freedom in each country around the world, and \n     provides a comprehensive accounting of the violations of \n     religious freedom, how severe they are and where they occur. \n     The report is to give an indication of trends towards \n     improvements in protecting religious liberty, and trends \n     toward the deterioration of that protection. The report will \n     also include information regarding U.S. government actions \n     taken to promote religious freedom abroad. The U.S. \n     government, when compiling this report, must work with non-\n     governmental organizations (NGOs), when appropriate, to \n     ensure that each report contains the most accurate \n     information.\n       The Annual Report must also include information on the \n     forced conversion of minor U.S. citizens living abroad. It \n     has come to my attention that our government has done little \n     to resolve cases of the victimization of minors who have been \n     taken to a foreign land, subjected to forced religious \n     conversion, and prevented under the laws of those nations \n     from returning to the United States where they would enjoy \n     religious freedom.\n       In some cases, especially for girls, this amounts to a life \n     sentence of living abroad. In some countries, women may not \n     travel abroad without the permission of their father or \n     husband. The State Department should work to secure the \n     rights of its citizens--including those living abroad, and \n     the Commission on International Religious Freedom should \n     monitor these cases.\n       Each year, the Secretary of State, working with the \n     Ambassador, must present this report to Congress by September \n     1. An Executive Summary highlighting the countries of \n     greatest concern with regard to religious freedom and \n     countries demonstrating significant improvement in the \n     protection of that right is to accompany the report. A \n     classified, more detailed addendum may be provided to \n     Congress.\n       Section 103. Internet Site for Religious Liberty: To assist \n     NGOs around the world, the Act establishes a State Department \n     Internet site posting the Annual Report, the Executive \n     Summary and other international documents on religious \n     freedom.\n       Section 104. Religious Freedom Training: To ensure \n     awareness by Foreign Service officers of the nature and scope \n     of violations of religious freedom, the Act amends the \n     Foreign Service Act of 1980 to require training in human \n     rights, including violations of religious freedom, as \n     standard training for Foreign Service officers. Training is \n     mandatory for officers with reporting responsibilities and \n     for Chiefs of Mission.\n       Section 105 & 106. Contacts with NGOs: Embassies are \n     required to seek out religious NGOs and meet with imprisoned \n     religious leaders where appropriate and beneficial. These \n     contacts will not only help our government gather the facts \n     accurately as it prepares the Annual Report, but also will \n     prove valuable as our government seeks to formulate \n     policies to promote religious freedom around the world, as \n     described in section 403. A Sense of the Congress directs \n     embassies to craft a strategy for the promotion of \n     religious liberty.\n       Section 107. Equal Access to U.S. Embassies: The Act grants \n     access to U.S. citizens (and, at the embassy's discretion, to \n     nationals) to U.S. missions abroad for religious activities \n     on a basis no less favorable than for other nongovernmental \n     activities unrelated to the conduct of the diplomatic \n     mission. For instance, it is inconsistent that permission be \n     granted by U.S. missions to allow the dispensing and social \n     consumption of alcoholic beverages and the serving of pork \n     products, contrary to local law, while discouraging such \n     permission for holding religious services. The fact that \n     several other foreign consulates afford access to worship for \n     their citizens disproves the suggestion that diplomatic \n     interests preclude similar provision for Americans by the \n     State Department. Many other social and American community \n     activities without discernable diplomatic purpose will no \n     doubt continue, and in most cases should continue. Religious \n     service access requests under section 107 may receive no less \n     consideration than these other activities occurring on U.S. \n     mission premises.\n       Section 108. Prisoner Database and Issue Briefs: To prompt \n     advocacy at every possible opportunity, the bill directs the \n     State Department to maintain country-specific lists of \n     religious prisoners and issue briefs on policies restricting \n     religious liberty, to be provided to executive branch and \n     Congressional leaders for use in meetings with foreign \n     dignitaries. In compiling these lists, the Act gives the \n     Secretary of State the discretion to decide whether including \n     a name on the list harms or helps the prisoner.\n       Sections 201 to 206. The International Religious Freedom \n     Act establishes a United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom. This Commission, which is bipartisan in \n     composition and will include both presidential and \n     Congressional appointees, will ensure that the President and \n     the Congress receive independent recommendations--and where \n     necessary, criticism--of American policy in support of \n     international religious freedom.\n       The Commission consists of 10 persons (including the \n     Ambassador at Large, who sits as an ex officio, non-voting \n     member), chosen for a period of two years; the Commission \n     sunsets in four years unless reauthorized. The innovative \n     appointment structure established in this Act ensures that \n     five commissioners will be selected by the President's \n     political party and four commissioners by the other political \n     party, no matter which political party controls the White \n     House or either house of Congress. While this Act \n     appropriately defers to the President's constitutional \n     authority in conducting policy toward foreign states, it is \n     the intent of Congress that the Commission hold policy makers \n     accountable to the purposes of this Act, and, thus, ensure \n     the Act's effectiveness.\n       The Commission will review the ongoing facts and \n     circumstances of violations of religious freedom (both from \n     government reports and from other sources) and make policy \n     recommendations. While the Commission's annual report on May \n     1 will stand as its main formal duty under the sequence of \n     requirements established by the Act, it is the intent of \n     Congress that the Commission be diligent in monitoring \n     violations of religious freedom on an ongoing basis and \n     make its policy recommendations on a timely basis and with \n     an urgency and specificity appropriate to circumstances.\n       Section 301. This section is a Sense of the Congress that \n     there should be at the National Security Council a Special \n     Advisor on International Religious Freedom, who monitors \n     persecution and serves as a resource and policy advisor for \n     executive branch officials.\n\n\n                                title iv\n\n       This title requires that the President take action to \n     address violations of religious freedom each year in each \n     country around the world where these violations take place.\n       Section 401. If a country engages in violations of \n     religious freedom as defined in the bill, then the President \n     must, at least once a year, choose one or more of the options \n     listed in the menu of options found in section 405. If the \n     President decides to take one of options 9 through 15, then \n     the President must fulfill the requirements of section 403 \n     and 404, which provide appropriate scrutiny and review of \n     potential sanctions.\n       Section 402. The President must, at least once a year, make \n     a determination as to which countries around the world are \n     engaged in particularly severe violations of religious \n     freedom. The President may make those determinations any time \n     during the year, providing the flexibility to respond quickly \n     and appropriately to occurrences of religious persecution.\n       If the President finds a country to be engaged in \n     particularly severe violations of religious freedom, then the \n     President is required to select one or more of options 9 \n     through 15 or take commensurate action as found in section \n     405.\n\n[[Page S13001]]\n\n       Once the President makes such a determination, the \n     President is to identify the government agency or \n     instrumentality and the specific officials responsible for \n     the persecution so that sanctions are as narrowly targeted as \n     possible to those entities responsible for the persecution.\n       Any economic action taken pursuant to a determination made \n     under this section cannot be taken until the provisions of \n     section 403 and 404 have been satisfied. However, in keeping \n     with the Act's purpose of changing behavior, the President \n     must first make every reasonable effort to conclude a binding \n     agreement with the foreign country to cease the violations. \n     If such an agreement is concluded, the President is not \n     required to impose a sanction on that particular country for \n     that particular year.\n       The Congress also recognizes that once sanctions are \n     imposed under the International Religious Freedom Act, \n     implementing sanctions the following year could be \n     counterproductive. Accordingly, the Act provides that in such \n     cases, or if a comprehensive sanctions regime is already in \n     place in significant part because of human rights abuses, \n     the President may designate those sanctions as fulfilling \n     the purposes of the Act.\n       It is the intent of Congress that this Act require action \n     abroad specifically and recognizably in response to \n     violations of religious freedom, and that no provisions of \n     the Act exempt the Department of State from recognizing that \n     violations of religious freedom have occurred and taking \n     action in response to those violations.\n       This section includes a provision that any determination \n     made under this Act, or any amendment to this Act, shall not \n     trigger any termination of assistance or activities as \n     outlined in sections 116 and 502B of the Foreign Assistance \n     Act of 1961.\n       Section 403. The consultations outlined in this section are \n     necessary to achieve a coordinated international policy, to \n     adequately ensure the safety of persecuted individuals or \n     communities and to ensure that the economic interests of the \n     United States are considered before our government takes \n     economic action.\n       Many NGOs have operations in the very countries where \n     persecution is ongoing and these organizations can provide \n     valuable insight as to how the problem of violations of \n     religious freedom can best be alleviated, and can help our \n     government better understand specific situations in the \n     country of concern or the potential harm any punitive action \n     might have on their organization or persecuted communities. \n     It is the intent of the Congress that these consultations be \n     the norm.\n\n\n                                title v\n\n       This title seeks to promote religious freedom through \n     authorizing assistance for legal protections of religious \n     freedom abroad, international exchanges, international \n     broadcasting to promote religious freedom and through \n     incentives and awards to our diplomatic community to promote \n     religious freedom.\n       Section 601. Use of Annual Report: This section provides \n     that the Annual Report on International Religious Freedom \n     serve as a resource for U.S. officials adjudicating asylum \n     and refugee applications involving claims of religious \n     persecution. U.S. officials may not deny a claim solely \n     because conditions described by an applicant are not \n     referenced by the Annual Report.\n       Section 602. Reform of Refugee Policy: U.S. officials are \n     assisted in processing potential refugees around the world by \n     personnel hired abroad. Unfortunately, such personnel are \n     sometimes influenced by unfairly prejudicial biases that \n     affect their screening and processing of potential refugees. \n     United States refugee policy should not be compromised by \n     local prejudices based on religion, race, nationality, \n     membership in a particular social group, or political \n     opinion. To lessen the possibility of unfair discrimination \n     by personnel hired abroad, and to provide greater oversight \n     of U.S. hiring polices, section 602 requires the Attorney \n     General and the Secretary of State to develop and \n     implement anti-bias guidelines, and to develop guidelines \n     for entering into agreement with local refugee processing \n     organizations.\n       The Act also requires all U.S. refugee-processing officers \n     to receive the same level of training as U.S. asylum \n     officers, who currently receive more comprehensive training. \n     This training includes instruction on the nature and extent \n     of religious persecution abroad. The Act also requires \n     Foreign Service officers who might have refugee-processing \n     responsibilities to receive adequate training in refugee law \n     and in the nature of religious persecution abroad.\n       Section 603. Reform of Asylum Policy: U.S. officials are \n     assisted in processing potential asylees by interpreters, and \n     other non-U.S. personnel who may be influenced by unfairly \n     prejudicial biases that may affect such processing. To lessen \n     the possibility of unfair discrimination by such personnel, \n     section 603 requires the Attorney General and the Secretary \n     of State to develop and implement anti-bias guidelines. \n     Personnel of airlines owned by foreign governments known to \n     engage in persecution are prohibited from employment as \n     interpreters. The Act requires training for all immigration \n     inspectors, asylum officers and immigration judges in the \n     nature and extent of religious persecution abroad.\n       Section 604. Inadmissibility of Foreign Government \n     Officials Who Have Been Engaged in Severe Violations of \n     Religious Freedom: Section 604 provides that foreign \n     government officials responsible for particularly severe \n     violations of religious freedom in the last two years, and \n     their families, shall not be admitted to the United States.\n       Section 605. Studies on the Effect of Expedited Removal for \n     Asylum Claims: Under section 605, the Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom may invite outside experts to \n     cooperate with the U.S. General Accounting Office in studying \n     and reporting on the effect of the expedited removal process \n     on potential asylees.\n       Section 701. The Act recognizes that transnational \n     corporations play an increasing role as agents for change \n     around the world and have a great potential for positive \n     leadership abroad in human rights. The Act states the Sense \n     of the Congress that U.S. transnational corporations should \n     adopt codes of conduct upholding the religious rights of \n     their employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S12999-1", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13001-S13002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS AND WORKFORCE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Abraham, the \nChairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, for his leadership in \nreaching this acceptable compromise that addresses the needs of our \nhigh-tech industry and is fair to U.S. workers. I also commend the \nWhite House for its strong commitment to protecting the U.S. labor \nforce. This is an issue of major importance to the high-tech industry \nand U.S. workers. High-tech jobs are growing at three times the rate of \nother jobs. Over the next ten years, high-tech computer companies will \nneed 1.3 million additional employees.\n  Few dispute the fact that today, U.S. high-tech companies are unable \nto find enough skilled workers to meet the mushrooms demands of their \nrapidly growing industry. Universities are also unable to obtain enough \ntalented faculty members and researchers to fill critical high-tech \nacademic positions. If these shortages persist, the growth and vitality \nof U.S. high-tech companies will be undermined and our role as a leader \nin technology and research will be diminished.\n  The obvious solution to this current crisis is to increase the number \nof temporary visas available to skilled foreign workers. But the \nincrease should not be permanent. Our immigration laws should not \njeopardize opportunities for young Americans, downsized defense \nworkers, and others who wish to enter the dynamic field of high-tech \nindustries.\n  The current compromise reaches a fair balance--by temporarily \nincreasing the number of high-tech visas over the next three years, and \nthen reinstating the current annual cap of 65,000 visas after the third \nyear.\n  Many of the foreign workers who will benefit from this compromise are \nexceptionally talented. They represent the ``best and brightest'' the \nworld has to offer. We welcome these accomplished individuals and the \nunique skills they will bring to strengthen and diversify our economy.\n  However, most of the positions that will be filled by these \nadditional foreign workers are simply good middle class jobs. Most of \nthe jobs are lower level computer programmers. Many are physical \ntherapists, occupational therapies, or nurses. It is shameful that U.S. \nworkers do not have the skills to compete for these jobs. The fact that \nAmerican workers lack the training skills to compete for these good \njobs is an incident of our educational system. Clearly, we need to do \nmore to find a long-term solution to this festering problem. And this \nbill gives three years to address this failure.\n  I have long insisted that any legislation increasing these visas \nshould substantially invest in improved job training for U.S. workers \nand better education for U.S. students. We must give the U.S. workers \nthe skills they need to qualify for these jobs. It makes no sense to \nthrow in the towel by increasing quotas--even temporarily--without also \ninvesting in our own labor force. As a nation, we have an obligation to \ninvest in our own workers and students.\n  Many firms are doing the right thing. Many of the large computer \ncompanies spend millions of dollars each year training their workers, \nand encouraging young men and women to choose high-tech careers. The \ncompromise before us today enhances that commitment.\n\n[[Page S13002]]\n\n  Earlier this year, Senator Feinstein and I proposed a way to provide \ngenuine training for American workers, without costing the taxpayer a \nsingle penny. I am pleased that the legislation before the Senate today \nincorporates our idea and achieves this goal. It contains a reasonable \nfee for visa petitions and visa renewals for high-tech foreign workers. \nThe $500 visa application fee included in the compromise will generate \napproximately $75 million a year.\n  One third of these funds will be used to fund National Science \nFoundation scholarships in math, engineering, and computer science for \nlow-income students. The remaining funds will be used to train U.S. \nworkers. As a result, many students and many workers will obtain the \nskills necessary to compete successfully for these good jobs. It is \nimperative that we provide as many U.S. workers as possible with the \nskills and specialized training to qualify for these positions.\n  The high-tech industry must also do a better job of recruiting U.S. \nworkers. We have all read the reports about unscrupulous employers who \npay only lip-service to recruiting U.S. workers, because they know they \ncan obtain cheaper foreign labor. It makes sense that employers should \nrecruit in the U.S. first, in cities like Boston, Detroit, or Los \nAngeles, before bringing workers in from Beijing, New Delhi, or Moscow. \nOnly if employers cannot find qualified U.S. workers, should they be \nallowed to recruit and hire foreign workers.\n  The following are a few examples of how U.S. employers have only \npayed lip service to recruiting U.S. workers.\n  A high-tech facility in New Mexico announced a hiring freeze and \nrefused to accept job applications. But at the same time, they brought \nin 53 foreign workers under the high-tech visa program.\n  Alan Ezer is a 45-year-old computer programmer with 10 years of \nexperience in the field. He has kept his skills up to date. He was \nwilling to take a pay cut to stay in the industry. After he was laid \noff, he sent out 150 resumes. He got only one job interview and no job \noffers.\n  Rose Marie Roo is an experienced computer programmer. But when no one \nwould hire her to do computer work, she and her husband opened a bed \nand breakfast in Florida.\n  Peter Van Horn, age 31, has a master's degree in computer science. He \nlives in California, but employers won't hire him either.\n  The list goes on and on. Many of the nation's high-tech firms are \nblatantly turning away qualified U.S. workers while appealing to \nCongress for more foreign workers.\n  As a result of this problem, Senator Feinstein and I fought long and \nhard to ensure that strong recruitment requirements would be included \nin the high-tech visa legislation. This compromise contains a \nworthwhile provision on this issue, and I commend Senator Abraham for \nsupporting our effort.\n  High-tech companies will be required to demonstrate that they have \ntaken good faith steps to recruit in the U.S., according to industry-\nwide standards. Companies will be required to offer jobs to any U.S. \nworkers who applies for a position and is equally or better qualified \nfor the job than the foreign applicant. U.S. workers should have first \ncrack at these jobs, and with this legislation, they will have it.\n  We should also make every effort to retain skilled U.S. workers \npresently holding these high-tech positions. There have been countless \nmedia stories about predatory high-tech computer firms firing talented \nmiddled-aged employees and replacing them with foreign workers willing \nto work longer hours for less pay. In the most flagrant instances, the \nreplaced U.S. workers have even been asked to train their foreign \nreplacement.\n  I am pleased that this compromise contains needed protections to \nguard against such abusive layoffs. Until now, it was legal under our \nimmigration laws for an employer to fire U.S. workers and replace them \nwith cheaper foreign workers. As a condition of participating in this \ncompromise, employers covered under the legislation must attest that \nthey have not laid off U.S. workers and tried to replace them with \nforeign workers.\n  The compromise contains many worthwhile provisions, but it also has \nflaws. One of the most serious defects is that the new recruitment and \nlayoff attestations do not cover all employers hiring skilled foreign \nworkers. The compromise exempts the largest high-tech companies from \nthe new attestation requirements, even though some of these firms are \nthe most serious violators.\n  Nevertheless, the Department of Labor will have increased enforcement \npowers. Under the previous law, the Department of Labor was restricted \nto waiting for complaints to be filed before they could act. The \nDepartment will now have authority to investigate compliance if they \nreceive specific credible information that a violation has occurred. \nAdditionally, the Department of Labor will now be empowered to conduct \nrandom investigations of even exempt employers if they are found to \nhave committed violations. Violators will face stiffer fines and other \npunishment.\n  A second flaw in the legislation is the failure to cap the number of \nvisas made available to health care workers. The effect of the \nabolition of this cap is that U.S. health care workers, particularly \nphysical and occupational therapists, will be increasingly unable to \nfind work. A recent study by the American Physical Therapy Association \nindicates that by the year 2000, there will be an 11% surplus of \nphysical therapists in the United States. By the year 2005, this \nsurplus will increase to 20-30%. Faced with these estimates, it is \nimpossible to conclude that there is a shortage of physical therapists \nin this country. I urge the Department of Labor to reconsider its \nclassification of physical and occupational therapy as occupations for \nwhich there is a blanket shortage of labor.\n  Despite these flaws, the compromise is, on the whole, fair to both \nU.S. and foreign workers. It provides much-needed protections for \nforeign workers. We must make sure that foreign workers who are brought \nto this country are not abused by their employers. The law requires \nthat temporary foreign workers must be paid the prevailing wage for the \nspecialty work they perform, including salary and benefits. This \ncompromise requires employers to treat all similarly situated workers \nequally.\n  Finally, I am pleased that the compromise contains whistleblower \nprotections I had recommended earlier this year. Despite serious \nabuses, few complaints were filed by workers because they were afraid \nof retaliation. Foreign workers were afraid that if they complained \nthey would lose their jobs and be forced to leave the country. American \nworkers were afraid to complain because they feared being blackballed \nin the industry.\n  This compromise protects workers who courageously report violations. \nThose who report abuses to the Department of Labor may request that \ntheir identity not be disclosed. And more important, workers who file \ncomplaints or cooperate with investigations cannot be intimidated, \nthreatened, restrained, coerced, blacklisted, or discharged by their \nemployer.\n  Overall, this compromise is a reasonable solution of the current \ndifficult problem. It deserves bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S13001-1", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13002-S13003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TARIFF AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT OF 1998--H.R. 4342\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, on September 29, the Finance \nCommittee reported unanimously H.R. 4342, the Miscellaneous Tariff and \nTechnical Corrections Act of 1998. It was my hope that we would pass \nthis legislation this year. Unfortunately, for reasons unrelated to the \nsubstance of the bill, this did not happen.\n  The failure of this legislation is disappointing because it served a \nnumber of important practical purposes. For example, this bill would \nhave temporarily suspended or reduced the duty on a large number of \nproducts, including a wide variety of chemicals used to make anti-HIV, \nanti-AIDS and anti-cancer drugs. Also included were certain organic \npigments which are environmentally benign substitutes for pigments \ncontaining toxic heavy metals.\n  In each instance, there were either no domestic production of the \nproduct in question or the domestic producers supported the measure. By \nsuspending or reducing the duties, we would have\n\n[[Page S13003]]\n\nenabled U.S. firms that use these products to produce goods in a more \ncost efficient manner, thereby helping create jobs for American workers \nand reducing costs for consumers.\n  The bill also contained a number of technical corrections and other \nminor modifications to the trade laws that enjoyed broad support. One \nsuch measure would have helped facilitate Customs Service clearance of \nathletes that participate in world athletic events, such as the \nupcoming Women's World Cup, the Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, \nUtah, and the International Special Olympics. Another measure would \nhave corrected certain outdated references in the trade laws.\n  For each of the provisions included in this bill, we had solicited \ncomments from the public and from the Administration to ensure that \nthere was no controversy or opposition. Only those measures that were \nnon-controversial and that had no opposition were included in the bill.\n  The failure of this bill is also disappointing because of the amount \nof time and effort that the staff put into preparing this extremely \ntechnical piece of legislation. That is why I would like to give \nspecial thanks to Faryar Shirzad, Linda Menghetti, Tim Keeler, Lisa \nLee, Marsha Moke, Matthew Sorenson, Bruce Anderson, Bob Merulla and \nMyrtle Agent from the Finance Committee staff, Polly Craighill, from \nthe Office of Legislative Counsel, and Hester Grippando from the \nCongressional Budget Office, for their extensive work on this \nlegislation.\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Senator \nD'Amato, the Chairman of the Banking Committee, for his diligence in \nbringing this legislation dealing with credit unions to the floor in a \ntimely manner. Although I have concerns with the commercial lending \nprovisions in the legislation, I do support the underlying bill.\n  I do have one question, however for the Chairman of the Banking \nCommittee relating to the community credit union provisions in the act. \nSpecifically, I am concerned with the way that the National Credit \nUnion Administration (NCUA) will design their regulations dealing with \nthe size and scope of community credit unions. Although I had initially \nintended to offer an amendment limiting the size of a federally-\nchartered community credit union to three or four contiguous census \ntracts, after discussing the matter with the Chairman I decided that my \namendment would be unnecessary.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I commend the Senator from Utah for his interest in this \nissue and thank him for refraining from offering this amendment. The \nSenator is quite correct when he states that his amendment would be \nunnecessary. The Banking Committee was very careful and direct in its \ninstructions to the NCUA in Section 103 of the legislation, where the \nNCUA is instructed to define a ``well-defined local community, \nneighborhood, or rural district.''\n  Additionally, in the Committee's report, language was inserted to \nmake this point especially clear. The Committee intends for the NCUA to \nlimit federally-chartered community credit unions to be subject to \nwell-defined, local, geographic expansion limits.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman for his clarification on this \nissue. As I said previously, I had intended to offer an amendment on \nthis issue, but I am satisfied by the Committee's report and by the \nremarks of the Chairman that such an amendment would be redundant and \nunnecessary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S13002-1", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13003-S13004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE HAITIAN REFUGEE IMMIGRATION FAIRNESS ACT\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nGraham, Senator Mack, Senator Abraham and our other distinguished \ncolleagues in supporting the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. \nLast year Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central \nAmerican Relief Act, which enabled Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees to \nremain permanently in the United States as immigrants.\n  Haitian refugees deserve no less.\n  These refugees have seen their relatives, friends and neighbors \njailed, or murdered, or abducted in the middle of the night and never \nseen again. They have fled from decades of violence and brutal \nrepression by the Ton Ton Macoutes, and later by the military regime \nwhich overthrew the first democratically elected president of Haiti.\n  The people of Haiti have struggled long and hard to establish a \ndemocracy in their nation. They endured repression and suffered \npersecution at the hands of successive governments. Haitians supporting \ndemocracy have faced torture, extra-judicial killings, imprisonment, \nand other forms of persecution. The State Department has documented \nthese and other gross violations of human rights.\n  The Bush administration found that the vast majority of Haitian \nrefugees were fleeing from political persecution. Thousands of these \nHaitians were paroled into the United States after establishing a \ncredible fear of persecution. Many others filed bona fide applications \nfor asylum upon arrival in the United States.\n  This legislation will enable Haitians to apply for adjustment of \nstatus if prior to December 31, 1995, they were paroled into the U.S., \nunder any of the parole classifications, or filed for asylum. \nAdditionally, as a result of an amendment proposed by Senator Abraham \nand I, a significant number of unaccompanied children and orphans who \ndid not have the capacity to apply for asylum for themselves will also \nbe eligible to apply for adjustment of status.\n  Like other political refugees, Haitians have come to this country \nwith a strong love of freedom and a strong commitment to democracy. \nThey have settled in many parts of the United States. They have \nestablished deep roots in our communities, and their children born here \nare U.S. citizens. Wherever they have settled, they have made lasting \ncontributions to the economic vitality and diversity of our communities \nand the nation.\n  This issue is about basic fairness. The United States has a long and \nnoble tradition of providing safe haven to refugees. Over the years, we \nhave enacted legislation to guarantee that Hungarians, Cubans, \nYugoslavs, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, Poles, Chinese, and many \nother refugees will not be sent back to unstable or repressive regimes.\n  Last year, we adopted legislation to protect Nicaraguans and Cubans. \nBut Haitians were unfairly excluded from that bill. The time has come \nfor Congress to end the bigotry. We must remedy this flagrant omission \nand add Haitians to the list of deserving refugees.\n  By approving the Haitian Refugee Fairness Immigration Act, we can \nfinally bring to an end the shameful decades of unjust treatment of \nHaitians. As the decisions of federal judges over the past two decades \nmake clear, Haitans are treated with blatant discrimination under our \nimmigration laws. Throughout the 1980's, less than 2 percent of \nHaitians fleeing the atrocities committed by the Duvalier regimes were \ngranted asylum. Yet, other refugee groups had approval rates as high as \n75 percent.\n  Haitian asylum seekers were detained by the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, but asylum seekers from other countries were \nroutinely released while their asylum applications were processed. \nUntil recently, Haitians have been the only group intercepted on the \nhigh seas and forcibly returned to their home country, without even the \nopportunity to seek asylum. We welcomed boat people from Cuba, Vietnam \nand other parts of the world. But for years, we picked up Haitians on \nthe high seas and sent them back to Haiti, in violation of \ninternational refugee laws.\n  This Congress has the opportunity to right the shameful wrongs that \nHaitian refugees have suffered. We have before us a bill that offers \nfull protection of our laws to these victims of persecution in their \nfight for democracy. The call for democracy is being heard around the \nworld, and America's voice has always been the loudest. How can we \nadvocate democracy on the one hand, and then deny protection to those \nwho heed our call and are forced to flee their homeland as a result?\n  The struggle for democracy is often dangerous and life threatening. \nAsk Nestilia Robergeau, who knows first hand the high price of \nsupporting democracy on Haiti. She and her brother started a youth \ngroup in support of Haiti's democratically elected President, Jean \nBertrand Aristide. After a military coup ousted President Aristide, her \nbrother was murdered by the military, and she went into hiding in the \nwoods around her village until\n\n[[Page S13004]]\n\nshe could escape from Haiti in a small boat. Today, she lives in \nAtlanta and holds two jobs. She is active in her local church, and \nhopes to be a nurse. Last year, she told the Subcommittee on \nImmigration that ever since she arrived in the United States, she has \nlived in fear of being sent back to Haiti.\n\n  Even the youngest Haitian refugees live in fear of being returned to \nHaiti. Ask Louisiana, a sixth grader at West Homestead Elementary \nSchool in Miami. She fled to the United States with her aunt, after her \nfather, a pro-democracy activist, was murdered by the Haitian military. \nLast winter, Louisiana told us that she was terrified that she will be \nsent back to Haiti. She is terrified that the same people who killed \nher father will come after her in Haiti. She asked us to please pass a \nlaw that will let her stay in the United States, where she is safe.\n  Ask Mr. H in Massachusetts, a journalist in Haiti who criticized the \nHaitian military government, and was repeatedly arrested for his \noutspoken views. Finally, he went into hiding in Haiti. When soldiers \ncould not find him, they abducted his girlfriend, brutally beat her, \nand dumped her by the side of the road to die. But she survived, and \nshe and Mr. H escaped by boat. They were picked up by the Coast Guard, \nand brought to the United States. They married and now live in \nMassachusetts. Their two children were born here. Yet, Mr. H and his \nwife could be deported without this legislation.\n  Congress has a duty to offer the same protection to these Haitians \nthat we have offered over the years to other refugees fleeing from \nrepressive regimes. This bill is about what is fair, what is right, and \nwhat is just. We owe it to Louisiana, to Nestilia, and to the thousands \nof other Haitians forced to flee their homes because they believed in \nthe promise of democracy.\n  This legislation has strong bipartisan support. It is supported by a \nwide range of nationwide organizations, including the Americans for Tax \nReform, U.S. Catholic Conference, the Church World Service, the \nAmerican Baptist Churches, the Mennonite Central Committee, the Council \nof Jewish Federations, the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service, the \nUnited Methodist General Board of Church and Society, the Presbyterian \nChurch (USA) and many, many more. As Jack Kemp wrote to Congress \nearlier this year ``This issue presents a chance to do the right thing \nby rectifying an omission in last year's bill, and to uphold our \nnation's tradition of accepting refugees.''\n  We should do all we can to end the current flagrant discrimination \nunder the immigration laws. Haitian refugees deserve protection too--\nthe same protection we gave to Nicaraguans and Cubans last year. We \nneed to pay more than lipservice to the fundamental principle of equal \nprotection of the laws.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/11/12/senate-section/article/S13003-1", "month": "11", "year": "1998"}]
