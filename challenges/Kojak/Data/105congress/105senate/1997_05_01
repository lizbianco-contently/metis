The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer knows, we have \nbeen at this for the better part of the week. I am pleased that the two \nsides have decided to proceed to the actual legislation and to consider \nits merits straightforwardly. I was also pleased to be notified this \nmorning that during the summit--and I had not realized this--that \noccurred, Governors Branstad of Iowa, Whitman of New Jersey, and Wilson \nof California, issued a public statement in support of the Volunteer \nProtection Act while in Philadelphia, and called on the President to \nsign it. I am deeply grateful to these Governors, who have longstanding \ncareers in public service, for stepping forward and calling on the \npassage of the Volunteer Protection Act.\n  Mr. President, I thought it would be useful, given the fact that we \nare now beginning the actual debate, to revisit the general parameters \nof the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, which is a bill to provide \ncertain protections to volunteers, nonprofit organizations, and \ngovernmental entities in lawsuits based on the activities of \nvolunteers.\n  First, Mr. President, I will frame the problem. Prior to 1980, there \nwas virtually no issue for us to consider here. Millions upon millions \nof Americans over the history of our country have continued to step \nforward, help their neighbors, help in disasters, help that is \ngrandiose, like fighting off the waters in a flood to something as \nsimple as crossing the street with a spare meal or a good wish for a \nneighbor.\n  But something happened in 1980. Suddenly there were several very \ncelebrated lawsuit cases that targeted the volunteer. It changed the \nwhole nature of the environment for voluntarism in America. As we moved \non through the 1980's we found a situation where, with increasing \nfrequency, for a variety of reasons, it was the volunteer that was \nsingled out by a plaintiff or a claimant. It could have been that the \norganization that the individual was contributing to did not have any \nresources, that\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\nthe volunteer had accumulated some assets--a home, a checking account, \nwhatever--and so the lawyers for the claimant went to the volunteer.\n  What has resulted from this? Well, as best we can tell, and you \nreally cannot get the exact data, there have not been a rash of \nfindings against the volunteers. They have been able to defend \nthemselves, by and large. Many of the cases have been thrown out. But \nthere is a chilling pall that has been cast over voluntarism across the \nland. In other words, we have put a question mark in the mind of an \nAmerican volunteer. ``Well, I want to help this family, I want to \ntravel to North Dakota and help in that flood, but could I be putting \nmy home or my business, or whatever we have accumulated in our family, \nat risk for having made this decision?'' The answer, unfortunately, is \nyes. So the result is that voluntarism over the last several years \nsince 1989 has been dropping--54 percent to 51 percent to 48 percent, \nthe last number we have seen.\n  Second, we have had thousands of volunteers who served on boards of \ncolleges and universities and charities and charitable organizations \nresign because they became fearful they would be the target of these \nlawsuits. So you not only have people with a question in their mind \nabout coming forward, you actually have caused volunteers to step \nbackward and resign. Some estimates are as many as 50,000 of these \nkinds of occurrences have taken place.\n\n  Now comes the summit, the volunteer summit, in the Presiding \nOfficer's home State, Pennsylvania, in the city of Philadelphia, where \nthe President and three former Presidents and First Ladies for six \nadministrations have come forward, 100 mayors, 30 Governors, and called \non America to step forward, to relight the fire, to reinvigorate \nvolunteer activity in America. I believe that is a very wholesome \nthing, a very inspirational thing.\n  But if you study the remarks, Mr. President, this was more than a \ncall for voluntarism. It is very interesting as you review it. This is \nfairly well targeted. Children are evoked over and over and were the \ncenterpoint of this call to voluntarism. Furthermore, the call was for \nvoluntarism to occur in difficult environments. We have heard language \nlike the poisonous streets. We are talking about difficult, rough, \nabnormal environment that you are asking these volunteers to go to. So \nthe specter of the problem is elevating. You are asking them to go into \na more troubled center, a more volatile arena, where communication and \ndifferences and diversity are great and, therefore, the probability of \naccident or misstep is higher.\n  I have been arguing all week that the Congress should respond in a \nvery forceful way by passing the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 which \nwill make it easier for a volunteer to respond, in the first place; and \nsecond, to a troubled place. The Volunteer Protection Act takes the \nvolunteer and provides some shield against being a target of a lawsuit.\n  I told the story earlier in the week of a charity that ran a gym and \na youngster broke a leg by dropping weights. A volunteer, a woman, was \nthe receptionist--not in the gym. She is out answering the phone. She \nbecame the legal target. She had virtually nothing to do with the \nincident other than having been on the premises on the phone. The \nVolunteer Protection Act would have protected that woman because she \nhad no relation to the incident. If she had been engaged in willful \nmisconduct, if she had been reckless, wanton, if she had been involved \nin a hate crime or a sex crime or a civil rights crime, this \nlegislation would not protect her, nor should it, and no one wants it \nto. It deals with simple acts of omission--an accident--that would \nprotect the volunteer.\n  I want to point out, because in all the chaotic conditions that go on \non Capitol Hill, I am not sure everybody has had a chance to read it \nand understand that no one is protected from willful misconduct or \nreckless behavior or drunk driving. Mr. President, even if the \nvolunteer is protected, the organization itself, the institution, the \nnonprofit, is still liable. This is directed, principally for acts of \nomission, at the volunteer. There are some other protections in the \nbill for nonprofits that would help the charitable organization, but \nprimarily this legislation would protect the volunteer from simple acts \nof omission or an accident of that kind.\n\n  The second thing it would do, Mr. President, is that it would create \nproportional responsibility. There is a legal term for that, but I \nthink it is easier to understand when we say proportional \nresponsibility. The case I just cited is a great example. This woman \nhad no responsibility, so she would not be eligible to be a target. \nWhat it does here is, it says that you can't go after an individual, a \nvolunteer, who has minimal responsibility or only a small proportion, \nor none, and cause them to be the target for compensation for the \nentire event, that there has to be proportional responsibility. That, \ntoo, would protect the volunteer.\n  Mr. President, we have concluded--those of us who have cosponsored \nthe legislation--that the issue is one of national concern and scope. I \ngo back to the summit. They were not there creating volunteers for \nPhiladelphia; they were there calling on the whole Nation to step \nforward. Volunteer organizations, many of them, are national in scope. \nYou don't have to spend much time thinking about it. They are \norganizations like the American Red Cross, the United Way, and Little \nLeague Baseball. The call for voluntarism is a national call, not a \nlocal community call. Many of the volunteers cross State jurisdictions \nin their activities. There is absolutely no way that many of these \ncharitable organizations--600,000 of them--could in any way understand \nthe myriad of laws that relate to this across the several States. \nCertainly, a volunteer would have no capacity to do this.\n  So this law, the Volunteer Protection Act, sets a national standard \nof protection. But if a State chose to create more protections, that \nwould be their right. Or if the State took an affirmative act to opt \nout from under this in those cases where all the parties involved are \ncitizens of that State, they could do that as well. So we believe this \nis an appropriate balance with regard to the interaction between the \nStates and the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I have gone back to this summit time and time again in \nthe discussion, but there is something I noted here this morning that I \nthink is very interesting. There was an article about the summit, and \nit says:\n\n       Perhaps no one put the challenge more simply or \n     compellingly than former First Lady Nancy Reagan, known \n     during her White House years for her antidrug slogan, ``Just \n     say no'' . . .\n\n  For which, I might add, many of us are greatly indebted.\n\n       Speaking for herself and her husband, ailing former \n     President Ronald Reagan, she implored, ``From this day \n     forward, when someone asks you to help a child, just say \n     yes.''\n\n  Just say yes. How right she is. My plea to the Senate and to the \nHouse and to the President is, just make it easier to say yes. Let's \ntry to remove this question mark that is holding volunteers back. Let's \ntry to not call on them to step forward and then leave a system in \nplace that trips them if they do. Let's remove this cloud that causes \nhigh-profile public policymakers to not agree to serve on a board. I \nventure to say, Mr. President, that every Member of Congress has had \nthe question mark I am talking about in their minds at one time or \nanother when they had to make a decision about whether to respond to an \norganization seeking their support.\n  Let's try to create an environment where volunteers don't resign from \nboards but are willing to serve on them. Let's try to create an \nenvironment where a volunteer immediately would rush to an accident \nscene and not put a question in their mind about whether they are \nputting their assets into a legal lottery. Let's do it in a way that is \nthoughtful--and I believe we have--and which does not protect somebody \nfrom ill doing, which I believe we have. The minority leader and I had \na brief discussion with regard to this yesterday evening. I was \nenumerating the fact that this would not protect reckless conduct. We \nwant to be conscious of a victim of an accident. But we have to do \nsomething here to free up America so that it can do what it has always \ndone.\n  Mr. President, just before I conclude here, I want to reiterate that \nI believe American voluntarism is as much a part of our culture and \nlife and a treasure of American life as our national monuments, our \nparks, and this very\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\nCapitol itself, because it is unique. There are very few places in the \nworld where voluntarism takes on the components and proportions that it \nhas in America. I was reading this morning that, last year alone, the \nequivalent value of American voluntarism, which was about 4\\1/2\\ hours \na week, was around $200 billion-plus that had been given freely. But \nthat is declining, and that trend should be reversed. We should nurture \nthis American treasure and we should protect it, just as if it were one \nof the crown jewels of this Nation, like our Capitol.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to begin the debate by at least framing the \nreason for the law, a brief description of the law, and a call for the \nCongress to come forward and reinforce what took place in the historic \ndays of the summit in Philadelphia, PA.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the Presiding \nOfficer, who just spoke, for his stick-to-itiveness in continuing to \nforce this issue here in the U.S. Senate and, finally, accomplishing \nwhat we had hoped to accomplish and probably should have accomplished a \ncouple of days ago, which is at least to move to this bill and begin \nthe debate on whether we can, here in the U.S. Senate, do some positive \nthings to the volunteer spirit of America, to see if we can remove some \nof the barriers that are in place right now that limit the amount of \nvolunteer participation in our society.\n  I think the present Presiding Officer's remarks about the \nPhiladelphia summit, the spirit created there, the momentum that was \ncreated there can only be enhanced. The big concern in Philadelphia, as \nI talked to so many people, was, ``Isn't this wonderful? Don't you feel \nthis great spirit? Don't you feel like we are focused on the right \nthing and we are pulling the country together, Republican and Democrat \nalike, liberal or conservative, focusing on a value that we all \nshare?'' It is an understanding that is sort of core as an American to \nunderstand the significance of participating as a volunteer in your \ncommunity and the benefit that it gives not only the people you \nvolunteer for but the benefit it gives you. But the big concern I heard \nover and over again, even from the most enthusiastic supporters of the \nsummit, was, ``Can we keep this going? Can this momentum continue? Will \nmuch happen after this week? How can we keep this spirit alive and keep \nthis momentum that we have built, the commitments that were made? How \ncan we continue to keep this ball rolling?\"\n  I point right here to the U.S. Senate. This is the best way that I \nknow of to keep the ball rolling, to keep the momentum going. If we \nfollow up this week and maybe early next week with the passage of this \nlegislation, with a strong message to the American public and to the \nprospective volunteers in America that not only do we think it is a \ngood thing--and everybody says nice things about voluntarism and we \ntalk about the benefits of it and about all of the wonderful things \nthat it accomplishes for your community and for you as an individual--\nbut we can lay down something solid, something tangible for them to say \nthat things are different. It is not just that people are talking about \nit now, or not that it is an in-vogue thing, but there is a different \nset of ground rules now to participate and, to me, they are much more \nfavorable. I don't have to look over my shoulder as a Little League \ncoach as to whether I gave the catcher the right mask. I know that was \none of the examples that was used over in the House. But I am doing \nthis because I love my community, I love my neighbors, and I want to do \nsomething positive to contribute to their lives. I want to do so in a \nway that I feel that I can really express myself without having to be \nconcerned about the whole troop of lawyers hanging in the wings for \nsomebody who may have some accident in the process of volunteering.\n\n  So I think what we are doing here is taking that first step after the \nsummit. This is the first step. People who have given all the great \nspeeches about how important voluntarism is--if they don't follow \nthrough with doing something to move this agenda forward then I think \nwe have every right to question the sincerity of the remarks. We have \nevery right to question whether this was in fact a political stunt, and \nnothing more; that this was an attempt to revive individuals involved \nin their own public reception and nothing more than that; that it \nwasn't really real.\n  This is an opportunity to make the summit in Philadelphia more real \nin the eyes of the American public, to do something tangibly good for \nthe volunteer in America, and thereby for the needy among us who have \nsuch a need and such a desire to deal with their fellow men and \nneighbors in solving the problems that confront them and their \ncommunities.\n  So I again congratulate the Senator from Georgia for his tremendous \ndrive and enthusiasm and stick-to-itiveness to stand up here--for 3 \ndays now--and fight this battle and refuse to relent.\n  I know some have said we are holding things hostage. I would suggest \nthat this bill releases hostages all over America who are hostage to \nlitigation fears--who now can go out and participate in their \ncommunities, and do the kind of things that will liberate so many other \npeople who are in the need of volunteers, and the organizations with \nwhom they work.\n  So I again congratulate the Senator from Georgia. I commend him for \nthis.\n  It sounds like we have accomplished something tremendous. We have. \nAll we have accomplished is that we can now talk about the bill, and we \ncan now debate the bill. We are going to have, I am sure, amendments \nthat will dramatically weaken this and that will take the teeth out of \nthis legislation. Unfortunately, those will be offered on the floor. We \nhave a tough battle ahead of us to be able to stand up to those kinds \nof weakening amendments, stay the course, and follow through with this \nresponsibly.\n  I believe it is a very valid piece of legislation that preserves the \nright of those who are injured and at the same time liberates the \nvolunteer in America to go out and pursue what they know in their \nhearts is the right thing to do which is to serve their fellow man to a \ngreater good.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I certainly join my colleague, the Senator from Pennsylvania, in his \nexpression of concern and hope for the outcome of the volunteer summit \nthat has just occurred in Philadelphia. I, too, hope that we can keep \nthe dynamics of that going.\n  There is no question, though, that one of the blights against \nvoluntarism and giving freely of one's time to the benefit of human \nkind is what has transpired in this country over the last several \ndecades when we have, in fact, denied the doctrine of charitable \nimmunity; in other words, the ability to go out and give of your time \nand then by chance you make an accident--or by chance somewhere in the \nprocess someone might claim some question of injury--that, all of a \nsudden, you are liable, the courts take it up, the trial lawyers drag \nyou through the courts, and they put a phenomenal blight on the giving \nconcept that voluntarism is all about.\n  That is what S. 543 is about--to clearly prescribe what the limits \nare so that we don't put a legal damper on the kind of energies that \nare spilling forth from Philadelphia that Colin Powell is trying to \nonce again fire up in this country. It is here. It is already here. It \nis part of the Judeo-Christian ethic that has made up the great growth \nof this country over the years.\n\n  I want to relate to you a comment that the director of March of Dimes \nEaster Seals told me right after the Berlin wall came down and Eastern \nEurope was freeing itself from the shackles of communism that some of \nit had been under for 70-plus years; most of it for about 45 years. I \nwas with this gentleman one night at a banquet. We were visiting, and \nwe were both seated at the head table.\n  I said, ``What are you doing nowadays besides the work of Easter \nSeals and March of Dimes?\"\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n  He said, ``You would be fascinated.'' He said, ``I am spending a lot \nof time in Eastern Europe with the countries of Eastern Europe.''\n  I said, ``Doing what?\"\n  He said, ``Teaching them voluntarism.''\n  I said, ``Tell me more. What do you mean teaching voluntarism?\"\n  You and I, Mr. President, would have considered that part of our \nfamily heritage, part of going to church, part of the extension of the \nperson of the American citizen--voluntarism. What had happened in \nEastern Europe and throughout the greater Soviet empire was that \ngovernment had taken over. Government had become the operative of \npeople. No longer could you give of yourself. It was government that \ntold you what to do, how to do it, what to say, what to think, and all \nof those kinds of things. Up until that time, I had forgotten, or I \nguess I had never really concentrated on the root of voluntarism, and \nwhat has transpired in our country over the years from the very early \ndays of the barn raising in your State and mine--of neighbors sharing \namongst themselves, because there was never enough work force to go \naround. So I would come over to your farm and help out, and you would \ncome over to my farm and help out. And together, in a sense of \ncommunity, we would help each other. That was before the days of lots \nof laws and lots of trial lawyers, and somebody looking around, and, \nsaying ``Gee. You have to be liable for that. It is your fault that \nsomething happened. And, therefore, we are going to take you to task on \nthat.''\n  Voluntarism has always been a phenomenal force in our country. And it \ndid start from a Judeo-Christian ethic of helping one fellow person. \nThat has been and remains the strength of our country.\n  I was so pleased when I heard Colin Powell through a series of \ninterviews leading up to the summit in Philadelphia. In fact, I was \npleased but a little disappointed one day when Katie Couric in a \nrather--at least my interpretation--cynical way said, ``Well, but, but, \nbut, surely you have to have Government doing some of these things, \nand, surely, you have to have a Government program. I mean, you have \ncut welfare, or Congress cut welfare.'' And, very consistently, Colin \nPowell said there is a role for Government. Yes. But there is a very \nclear role for people. Government doesn't nurture the child in the \ncommunity. We can put food to the child. But we cannot nurture the \nsoul. That is a personal relationship. That is a giving kind of \nrelationship that is only put forth through the volunteer effort of the \ncaring individual.\n  It was the sense of the Soviet States, if they were truly to become \nfree states again and knowing that government could never provide \neverything to everybody, that they would have to reignite voluntarism \nin the voluntary spirit of nearly half a century past. So they were \nasking large contributive voluntary charitable groups from this country \nto come across, to extend to them how we did it, and to work with them \nto rekindle the human spirit in an effort of voluntarism.\n  That is what Philadelphia is trying to do--not to rekindle because it \nis clearly here in this country, and it always has been, but to extend \nit into other areas, urge people to give more of their time, to urge \ncompanies to provide time for their employees to go out and participate \nin the community in a free and giving way, and to knock down some of \nthe barriers that exist in normal life that limit people's ability to \ncontribute to give and to volunteer.\n\n  That is what S. 543 is all about--knocking down the percolation of \nlegal barriers that have built up over the years of somebody trying to \nmake somebody liable for something. We know that when you give of your \ntime it is going to put you at risk. You are willing to give less. You \nback away, and say, ``I can't be a part of contributive or voluntary \neffort if I might be sued.'' I mean that isn't in the spirit of \nAmericanism. That isn't in the spirit of the raising of the barn in \nKansas a century ago. Sure, the wall might have fallen down, and you \nhad to pick it back up and somebody might have been hurt. There was \nalways that risk. But it was always understood that nobody was liable \nunder those circumstances--that you weren't trying to profit from it \npersonally, that you weren't trying to gain from it. You were giving.\n  That is what this legislation is all about--to recreate at least an \nunderstanding that people can give of their time freely without a loss \nof the immunity they have always had with charitable voluntary efforts.\n  So I am truly complimentary of the Senator from Georgia for the \ntremendous effort that he has put behind this. It has come at a very \nimportant time. I must say to my colleagues across the aisle. You are \nfilibustering. Get with it. Don't do that. There may be other reasons. \nBut, if it is for this, it is a bad reason. If the trial lawyers of \nthis country are wanting to play games with this, it is the wrong \nreason. They ought to go somewhere else instead of trying to go at the \nvoluntary spirit of this country, the energy that built our country \nthat made us what we are. It was not Government. It was people giving \nfreely of themselves to other people.\n  That is what this legislation is about. That is what the nations of \nthe former Soviet Union have had to actually seek from us. Yes. They \nwant our institutions of government because they figure that ours is \nthe best form of government. But they want our people institution. They \nknow that they cannot have government alone, that it will not serve the \nneeds of citizens of Poland, or Czechoslovakia, or one of those nations \nthat was barricaded and imprisoned behind the Iron Curtain.\n  So they reached out to our great charitable voluntary contributive \norganizations immediately after the fall of the wall, and said, ``Come. \nTeach us again how you make it work because what we see in America, \nwhat we see as the great energy and the spirit of your country, is the \nblend of government with the blend of the free citizen, both working \ntogether for the betterment of humanity and for the betterment of your \ncountry.''\n  That is what S. 543 is all about. It isn't about trial lawyers taking \npeople to court. There is plenty of that to go on in the private \nsector, and in the private economy, but not in the private giving \nshould that be allowed. I am thankful that S. 543 speaks so clearly of \nthat.\n  I again say to my colleagues on the other side: Get with it. Come on. \nStop this filibuster. This is a time to stand together, as former \nRepublican Presidents and former Democratic Presidents and a Democrat \nPresident stood together in Philadelphia and said this is Americanism \nat its best. We should not use Government to tear down voluntarism. We \nshould not use laws to restrict it. Let us use our energies to multiply \nit for the betterment of our citizens and for mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President. I am particularly grateful \nfor the statement of the Senator from Idaho, and for the measure of the \nSenator from Georgia.\n  When you try to define America, you can't define America by looking \nat people and from outward appearance. We are not all of one race or \none ethnic origin. We represent every possible assemblage from around \nthe world. We have come here. What we have, together, is not ethnicity \nnor religious background. It is not racial. What we have is a common \ncommitment to community, a common commitment to what it is America is. \nIt goes beyond politics. It goes beyond where we go to church. It goes \nbeyond where the ancestors on our family tree came from. It simply goes \nto the heart of how we feel about each other.\n  No other nation on the face of the Earth has been so characterized by \nthe idea of caring. Look at the great service organizations around the \nworld, such as the Lions Club, which has a specific interest in \nprotecting vision and making sure that people can see. The idea has \nbeen exported to the world from the United States of America. Look at \nthe Rotary Club. Rotary clubs literally go around the globe. They have \ncome from the United States of America where we look at the four-way \ntest of rotary, which talks about the betterment of all concerned, \nwhich looks at the other side of the coin, which always asks about \nsomeone else.\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\n  Look at the Kiwanis Club, the slogan of which is ``We Build.'' It has \nbeen exported to nation after nation. It has been embraced by cultures \nall around the globe, but it is something that started in the United \nStates of America. It is something that is so universal and so \nimportant to the fabric, to the very tapestry that defines what this \nNation is that it crosses party lines just like that.\n  You have four Presidents of the United States joining together, \nRepublicans and Democrats, in the Presidents' summit on voluntarism, \nand you have a person who in most societies would be considered to be \nan individual who knows how to deploy military resources and how to \nfight and how to hate and how to kill but an American whose heart \nreally is in how to help, Gen. Colin Powell. He is heading up the \nentire focus again on voluntarism. It is something that is the \ncharacter of this country. It is what makes us community. Frankly, it \nis richer than cultures that rely on Government and entitlement for all \nthe things that are done. It is not universal in the world. In lots of \nplaces people think that charitable things are wrong, that it should be \ndone by Government, so no one ever owes anyone else.\n  Well, in America we do not owe each other. We love each other. And \nthe idea of voluntarism is a way that we can extend to each other and \nbuild the chords of community that bind us together. The poets from \noverseas have said it well: Never send to know for whom the bell tolls; \nit tolls for you.\n  That is why I have been involved in all kinds of charitable \nendeavors. I remember even when I was Governor of my home State, when a \nchild was lost close to the State capital 20 or 30 miles away, I walked \nthrough the woods during the night with hundreds of other individuals \nto find the child. We were all kinds of people from all kinds of \npolitical persuasion, from all kinds of backgrounds, yet there we were \nwalking through the woods at night. I remember in the great floods that \nafflicted Missouri, I filled sandbags next to people I did not know but \npeople whom I loved because I cared for the communities, and I knew \nthat if there were ever a flood at my place, they would be there with a \nshovel and their children with them, as mine were with me, filling \nsandbags.\n  That is what America is about. We would not want to do anything to \ndestroy the capacity of Americans to help each other, to love one \nanother, to participate in community activities, charitable activities \nwhere we reach out to one another. How many times did dads, when I was \na boy, haul me to the ball game? My father traveled a lot. My father \nwas an itinerant, in some respects, minister at some times during his \nlife and then traveled extensively when he was involved in education, \nraising money for the college. But you know, there was always some dad \nfrom the area who took me to the game.\n  I will never forget Charles Wilcox. One time after a dusty, hot \nbaseball practice, he took the whole team to the root beer stand, and \nhe walked up to the window and said the most generous thing I have ever \nheard in my entire life. It almost knocked me over as a boy. He said to \nthe fellow inside the root beer stand, ``This is my team. Fill em up.'' \nIt had never happened to me before and perhaps has not happened to me \nsince. I think soda pop is pretty commonplace these days, but back in \nthe 1950's, when someone walked up to the root beer stand and said, \n``Fill em up,'' it was a big thing.\n  I do not want the Charlie Wilcoxes of this world not to be able to do \nthat anymore. I do not want them so afraid that when they coach the \nLittle League team, they are going to have to put on their family the \nrisk of financial ruin. We have seen the cases, the shear lunacy of \ncases where the coach is sued because the youngster was moved from \nshortstop to left field and got hurt when a fly ball hit him in left \nfield. His mom had said he was a born shortstop. Who is going to be the \ncoach if you can get sued when you move someone to left field?\n  We have seen the ridiculous cases where the youngster insists on \nsliding in headfirst and then injures himself and the coach is sued \nbecause the youngster slides headfirst instead of feet first, in spite \nof the fact that the youngster has seen all the big leaguers doing it \ntime after time after time. But if that coach is going to lose his \nhome, if his children cannot go to college because he is generous \nenough to care for someone else, we will certainly have cheated a lot \nof young people out of a lot of helping hands.\n\n  When I was at the summit this last weekend in Philadelphia, each of \nthese Presidents called upon me personally. No, they did not come up to \ntalk to me, but they spoke to me, they spoke to my heart. They said \nAmerica needs again to have a revival of individuals who are willing to \ncare for each other. I thought to myself, we need to make sure as \nMembers of the Congress that we do what is necessary to make that \npossible. I think of the Scout volunteers on the west coast who allowed \nthe boys to play touch football. When I was a Scout, we would never \nsettle for touch football, but these must have been very good leaders, \ninterested in the safety of the youngsters. But one got injured and he \nended up with a $7 million judgment against two of the volunteers. The \nappellate courts reduced it to $4 million. I cannot imagine that was \nmuch of a consolation to those Scout volunteers.\n  Most people do not want to have to choose between helping the \ncommunity and protecting their family. No one really will ever say I \nwill help someone else if I have to sacrifice my family, because we \nhave a very strong commitment to our families in America. It is a \ncornerstone of what we are. But a similar cornerstone of this house we \ncall the United States of America is helping each other, and we should \nnot put these cornerstones at odds. We should not say to people, in \norder to help someone else, you have to put your family at risk. That \nis what we have done with a tort system that has awarded judgments like \n$4 million against Scout leaders, that has awarded judgments against a \nLittle League coach who moved someone from shortstop to left field.\n  Let us get serious. The Presidents, past and present, know what \nAmerica is about. It is in the hearts of Americans across this country. \nWe want to make it possible for people again to extend themselves in a \nvoluntary way without putting their families at risk. That is the long \nand the short of what we want to do.\n  I think it is entirely inappropriate for some in this Chamber to \nstand against us, for those whose President has called us to a summit \non voluntarism to say no, we are not going to allow any discussion of \nthat in the Senate, we are not even going to proceed to the bill; we do \nnot want you to have a chance to vote on it. That is what this \nfilibuster by the Democratic Members of this body is achieving right \nnow. It is keeping us from voting on this bill. This is not the bill \nitself we are talking about. We are talking about the motion to \nproceed. This is technical gobbledygook of the Senate. But in order to \nconsider a bill, you have to succeed in passing a motion to proceed to \nthe bill, and we are being filibustered on the motion. It is time for \nall Americans to again enlist in this great enterprise of community \nwhich we call America and help each other, and it is time for the \nSenate, Members of the Congress, to build a framework where we do not \nask people to choose between protecting their family and helping other \npeople. We have to say we will make sure your family is protected if \nyou are kind enough and loving enough and caring enough to extend a \nhelping hand, a hand of care, compassion, and love to those in your \ncommunity.\n  I have been told we are on the bill now. I am glad to know that we \nare on the bill. Yesterday we were on a filibuster to the motion to \nproceed, and I appreciate the correction. I apologize to Members of \nthis body on the other side of the aisle. I would not impair or impugn \ntheir motive here. I am glad to be on the bill. I think with that in \nmind we ought to make sure we all vote in favor of this. This is an \noutstanding piece of legislation which will stop the irrationality of \nasking people to choose between protecting their family and helping \ntheir neighbor. The history of this country is that we have not only \nprotected our family; we have enriched our families by helping our \nneighbors because we have been taught one of the most important values \nof life, that is, that we are not alone, that we live together in \ncommunity.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3866]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I commend both the Senator from Idaho \nand the Senator from Missouri for their statements. Senator Ashcroft is \na cosponsor, as is Senator Craig, and they both have devoted extensive \nactivity and time and energy to the promotion of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am going to talk a little bit more about the bill \nand then move to a quorum call. It is my understanding there are \nseveral Senators who wish to speak as if they were in morning business. \nIt would be appropriate with us. We have now had a full hour framing S. \n543, but I want to just go back to the summit a minute and quote three \nprominent figures in American life. As First Lady Hillary Rodham \nClinton put it in her column last week in the Washington Times:\n\n       Whether through tutoring children, picking up litter on a \n     highway, or providing free legal counsel to a needy client, \n     we all have a chance to help address problems in our \n     communities and enjoy the satisfaction that comes from being \n     good neighbors. What we may not realize is that in the \n     process we are also strengthening our democracy. Democracy \n     depends on citizenship and citizenship depends on people \n     voluntarily contributing their time and performing services \n     that their country needs.\n\n  She is absolutely correct. I have always believed, Mr. President, the \ngenesis of the American spirit is that we are a free people, and if you \nreally want to know the roots of voluntarism, because it is uniquely \nAmerican, it is because we have been free and we have unleashed spirits \nand thinking and activity which the world has never seen nor compared. \nWhat we are talking about here in this legislation is there has evolved \nin the last decade and a half a constriction, a choke, on that kind of \nfreedom. We have chilled it. What we are seeing is the same kind of \nthing that happens anytime a government or practice becomes engaged in \nconstriction of freedom and the natural activity of human beings.\n  We have, unwittingly I believe, had evolve a situation where the \nvolunteer has become a target, and they have become fearful of it, \nwhich is a step back from freedom. Fear is one of the first things that \nhappens when people, for whatever reason, begin to lose their freedom. \nThey become fearful and their behavior changes. The explosion of \nvoluntarism in America was born in freedom, and the constriction of it \nis occurring because they do not feel as free to do it. They fear harm. \nThey fear retribution. They fear consequences. They fear for their \nfamilies. So they alter their activity, and the Nation and the neighbor \nsuffer. This legislation is designed to remove the fear and come back \nto the genesis of freedom to make choices, freedom to help the person \ncross the street or the person suffering from the flood that was \ndescribed yesterday.\n  I do not believe our policymakers have really quite understood how \nserious this is. Everybody is busy with all their activities and their \nagenda, whether you are the President of the United States or you are \nrunning a store or you are the mayor of a local town. No one realized \nthe field changed in the 1980's; the volunteer was not as free to step \nforward. It happened in the 1980's. So, this legislation is necessary \nto try to recreate the environment that has so enriched our Nation and \nour country.\n\n  Mr. President, I will take a minute. I have mentioned several times I \nam the former Director of the U.S. Peace Corps, which is one of \nAmerica's preeminent institutions of voluntarism. There have been about \n150,000, since 1961, who have gone all over the world, and their \nvoluntarism does not stop there. In fact, the original charter of the \nPeace Corps has a third mission: Go where you are asked to go, be of \nassistance to the people there--and bring the knowledge of the world \nback home. So we continue to ask these volunteers to serve when they \nreturn, and thousands of them do. Many of their activities are \naddressed at the very core of the summit call--children.\n  As you might expect in an institution like that, there is a lot of \ndiscussion about voluntarism. There would be discussion, from time to \ntime, about: Should they receive greater compensation? Would that \ncreate more volunteers? And you always came up with the same answer, \nthat what we wanted was the volunteer who willingly stepped forward and \nwanted to do it and there was not another incentive. They were not \ndoing it for a check. They were doing it to serve. Because, when you \nalter that chemistry, the whole interaction between the volunteer and \nthe beneficiary changes, and you create a completely different kind of \ninteraction.\n  I mentioned the story yesterday of the fellow who was helping train \nin the Civil Air Patrol. He even had to spend his own money to do it. \nBut as he got out of the car he turned to me and he said, ``But the \npayback is when I look in their faces, when I see their pride and sense \nof accomplishment.'' That is a volunteer.\n  This issue of legal threat changes the chemistry of the volunteer. It \nchanges the component of the interaction between the volunteer and \nbeneficiary and alters their behavior, sometimes to the point of \ncausing it to cease. This is a very important piece of legislation, and \nit is about America. It is not very complicated--12 pages. But it is \nright near and sitting up beside the heart and soul of who we are as a \npeople. We need to get this done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see we have been joined by the \ndistinguished Senator from--Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague from Georgia \nrecognizing the North Pole.\n  First, let me say a few words about the effort of my good friend from \nGeorgia in bringing to the attention of this body, as well as to the \nNation, the importance of the Volunteer Protection Act. The issue \nbefore us is vital; it is a matter defending the noble act of personal \nsacrifice and contribution for the benefit and good of others. So I \ncommend the Senator for his diligence, the time he spent on the floor, \nand the effort that has been made. And I look forward to supporting the \neffort for the Volunteer Protection Act which has been introduced by \nSenator Coverdell of Georgia.\n  Let me just ask my colleagues to bear with me for a moment. As we \nknow, this past week President Clinton and other prominent Americans \nappeared in Philadelphia. Philadelphia is the city where our American \nheritage is rooted. What better place to come to for the recognition of \nvoluntarism and what it means to this country, because those who \nfounded our Constitution--our early efforts to formulate the principles \nof this country--were all volunteers. They were volunteers coming \nforward and contributing their knowledge, their expertise, their \nwillingness to formulate a nation. So it was certainly appropriate that \na summit on voluntarism was held in the city of Philadelphia during the \npast week. But what did this summit really accomplish?\n  I am told there were balloons, streamers, speeches, and a lot of good \nphoto ops. But, unfortunately, we have to look at the bottom line and \nask what was accomplished? How much was accomplished? It brought the \nissue to the American people. But, specifically, what did we get out of \nit? Because I think the summit ignored the fact that, in order for the \nspirit of voluntarism to flourish, you must, first of all, have real \nreform in our American judicial system.\n\n  What the Senate is basically doing today, and what we have been \ntrying to do for the past 4 days--for the past 4 days--is not put on a \nhighly publicized summit about voluntarism. We are trying to reform a \njustice system that deters voluntarism.\n  I am pleased, after several days of procedural delay, we have finally \nbegun debate on this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, recent congressional findings reveal that our legal \nliability system deters voluntarism. In fact, according to the \ntestimony given before a congressional committee last year, one in six \nvolunteers withholds his or her services due to the fear of exposure to \na lawsuit. That is the system that we have unfortunately devised. If \nthat figure is applied to the number of volunteers in nonprofit \norganizations alone, we might see as many as 100,000 have had to \ndecline to serve because of the fear of being sued.\n\n[[Page S3867]]\n\n  America's litigation explosion forces nonprofit organizations to \nspend an ever-increasing amount of time and resources preparing for and \navoiding lawsuits. The American Society of Association Executives \ntestified before Congress last year that the association's liability \ninsurance premiums increased an average of 155 percent; one in eight \nnonprofit organizations reported an increase of insurance premiums of \n300 percent alone. This has put some of our most revered nonprofit \norganizations at risk.\n  For example, Dr. Creighton Hale of Little League Baseball reports \nthat the liability rate for a league increased from $75 to $795, in the \nlast 5 years. Because most leagues cannot afford such an expense, many \noperate without insurance. Some have, unfortunately, been disbanded \naltogether. The bill before us protects volunteers from liability \nunless they cause harm through reckless or criminal conduct.\n  This common-sense approach legislation would put an end to tragic \nliability cases such a 1990 negligence case in which a Chicago jury \nawarded $12 million to a boy who was injured in a car crash. Who was \nthe negligent party? According to the jury, it was the estate of the \nvolunteer--the estate of the volunteer, who gave his life attempting to \nsave that boy.\n  Here are just a few other examples of recent outrageous litigation \nwhich threatens voluntarism.\n  In Oregon, a boy on a Boy Scout outing suffered a serious injury \nwhile playing tag football. The court dismissed the original lawsuit \nfiled against the Boy Scouts, due to an insufficient nexus between the \nBoy Scouts and the youth's injury. The injured boy then decided to sue \nthe volunteers who supervised the game. In one of the largest monetary \nverdicts in Oregon history, the jury found the two volunteers liable \nfor $7 million.\n  When a 10-year-old boy in New Jersey lost a fly ball in the Sun \nduring Little League practice, the ball dropped and hit the boy in the \neye. The boy's coaches were sued for negligence.\n  In Oklahoma City, a member of an amateur softball league was so \nangered when he was ejected from a game that he drove away in a fit of \nrage and crashed his car. So what does the ejected player do? He files \na suit against the umpire.\n  According to William J. Cople, a Washington lawyer who is pro bono \ncounsel for the Boy Scouts of America, ``Volunteers have simply been \nswept away in the hysteria of litigation. . . . Suits are brought for \nalmost anything, under any circumstances.'' What good comes from these \nsuits? Well, about all you can say is that they keep a lot lawyers in \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are debating will help put an end to such \nunwarranted litigation. This bill creates a system in which plaintiffs \nsue only for good reason and sue only those who are responsible for the \ndamage. Such common-sense reforms will create an atmosphere which will \nnurture voluntarism. This legislation will foster the spirit of \nvoluntarism, not just speak about it at a photo op.\n\n  For centuries, volunteers in America have fed our hungry, sheltered \nour homeless, instilled values in our youth. Volunteers are vital, as \nwe know, to our survival as a moral nation. It is time we gave \nvolunteers something in return, and that something is this legislation \nthat will protect them from frivolous and outrageous legal attacks that \nare the result of a judicial system in desperate need of reform.\n  Finally, there is something else I believe we should do to encourage \nthe volunteer spirit in America. This is to allow volunteers to get a \nmore realistic tax deduction for their travel costs associated with \ncharitable activities. Later today, I, along with Senator Cochran, will \nbe introducing the Charitable Equity Mileage Act of 1997. This bill \nwill increase the standard mileage rate of deduction for charitable use \nof an automobile from 12 cents a mile to 18 cents a mile. I think this \nbill should be unanimously supported by my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Further, many of our citizens who volunteer for charitable activities \ndo incur expenses for which they are not reimbursed. For example, when \nan individual uses his or her automobile to deliver a meal to a home-\nbound elderly individual or to transport children to Scouting \nactivities, the volunteer usually pays the transportation costs out of \nhis or her own pocket with no expectations of reimbursement. I believe \nthe costs associated with charitable transportation services ought to \nbe deductible at a rate which fairly represents the individual's actual \ncosts. This is especially important for volunteers living in rural \ncommunities who have to travel long distances to provide community \nservices.\n  Congress, in 1984, set the standard mileage exemption deduction rate \nof 12 cents per mile for individuals who use their automobiles in \nconnection with charitable activities. At the time the standard mileage \nrate for business use of an automobile was 20.5 cents per mile. In the \nintervening 13 years, the business mileage rate has increased to 30.5 \ncents per mile, but the charitable rate has remained unchanged at 12 \ncents per mile because the Treasury Department does not have the \nauthority to adjust the rate. By raising the charitable rate to 18 \ncents a mile, my legislation, I think, restores the relationship that \nexisted in 1984 between the charitable mileage rate and the business \nmileage rate. In addition, the legislation authorizes the Secretary of \nTreasury to increase the charitable mileage rate in the same manner as \nis currently allowed for business mileage expenses.\n  All of us agree that, with the changing role of the Federal \nGovernment, we need to do more to encourage voluntarism in our country. \nThe Volunteer Protection Act will do that, and so will the legislation \nthat I am introducing. Volunteers who provide transport services should \nbe allowed to deduct such costs at a rate which fairly reflects their \ntrue out-of-pocket costs, and this is precisely what the bill does.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in sponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter of support for my bill from the \nAmerican Legion. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     Member, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: The American Legion fully supports \n     the ``Charitable Travel Equity Act of 1997,'' to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the standard \n     mileage rate deduction for charitable use of passenger \n     automobiles.\n       Not only does The American Legion applaud the increase in \n     the mileage rate deduction, but more importantly this measure \n     fixes the problem that has not allowed for incremental \n     increases without an act of Congress action. The standard \n     mileage rate deduction for business use of passenger \n     automobiles has increased significantly while no adjustments \n     were made in the charitable use rate. Granting the Secretary \n     the authority to make prescribed adjustments will provide \n     fairness and promote additional volunteerism.\n       Thank you for your continuous leadership on behalf of \n     America's veterans and their dependents.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Steve Robertson,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                                  National Legislative Commission.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3861-6", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3867-S3870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have been in the midst of a filibuster \nwhere our President and many of our notable leaders around the country \nhave gone to Philadelphia and called for an expansion in voluntarism, \nsomething that we all believe in, something that America was built on.\n  We have a bill on the floor of the Senate now to try to protect \nvolunteers from frivolous lawsuits which threaten the whole process, \nand we are in the midst, basically, of a stall and a filibuster by our \nDemocratic colleagues in opposition to this bill.\n  In this lull, I wanted to take the opportunity to come to the floor \nof the Senate and, for the first time, publicly make a comment on the \nemerging budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the budget agreement that is now \nemerging is a good political deal, but it is a\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\nbad budget. It is a good political deal because, in a sense, it gives \nboth parties in the negotiation what they want.\n  The President in this budget negotiation gets what he wants. He gets \nan ironclad guarantee that the era of big Government is alive and well \nand guaranteed in Washington, DC. He gets new entitlement programs. He \ngets the reestablishment of entitlements that we eliminated in welfare \nreform. He gets more social spending than President Carter and nearly \ntwice as much as in the 1960's under Lyndon Johnson. The President, in \nthis emerging budget agreement, gets the one thing that he cares most \nabout, and that is a guarantee that Government is going to continue to \ngrow and that its presence in the American economy and American society \nis going to continue to be dominant.\n  In a sense, Republican Members of Congress get what they want. We get \nto claim a tax cut. We get to claim that we have delivered on a \ncampaign promise we made to let people keep more of what they earn. \nThere are still negotiations underway as to how big that tax cut is \ngoing to be. But the problem is that by politically manipulating the \nConsumer Price Index, something I will talk more about in a moment, \nwhat is happening is that while on one hand we are going to be \nguaranteeing a cut in taxes in the short run, by manipulating the \nmeasure of inflation upon which the Tax Code is built, we are \nguaranteeing increases in tax rates that will, over time, offset the \ncut in taxes that we will claim from this budget agreement as a \nvictory.\n  The President gets what he wants: more Government and a lot of it. \nRepublicans get what they want, and that is a claim of a short-term tax \ncut. But let me say the American people do not get what they want. The \nAmerican people get no fiscal restraint. In the end, the American \npeople will not get a balanced budget. In the end, the American people \nare not going to get a stronger economy from this budget. In the end, \nthe American people are not going to get any lasting tax relief from \nthis budget.\n  This budget is a great deal for Washington, but it is a bad deal for \nAmerica. This is the kind of budget that comes about when the two great \npolitical parties stop debating ideas and start conspiring against the \npublic, conspiring to promote their interest but not working either \ntogether or in contention to promote the public interest.\n  Let me say a little bit about the Consumer Price Index and about \npoliticizing it.\n  America is a country where statistics matter. Facts are persistent \nthings. Facts have an impact on what happens in our country, and the \nmeasure of inflation affects everything from how much you get in Social \nSecurity benefits to how much veterans receive in retirement benefits \nto how much we pay in taxes to how contracts are negotiated. We have \nset up an agency which, historically, has acted independently, the \nBureau of Labor Statistics, to try to come up with a measure of what \ninflation is, what consumer prices are.\n  Obviously, no statistic is perfect. In fact, we have had a debate in \neconomics for 40 years about whether the Consumer Price Index is a good \nmeasure of the cost of living. To listen to politicians talk about it \nin the last 4 or 5 years, there is this unanimous opinion among \nprofessional economists that the Consumer Price Index overstates \ninflation. Let me say that there are only two economists in the \nCongress, Dick Armey and myself, and we both oppose the change in the \nConsumer Price Index. In fact, economists are split on this subject.\n  No less an authority than Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize winning \neconomist, perhaps the best known economist on the planet and probably \nthe most able, has concluded that the CPI may well overstate the rise \nin private prices, but it almost certainly understates the cost of \nliving, which is the measure that we are using it for.\n  And why does the CPI understate the cost of living? Because it leaves \nout the No. 1 cost of living for the average working family in America. \nIn fact, it leaves out an involuntary expenditure that is bigger than \nhealth care, housing, nutrition, and transportation combined. The \nConsumer Price Index does not include the cost of Government, does not \ninclude taxes and, therefore, through that exclusion, Milton Friedman \nargues it understates the true cost of living, even though it might \nunderstate the rise in the cost of goods and services in the private \nsector. But whether CPI overstates or understates the Consumer Price \nIndex, we should not have political decisions being made about economic \nstatistics, and I would have to say, obviously, it was inevitable in \nthe Clinton administration that the process of setting statistics was \ngoing to become politicized.\n  We are looking in this negotiation underway at mandating, through an \nassumption that it will happen in the future, a change in the Consumer \nPrice Index that will raise taxes over a decade by over $100 billion, \nand it will raise taxes by changing the inflation rate and, therefore, \npushing working families more quickly into higher tax brackets and \nlowering the value of the personal exemption and the dependent \nexemption, which are critical factors in calculating the taxes of \nworking families.\n  So the bottom line is, by deciding on a political basis where Members \nof Congress and the President have decided that we are going to \nmanipulate the Consumer Price Index, we are going through that process \nto cut Social Security and other benefits over a decade by about $180 \nbillion, and we are going to raise taxes by about $120 billion.\n  What are we going to do with that money? We are going to spend every \npenny of it. So Social Security is 15 years away from insolvency, we \nare going to manipulate the Consumer Price Index and reduce benefits, \nbut we are not going to put those benefits back in to saving the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  We have the highest tax rates in American history. No American has \never lived a day where the aggregate tax rate, where you are looking at \ntaxes at all levels of Government, was as high as it is today. Never; \nnot a day. But what we are doing by manipulating our statistics is we \nare raising taxes on working families, and we are all doing it sort of \nquasi under the table.\n  I will offer, when we debate the budget, an amendment which I think \nis a pretty important amendment. In fact, I am going to call it the CPI \nSocial Security and Tax Equity Improvement Act. What this amendment is \ngoing to say very simply is this: That rather than having a bunch of \npoliticians manipulate the Consumer Price Index to try to cut Social \nSecurity benefits and raise taxes so we can spend the money, we ought \nto go ahead, since this has now reached such a political fever pitch to \nseize this money and squander it will not go away, we should leave it \nto the experts but dedicate the savings to specific purposes.\n  So what I am going to propose is two things. In the budget, I am \ngoing to say whatever we do to change the Consumer Price Index, that \nevery penny that comes from raising taxes on working families ought to \ngo back to those working families to raise the dependent exemption and \nthe standard deduction first back to the level that existed in 1950 in \nreal dollars. Today, the standard deduction is about $2,550. In \ncurrent-day inflation adjusted dollars, in 1950, it was $3,800.\n  So the first thing we would do with these savings that come with \nincreases in taxes from changing the CPI, if Congress does it in the \nbudget, is we would take that money rather than letting Congress spend \nit, the part that comes from raising taxes we use first to raise the \nstandard deduction up to $3,800 a year, and then we would use it to \nreduce marginal tax rates. And those parts of savings that come from \ncutting Social Security benefits, we would put back in the Social \nSecurity trust funds, but we would set up real trust funds with it. It \nwould be outside the Treasury Department. It would not count as the \ninternal debt of the Federal Government, because it is the debt of the \nFederal Government to Social Security beneficiaries. When we pay \ninterest on that debt, it would count as an outlay of the Federal \nGovernment. Today, it does not even count as an outlay of the Federal \nGovernment when Social Security earns interest. Finally, we would set \nup a procedure where we could look at having a real trust fund, \nincluding real investments.\n\n  I also will introduce a bill that will establish an independent \ncommission made up of all living American Nobel Prize winners in \neconomics and have\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nthem, in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, review for 6 \nmonths the Consumer Price Index and make a recommendation to the \nCommissioner of Labor Statistics. If she decides, based on their \nrecommendations, which will be made public, to change the Consumer \nPrice Index, then under the bill I will introduce, the part of savings \nthat come from raising taxes will go back to families to raise the \nstandard deduction and cut marginal tax rates. The part of savings that \ncome from the Social Security trust fund will go back into it, but into \na real trust fund that will be set up outside the Treasury, and it \nwould be capable for the first time in American history of making real \ninvestments.\n  I am not here to criticize our leader or to criticize Senator \nDomenici for their work on these negotiations. We all have to do the \nbest job we can do. We all have to try to achieve what we believe in, \nand I am sure that if the negotiations are completed along the lines \nthat they have negotiated them, that they will believe they have gotten \nthe best agreement they can get. But I cannot and do not support an \nagreement where the President gets what he wants, a guarantee of big \nGovernment in perpetuity, new entitlement spending, social spending the \nlikes of which we have not seen since the 1960's; Congress gets what it \nwants, the ability to claim a tax cut, even though by manipulating the \nmeasure of inflation, we raise taxes and, over time, offset that tax \ncut.\n  The problem is the President gets what he wants politically, Congress \ngets what Congress wants politically, but the American people do not \nget what they want politically. They want a real budget; they want \nfiscal restraint. Nobody can claim that this budget exercises fiscal \nrestraint. Nobody--Democrat, Republican--no one can look at this budget \nand say that a tough decision has been made, that spending has been \ncontrolled. There is no fiscal restraint in this budget.\n  While we will be able to claim a short-term tax cut, the reality is \nthere is no permanent tax cut when you factor in the change in consumer \nprices in this budget. We do not guarantee in this budget a balanced \nbudget. In fact, this budget begins by assuming a balanced budget, for \nall practical purposes. By changing the underlying assumptions in this \nbudget, if we simply went with a spending level set out in \ndiscretionary spending in current law, which is $4 billion for next \nyear below what we are spending now--that is the law of the land--and \nwe did nothing else under the assumptions of this budget, for all \npractical purposes, we would have a balanced budget.\n  So a balanced budget is not achieved by this budget; it is assumed by \nthis budget. In the end, this budget gives both political parties what \nthey need politically, but it does not give the American people what \nthey need and, as a result, I am not for it. This is a bad deal in the \nmaking. It is a deal that is a political deal with political ends. It \nis a deal that comes about when we move away from the traditional \nfunction of our great political parties, which is to contest, which is \nto present competing ideas and then ultimately allow the superior ideas \nto prevail. This budget really represents what I am sure will be \nportrayed in the media as great bipartisanship, but in reality it is \nthe two parties working together to claim political victories for each \nparty without achieving the objective that the American people seek.\n  So I do not doubt that there will be great support for this budget. \nWhen you claim you are balancing the budget, when you can demonstrate \nthat we are creating new entitlements and the largest social spending \nthat we have ever seen since the 1960's, you are going to have a lot of \nDemocrats who are going to support this budget. When you can claim, no \nmatter how temporary it may be--with the procedures in this budget, we \nwill over time raise income taxes--but when you can claim that we are \ncutting taxes, even for a short period of time, there are going to be \nsome Republicans who find this agreement to their liking.\n  Finally, there is pressure on us all, and there should be, to find a \ncompromise to balance the budget, to work with the President. But I do \nnot see an effort here to work with the President to solve the problem. \nI do not see an effort here to work with the President to gain control \nof spending. Both parties campaigned in the last election on \ncontrolling spending. There is no effort here to control spending. In \nfact, there is a conspiracy here, a bipartisan one, to increase \nspending. I do not see an effort here to guarantee and lock in a \nbalanced budget. I see an effort here to assume a balanced budget, so I \nsee bipartisanship all right, but it is bipartisanship basically to \nachieve a political goal for each political party. I do not see \nbipartisanship to achieve a goal for America.\n  Let me touch on two final points and then I will yield the floor.\n  We are going to bring up next week a supplemental appropriations \nbill. That supplemental appropriations bill, for all practical \npurposes, raises the deficit $8.4 billion, though there are some \noffsets in the defense area.\n  I remember when we had 43 Members of the Senate who were Republicans, \nand the Democrats tried to bring up a $17 billion so-called economic \nstimulus package, and we blocked it. We now have 55 Republicans, and \nyet next week we are going to bring up an $8.4 billion spending bill \nwhere virtually every penny of it is going to raise the deficit. We are \nalready spending $22 billion above what we said in our 1996 budget we \nwould be spending on discretionary spending this year.\n  I intend to offer an amendment next week. That amendment is going to \ndo two things. No. 1, it is going to say every penny we spend this year \non emergencies--and I am in favor of disaster relief--but I think it is \nvery instructive that if you look at the number of States we have had \nfloods in, and then you look at the fact that we are giving disaster \nassistance to 23 States, this disaster is taking on manmade \nimplications made in Washington, and the disaster is not just flooding \nhouses in North and South Dakota and Minnesota, but it is increasingly \nrunaway Government spending at the expense of the taxpayer and at the \nexpense of the deficit.\n  What I will propose is the amount of money we are going to spend for \nan emergency this year, spend it, but do an across-the-board cut in \nother programs to pay for it. Then whatever we spend next year, make it \ncount as part of the budget for next year; in other words, for next \nyear that it be offset against other programs that we might have spent \nit on.\n  I know we will have colleagues here who will jump up and say, well, \nwe have people who have been flooded out of their homes. And we do. And \nwe should help them. But shouldn't we pay for it?\n\n  What family would not like to say, when Johnny falls down the steps \nand breaks his arm, ``Well, look. We don't have any money. We have \nplanned to go on vacation this year'' or ``we were going to buy a new \nrefrigerator this year. So we are just going to have to assume that \nJohnny's arm gets fixed, and it would be nice if somebody would come in \nfrom Heaven and just give us the money.'' But that does not happen in \nAmerican families. What they have to do is they have to go back and \nthey have to not buy that new refrigerator or they have to not go on \nvacation.\n  What I am saying is, help people who have been the victims of natural \ndisaster, but do not create a financial disaster by simply adding it to \nthe deficit. Let us provide disaster assistance, but let us cut other \nprograms that now, with these disasters, we cannot afford.\n  Let me also note that this is not unexpected. We have had a disaster \nevery year that President Clinton has been in office and we have not \nhad the money to pay for it because we did not write it into our \nbudget. It has averaged about $7 billion a year. There is nothing \nunexpected. Every year in America we have floods or hurricanes or \ntornadoes or earthquakes. We know it is going to happen. When we do not \nwrite the money in our budget to pay for it, all we are doing is \nsaying, let us borrow the money and just keep spending. My answer is, \nlet us pay for it by cutting other Government programs.\n  I do not believe, Mr. President, that amendment is going to be \nadopted. There is no constituency that I can determine in the Congress \nfor controlling spending. But we are going to vote on it. We are going \nto know where people stand on this issue.\n  The final point I want to mention is on the so-called CR. We all know \nthat when the Government shut down, people were dislocated. I would \nhave to say\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\nthat I think the President did an exceptional job politically of \nexploiting it. I admire him for it. I think we did an inept job of \nexplaining that in fact the President vetoed the bill and shut the \nGovernment down.\n  But in an unusual effort to have good Government, what Republicans \nare saying on this appropriations bill we are going to vote on next \nweek is, look, before we get into any disputes with the President, let \nus just agree that if at any point during the year we cannot agree on \nhow much money to spend to keep the Government open, that we will keep \nit open temporarily at 98 percent of the spending we spent last year, \nwhich, by the way, is substantially above the budget that we adopted \nlast year.\n  Our Democratic colleagues are saying, ``Well, no, we can't do that. \nWe can't set out that if we can't reach an agreement we will simply \nspend 98 percent of last year's level.'' They are saying that somehow \nwe are trying to impose priorities on the President. What we are trying \nto do is to guarantee that we do not have a shutdown in Government. I \nthink our proposal is eminently reasonable. And I intend to support it. \nI do not intend to vote for this supplemental appropriations bill if we \ndo not have this provision to prevent a fiscal disaster written into \nit.\n  I think it is time for us to understand that we have an obligation, \nNo. 1, to pay for these bills, and, No. 2, to try to set out some way \nof gaining control of runaway Federal spending. The problem in \nWashington is still spending. We are still not controlling it. That is \nwhat this debate is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as some of my colleagues know, I was \nconsidering introducing, as a substitute to the bill by the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia and others, the bill of the \ndistinguished gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Porter, as introduced in the \nother body. I am withholding that because staff from my office and \nstaff of the distinguished Senator from Georgia and others have been \ntalking about some additional amendments to the pending legislation \nthat, if acceptable to all sides, would improve a number of the \nconcerns that the Senator from Vermont has with the pending \nlegislation, concerns I will not go into again here because the Senator \nfrom Vermont has discussed them on a number of occasions on the floor.\n\n  While I was waiting to make that announcement, though, I could not \nbut hear some comments of the Senator from Texas regarding the budget.\n  Frankly, I will say to my friend from Texas or anybody else, if they \nare not happy with the recommendations being made by the White House or \nDemocratic Senators or anything else, the Republican Party has a \nmajority of the Members in the House of Representatives, the Republican \nParty has a majority of the Members in the Senate of the United States. \nAll they have to do, if they have a budget they prefer to anything the \nPresident has, is bring it forward and pass it. They have enough votes \nto pass it. And the President cannot even veto it; it is a budget \nresolution. So it is a little bit disingenuous to suggest that somehow \nthe President or anybody else is winning on this.\n  The Republican Party has the majority of votes in the House and the \nSenate. A budget resolution cannot be vetoed. All they have to do is \npass it. In fact, the law requires that they pass it by April 15--I \nmean, April 15 of this year, not next year. The law also requires that \nyou and I, Mr. President, file our income taxes by April 15. If we do \nnot, we get a knock on the door from the IRS. Apparently nobody is \ngoing to knock on the door when the Congress did not pass a budget \nresolution by April 15.\n  But I suggest, before anybody goes tearing too hard after the \nPresident or anybody else that may have been negotiating a budget, with \nall due respect to my friends on the other side of the aisle, if they \ndo not like it, just pass their own. They could have followed the law \nand passed one by April 15. They did not. I will not chastise them for \nnot obeying the law, even though they want the rest of us to. But just \npass it, if you like. You can do it. I will also say, as far as passing \nan automatic continuing resolution, whoa Nellie, that has nothing to do \nwith cutting budgets. I am perfectly happy to vote for budget cuts. I \nvoted for more successful budget cuts than an awful lot of people in \nthis body, I mean those that actually passed in the Appropriations \nCommittee and elsewhere.\n  But this idea of some kind of an automatic continuing resolution is \njust a law that says we do not have to do our work. Now, by the end of \nSeptember we have to pass 13 appropriations bills. If we all just go \noff and take another vacation, do not pass them, then this law proposed \nby the Senator from Texas and others would kick in, and nobody would \neven know if we were out of town.\n  I prefer we do our work. Maybe some of the same people, some of the \nsame people who were unable to come up with a budget by April 15, who \nrefused to follow the law to come up with a budget by April 15, want \nthis new wrinkle, this unprecedented wrinkle of basically passing \nappropriations bills in advance, because if you pass this law, this \ncontinuing resolution, we can just go home. Maybe the American people \nwould like that, but I do not think we are meeting our \nresponsibilities. So I think we should stop the gimmicks in the \nappropriations bills. And this is just one more. It is not an issue of \nwhether you want to cut budgets or not. It is an issue of whether we do \nour work.\n  We have had several vacations this year and we confirmed two Federal \njudges and we are now in the fifth month. There are 100 vacancies. We \nhave had several vacations this year and we are now in May, even though \nthe budget resolution is supposed to be here April 15. I think before \nwe pass any more laws that allow us to escape the responsibility for \ncarrying out our actions in this body, we ought to do what we are \nsupposed to do.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 678 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3867-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3870-S3871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, going back to the matter at hand, all of us \nsupport the concept of volunteers working to help. In fact, this \ncountry could not make it without volunteers. I think of those \nvolunteers in the recent disastrous floods in the Dakotas who worked \n16- and 20-hour days to pack sandbags, sometimes to protect homes and \nproperty and businesses of people they did not know and probably never \nwould know. They just showed up, volunteered, and did it.\n  I think what happens, sometimes we will get hit with a vicious storm \nin my part of the world, power lines will come down, electricity will \nbe out, and people gather to volunteer and help. I think of some people \nI have seen in times when I have had the opportunity to volunteer in \nwhat we call our Cleanup Day. Cleanup Day in Vermont was begun by a \ndear friend and former Governor of Vermont, Dean Davis. This is where \nthousands of Vermonters all over the State go out at this time of \nyear--the snows are gone, we hope--and we will pick up trash all over \nthe State, beautify our roads, our streams.\n  In fact, I recall when my daughter was the State director, and I went \nwith her and some others. We saw a little piece of metal sticking up in \na stream and we decided to pull it, and more of us pulled, and pulled \nand pulled, and we got a car hooked up and pulled and pulled, and out \ncame a sink--a whole sink. Somebody had tossed it in there. We cleaned \nit up. I hope that stream was better as a result.\n  I think of the men and women who work with children in my State, the \nvolunteers who work with the 4-H Club, for example. During my 8 years \nas a prosecutor in Vermont, I went back through the records of all \nthose who came in our juvenile courts in the county where I was the \nStates attorney or district attorney. We had about a quarter of the \npopulation. During 8 years in that juvenile court, we never had a \nperson in there who had been active in 4-H or active in Scouting. Those \npeople worked so hard at it and learned good basic values, but they had \na lot of adults who volunteered to help in those operations.\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\n  I daresay that every single Member of this body is for volunteers. \nWhat I am concerned about in this particular bill is that it was \nintroduced, we never had a hearing, we have never had discussion of \nsome of the problems--and there are some significant legal problems in \nit--and I think that of late the Senate has been acting that way, just \ntaking up a big piece of legislation and rushing to the floor with it.\n  I raised a concern that various hate groups might be protected with \ntheir volunteers under this bill. The Senator from Georgia, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, and all the others both for and against this have a total \nabhorrence of hate groups. There is not a single Member of this body \nthat will stand for the kind of thing that so many hate groups stand \nfor.\n  What I have suggested is they should be looked at carefully. How do \nyou make sure that even beyond the prohibitions against hate crimes \nthat are in the bill that we have the prohibitions against immunizing \nvarious hate groups? Do we immunize the volunteers, and do we go \nfurther and immunize large organizations that might utilize volunteers \nand might not take the kind of care they should for the people that \ncome in there, absent those volunteers, or absent that immunization?\n  Let me give an example. If you have a large for-profit hospital, the \nkind of hospital where some of the administrators and owners of it will \nmake millions of dollars a year, where the daily care of the patients--\nnurses, nurses aides and others, of course, make a tiny infinitesimal \nfraction of that--are augmented by people who willingly come in and \nvolunteer in those hospitals, who are not the millionaire \nadministrators, do we want to set it up so the millionaire directors \nare somehow removed from that because they were wise enough to bring \nsome volunteers in? Now, I do not think anybody wants to do that.\n\n  So let us look at this legislation. As I said, I think we could have \navoided several days of discussion and cloture votes and everything \nelse if we had just done what we normally do or should do around here, \nand that is have a hearing on it. I am the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and we are not having to take much time for \nhearings on Federal judges and nominations even though there are 100 \nvacancies in the Federal courts. We had time to spend the whole day \nyesterday to beat up on Janet Reno in a hearing. We could have had time \nto take a couple hours to hold a hearing on this bill and probably \ncorrected the problems and we would have taken up a lot less time of \nthe Senate in the long run.\n  I found very interesting the hearing with Attorney General Reno. At \nthe end of 7, 8, or 9 hours, whatever it was, I commended her. She had \nlistened to interminable speeches punctuated by an occasional question. \nShe showed equanimity during the speeches, which made up most of the \nhearing--speeches from Senators--but also answered the occasional \nquestions with candor and integrity. It does not mean everyone will \nagree with her answers.\n  She sure showed a streak of independence, a streak that may have \nbothered some, because she showed a willingness to look into \ninappropriate activity by Members of Congress as well as just at the \nWhite House, a matter that I realize has caused some consternation to \nsome on the Hill, but I think it is only fair. If we look at one end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, we should look at the other end. I am sure the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer and others would agree with me in that \nregard.\n  Let us go to the bill at hand, let us continue to work together. The \nSenator from Georgia has been dealing in good faith, and he knows the \nSenator from Vermont has. We will continue to work and see if we can \nfind something, I hope, very soon.\n  I see the Senator from Georgia on the floor, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his remarks and \nhis interest and dedication to the effort.\n  I respond to him that, indeed, the effort to try to mesh the concerns \non both sides is eagerly being addressed right here at the moment, and \nthere are some positive indications, and I am hopeful that between the \nSenator from Vermont and his staff and ours and others that are \ninterested in the subject, that we can show some very positive, \nbipartisan effort here maybe in the next couple of hours or so. Again, \nI thank him for the effort to create the atmosphere that would allow us \nto perhaps bring resolution to this matter this afternoon yet.\n  Mr. President, I also say I think it is fair to note that the issue \nhas been before the Congress in one form or another since 1985. This is \nthe first time that we have really had legislation--that is 12 years. \nSo we are really not dealing with a subject matter for which there is \nunfamiliarity. We are really trying to hasten the coming together.\n  There is a propensity in Washington and in the Congress to mull \nthings a bit long. We have had a summit in Philadelphia where we have \nhad the President and three former Presidents, 30 Governors and 100 \nmayors say, ``Now is the time. Now is the time.'' They have called on \nover 2 million Americans to step forward. We want them to be able to \nstep forward and not get tripped up. This is exactly the time for us to \nbe addressing this legislation. It has been studied, reviewed, and \nargued for 12 years. We are down to, as I have said many times, 12 \npages. I am very hopeful that people of good faith and good will on \nboth sides can mesh these 12 pages together and, hopefully, by the end \nof the day, at least in the Senate, we can say yes to the President's \ncall and yes to Nancy Reagan, when she said, ``I hope from now on when \nsomebody asks for a helping hand, you just say yes.'' This helps \nAmerican volunteers do just what she requested: Just say yes.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3870-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3871-S3872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak a little bit about the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, which I gather will be on the floor \nhere probably next week, and this issue which has come to light about \nthe effort to put a so-called continuing resolution onto the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. I want to just try to make sense out \nof that as best I understand it and describe my recollection of things.\n  There has been a lot of talk in the last few days about the shutdown \nof Government that occurred in the last Congress. I was here at that \ntime and I remember the occasion. What was happening, as I recall it, \nwas that the President indicated very clearly in public statements and \nprivate statements, in a variety of ways, that he would not sign \nappropriations bills that contained major cuts in education and some of \nthe funds for enforcement of the environmental laws in particular. \nThose were areas of great concern to the President. He indicated that \nhe wanted Congress to agree with him to maintain funding in those \nareas--not necessarily increase it, but at least maintain funding in \nsome of those areas before he would sign those bills.\n  In spite of those statements to that effect, the majority here in \nCongress sent those bills to the President and he vetoed them. \nAccordingly, we had a shutdown of the Government. There was no funding \navailable through that appropriations process for those areas of the \nGovernment that were covered by those appropriations bills. So, \nessentially, what was going on was that the majority in Congress was \ntrying to force-feed the President to accept some proposals and some \ncuts in funding that he was not willing to accept, and that \nprecipitated a crisis. Some felt strongly. Some in the majority party--\nthe Republican Party--at the time felt strongly enough about it that \nthey\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nwere willing to just keep the Government shut down and not send another \ncontinuing resolution, not agree to fund Government at the steady State \nlevel, but to allow the Government to stay shut down as a way of \ngaining leverage in those negotiations. I believe it was on the 18th \nday of, I think, the second shutdown when Senator Dole, the leader in \nthe Senate, finally came to the Senate floor and spoke and said that he \nbelieved enough was enough and he himself was going to urge that a \ncontinuing resolution be passed in order to go ahead and at least keep \nthe Government funded on a steady-state basis while negotiations \nbetween the President and the Congress continued. I came to the floor \nright after Senator Dole spoke, or I was here at the time he spoke, and \nI commended him for his decision to break with the House leadership and \nto go ahead, after 18 days of shutdown, and finally go ahead and fund \nthese departments of the Government. Many of his colleagues here in the \nSenate followed his lead after that and agreed to go ahead and pass a \ncontinuing resolution to fund those areas of the Government.\n  That was the shutdown, as I recall it. That is a general description \nof the shutdown that occurred. What we have now is a bill to provide \nvery important funding for a variety of subjects. It is all wrapped \ninto this supplemental appropriation. It is a supplemental, of course, \nbecause it is not one of the regular appropriations bills which we do \neach year. It is a supplemental that comes at an unusual time, and the \ntime that we are dealing with this has been driven, perhaps as much as \nanything, by the natural disasters that have occurred in particular \nparts of the country, in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and in \nsome other areas as well. There are some other provisions in this \nsupplemental which are also very important. My home State of New Mexico \nwill be able to receive, under this supplemental, $14 million of \ndesperately needed highway funds, which should have been provided to us \nunder last year's bill and which I made a major point about in the last \nCongress. We had been fighting to get this money for over 6 months. We \nlost it in the last set of appropriations bills.\n\n  This year, we have been able to persuade the appropriators to include \nit in this supplemental, and I think that is a very important step \nforward. So there are provisions in this bill that are important to my \nState highway funds, title I funds, as well as, of course, the \nprovisions that are intended to assist with the disaster relief, which \nis so needed by many families that have been devastated by the weather \nand by the floods that they have experienced in recent weeks in these \nareas of the Midwest. So that is where we are.\n  The problem has come up that there is an amendment being included in \nthe supplemental appropriation that is another continuing resolution, \nand it says that essentially if we adopt that amendment, it would say \nthat if the Republican majority in Congress does not send the President \nan appropriations bill he will sign, an acceptable appropriations bill, \nin any area, there will be allowed to be continued funding in those \nareas at a rate of 2 percent less than this current fiscal year. The \ndifficulty with it, of course, is that it again changes the dynamic \nvery greatly against a real compromise occurring between the Executive \nand the Congress on these very important funding issues.\n  It says to the President, ``Look. Before, you had the ability to veto \nan appropriations bill which you disagreed with, and then everyone had \nto go back to the table.'' Now, if we add this continuing resolution \nprovision to the supplemental, that requirement won't be there anymore \nbecause there will be no pressure on the Republican Congress to go back \nto the table and negotiate further with the President. The President \nwill, if we send an appropriations bill that he determines is \nunacceptable for whatever reason and he vetoes it, as called for in the \nConstitution, then there is no pressure on the Republican leaders in \nCongress to renegotiate. They will have in place at that point a \ncontinuing resolution, which will have been part of the supplemental, \nwhich says we are going to fund everything, and, by the way, the \nfunding level is going to be 2 percent less than it was in the previous \nyear, or, in the case of areas such as education, it is going to be 7 \npercent less than he requested for this year. That will be the steady \nrate, and that will be the continuing situation from now on. So there \nis no pressure for the compromise that the Constitution contemplates \nbetween the executive branch and the legislative branch to occur. I \nthink it is a very ill-advised provision.\n  I think the President is taking the right position by saying that he \nwill not agree to this kind of continuing resolution being adopted as \npart of this supplemental. But basically, if the Congress says to the \nPresident,\n\n       If you want this relief for these flood victims, if you \n     want this money for highways in New Mexico, if you want this \n     money for Head Start, or for title I, or any of the other \n     provisions in this supplemental, then you have to agree to a \n     spending level that is 2 percent below this current year's \n     level in all of these other areas, unless we are able to send \n     you something else that is preferable at a later date.\n\n  This is not an acceptable proposal. I think the President is correct \nin refusing to agree to it.\n  We on the Democratic side are correct in refusing to agree to it. \nWhat we should do, and what I believe the American people would like us \nto do, is to go ahead and approve the supplemental appropriations bill, \ngo ahead and appropriate the funds for flood relief, go ahead and \nappropriate the funds for the additional highway funding, go ahead and \nappropriate the additional funds for title I. Then we can have a \ndebate, as we go through the rest of this year, on the budget \nresolution and on the appropriations bills. We can have a debate about \nwhat the right level of spending ought to be in each of these other \nareas.\n  We should not at the very beginning, before we have a budget \nresolution, before we have any appropriations bills, have some kind of \nlegal provision that says, unless the President agrees to what the \nRepublican majority in Congress sends him, that he has to settle for a \n2-percent cut in all areas: education, environmental protection, and \nall of the other areas.\n  That is what this continuing resolution provision would do. It needs \nto be dropped from the supplemental appropriations bill if we are going \nto go ahead and pass this supplemental appropriations and have it \nsigned into law. It is very important that it be signed into law, and \nsooner rather than later.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are very hopeful, now that we have \ngotten to S. 543, an accord that deals with the views and concerns of \nboth sides can be reached, but that is not the case as yet and I \nthought I would take just a moment on something I wanted to acknowledge \nduring the course of the debate.\n  I found it very interesting that one of the periodicals that came out \nfollowing the summit in Philadelphia quoted President Clinton and \nPresident Bush. I want to share that with the Senate. President Clinton \nsaid:\n\n       I am keenly aware of the need for strong, caring adults in \n     a child's life. My mother taught me to see opportunities \n     where others see only challenges. My grandfather took me with \n     him, visiting with neighbors and teaching me about people. My \n     grandmother read aloud to me every day so I would be able to \n     read before going to kindergarten. I want children in every \n     family and community to have the same chance I did.\n\n  President Bush said:\n\n       I said it as President and I'll say it again: Someplace in \n     this country every problem that plagues us is being solved \n     through volunteerism, whether it's drug addiction, street \n     crime or teenage pregnancy. Some community, through \n     volunteers, has solved the problem.\n\n  Both of these Presidents have pointed, as most of the summit did, to \nthe\n\n[[Page S3873]]\n\nshortfall that is occurring among and for many of the youth of our \nNation, which is again why I think it is so important that S. 543 \ngarner passage here today, because it will free up so much energy to \naddress this problem.\n  The other point I want to reiterate is that when you read through the \nstatements and the work of General Powell and the others at the summit, \nthey are not only talking about voluntarism but they are talking about \nvoluntarism that occurs in very troubled communities. They use the \nterms poisonous streets and difficult environments. They are talking \nabout not the everyday idea of an American family. They are talking \nabout people who are products of broken families and very serious \ndifficulties. The issue that I have tried to underscore with regard to \nS. 543 is that because these areas are so troubled and so difficult, it \nmore than accentuates the need for some protection, legal protection \nfor our volunteers who are willing to go into this area, because they \nare going into an environment, they are going into a situation that is \ntroubled, volatile, abnormal, prone to difficulties and accidents, and \nconditions that would elevate the threat of legal ramifications.\n  So I think it is important that we are not talking out of the summit \nabout some of the more traditional forms of voluntarism, many of which \nare not surrounded with risk, but this call for 2 million people to \nstep forward in a difficult situation is all the more reason this \nCongress should take steps to make it easier for those volunteers to \nstep forward.\n  Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague from Alaska has come \nto the floor, and I am glad to yield the floor so that he might make \nhis remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I reintroduced a bill that I \nintroduced some years ago. I think it is a very important measure. It \nis a measure that will unlock and open a door that Congress has kept \nbarred for over 100 years. By opening this door, we are going to create \nthousands of new jobs, hundreds of millions of dollars in economic \nactivity, and significant revenue for the Federal and State and local \ngovernments. Furthermore, that door can be opened with no adverse \nimpact on any existing U.S. industry, U.S. labor interest, or on the \nenvironment. And it will cost the Federal Government nothing.\n  There is no magic to this. In fact, it is a very simple matter. This \nbill allows U.S. seaports to compete for the ever-growing cruise ship \ntrade, specifically to my State of Alaska, but all west coast ports, \nTacoma, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and so forth, would benefit. \nFurther, it would encourage the development of an all-Alaska cruise \nbusiness as well.\n  The bill I propose amends the Passenger Service Act to allow foreign \ncruise ships to operate from U.S. ports to Alaska and between Alaska \nports. However, it also very carefully protects all existing U.S. \npassenger vessels by using a definition of cruise ship designed to \nexclude any foreign flag vessel that could conceivably compete in the \nsame market as U.S.-flag tour boats, ferries, vessels that carry cargo, \net cetera.\n  Finally, it provides a mechanism to guarantee that if a U.S. vessel, \na cruise vessel, ever enters this trade in the future, steps will be \ntaken to ensure an ample pool of potential passengers. Specifically, it \nwould require that foreign-flag vessels of greater passenger capacity \nwill be required to leave the market upon the entry of any U.S. cruise \nship.\n  People say, don't we have U.S. passenger ships? We have one, just one \nleft: the Constitution, that operates off the Hawaiian Islands. The \nlast U.S. passenger ship that was built to cruise ship capability, was \nthe S.S. United States, nearly 40 years ago. We are simply not in the \ncruise passenger business in the United States anymore, but foreign \nships from the Caribbean are. They move to Alaska and the west coast of \nBritish Columbia in the summer, where they carry passengers between \nAmerican ports and foreign ports, but cannot carry passengers between \nU.S. ports. What we are proposing is we simply allow those vessels on \nthe west coast to carry passengers from west coast U.S. ports such as \nSan Francisco and Tacoma, to Alaska, and on intra-Alaska voyages.\n  This is a straightforward approach to a vexing problem that deserves \nsupport by this body.\n  Let us look at the facts. The U.S. ports currently are precluded--let \nme emphasize this--U.S. ports are precluded from competing for the \nAlaska cruise ship trade by the Passenger Service Act of--when? Of \n1886. That act bars foreign vessels from carrying passengers on one-way \nvoyages between the U.S. ports. However, it is not 1886 anymore. These \ndays, no one--no one is building any U.S. passenger ship of this type. \nAnd no one has built one in over 40 years. The S.S. United States was \nthe last one.\n  Let me again emphasize that it is not 1886 anymore. These days, no \none is building any U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed, U.S.-built cruise ships \nof the type that are in the cruise business and sail out of Caribbean \nports in the wintertime and out of Vancouver, British Columbia, to \nAlaska in the summertime.\n\n  Because there are no U.S. vessels in this important trade, the only \nreal effect the Passenger Service Act has been to force all vessels \nsailing to my State of Alaska to base their operations in a foreign \nport, namely Vancouver, British Columbia.\n  In essence, Mr. President, what we have here is an act of Congress \nprohibiting U.S. cities from competing for thousands of jobs, and for \nhundreds of millions of business dollars. This is absurd. It is worse \nthan absurd. In light of our ever-popular election year promises to \nkeep the economy growing, I suggest it belongs to Letterman's top 10 \nreasons why Congress oftentimes does not know what it is doing.\n  Can anyone argue with a straight face for the continuation of a \npolicy that fails utterly to benefit any identifiable American \ninterest, while actively discouraging economic growth?\n  This is not the first time I have introduced this legislation. When I \nbegan the process, Alaska-bound cruise passengers totaled about 200,000 \nper year. By last year, 445,000 people, most of them American citizens, \nwere making that voyage. This year's traffic may exceed 500,000 people. \nAlmost all of those passengers are sailing to and from Vancouver, \nBritish Columbia, not because Vancouver is necessarily a better port, \nbut because our own foolish policy demands it.\n  I have nothing but admiration for my friends in British Columbia and \nthe city of Vancouver. They have done a fine job. But we are simply \nspiting ourselves and our own U.S. interests and it is time we looked \nat this issue rationally. The cash flow generated by this trade is \nenormous. Most of these passengers fly in and out of Seattle-Tacoma \nInternational Airport in Washington State, but because of this law they \nspend little time there. Instead they spend their pre- and post-sailing \ntime in a Vancouver hotel, in a bus to Vancouver, at a Vancouver \nrestaurant, a Vancouver coffee shop, and when their vessel sails it is \nloaded with food, fuel, general supplies, repair, maintenance needs \ntaken care of--by Canadian vendors.\n  There is nothing wrong with that, but this business could be in the \nUnited States. According to some of our estimates, the city of \nVancouver receives benefits of well over $200 million a year. Others \nprovide more modest estimates, such as a comprehensive study done by \nthe International Council of Cruise Lines, which indicated that in 1992 \nalone, the Alaska cruise trade generated over 2,400 jobs for the city \nof\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\nVancouver, plus payments to Canadian vendors and employees of over $119 \nmillion.\n  If that business had taken place in the United States, in U.S. ports \nsuch as Tacoma or San Francisco, it would have been worth additional \nFederal, State and local tax revenues of approximately $60 million.\n  I note that there is interest now in ports in South Carolina to offer \nsailings along the eastern seaboard. It is interesting to note also \nthat we have already seen fit to exempt Puerto Rico from the Passenger \nService Act, under less onerous restrictions than in this bill, so that \nforeign vessels are allowed to from the United States to the territory \nof Puerto Rico. So we have made these exceptions, they can work without \ndestroying the fabric of our life, and there is no justification why \nthis should not also be done for voyages from the west coast to Alaska.\n  In addition to the opportunities now being shunted to Vancouver, we \nare also missing an opportunity to create entirely new jobs and \nincreased income flow by developing new cruise routes between Alaska \nports.\n  The city of Ketchikan, AK, was told a few years ago that there were \ntwo relatively small cruise lines that were very interested in \nestablishing short cruises within southeastern Alaska, and indeed, were \ninterested in basing their vessels in Ketchikan. I am told such a \nbusiness could have contributed as much as $2 million or more to that \nsmall community's economy and created dozens of new jobs, but because \nof the current policy, the opportunity simply evaporated.\n  Why, Mr. President, do we allow this to happen? This is a market \nalmost entirely focused on U.S. citizens going to see one of the most \nspectacular States of the United States, namely, Alaska, and yet we \nforce them to go to another country, Canada, to do it. We are throwing \naway both jobs and money and getting nothing in return. Why is this \nallowed to happen? The answer is simple, but it is not rational.\n  Although the current law is a job loser, there are those who argue \nthat any change would weaken U.S. maritime interests. I submit that \nsimply is not the case. For some inexplicable reason, paranoia seems to \nrun deep among those who oppose this bill. They seem to feel that, by \namending the Passenger Service Act so that it makes sense for the \nUnited States and would create jobs, somehow it is a threat to the \nJones Act. That is not true. The vessels covered under the Jones Act \nhaul freight, not passengers, between U.S. ports. They are required to \nbe U.S. built, U.S. crewed, and U.S. documented, and because this \nprotects an existing industry, we support that. But the circumstances \nfor freight vessels do not exist for passenger ships.\n  There is simply no connection whatsoever between the two issues. I \nhave repeatedly made it clear that I have no intention of using this \nbill to create cracks in the Jones Act. This bill would actually \nenhance, not impede, opportunities for U.S. workers--shipyard workers \nand certainly longshoremen, not to mention hotel and restaurant \nworkers, and many others who would have a great deal to gain from this \nlegislation.\n  The bill has been carefully written to prevent the loss of any \nexisting jobs in other trades. As I have said before, Puerto Rico \nalready enjoys an exemption from the Passenger Service Act. We looked \nat that exemption--which has worked successfully--and drafted this \neffort with even more care in mind.\n  Finally, there can be no suggestion that this bill might harm smaller \nU.S. tour or excursion vessels built in U.S. yards with U.S. crews. The \nindustry featuring these small vessels is thriving and doing well but \nsimply does not cater to the same clientele and same base as the larger \ncruise ships. For one thing, the tour boats operating in Alaska are \nmuch smaller. The smallest foreign flag vessel eligible under this is \nCarnival Cruise Lines Wind Star, which is about 5,700 gross deadweight \ntons. It overnights approximately 159 passengers.\n\n  By contrast, although the largest U.S. vessel in the Alaska trade is \nrated at 138 passengers, she is less than 100 gross deadweight tons. \nThis means there is a vast difference between these two vessels. The \nsmall U.S. vessels should be protected from foreign competition, and \nour bill does that, but it does so with the realization that not all \nmarkets, and not all passengers, are the same.\n  The fact of the matter is that there is no significant competition \nbetween the two types of vessels, because the passengers inclined to \none are not likely to be inclined to the other. The larger passenger \nvessels offer unmatched luxury, personal service, onboard shopping, \nentertainment, gaming and so forth. The smaller vessels offer more \nflexible routes, the ability to get closer to the extraordinary natural \nattractions along the way and are able to get into the smaller \ncommunities.\n  Now Mr. President, in the spirit of full disclosure, let me \nacknowledge that there is one operating U.S. vessel that does not fit \nthe mold, as I mentioned earlier. That is the Constitution, an aging \n30,000-ton vessel operating only in Hawaii. It was a U.S. flag vessel \nthat was built years ago to operate in the United States. It went out \nof U.S. operation, into foreign flag service, then was refitted. It \ntook action by Congress to allow it to come back into the U.S. trade.\n  This is the only oceangoing-capable U.S. ship that might fit the \ndescription of a cruise vessel, but I question its ability to compete, \ncertainly in the market with the newer cruise vessels. And I repeat, it \nis the only one. I searched for other U.S. vessels that meet or exceed \nthe 5,000-ton limit in the bill, and the only ones I found that even \napproach it are the Delta Queen and the Mississippi Queen, both of \nwhich are approximately 3,300 tons and both of which are somewhat like \n19th century riverboats. They can operate on the Mississippi and other \nlarge rivers, but are entirely unsuitable for any open-ocean itinerary.\n  I cannot claim this legislation would immediately lead to increased \nearnings to U.S. ports. There are advantages of operating out of \nVancouver--the sailing time to Alaska is shorter, and so forth. But I \ncan say that it would allow U.S. ports--ports like Tacoma and San \nFrancisco--to compete fairly for this lucrative business.\n  Instead of being anchored by a rule that is actively harmful to U.S. \ninterests, as I said at the beginning, this is only a way to open the \ndoor so we can look at what we are losing and look at what we can gain.\n  We heard a lot of talk about growing the economy and creating jobs \nduring the last years, and we all know that such changes are easy to \ntalk about but difficult to accomplish. Here is a bill that opens up \nthe door to thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars, and \ncan do it without 1 red cent of the taxpayers' money. Isn't that worth \nthinking about?\n  It has been 110 years since the current law was enacted, and it is \ntime for a change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3873-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3874-S3880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n     is deterred by the potential for liability actions against \n     them;\n       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n     organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n     associations, social service agencies, educational \n     institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n     affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n     directors and service in other capacities;\n       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n     is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n     programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n     participating;\n       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n     effective social service programs, many of which are national \n     in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n     represent some of the most successful public-private \n     partnerships, protection of volunteerism through \n     clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n     assumed by the volunteer in connection with such \n     participation is an appropriate subject for Federal \n     legislation;\n       (5) services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit \n     organizations would often otherwise be provided by private \n     entities that operate in interstate commerce;\n       (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher \n     costs in purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance \n     markets, to cover their activities; and\n       (7) clarifying and limiting the liability risk assumed by \n     volunteers is an appropriate subject for Federal legislation \n     because--\n       (A) of the national scope of the problems created by the \n     legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, arbitrary, or \n     capricious lawsuits;\n       (B) the citizens of the United States depend on, and the \n     Federal Government expends funds on, and provides tax \n     exemptions and other consideration to, numerous social \n     programs that depend on the services of volunteers;\n       (C) it is in the interest of the Federal Government to \n     encourage the continued operation of volunteer service \n     organizations and contributions of volunteers because the \n     Federal Government lacks the capacity to carry out all of the \n     services provided by such organizations and volunteers; and\n       (D)(i) liability reform for volunteers will promote the \n     free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n     commerce and uphold constitutionally protected due process \n     rights; and\n       (ii) therefore, liability reform is an appropriate use of \n     the powers contained in article 1, section 8, clause 3 of the \n     United States Constitution, and the fourteenth amendment to \n     the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the \n     interests of social service program beneficiaries and \n     taxpayers and to sustain the availability of programs, \n     nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that \n     depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws to \n     provide certain protections from liability abuses related to \n     volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental \n     entities.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to \n     the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, \n     except that this Act shall not preempt any State law that \n     provides additional protection from liability relating to \n     volunteers or to any category of volunteers in the \n     performance of services for a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This Act \n     shall not apply to any civil action in a State court against \n     a volunteer in which all parties are citizens of the State if \n     such State enacts a statute in accordance with State \n     requirements for enacting legislation--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this Act \n     shall not apply, as of a date certain, to such civil action \n     in the State; and\n       (3) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as \n     provided in subsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable \n     for harm caused by an act or omission of the volunteer on \n     behalf of the organization or entity if--\n       (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n       (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n     licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n     authorities for the activities or practice in the State in \n     which the harm occurred, where the activities were or \n     practice was undertaken within the scope of the volunteer's \n     responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity;\n       (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal \n     misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a \n     conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of \n     the individual harmed by the volunteer; and\n       (4) the harm was not caused by the volunteer operating a \n     motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which \n     the State requires the operator or the owner of the vehicle, \n     craft, or vessel to--\n       (A) possess an operator's license; or\n       (B) maintain insurance.\n       (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to \n     Organizations and Entities.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect any civil action brought by any nonprofit \n     organization or any governmental entity against any volunteer \n     of such organization or entity.\n       (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--\n     Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \n     liability of any nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity with respect to harm caused to any person.\n       (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the \n     laws of a State limit volunteer liability subject to one or \n     more of the following conditions, such conditions shall not \n     be construed as inconsistent with this section:\n       (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n     including mandatory training of volunteers.\n       (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n     liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the \n     same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or \n     omissions of its employees.\n       (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of \n     a State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n       (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n     individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n     volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n     financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n     policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a \n     risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n     arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization \n     or entity will be able to pay for losses up to a specified \n     amount. Separate standards for different types of \n     liability exposure may be specified.\n       (e) Limitation on Punitive Damages Based on the Actions of \n     Volunteers.--\n       (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may not be awarded \n     against a volunteer in an action brought for harm based on \n     the action of a volunteer acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity unless the claimant establishes by clear \n     and convincing evidence that the harm was proximately caused \n     by an action of such volunteer which constitutes willful or \n     criminal misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to \n     the rights or safety of the individual harmed.\n       (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of \n     action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede \n     any Federal or State law to the extent that such law would \n     further limit the award of punitive damages.\n       (f) Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--The limitations on the liability of a \n     volunteer under this Act shall not apply to any misconduct \n     that--\n       (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n     defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n     of international terrorism (as that term is defined in \n     section 2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been \n     convicted in any court;\n       (B) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n     Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n       (C) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n     State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n     court;\n       (D) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n     found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; \n     or\n       (E) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n     determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n     alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     be construed to effect subsection (a)(3) or (e).\n\n     SEC. 5. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any civil action against a volunteer, \n     based on an action of a volunteer acting within the scope of \n     the volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization \n     or governmental entity, the liability of the volunteer for \n     noneconomic loss shall be determined in accordance with \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant who is a volunteer shall be \n     liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to \n     that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2))\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\n     for the harm to the claimant with respect to which that \n     defendant is liable. The court shall render a separate \n     judgment against each defendant in an amount determined \n     pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant who is a volunteer under this section, the trier of \n     fact shall determine the percentage of responsibility of that \n     defendant for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any \n     pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of \n     earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical \n     expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death, \n     burial costs, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities) to the extent recovery for such loss is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (2) Harm.--The term ``harm'' includes physical, \n     nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses.\n       (3) Noneconomic losses.--The term ``noneconomic losses'' \n     means losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, \n     inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, \n     disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and \n     companionship, loss of consortium (other than loss of \n     domestic service), hedonic damages, injury to reputation and \n     all other nonpecuniary losses of any kind or nature.\n       (4) Nonprofit organization.--The term ``nonprofit \n     organization'' means--\n       (A) any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under \n     section 501(a) of such Code; or\n       (B) any not-for-profit organization organized and conducted \n     for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, \n     civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or any political subdivision of any such \n     State, territory, or possession.\n       (6) Volunteer.--The term ``volunteer'' means an individual \n     performing services for a nonprofit organization or a \n     governmental entity who does not receive--\n       (A) compensation (other than reasonable reimbursement or \n     allowance for expenses actually incurred); or\n       (B) any other thing of value in lieu of compensation,\n\n     in excess of $500 per year, and such term includes a \n     volunteer serving as a director, officer, trustee, or direct \n     service volunteer.\n\n     SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act shall take effect 90 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Application.--This Act applies to any claim for harm \n     caused by an act or omission of a volunteer where that claim \n     is filed on or after the effective date of this Act, without \n     regard to whether the harm that is the subject of the claim \n     or the conduct that caused the harm occurred before such \n     effective date.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me explain our disposition. While \nthere is considerable more time in the unanimous consent, it is \nanticipated that there would be a delegating of time back so we might \nvote as closely to 2 o'clock as possible. So, I would like to proceed \nto explain this amendment so we might get this piece done. There are \nconditions that are affecting certain Members that would require, \nhopefully, we could vote as close to 2 o'clock as possible.\n  Mr. President, I want to explain to our colleagues. First, I thank \nthe ranking member, the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy. It has \nbeen a long week for both of us. He and his staff and colleagues have \nworked diligently with this Senator and his staff and colleagues \nthroughout the morning to arrive at the amendment that has just been \nforwarded to the desk under unanimous consent.\n  This substitute adds a finding to clarify the Federal role in civil \nliability matters related to voluntarism. The substitute clarifies the \nState opt-out section, to ensure the provision does not supersede State \nrequirements for enacting legislation and allows for States to include \nan effective date. The substitute clarifies the punitive damage \nprotections only relate to cases that are based on the actions of the \nvolunteer and do not supersede more restrictive Federal or State laws.\n  The substitute would clarify that the specific exemptions in the bill \nfor cases of violent crime, sex offenses, hate crimes, civil rights \nviolations, and DUI, do not restrict the general exemption where the \nharm was willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless \nmisconduct or conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety \nof the individual harmed.\n  The substitute clarifies that the joint and several liability \nlimitations for noneconomic damages and the punitive damage limitations \nonly apply to defendants who are volunteers. The substitute clarifies \nthat the volunteer can receive reimbursement for reasonable expenses \nand still be considered a volunteer.\n  I and the other authors on our side have concurred with these \nchanges. We still believe the version we submitted, S. 543, was \nreasoned and balanced, but feel that this is a compromise that gets us \nto the target we were after--the shield for the volunteer. And in these \nactions, assuming we receive a favorable vote, we will have responded \nresponsibly and rightfully to the call of the administration, President \nClinton, and Presidents Bush, Ford, and Carter, to launch a new era in \nvoluntarism in the United States.\n  With that brief statement, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to learn we have worked \nout a compromise with the other side on this very important issue. I \ncommend the Senator for his diligence and commitment to proceed with a \nsolution that is going to be in the best interests of voluntarism.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, let me give the disposition of our \nsituation on S. 543. We are trying to communicate to the principal \nauthors so that they might have a chance to make closing comments with \nregard to the amendment that I have submitted, and we are still \nendeavoring to try to vote between 2 and 2:15.\n  While we are waiting for those Senators to arrive, I will talk about \nwhat the passage of this bill will mean, an achievement that will be \nsecured in the Senate.\n  We will have effectively responded to a circumstance that has been \ndeveloping since the mid-1980's when volunteers suddenly found \nthemselves the targets of lawsuits in the act of volunteering. Prior to \nthat time, very little of this type of legal allegation occurred. We \nhave discovered that voluntarism has been chilled and threatened and \npushed back and been less exuberant. Volunteers' behavior is even \ndifferent when they do volunteer because of the threat of legal \nconsequences.\n  When we pass this legislation, S. 543, and hopefully ultimately pass \nit in the House and send it to the President and he signs it, we will \nhave created a protective buffer, a shield for the well-meaning \nvolunteer, the volunteer who experiences a simple accident or omission. \nWe have heard some of the stories on the floor of the Senate. A coach \nwho has a player who inadvertently slides into home head first instead \nof feet first will not have to spend long nights awake wondering \nwhether, because he was or she was a volunteer, they will lose their \nhome and assets and checking account, et cetera. The principle we will \nhave accomplished is to protect a volunteer from being under assault \nfor that kind of omission.\n  The second thing we will have achieved is that the volunteer will no \nlonger be looked at as the deep pocket. If they volunteer for an \norganization that does not have any resources, they may have a home, or \nsomething to that effect, and so the suit goes to the volunteer instead \nof the organization. But now the volunteer cannot be held liable for \nanything more than their proportional responsibility. So the story we \ntalked about on the floor of the Senate yesterday and today of the \nwoman who was nothing more than a receptionist out front answering a \nphone while an accident occurred in the gym will no longer be held \nliable for the fact that something went wrong somewhere else.\n  So this is very meaningful, as I said a moment ago, a very \nsignificant congressional initiative that keeps the legacy of the \nsummit alive and helps fuel the call for new volunteers.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, said earlier today \nthat one of the concerns of the summit was that it would flame out, \nthat after all the glitz and the visuality of seeing the celebrities \nand political leaders gathered together, what would keep it\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\ngoing? I think S. 543 will be one response from the Congress, one \nopportunity to keep the fuel under the idea of more and more Americans \nstepping forward in a very, very difficult time.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will be able to conclude this \nvote, if at all possible, by at least 2:15.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today to announce my strong \nsupport for S. 543, the Volunteer Protection Act.\n  As the excitement surrounding today's events in Philadelphia have so \npoignantly illustrated, ours is a nation that has a particular \ndependence on the volunteer movement. Nonprofit organizations mobilize \nvolunteers by drawing on their members' special talents to meet social \nor economic needs. Volunteer organizations are currently deeply \ninvolved in such activities as alleviating hunger, educating the public \nabout the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse, providing care of the \nelderly and infirm, providing athletic programs for our Nation's youth, \nproviding opportunity for the poor, building housing for the homeless, \npromoting literacy and education, finding missing children, teaching \nfire safety, aiding victims of natural disasters, providing moral \neducation for our youth, and spreading American ideals across the \nworld. In fact, according to a 1990 study by the Hudson Institute, \nwhich polled approximately 5,500 associations, volunteer time in \nAmerica was conservatively estimated to total $3.3 billion per year.\n  This is nothing new. In his 1835 commentary of our country, the epic \n``Democracy in America,'' Alexis de Toqueville noted that America was a \nnation of joiners. To de Toqueville this was very significant. \nNongovernmental charitable, religious, and community organizations \ncombined with the family and other natural social units to form what he \ntermed ``intermediary'' organizations--organizations that impede the \ntrend toward centralization of virtually all administration in the \nnational government. It is these intermediary groups that are essential \nin protecting the liberty of the individual and community from the \nregulatory state.\n  In recent times, there has been an awareness of the need to \nstrengthen volunteer organizations as a way to buttress the newly \nrediscovered virtues of limited government. Americans are coming to \nrealize that government should not and cannot be relied on to provide \nall social services. The gap between American needs and American \nresources must be filled by the generous efforts of our volunteer \ncorps. But the current litigation nightmare sweeping our Nation is \ngoing a long way to hinder the efforts of these important volunteers. \nThis at a time when we must be doing everything possible to encourage \nthe spirit of voluntarism.\n  Mr. President, I'd like to illustrate for you a couple of reasons why \nI believe the litigious nature of our society is dampening the spirit \nof voluntarism. A Gallup study revealed the large extent to which the \nthreat of lawsuits, and the prohibitive cost of liability insurance, \nhave a negative effect on volunteer participation in charitable \norganizations. The survey found that nearly 20 percent of all nonprofit \norganizations in the United States have experienced volunteers \nwithholding service or resigning due to fear of liability exposure. \nThis figure represents a very significant portion of the volunteer \ncommunity. Specifically, 1 in 10 nonprofit organizations have \nexperienced the resignation of a volunteer due to liability concerns. \nLet's do the math--with approximately 600,000 nonprofit organizations \nin America, we know that 48,000 volunteers have been lost during the \npast few years strictly due to liability concerns. Additionally, one in \nsix volunteers report withholding their services due to fear of \nexposure to liability suits. This means that 100,000 potential American \nvolunteers have declined to serve due to fear of exposure to lawsuits. \nThis is an extraordinary figure.\n\n  Additionally, the rate voluntarism has been steadily declining in \nrecent years. The percentage of Americans volunteering dropped from 54 \npercent in 1989 to 48 percent in 1993. Sadly, charitable donations are \nalso declining, falling roughly $100 per household during this same \nshort period. However, in 1991 alone, Americans spent a hefty $132 \nbillion on the civil justice system. As a result, it is not surprising \nto note that liability insurance premiums for nonprofit organizations \ncontinue to rise.\n  These figures demonstrate that the on-going litigation craze has \nseriously damaged the spirit of voluntarism. I would like to document \nseveral cases that stand out in particular:\n  Lawyers for an injured mountain climber sued volunteer rescuers for \n$12 million on the grounds that their rescue methods were negligent and \nreckless. Prior to assisting this particular climber, the rescue team \nsuccessfully and carefully made hundreds of rescues without incident.\n  In February 1995, Cleighton Hall, then CEO of Little League Baseball, \nwrote in the Wall Street Journal that Little League had turned into \n``Litigation League.'' In one instance, two youngsters collided in the \noutfield, picked themselves up, dusted themselves off, and sued their \ncoach. In another instance, lawyers won a large cash settlement when \ntheir client was struck by a ball that a player failed to catch--that \nplayer, strangely enough, was the client's daughter. Finally, trial \nattorneys for a child in Runnymeade, NJ, filed suit against the youth's \ncoach when he was struck by a flyball in center field.\n  Finally, a boy in a scouting unit with the Boy Scouts of the Cascade \nPacific Council suffered a paralyzing injury in a game of touch \nfootball. Several adults volunteered to supervise the trip. The youth's \nattorneys filed a personal injury suit alleging that the Boy Scouts and \nthe volunteers were negligent for failing to supervise the youth \nadequately. The jury found that the volunteers were personally liable \nfor $7 million. Oregon law ultimately caused the judgment to be reduced \nto around $4 million, but few Boy Scout volunteers can afford this kind \nof judgment.\n  Anyone who has been a Boy Scout or has volunteered in any capacity \nknows that certain accidents are impossible to prevent. The basic \nproblem is that the actions of this Nation's greedy trial lawyers are \nserving to undermine the positive effects of voluntarism. Clearly, Mr. \nPresident, the current situation cries out for reform.\n  The Volunteer Protection Act helps charities and nonprofit \norganizations serve their communities by giving their volunteers \nimmunity from lawsuits. Volunteers who act in a grossly negligent or \nincompetent manner are, of course, not be protected under the \nlegislation.\n  This bill will provide a volunteer protection from litigation in \ncases where, first, the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \nvolunteer's responsibilities; second, the volunteer was properly \nlicensed, certified, or authorized by the State in which the harm \noccurred, if such authorization is required; and third, the harm was \nnot caused by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, \nreckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the \nrights or safety of the individual harmed by the volunteer.\n  The bill also limits punitive damages that may be awarded against \nvolunteers and nonprofit organizations based on harm caused by a \nvolunteer acting within the scope of the volunteer's responsibilities. \nPunitive damages against any such defendant will be available only \nwhere the claimant demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that \nthe volunteer caused the harm through willful or criminal misconduct.\n  Finally, while the bill preempts State law to the extent that it is \ninconsistent with the bill, the bill will not preempt any State laws \nthat provide additional protections from liability relating to \nvolunteers or nonprofit organizations.\n  Mr. President, this bill is consistent with the overall thrust and \npunitive damages reforms of my bill, S. 79, the Civil Justice Fairness \nAct. I am proud to support it as another step in our march toward \ncomplete civil justice reform.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes of my time to \nthe distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes left.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, let me say how much I have appreciated the efforts of the \nSenator from Georgia in promoting this legislation, this Volunteer \nProtection Act of 1997. I think probably most everything about the bill \nhas been said. I am delighted to hear that there has been an agreement. \nI can hardly imagine that anybody does not agree with the concept of \nmaking it easier for people to volunteer, of taking away some of the \nkinds of threats that have inevitably been there when someone does \nvolunteer to serve. So I am very pleased about that.\n  I think it is true--and I guess I will probably be saying some of the \nsame things again--it is true that the nature of this society, this \ndemocracy, requires that people care. It is a Government of the people \nand by the people, and designed to be a relatively minimal Government \nin that it sets a framework for us to do the things that we think \nshould be done, for us to take the leadership to cause our communities \nto be strong.\n  The Federal Government clearly has a role. But, you know, the more I \nam here, Mr. President, and the more I see what I think is the role of \nthe Federal Government, the more I am impressed with the fact that you \nand I make our communities strong there. And much of that is because we \nare willing to volunteer. I think it was the Frenchman de Tocqueville \nwho came to examine and to explore and to look into this new idea of \ndemocracy. One of the things that he observed and found to be most \nimportant was this was a country, this was a society that was doing \nthings together for each other voluntarily. And that still is--that \nstill is--the root, it seems to me, of our society. The role of the \nFederal Government is minimal in that.\n  I was pleased with the President and the several Presidents last week \nwho raised the image and raised the visibility of voluntarism. But the \nfact is, national voluntarism is not really the key. It is in Casper, \nWY, or Gillette, WY, or Louisville, KY. That is where voluntarism works \nand that is where it will continue to work.\n  So I think this bill is something we all should support. I am so \ndelighted that the sponsors have done this, worked on it. I am \ndelighted that we will be able to vote and vote positively on it in a \nfew minutes.\n  I see some others wishing to speak, Mr. President, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I now ask for the yeas and nays on \nfinal passage of S. 543.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this is a very significant bill. I want \nto commend the Senator from Georgia for his leadership which has \nbrought us to this point this year. As he knows, I introduced similar \nlegislation in 1990 and in 1993 and again in 1995. So I take particular \npride in seeing it moved to this point where, hopefully, it will pass \nthe Senate in the next minutes ahead.\n  This bill really, Mr. President, comes from the grassroots of \nAmerican voluntarism. This bill sprang from the concerns and complaints \nof volunteers and national leaders in the volunteer community, thoughts \nof the men and women who are on the frontlines in our national \nvolunteer efforts.\n  Just last week over on the House side we heard from Terry Orr, a \nformer Washington Redskins football player. He said when he came into \nthe NFL a few years ago players were asked to volunteer, and they \nresponded, ``Just tell me where to go.'' There was not a moment's \nhesitation. In today's litigious world, players are asked to volunteer, \nand they respond, as Terry Orr said, ``Do we have coverage?''\n  Players are afraid to play a benefit ballgame or do any kind of \nvolunteer activity without engaging in extensive discussions with their \nlawyers. That is today's environment, Mr. President.\n  Lynn Swann, another famous football player with the Pittsburgh \nSteelers, is a commentator on one of the networks. He was also at that \npress conference. He is the immediate past president of Big Brothers/\nBig Sisters of America. This is what he had to say. He said in the late \n1980's the Big Brothers/Big Sisters federation endorsed Federal \nvolunteer protection legislation. According to Lynn Swann, the Big \nBrothers and Big Sisters organization endorsed the legislation because \n``a series of high visibility law suits against direct service \nvolunteers had dampened [the] enthusiasm for volunteering in our \nprogram.''\n  He went on to say the legislation was necessary because: ``We [can] \nnot afford to lose prospective, high quality volunteers due to \nliability fears.''\n  That was Lynn Swann and Terry Orr, two former professional football \nplayers, just expressing their own experience in this highly litigious \nsociety in which we live and how it affects the willingness of people \nto volunteer their time.\n  William Cople, former pro bono general counsel for the National \nCapital Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America has written as \nfollows:\n\n       Volunteer service is under assault from an unlikely \n     quarter--the civil justice system.\n\n  The civil justice system.\n\n       Like so many others, volunteers and their service \n     organizations have been swept into the courts to face \n     potential liability in civil suits.\n\n  Thomas L. Jones of Habitat for Humanity International also testified \njust this past week that volunteers across the United States have \ndeclined service on Habitat for Humanity boards ``because of perceived \nliability responsibility.''\n  Mr. President, the bill before us protects volunteers who serve on \nthe boards of nonprofit organizations.\n  H.R. 911, a bill over on the House side, however, provides little \nprotection for volunteers who want to serve as officers on nonprofit \nboards. H.R. 911 defines volunteer so narrowly that it excludes anyone \nwho receives reimbursement for expenses of $300 per year. And H.R. 911 \nwould not--I repeat, not--cover a volunteer who serves in a rape crisis \ncenter or a child abuse center and gets reimbursed $30 a month for \nreasonable expenses, such as transportation costs. In other words, the \nbill over in the House is simply too narrow.\n\n  Our bill allows a volunteer to be fully reimbursed for reasonable \nexpenses.\n  The opponents of volunteer protection argue that: This legislation is \nnot necessary because there is no comprehensive digest of jury awards \nagainst volunteers. That is the argument.\n  First, let me say I have already cited several examples of outrageous \nlawsuits and jury verdicts. Second, the fact that jury verdicts are not \nrendered against volunteers every month is simply not relevant--simply \nnot relevant.\n  Most lawsuits settle before trial and thus are unreported. The \nchilling effects of even one case is astounding.\n  As the Boy Scouts' former general counsel has explained, ``a legal \njudgment entered in a single case can have a multitude of consequences \nextending far beyond that case itself. This surely is a reason for \nconcern in the case of volunteers to service organizations.''\n  We have heard opponents argue that the bill is too broad and might \noffer immunity to the Ku Klux Klan or other organizations whose views \nwe all abhor. This argument fails for several reasons.\n  Organizations are not granted immunity from lawsuits under this bill.\n  A volunteer is not covered under this bill if the volunteer engages \nin willful misconduct, specifically including hate crimes or civil \nrights violations.\n  It is not at all clear that the KKK would be covered as a nonprofit \nentity that exists primarily for public benefit and operates primarily \nfor charitable purposes.\n  Survey of State volunteer protection laws indicates that there are \nStates\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nthat define ``nonprofit organization'' in the same manner as S. 543 or \neven broader. Yet, no one can come up with any examples from those \nStates where KKK members were immune from lawsuits. The KKK argument is \nan offensive and bogus bogeyman argument.\n  Mr. President, also, opponents argue that this is a matter of States \nrights. I am constantly amazed to hear people make that argument. It is \nreminiscent of the argument against the civil rights laws in the 1960's \nwhere opponents said this really is a States rights matter, not a \nmatter for the Federal Government.\n  The same argument was made against national voting rights \nlegislation. And a lot of the folks who were the most enthusiastic for \nthat kind of legislation now turn around and start arguing that the \nStates rights is a good argument to not deal with what is clearly a \nnational problem with national implications which needs a national \nsolution.\n  Opponents also argue that some States have some protections for some \nvolunteers in some circumstances. Well, that is not good enough. That \nkind of patchwork protection is simply not going to get the job done.\n  In my State we have some basic protections for volunteers. But these \nKentucky protections are of no benefit to a Kentucky volunteer who goes \nto help his neighbor in one of the seven States which border the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n  Volunteers, Mr. President, should not have to hire a lawyer in order \nto cross State lines to help their neighbor.\n  Bob Goodwin, president and CEO of the Points of Light Foundation, \ntestified last week that a national solution is necessary because \n``there is no consistency among our States with regard to volunteer \nliability statutes, and that lack of consistency has led to confusion \nin the volunteer community.''\n  Let me quote another leader in the national volunteer movement. John \nH. Graham, CEO of the American Diabetes Association, also testified \nlast week on behalf of the National Coalition for Volunteer Protection. \nThis is what he had to say:\n\n       We have seen recently that otherwise qualified and willing \n     individuals are withholding their services out of fear of \n     liability and confusion concerning the different volunteer \n     protection laws on the books in many states. These are \n     individuals who would help house and feed the homeless, who \n     would treat and support the elderly, and who would clothe and \n     care for the poor.\n\n  So in summary, Mr. President, our national volunteer movement is \nbuilt upon the idea of loving your neighbor as yourself, of being a \ngood Samaritan, of stopping alongside the road and lending your \nneighbor a helping hand.\n  People from my home State of Kentucky understand this concept. Their \nneighbor is not just the child across the street, but it is the family \nacross the bridge or across the State line.\n  If the Kentucky Red Cross volunteer wants to cross over into \nTennessee or Ohio or Illinois or Indiana or West Virginia or Virginia \nand help his neighbor recover from a flood, then he should not have to \ncall his lawyer to check on his liability potential in a surrounding \nState. We must have a uniform minimum standard.\n  The principles of loving your neighbor, of being a good Samaritan are \nwoven deeply into the fabric of our Nation. We need to find ways to \nfree up this spirit, not to suppress it. We must inspire and encourage \npeople to do good works, not sue and harass and discourage.\n  Those who say that our volunteers do not need this legislation have \nobviously not been talking to the people on the frontlines.\n  My longstanding interest in this issue comes from talking to \nvolunteers like the very ones that I have mentioned here today. \nHowever, I must confess, Mr. President, that one particular volunteer \nleader has had my ear on this issue for quite awhile. That is my wife, \nElaine, who is a former Director of the Peace Corps and former \npresident and CEO of the United Way of America. She has been involved \nin this battle for a long time and understands fully the implications.\n  So, Mr. President, let me close by again thanking Senator Coverdell \nfor his leadership, and the others who participated in this. This is an \nextremely important piece of legislation which I hope will pass the \nSenate overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do wish to thank my friend from Georgia, \nMr. Coverdell. With the Coverdell-Leahy-Ashcroft-McConnell and others \nsubstitute, I think this piece of legislation has been substantially \nimproved.\n  So Members know, we have limited it to individual volunteers. The \nbill is no longer intended to provide immunity or limitation of \nliability for organizations. I think it is also important that the \noriginal sponsors of the bill agree not to include any limitation on \nmotor vehicle liability, even as it relates to individuals. I think \nthat is important.\n  I believe this bill has been significantly modified. It is not \nprecisely the bill I would have written, but it is not precisely the \nbill my friend from Georgia would have written. I think it reflects \nwhat is best in the Senate when both sides can give and come out with \nsomething that can be better and more acceptable to a broad cross-\nsection of Senators. Most of us do have concerns if we preempt State \nlaws. In this, we have tried as best as possible to preserve State \noptions.\n  I do not believe the threat of litigation deters Americans from \nvolunteering to help neighbors, and did not deter the hundreds and \nhundreds who volunteered in floods in the Dakotas or in so many other \nareas we have seen in recent times. I am glad we have been able to \nlimit the reach of the Federal protections provided, but we will be \nable to help individual volunteers. They should have some insulation \nfrom honest mistakes. We all want volunteers to be able to help \nwhenever they can and worry most about how much stamina they will have \nto help, and have that be their chief concern.\n  So we will continue to work on this. Of course, it will have to go \nthrough conference, and we will make sure there is no unintended \nbenefit or defenses available to anybody, and that nobody is harmed or \nleft without a remedy.\n  We have seen an extraordinary week, as I said, in Philadelphia, with \nthe President of the United States, together with past Presidents, the \nwife of a past President, General Powell, and others, who came together \nto promote voluntarism. We do not want to do anything to hamper that.\n  Again, I thank my friend from Georgia. I thank Ed Pagano and Jonathan \nLamy on the Judiciary Committee staff, and all the others on both sides \nof the aisle who worked to make this legislation better.\n  I am prepared to yield if there is any time left on this side, and am \nprepared to go to vote on the Coverdell-Leahy substitute.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will take just a few minutes of my time, then do the \nsame as the Senator from Vermont and yield back time and proceed to the \nvote.\n  I want to take a moment to thank Senator Leahy and his staff. It is \ninteresting how life makes people's paths cross each other from time to \ntime. He and I have done so now on various occasions over the last \ndecade. As always, I have found him to be an admirable either adversary \nor cooperator, but always with well-intentioned and good purpose. I \nthank him for his attention to this matter and the assistance both here \nand on those occasions in the past.\n  I also want to thank Senator McConnell. Senator McConnell has labored \nin this area for years and has made contributions to this legislation \nthat are exceedingly significant. I am very grateful for his assistance \non this matter, as well as Senators Ashcroft, Santorum, and others.\n  I want to acknowledge the work of Kyle McSlarrow, Terri Delgadillo, \nand Dan McGirt on our side who have worked so hard to iron out the \ndifferences so we could produce this meaningful piece of legislation.\n  The hour is 2:05. We said we would vote as near as possible to 2 \no'clock. I yield back all time on our side.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 53) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 10 minutes equally divided.\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We yield back all time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on final passage of S. 543 as \namended. The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to speak for one moment about \nthe disaster supplemental bill.\n  It is fair to say that my State has been absolutely devastated by \nthis extraordinary set of occurrences. First of all, the greatest \nsnowfall in our State's history--over 10 feet of snow--followed in \nearly April by the most severe winter storm in 50 years. Nearly 2 feet \nof snow fell in that one blizzard, accompanied by 70-mile-an-hour winds \nand an ice storm that brought down the electrical grid serving 80,000 \npeople. That was followed by what we are now told was not the 500-year \nflood but the 1,000-year flood. That was coupled in Grand Forks with a \nfire that destroyed nearly three city blocks and was only contained \nbecause of the heroic efforts of the fire department in Grand Forks.\n  Mr. President, we have not had in this country a circumstance in \nwhich a town of the size of the city of Grand Forks with more than \n50,000 people having been evacuated on a mandatory basis. Those people \nare not able to return to their homes for perhaps as long as a month.\n  This is a disaster of truly staggering proportion and dimension. \nThose people need help, and they need it now.\n  Mr. President, I know there are some who would like to attach \namendments that are, in fact, extraneous to disaster relief to that \nlegislation. I ask my colleagues to forbear the temptation to add \nextraneous matters to this disaster legislation. I know that some feel \nthese amendments are not extraneous. In my own judgment, virtually all \nof these amendments that have been added have nothing to do with the \nimmediate purpose of the legislation, which is to address the disasters \nthat have been experienced in some 22 States--most recently the States \nof North Dakota, South Dakota and Minnesota. Some of these amendments \nreally relate to the budget dispute of last year. We are going to have \nlots of opportunities for budget discussions. This disaster bill is not \nthe time and is not the place for that to be.\n  The people who have been hurt deserve to be helped, just as we have \nhelped other States impacted by disaster. Over and over, when we have \nhad disaster bills, we have agreed, on a bipartisan basis, to withhold \nextraneous amendments. I have agreed to do it, even though I, too, have \nbeen tempted to offer things that I thought were critically important.\n  I hope my colleagues will extend that same courtesy to those of us \nwho represent States that have been devastated in the most recent \ndisasters. Our people deserve the same consideration and the same \ntreatment that we have extended to others in similar circumstances.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief, for a question.\n  Senator Conrad talks about the disasters that have precipitated the \nneed for a disaster bill. As a member of the Appropriations Committee \nin the Senate, I participated yesterday in writing the bill that would \ncome to the floor of the Senate next week.\n  Included in that legislation are amendments that have really nothing \nto do with the legislation at all, that are very controversial and \ncould delay or impede the progress of this bill.\n  I join with my colleague to urge those who I know have other agendas \nand amendments, which I am sure are important to them, to decide not to \noffer them to this legislation.\n  I encourage those who have offered them in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to take those amendments out of this bill and allow us to do \nwhat we need to do for the victims of these disasters--to extend a \nhelping hand and say to those who have suffered so much\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\nthat this country understands that you need help, that you are not \nalone, and this legislation and this Congress, by enacting this \nlegislation, wants to do that and do it quickly.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, makes a very important \npoint. I associate myself with that point--that between now and next \nTuesday, or Wednesday, when we take that legislation to the floor of \nthe Senate, I hope very much that we will see those who have been \nadding and probably those who might want to add additional amendments \nto decide not to do that on this very important bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I can follow up on Senator Dorgan's comments, then I \nwould be happy to yield further.\n  Last night I accepted an award on behalf of the Grand Forks Fire \nDepartment for the extraordinary heroism they demonstrated when this \nfire was burning out of control and they were prevented from fighting \nthat fire as they normally would by the flood waters. And yet they took \non an extraordinary circumstance; with live wires in the floodwaters, \nthey could not know, as they moved to rescue people who were in those \nbuildings, if they would be electrocuted, and they went forward, they \ndid their jobs, and they rescued more than 20 people. And because of \ntheir bravery not a single life was lost. We lost some buildings. We \ndid not lose a single life.\n\n  Last night the Firefighters of America gave to me, on behalf of the \nGrand Forks Fire Department, an award. I might say those firefighters \nwho risked their lives to save others were doing it at the very time \ntheir own homes were being destroyed. Forty-three of those firefighters \nhad their homes destroyed while they were saving other people's lives.\n  I can tell you, those people are wondering, why is it when we have a \ndisaster that impacts our area people want to put on amendments that \nhave nothing to do with disaster relief? They cannot understand it. We \ndid not do that when the shoe was on the other foot. When other States \nwere hit by disaster, we did not offer other amendments. I hope that \ncooler heads would prevail here and that we would find other vehicles \nfor Senators to offer their amendments that they believe are important \nbut leave the disaster bill clean so the people who are trying to \nrebuild their lives from an extraordinary set of disasters have a \nchance to rebuild their lives. That is not too much to ask.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to proceed to the motion to \nproceed to S. 4. However, I would ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator Dodd be allowed to talk for 2 minutes and 1 minute to----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I had not yielded the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe the Senator gave up the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No; I had not yielded the floor. I was yielding for a \nquestion from my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be brief. Minnesota is one of these States, \ntoo, and every day we come here and speak briefly because we just keep \ntrying to pitch away.\n  Could I ask one question? I think the Senator recognizes I would \nrather give a statement. I will not. But is it not true that when you \ntalk to people in North Dakota--I certainly find this to be the case in \nMinnesota--they just do not understand at all how it can be that we \njust do not get this to them and how there can be this discussion of \namendments having to do with budget cuts in education and budgets cuts \nin any number of other areas?\n  I say to the Senator, if I could get his attention for a moment, the \nmost difficult thing for me is to try to explain to people how it could \nbe we are at this impasse and that we cannot get the help to people as \nquickly as possible. In terms of how they live their own lives, people \ndo not understand this kind of discussion about strategy and tactics \nand they feel as if we are just playing with their lives.\n  Does the Senator have trouble explaining to people why it is we \ncannot get this done for them?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just say to my colleague by way of a quick answer that \nin Grand Forks two-thirds of the people are refugees. They cannot be in \ntheir own homes. They have been gone now for nearly 2 weeks. They still \ndo not know in many parts of the city when they will return. And when \nthey hear that there are amendments not related to disaster that are \nslowing down the disaster bill, they are just bewildered by what we are \ndoing here. I must say there are times when I wonder what we are doing \nhere. And again, I just hope that our colleagues would desist from \noffering amendments that are not disaster related to a disaster bill.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, very briefly, I may not even take the 2 \nminutes. I just wanted to inform my colleagues that about a week ago, \nCongressman Chris Shays, of Connecticut, and I hosted a program called \nDebtbusters with a group of 200 of our constituents. We invited people \nto come together to sit down in groups and try to balance the Federal \nbudget in 5 years. This is an exercise designed by the Concord \nCoalition, and it is the first time such an event has been done on a \nbipartisan basis. I highly recommend it to my colleagues.\n  It is a fascinating exercise to watch people act as Members of \nCongress over a period of 2 or 3 hours, faced with the choices that \nmany of us have to make here in Washington as we work toward a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002. It was a tremendously worthwhile exercise. I \nwant to commend the Concord Coalition for organizing it, for putting \ntogether the questionnaire. It was not perfect. Anyone who writes \nquestions and makes choices obviously is going to bring some bias to \nit. But overall I found it to be rather fair and interesting. I would \nalso like to commend the citizens of Connecticut, specifically the \ncitizens of Stamford and the surrounding area, for taking the time out \nof their weekends to come together and work in such a constructive \nspirit.\n  It was curious to see the choices that people made. People, when they \nsat down and had to work with six or seven or eight other people from \ntheir community with many different ideas and issues, were able to \ncompromise and come to conclusions and even give up on things they \ncared about very, very much. It was instructive. It did not solve the \nbudget problem. But last Saturday I was impressed that, on a gloriously \nsunny day, people came out and spent the 2 or 3 hours to try and \nresolve these issues. I thought my colleagues might find it \ninteresting.\n  As we are about to hopefully reach some sort of budget agreement \nourselves, I believe it is worthwhile to appreciate what average \ncitizens are able to do, just as I said, in a few hours on a bright \nsunny Saturday morning.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for making the time \navailable and I yield back any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3881-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3881-S3890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT AMENDMENTS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are now proceeding on the motion to \nproceed to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. First of all, I \nwish to commend Senator DeWine, who is the chairman of the subcommittee \nwhich very dexterously handled this bill in committee. I would also \nlike to thank Senator Ashcroft, the original author of the bill, who \nhas done so much to bring, not only the attention of Congress to the \nproblems we are addressing in the Family Friendly Workplace Act,\n\n[[Page S3882]]\n\nbut also helped and assisted in bringing the attention of this body to \nthe problems that are created by the current law.\n  I am pleased to be on the floor of the Senate today for the opening \ndebate on the motion to proceed to S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace \nAct. I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of many other \ncolleagues and the effort that went into S. 4 by the committee who was \nable to bring out a piece of legislation which I am confident will have \nthe support of the Senate.\n  I am extremely excited about this legislation because I believe it \nwill positively affect the lives of millions of Americans. Today, there \nare more working single parents and dual-income families in America \nthan ever before. The Family Friendly Workplace Act represents an \nimportant step in providing employees in the private sector greater \nlatitude to balance the conflicting demands of work and family. This \nlegislation provides men and women working in the private sector the \nopportunity to voluntarily choose compensatory time off in lieu of \novertime pay as well as to voluntarily participate in biweekly and \nflexible credit hour programs. It does so by giving employees the \nopportunity to choose to take paid leave time instead of cash \ncompensation for overtime worked and to work out more flexible \nschedules with their employers if it suits their needs. These same \noptions have been available to State, local and Federal employees for \nsome time and they have been enormously popular with these public \nsector employees.\n\n  Mr. President, since this bill was first introduced, it has met with \nopposition. I believe the opposition stems from the political positions \nof big labor unions rather than the needs of working men and women. I \nimagine that S. 4's opponents are concerned, in part, because it is the \nfirst piece of legislation in nearly six decades that makes any \nsignificant modification to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\n  While I understand the concern of S. 4's opponents, I believe that it \nis misplaced. The Fair Labor Standards Act was, and still is, an \nimportant piece of legislation because it provided much needed \nprotection to American workers at the time when their welfare was often \ndisregarded, in the horrible period of the Depression. While the \nprinciples behind the Fair Labor Standards Act have not changed, its \nstringent provisions make it difficult to accommodate the needs of \ntoday's work force.\n  Since the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, there \nhave been considerable changes in our Nation's economy, labor market \nconditions and labor-management relations. One of the greatest \ntransformations has been in the composition of the U.S. labor force. \nMore women are working than ever before. According to the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, women now account for 46 percent of the labor force. \nBetween 1948 and 1995, women's labor participation rates almost doubled \nfrom 33 percent to 59 percent.\n  The increase of women in the workplace has had a significant impact \non the day-to-day activities of the American family. The stay-at-home \nmom is now the exception rather than the rule. Indeed, in 1995, only \n5.2 percent of all American families mirrored the traditional ``Ozzie \nand Harriet'' family structure of a wage-earning father, a nonworking \nmother, and two children. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \n62 percent of two-parent families with children have both parents \nworking outside the home.\n  The makeup of the American work force has changed dramatically, yet \nfew provisions of the FSLA have been updated to reflect these changes. \nThe needs of today's work force are different than the needs of the \nwork force of the 1930's. Although employees are demanding more \nflexible work schedules and compensation packages, the FSLA and its \nunderlying regulations preclude employers from complying with employee \nneeds.\n  This need for a change in the existing law was exhibited in a recent \npoll conducted by Penn & Schoen for the Employment Policy Foundation. \nThe poll indicates that 88 percent of all workers want more flexibility \nthrough scheduling and/or the choice of compensatory time. Another \nnational poll revealed that 65 percent of Americans favored changes in \nthe labor law that would allow for more flexible work schedules. It is \nnot surprising that the private sector is demanding change. In a 1985 \nsurvey of Federal employees participating with flexible work schedules, \n72 percent said that they had more flexibility to spend time with their \nfamilies, and 74 percent said that having a flexible schedule had \nimproved their morale.\n  Over the past several years, the committee has heard compelling \ntestimony from workers about the difficulty of balancing work and \nfamily responsibilities. For example, Christine Korzendorfer, who works \nfor TRW Systems in Fairfax, VA, testified that she works a lot of \novertime hours. Her husband, who is self-employed, also works 7 days a \nweek making caring for their two children a constant struggle. Ms. \nKorzendorfer said that while the overtime pay is important to her, \nhaving extra time off to be with her family is more important. She \nwants the choice to be able to take comp time off instead of overtime \nwhen it best fits her needs and her family's needs.\n\n  In addition, the committee heard from Sallie Larsen, vice president, \nHuman Resources and Communication, TRW Systems Integration Group, about \nTRW employees' frustration with the rigidity of the current law. Ms. \nLarsen explained that it was important for her business unit to \nunderstand their employees' work patterns because the work patterns \nfactored into how TRW bid for new work. To meet the needs of its \nemployees, TRW saw an opportunity to add flexibility for all of its \nsalaried employees and managers in its work scheduling. As a result, \nTRW invented a program called the Professional Work Schedule which \ngives salaried employees the ability to participate in 2-week flexing, \npartial-day time off and additional time off. However, the restrictions \nof the Fair Labor Standards Act prevented TRW from offering the program \nto its hourly employees. Ms. Larsen testified that TRW's hourly \nemployees were amazed to learn that it is a 60-year-old law that is \nsubstantially unchanged since it was passed that stands in their way of \nbecoming a full member of the team.\n  When the employees ask, ``Why am I treated as a second-class \ncitizen?'' TRW explains, ``It is the law, not the company's \nunwillingness to offer the professional work schedule to them.''\n  As I mentioned earlier, employees in the public sector have had this \noption since 1985, and it has been very popular. Unlike in the public \nsector, however, S. 4 would prohibit employees from forcing workers to \naccept comp-time off instead of being paid overtime as a condition of \nemployment. That is a change from the public law. In fact, under S. 4, \nan employee's participation in any flexible work arrangement would be \ntotally voluntary. We have worked hard on the language since its \nintroduction to make this crystal clear and to provide strong penalties \nagainst any employer who coerces, intimidates, or threatens a worker \ninto accepting such an agreement.\n  This is true flexibility for workers and not the heavy hand of the \nemployer. Providing families more flexibility in the workplace to help \nmeet family needs should be a bipartisan goal. In the last year, \nPresident Clinton has acknowledged the importance of work force \nflexibility. For instance, in his recent State of the Union Address the \nPresident said, ``We should pass flextime so workers can choose to be \npaid overtime in income, or trade it for time off to be with their \nfamilies.''\n  Because S. 4 will assist American workers to balance the needs of an \nevolving work environment and quality family time, I urge all my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think, since this is the Ashcroft \nlegislation, the Senator should be entitled to make the first statement \non it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join us in \nmoving to consideration of S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It \nis an act which would help us accommodate the needs of families by \nrecognizing that there are competing stresses. Most families feel two \nimportant stresses in their lives: One, the need to be with their \nfamilies and to do for their families what their families require; the\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\nother is to provide resources, financial resources, for the family. \nThese two stresses have put us in a unique condition, in terms of the \nway families operate. In the 1930's, when we enacted the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, it was clear that very few families found both parents \nas wage earners. As a matter of fact, in the 1930's, only one out of \nevery six women with school-aged children worked outside the home.\n  We have seen these two stresses--the requirement to spend time with \nour family and the requirement to provide financial resources in order \nto support our family--drive both parents in many situations into the \nworkplace so there is this tension that exists in the workplace. It is \na tension that relates to how we accommodate our families at the same \ntime we provide the financial resources for our families. That being \nthe case, the sponsors of S. 4 sought to find a way that we could say \nto families: We understand how important it is to you to get the \nfinancial resources to support your children. We understand how much \nyou need to spend time with your children. Finally, we want to say to \nAmerican families that we understand how important it is that you spend \ntime with your children without sacrificing the financial resources \nthat your family needs. The solution--we thought it best to provide a \nway for people to be able to work flexible work schedules.\n  This is not a way for people to take a pay cut or to lose resources. \nWe already have the Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows people \nto take a pay cut in order to meet a family emergency. But public \npolicy in this country should not require American workers to take a \npay cut in order to be a good mom or dad in this country. Most people \nhave the understanding that they want to be able to both meet the \nfinancial needs of their family and meet the social needs that are \nattendant to being a mom or dad. That is what this bill would do.\n\n  This bill would simply allow flexible work schedules to be arranged, \nwhen the employee and the employer agree--when there is agreement on \nboth parties--it cannot be a coerced agreement. The bill provides \nspecifically, that if there is coercion--either direct or indirect \ncoercion--that there are enhanced, heightened, and substantial \npenalties involved. Therefore, when there is a voluntary agreement \nbetween the employer and employee, the employee in overtime situations \ncan opt to take time-and-a-half off instead of getting time-and-a-half \npay. And, where there is an employee who does not get overtime work \nregularly, and that happens to be most of the hourly workers in the \ncountry--the vast majority of citizens do not get overtime work. In \nthose settings, where an employee never has an opportunity to earn \novertime compensation, there should be an opportunity for people to say \nto the boss, ``If I work an extra hour this week, calling that \nflextime, can I take an hour off next week when my son or daughter is \ngoing to get an award at the high school and I need to take an extended \nlunch hour? Can I take some time off next week if I need to go take a \ngroup of kids to the soccer game? I will work the hour this week.''\n  Americans really are not aware that that is against the law for \nhourly workers right now. For an employer to trade with an employee an \nhour in 1 week, and say you can make it up in the next week, if the \nhour in the next week puts the person over 40 hours--it simply is \nillegal to make that up on an hour-for-hour basis. If you want to take \nthe hour off this week and make it up next week, it is now a \nresponsibility of the employer to make it up at a time-and-a-half \nbasis. So you have to pay time and a half. Most employers cannot afford \nthat, so they do not have that kind of flexible working arrangement. It \nis pretty clear to me that most Americans would like to have the \nopportunity to swap an hour, sometimes, one week for an hour the next \nweek. Under this bill, if the employer asked, suggested, or even hinted \nthat he wanted an employee to work over 40 hours in a week, the \nemployee would be entitled to overtime pay. In order to bank hours on \nan hour-for-hour basis, the employee ``initiate and request'' the \nability to work the additional hour.\n  So, there are a number of components of this bill, all of which are \ndesigned to relieve the stress of working families, all of which are \ndesigned to give Americans more time with their families. These \nprovisions are designed to do it without forcing you to take the time \noff without pay. The real challenge we have in our culture is to \ncontinue to sustain our families financially but also to continue to \nsustain our families in their abilities to do the kinds of things they \nneed to do together. What is important to note is that, in addition to \nthe overtime provision, which can be compensated at time and a half, \nthere is also the flextime provision of the bill which attends to \nworkers who are not normally able to get overtime work.\n  The Census Bureau collects data on a regular basis. Out of their data \nthey collected in 1996, the data revealed that only 4 percent of \nworking women who work on an hourly basis reported that they get \nregular overtime pay. It would be fine for those women if they could \ntake that overtime and convert it to time-and-a-half off. But let's be \nserious. If we were only going to address the stresses and tensions \nthat exist in the families of that 4 percent of the work force, we are \nnot really going to do much to improve the lives of very many people. \nWe need to be able to address this tension and this stress that exists \nin the work force generally. That is why it is important to offer the \nflex-time parts of this bill, which allow a person to say, ``I will \nwork an extra hour this week in return if the boss will let me take \nthat hour off next week, or vice versa.''\n  Those are the kinds of provisions that have been available in the \npublic sector for the last 20 years. In 1978, sponsored by \nCongresswoman Ferraro, of New York, and Congresswoman Schroeder, of \nColorado, we enacted the law in the Federal system which provided for \nflexibility in employment for Federal workers. The same provisions, \nwhich we now are offering before the Senate, ought to be extended to \nworkers around the country in the private sector. What is interesting \nis that the system has worked so well at the Federal and local level. \nAs a matter of fact, the General Accounting Office wanted to see what \nthe impact of having these kind of work rules was on governmental \nperformance, on morale of workers. When the General Accounting Office \nsurveyed the workers they found out that workers approved or expressed \ntheir appreciation for this kind of working arrangement at a 10-to-1 \nratio. So, for every 1 worker here who said, ``I am not enthusiastic \nabout this, I do not really care for it,'' 10 workers said they \napproved it.\n\n  Frankly, you cannot get that 10-to-1 ratio of workers to agree that \ntoday is Thursday afternoon. That is an overwhelming endorsement. That \nis a clear statement by workers, the workers themselves--union workers, \nnonunion workers--that this system works.\n  One of the features that is allowed in the Federal Government system \nthat would be allowed and available in the private sector under this \nbill would be the ability of workers and their employers, upon the \nagreement and voluntary--voluntary consent of both parties, to schedule \nwork over a 2-week period to average 40 hours a week. This was \nextremely popular in the Federal Government, because it allowed people \nto work 9 days in the 2-week period instead of 10 days in the 2-week \nperiod. Working 9 days in the 2-week period really meant that workers \nhad every other Friday off, so they would work 8 days at 9 hours a day \nfor 72 hours and then the ninth day they would work 8 hours. That took \nthem to 80 hours. Then, with that in mind, having worked 80 hours in \nthe 2-week period, 45 hours in the first 5 days and 35 hours in the \nnext 4 days, those 2 weeks together constituted 80 hours. And each \nsecond week, Friday would be off.\n  The opportunity is apparent, here, in terms of the ability to spend \ntime with your children; the ability to tend to things that can only be \ndone during business hours. This is one of the reasons, when Federal \nemployees are asked about the program, they endorse it overwhelmingly. \nIt is one of the reasons why unions in the Federal arena insist on \nthese provisions, these capacities, these flexibilities. It is one of \nthe reasons why individuals in the work force ought to really have this \nopportunity in the private sector.\n  Having worked flawlessly for the last 20 years, increased \nproductivity, built morale, and been endorsed by workers \noverwhelmingly, it is time for us to say\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\nto the work force generally: This is something you should have. Federal \nworkers have it. It is time that ordinary workers in the private sector \nhave it. I should not say ``ordinary'' because I do not want to suggest \nthat the other workers are extraordinary. The point is, salaried \nworkers have had flexibility for a long time. The boardroom has had \nflexibility for a long time. The guys who run the company never seem to \nhave difficulty in being able to take time off to see their kids get an \naward, or even to play a game, or a round of golf, or perhaps link up \nwith some of their friends at a predetermined time for a fishing trip \nor outing, or to even be volunteers, when it is necessary, to help \ntheir communities.\n  But the hourly individuals are the ones who have faced that \nchallenge. Of course, the people who have felt the squeeze the most, I \nthink, are the moms who have gone into the work force since the 1930's. \nThere are 28.8 million working women who work by the hour in this \ncountry and it is time for us to say to them: You should be entitled to \nsome of the same flexibility that people in the boardroom or at the \nhead of the company or the salaried workers of America have had. It is \ntime for us to say to them you should be entitled to some of the same \nopportunities to work with your family as the people who work for the \nFederal Government have had. It is time for us to say to them it would \nbe appropriate for you to have the same capacity to volunteer and to \nhelp your children in their athletic activities, or academic \nactivities, or extracurricular activities, as the people who work for \nState and local governments have had.\n  It is time to give the average worker in the United States of \nAmerica, that individual who has served, working hard on an hourly \nbasis, these same benefits that have been enjoyed by individuals who \nhave worked on a salaried basis and have worked for the U.S. \nGovernment, for State governments, or for local governments.\n  Some individuals have indicated that perhaps it is enough for us to \njust address the issue of comptime. I would just suggest, because \ncomptime is available only to workers who work overtime regularly, that \nwe ought to think carefully about limiting the flexible working \narrangements that we think ought to be available to American workers to \nthose who are normally endowed with the right to work overtime.\n  Overtime is not the prerogative of most American workers. Estimates \nrun as high as a third of the workers get regular overtime. The census \nclearly indicated only 4 percent of the hourly workers who were women \nin 1996 said they got regular overtime.\n  What if you would triple that number from 4 percent to, say, 12 \npercent? You would still only have one woman working by the hour out of \neight who received regular overtime. If we are going to provide \nflexibility to only one out of eight women, it seems to me we have \nmissed the boat; or only two out of eight men, because twice as many \nmen work in jobs that get overtime as women do.\n  If you take the universe of people who get overtime work, it is a 2-\nto-1 population in favor of men who have worked in the jobs that \nhistorically get overtime.\n  I do not think it is appropriate for us to try to limit what we do to \nindividuals who have had the good fortune to find themselves in jobs \nwhere they would traditionally get overtime, especially when that means \nthat it would only result in maybe one out of eight women in the work \nforce working by the hour, having the flexible options, having the \ncapacity to have an adjustable schedule the way people do in the \nboardroom, the way people do in State government, the way people do in \nthe Federal Government.\n  I think it is time for us to say to America generally, ``We \nunderstand it's tough to balance the competing demands of the homeplace \nand the workplace. We understand that when you take time off, you don't \nwant to lose money doing so, because you wouldn't be working in the \nfirst place if you could afford to lose money by taking time off.''\n  We need to say, ``We understand you don't want to take a pay cut to \nbe a good mom or dad.''\n  We need to say, ``We understand that you want to be a volunteer and \nyou will need to have flexible working arrangements from time to \ntime.''\n  We want to build a framework that says to them, ``If, indeed, those \nare your aspirations, here is the way you can accomplish them. At least \nyou and your employer can together agree voluntarily that these kinds \nof things can be done.''\n  I emphasize the word ``voluntarily,'' because that is the way the \nbill would work. If there is coercion, either direct or indirect \ncoercion, the bill provides for elevated, extraordinarily high \npenalties. It says, ``If you are going to coerce workers, beware, you \nare going to have a doubling of the penalties you previously had in \novertime settings.''\n  Second, in order to provide a further incentive for employers, who \nare offering compensatory time off options, to not only allow employees \nto take the time when they need it but also to not see it as a cost \nsavings, the bill provides that if an employee has chosen a comptime \noption, if at any time the employee changes their mind, the employee \nonly has to say ``Nope, I've changed my mind. I would like to have the \nmoney back instead of the time and a half off.''\n  So, if someone had originally said, ``I'll take time and a half \noff,'' thinking that would please the employer in some way, they can \nreverse that decision. In addition, if he believed he needed to accept \nthe comptime, in lieu of financial compensation, it would be coercion \nand double current penalties could be assessed.\n  As an ultimate backup to make sure we don't have any abuse of the \nworkers here, we have a situation built right into the structure of the \nbill so that at the end of the year, all the time and a half that is \nthere as comptime is automatically paid as time and a half and at time-\nand-a-half rates.\n  So what we have here is a clear voluntary situation. You do not have \nany incentives for any employer to distort the voluntarism. You have \nemployers who really understand that, if they can help employees be \ngood parents, they are going to be better employees and, together, with \na happier employer and happier employee, people are going to be able to \nmeet the needs of their family without taking pay cuts. That it is a \nwin-win situation. That is what we targeted. We built protections into \nthe bill and structurally designed the bill, so that compensatory time \ncan be converted quickly and efficiently. It is automatically converted \nif it is not used by the end of the year and we have provided elevated \npenalties in the event that there is a problem with any coercion, \ndirect or indirect.\n\n  I might add as well, in the event the employer and employee in this \nmeasure do not agree to take time off as compensatory time, if there is \nno agreement on it, we fall back under the 1930's Fair Labor Standards \nAct. In other words, nothing is done to deprive any worker who wants to \nlive under the terms and conditions of the law as it now exists from \nworking under those conditions.\n  What we really have is an ability of the worker and the employer to \nchoose to be more flexible and, if either one is dissatisfied, that \nchoice is reflected in the continuation of the status quo: The 40-hour \nweek continues to be in existence; the required payment of overtime at \ntime and a half payment instead of time and a half off continues in \nexistence. So the ultimate security for any worker is that the worker \ncan choose to operate in the same framework of legal protection that \nworker has at this very time.\n  This is an attempt to say to the work force, ``We know that you are \nstressed. We know that the demands of your house and the demands of \nyour job are competing, and when they collide, if possible, we would \nlike to give you the option of being able to work it out with your \nemployer and to work it out in a framework of protections that are \nlikely to result in your being able to succeed.''\n  We are doing this, not with some program we have dreamed up, not with \nsome novel, untested, untried set of opportunities. We are doing this \nwith a program that has been in existence now since 1978, almost 20 \nyears, in the Federal Government. We are doing this by proposing for \nthe private sector the kind of flexible working arrangements which have \nbeen available in the public sector and which workers in the public \nsector have endorsed at a 10-to-1 ratio, which workers in the public \nsector, be\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nthey union workers or nonunion workers, are eager to continue, and when \ncontracts are negotiated, there is an insistence that these kinds of \nprovisions continue to be available.\n  I might just add one other thing about the President and his \ninvolvement. The President, in his campaign, called for ``flexible work \narrangements'' for citizens. He used that very language. He used that \nlanguage again in his State of the Union Message. He talked about \n``flexible working arrangements.'' When the President of the United \nStates, President Clinton, came into office, he noticed that there was \na small group of executive branch workers who didn't have the \nprivileges that were accorded to the rest of the Government workers \nregarding flexible working arrangements and compensatory time. When the \nPresident made that observation, he did the right thing. The President \nsaid to the rest of the workers, ``I'm going to extend the benefits of \nthese kinds of working relationships by Executive order to you as \nFederal workers, because these are the kinds of things which will help \nyou do a good job, they will help us get good work, and they will help \nyou resolve the tension between your family and your workplace.''\n  What was good for the President of the United States in his campaign, \nwhat he remarked on favorably in his remarks to the Congress, what he \nindicated was appropriate by way of Executive order, is good for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican leadership is pushing its \nso-called compensatory time bill, but a better name for it is the \nPaycheck Reduction Act. The bill has four fatal flaws:\n  First, it is a pay cut for large numbers of workers who don't deserve \nthat harsh treatment from either Congress or their employers. The bill \neliminates the guarantee of pay for overtime work for 65 million \nemployees. The Republicans have openly admitted their pay-cut strategy. \nWhen the National Federation of Independent Businesses testified at the \nSenate Labor Committee hearing on the bill, they said ``Small \nbusinesses can't afford to pay overtime.'' That's why they support this \nlegislation.\n  Vast numbers of today's workers depend on overtime pay to make ends \nmeet. Half of those who earn overtime take home $16,000 a year or less. \nMore than 80 percent earn under $28,000 a year. American workers cannot \nafford this Republican pay cut.\n  Second, the bill cuts other benefits. Health and retirement benefits \nare based on the number of hours worked by employees, and their \nbenefits would be slashed too. Comptime hours do not count as hours \nworked, so employees will lost health coverage while they are working, \nand much-needed pension benefits after they retire.\n  Third, the proposal abolishes the 40-hour week. Employers could \nrequire employees to work up to 80 hours in a week without receiving \novertime pay. A company could schedule a worker for 60 hours in 1 week, \nand 20 in the next, all without a penny of overtime pay. This isn't a \nfamily-friendly bill--it's a family-enemy bill.\n  Fourth, the bill provides no employee choice. The employer chooses \nwho works overtime and when an employee can use comptime. The employer \ncan assign all overtime work to employees who will accept comptime \ninstead of overtime pay. Those who need overtime pay to make ends meet \nwill no longer receive it. The bill also lets the employer decide when \nemployees can use the comptime they have earned. If an employee wants \nto use comptime to take a child to the dentist, or attend a school \nplay, the employer is free to deny the request.\n  If the Republicans are genuinely interested in helping working \nAmericans deal with family needs, they should support expansion of the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act. That law has been a resounding success \nsince its enactment in 1993. It gives employees up to 12 weeks of \nunpaid leave a year to care for a newborn or newly-adopted child, or to \ndeal with a serious medical condition of the employee or close \nrelative.\n  Two proposals to expand the act are now under consideration in \nCongress. Senator Dodd proposes to apply the law to all firms with 25 \nor more employees, instead of 50 or more employees under current law. \nThis step would enable 15 million more workers to receive this \nimportant benefit. Senator Murray proposes to offer 24 hours of leave a \nyear for employees to attend parent-teacher conferences and other \nschool events.\n  Those who support genuine family-friendly policies know that the \nFamily and Medical Leave Act works well for working families. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its expansion and to reject the Republican \ncomptime Trojan horse.\n  I know there is significant interest in the idea of legislation that \nwould allow an employee to make a genuinely voluntary choice to be \ncompensated for overtime work in time off rather than in pay. But, this \nis not that bill. Even those of you who support the concept of \nvoluntary comptime should oppose S. 4. S. 4 contains four major \nprovisions, each of which is designed not to help employees, but to \nallow employers to reduce the amount of money they must pay their \nworkers.\n  This bill isn't meant to help employees juggle their work and family \nobligations. Instead, it is designed to help employers cut workers' \nwages. Forcing employees to accept time off instead of overtime pay is \na cut.\n  While the legislation purports to let employees make the choice \nbetween overtime pay and comptime, it does not contain the protections \nwhich are necessary to ensure that employees are free to choose and are \nfree from reprisal.\n  Under S. 4, it is the employer, not the employee, who decides what \nforms of comptime and flextime will be available at the workplace. \nThere is no freedom of choice for the worker.\n  There is nothing in this bill which prevents an employer from \ndiscriminating against a worker who refuses to take comptime instead of \novertime pay. Under S. 4, an employer could lawfully deny all overtime \nwork to those employees who want to be paid and give overtime \nexclusively to workers who will accept comptime in lieu of pay. There \nis no freedom of choice for the worker.\n  The employee may want a particular day off so that she can accompany \nher child to a special school event or to a medical examination at the \npediatrician. However, nothing in this legislation requires the \nemployer to give the employee the day she requests. This bill gives the \nemployer virtually unreviewable discretion to determine when a worker \ncan use her accrued comptime. Here, too, there is no freedom of choice \nfor the worker.\n  S. 4 contains much more than a badly flawed comptime provision. It \ncontains a section entitled ``Biweekly work program'' which literally \neliminates the 40-hour workweek. The bill substitutes a provision which \nwould allow an employer to work his employees up to 80 hours in a \nsingle week without paying a cent of overtime. The employees would not \neven receive 1\\1/2\\ hours of comptime for each extra hour they worked.\n  The next new provision is entitled ``Flexible credit hours.'' Under \nthis provision, an employee who works hours that are in excess of the \nbasic work requirement would no longer be entitled to overtime. \nInstead, the employee would get an equivalent amount of hours off at a \nlater unspecified time. Under existing law, the employee would be paid \ntime and a half for such excess hours. Under comptime, the employee \nwould at least receive 1\\1/2\\ hours of time off for every excess hour \nworked. However, flexible credit hours purport to offer the employee a \nnew, innovative alternative--work the excess hours but receive only 1 \nhour off for each excess hour worked. I cannot imagine how any employee \ncould turn down an offer like that. Does anyone in this room honestly \nbelieve an employee who was not being coerced would choose to \nparticipate in such a plan?\n  The last feature of this bill appears on page 43. We haven't \ndiscussed it and I would urge each of you to take a closer look at it. \nIt applies to salaried employees. Under current law, they do not \nreceive overtime when they work extra hours and their pay cannot be \ndeducted for an absence of less than a full day. S. 4 proposes to \nchange that rule. Salaried employees would still receive no overtime \nbut they could be subject to deductions in their pay if they were \nabsent. In other words, the fact that they could have pay deducted if \nthey missed 5 hours of work in a week can no longer be used to prove \nthat they are hourly\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nemployees entitled to overtime if they work 5 hours extra another week. \nIs that fair? Is that enhancing worker's freedom of choice.\n  When you analyze what S. 4 would really do for American workers, it \nshould be entitled ``The Pay Reduction Act of 1997.''\n  The essence of a genuine comptime bill is the creation of new options \nfor employees, not employers. As you know, President Clinton has \nendorsed comptime legislation. However, even as a supporter of the \nprinciple of comptime, he has stated that he would be compelled to veto \nS. 4. A letter sent to this committee by the Acting Secretary of Labor \nat the direction of the White House sets forth the failings of this \nlegislation clearly:\n\n       Any comptime legislation must effectively and \n     satisfactorily address three fundamental principles: real \n     choice for employees; real protection against employer abuse; \n     and preservation of basic worker rights, including the 40-\n     hour work week. President Clinton will veto any bill that \n     does not meet these fundamental principles.\n       While the President has called for and strongly supports \n     enactment of responsible comptime legislation, he will not \n     sign any bill--including S. 4--that obliterates the principle \n     of time-and-a-half for overtime or that destroys the 40-hour \n     workweek. Workers--not employers--must be able to decide how \n     best to meet the current needs of their family.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, my colleague from Minnesota indicated he \nwas ready to proceed. Let me see if he is ready. For the moment, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator DeWine, \nfor his courtesy.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anne \nWilson, who is interning with us, be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will actually be relatively brief for \nnow. We are going to have time for plenty of discussion and debate. In \nits present form--and I appreciate the words of my colleague from \nMissouri--this piece of legislation might better be called the Paycheck \nReduction Act. I will just go over some bullet points and marshal \nevidence behind each.\n  Pay cut eliminates the guarantee of pay for overtime work for 65 \nmillion American workers. Mr. President, we passed the Fair Labor \nStandards Act over half a century ago. It was an important piece of \nlegislation. It represented real progress for working families. The \nidea was that if you worked over a 40-hour week, you would get paid \ntime and a half. That is an important principle. This piece of \nlegislation essentially turns the clock back over a half a century. In \na way it is a nonstarter for that reason alone.\n  Interestingly enough, we had an amendment when we were marking up the \nbill in committee which essentially said, at least don't give the \nemployer all the power so that an employer is in a position to say to \nsomeone, Look, we will not give you time and a half compensation for \novertime work. We will give you flextime. So the employer is in a \nsituation to say to a worker, OK, you worked an hour over; we'll give \nyou a flextime hour--that is hour to hour--but we won't offer flexible \ncompensation at time and a half. That was voted down.\n  Benefits cut. Health and retirement benefits based on hours worked \nwould be slashed.\n  Abolishes the 40-hour week. Employee could work up to 80 hours in a \nweek without receiving overtime pay. That is just unbelievable. \nEverybody should understand this. This is a sacred principle. The \nreason we passed the Fair Labor Standards Act is that many employees, \nsome the very employees Senator Ashcroft was discussing, do not have a \nlot of clout vis-a-vis their employers.\n  The idea was to have some basic protection, so that if you were \nworking hard to support a family and you worked overtime, you would get \npaid overtime. That assurance is abolished. Under this legislation, an \nemployee could be working 50 or 60 hours a week or more and not get \npaid any overtime for that. To move away from the 40-hour week turns \nthe clock back about a half a century.\n  Finally, No employee choice. Employer chooses who and when. Employer \ndetermines who works overtime and when an employee can use comp time. \nThis is, in many ways, one of the most troubling features of this \nlegislation. Please remember, and we had testimony in our subcommittee \non this, there are companies that really work well with employees. They \nhave good partnerships, and there are situations where an employee \nworks 4 days a week, 10 hours a day and takes off Friday. That can be \ndone now. You do not need to overturn the Fair Labor Standards Act. You \ndo not need to overturn the 40-hour week. That can be done now.\n  Or what people can do is work 9 hours a day as opposed to 8 hours and \nthen work half a day on a Friday or on a Monday. That can be done now \nwithin the existing framework of labor law.\n  Or people can go in at 7 and come home at 3 or come in at 10 and go \nhome at 6. There are all sorts of flexible arrangements. Right now, \nemployers can give their employees this flexibility if they so desire. \nThe problem is, a lot of employers do not do that. But it has nothing \nto do with the basic principle of the 40-hour week, and the principle \nthat if an employee works overtime, he or she should get time and a \nhalf pay. This legislation undercuts that.\n  Mr. President, that hardly represents a step forward for working \npeople in this country. That is why, in its present form, this is the \nPaycheck Reduction Act. And that is why we are adamantly opposed to it. \nThat is why most people in the country will be opposed to it when they \nlearn all the provisions in the legislation.\n  This is my last point for today. Mr. President, what is interesting \nabout this is it is all done in the name of choice. But you know, we \nhad some interesting amendments in committee that speak to this \nquestion.\n  I offered an amendment which said we have a Family Medical Leave Act \nright now which says that there are up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in \nthe case of sickness of a child or an adult, so why don't we say this: \nIf an employee has banked 10 hours of earned comp time, and she calls \nher employer and says, ``Look, I need that time off because my child is \nsick,'' she gets it automatically. The employer does not get to shut \nher down and say no. If you want to give the employee choice, do not \ngive all the power to the employers. But, Mr. President, that amendment \nwas voted down.\n  We had another amendment which took some parts of the labor force--\nfor example, garment workers--and said, we have a lot of people right \nnow who, whatever the law of the land says, are not even getting paid \nminimum wage or earned overtime. We have a lot of examples of forced \nand unpaid overtime, and we have a whole backload of unfair labor \npractices. So couldn't we at least exempt some sectors of the work \nforce where we know people are vulnerable and somewhat powerless and, \nas a matter of fact, have been exploited by some employers? Thank \ngoodness most employers are not that way. But that amendment went down \nas well.\n  Mr. President, one other example. We had discussion where we said, \nwait a minute, we have this backload, we have all sorts of potential \nfor abuse. Can't we at least have a commitment of resources so we have \nsome enforcement?\n  You are going to need more people within the Department of Labor to \nenforce this to make sure that people are not forced to work overtime \nwithout overtime pay because no matter what you say in theory--about \nthis being voluntary--the vast majority of people who work can tell you \nright now they do not always have a lot of choices. A whole lot of \npeople put up with really awful working conditions. They put up with \nunsafe working conditions. They put up with situations that none of us \nwould want to be in. But they do it to put food on the table. So \ncouldn't we at least provide people with some protection? That is not \nhere either.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect, this bill is hardly giving \npeople more\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nflexibility. That is the way it sounds at first blush. But what really \nis at issue here is you essentially overturn portions of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, you overturn the 40-hour week, you put people in the \nsituation where the employer--and in most situations the employer has \nthe power--is going to say to people, ``Hey, we're pleased to give you \nflextime,'' or, ``We're pleased to give you an hour off, but it's hour \nfor hour, even if you worked overtime. Even if you've banked hours, \nwe're not going to give you time and a half compensation when you want \nand need it.''\n  Let me tell you, the reason people work is because they need that pay \nto put food on the table. The reason you have so many families where \nboth people work, both husband and wife, is because they need the \nincome.\n  I do not think people are interested in seeing their paycheck cut. I \ndo not think people are interested in being put in a situation where \nthey no longer receive time-and-a-half overtime compensation. I do not \nthink people are going to be pleased with a piece of legislation that \nabolishes the 40-hour week. And I do not think people are going to be \npleased with a piece of legislation which sounds great in theory about \nemployee choice, but does not have any of the provisions in it which \nwould really guarantee that that would be a reality.\n  So, Mr. President, I have a budget meeting, and I apologize, because \nI like to debate with my colleague from Missouri. I promise him I will \nbe on the floor whenever we get back to this, to hear what he says and \ngo back and forth--and with my good friend from Ohio. These two are my \ngood friends. We do not always agree, but they are two Senators I \nreally do like and respect. I feel badly about speaking and leaving, \nbut only because we have this budget meeting right now. In any case, \nMr. President, what I said was so compelling, what I said is \nirrefutable and irreducible, and I do not think they could possibly \nrespond to it anyway.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague from Minnesota for the kind \ncomments. I am sorry he is leaving, but he has an important mission on \nthe Budget Committee. I have debated this issue on a number of \ndifferent occasions in committee. But I must say that he is \nparticularly eloquent today, because I do not even recognize this bill \nafter he finished describing it. It is an entirely different bill than \nthe bill I thought we passed out of committee. And I am sure many of \nthe points that he raised today are going to be points of contention as \nthis debate continues over the next few weeks.\n  Mr. President, let me first congratulate Senator Ashcroft and Senator \nKay Bailey Hutchison for the great work that they have done to bring \nthis bill to the floor today. In the House, my colleague from Ohio, \nCongresswoman Deborah Pryce, has done tremendous work on this bill.\n  This is a bill that I am particularly proud to have been involved in \nto help bring to the floor today, because I think it will help bring \nthe American workplace into the 21st century and, more importantly, \nbring the underlying labor law into the 21st century and make both more \nconducive, more understanding, to the changing nature of American \nsociety and of the American workplace, particularly of the American \nfamily and how people really live today.\n  In the hearings that we held in the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee on this bill several months ago, we heard facts that \nsubstantiate the monumental changes that have taken place in American \nsociety in this century, particularly in the last 20 to 25 years, \nchanges that make it absolutely essential that we pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, today more than 60 percent of married women work \noutside their home; 75 percent of married women with school-aged \nchildren work outside the home; 75 percent of married couples with \nchildren have both spouses working.\n  We compare these statistics, Mr. President, to the situation in 1950: \n11 percent in 1950--11 percent--of married mothers with children under \nthe age of 6 worked outside the home. Today, almost 50 percent do--47 \npercent.\n  In less than half a century--in my lifetime--we have gone from around \n10 percent of these mothers working outside the home to nearly half of \nthem. This is truly a historic social change. I believe the sponsors of \nthis bill in both the House and the Senate believe that it would be a \ngood idea for the dynamics of the American workplace to finally catch \nup with the dynamics of our society.\n  It would be a good idea, Mr. President, for our laws to reflect the \nreality of how people live today. Put simply, Mr. President, there are \nmore single parents and dual income families in our work force today \nthan ever before, and their numbers are growing. In today's society, \nemployees are faced with a difficult task of balancing their \nobligations to family, to spouse, to children, to work, school, other \nimportant things.\n  Mr. President, it is significant--it is significant--that for many \nyears Federal, State, and local governments have enjoyed the statutory \nability to offer their employees a flexible work schedule, thus \nallowing them an opportunity to spend more time with their families or \nmore time to continue their education.\n  Mr. President, as our colleagues consider this bill, I ask them to \nconsider how many times they have had a Federal employee, when they \nhave been back to their State, come up to them and say, ``I don't like \nthis. I don't like the comptime. I don't like the flexibility that the \nlaw gives me today.'' They have had this, Federal workers have, for \nseveral decades. State employees have.\n  I was Lieutenant Governor of Ohio for 4 years. I do not recall one \nState employee ever coming up to me and saying, ``I don't like the \nflexibility that we have.'' In fact, just the contrary. Everyone who \nhas ever talked to me about it has said, ``I enjoy it. I like it. It \nhelps my family.''\n  Mr. President, there are actually antiquated Federal laws which are \nstill on the books that are preventing some of the necessary changes in \nthe non-Government workplace. This is what this bill does. It sweeps \naway some of these old laws that prohibit workers from doing what they \nwant to do.\n  Let us say, for example, a mother wants to take her daughter to a \ndoctor's appointment. She wants to make up the working hours she missed \nby stacking them into other work days. Today, Federal law, written by \nCongress in 1938, says the employer cannot do that. The employer has to \nsay to her, ``No. I am prohibited by law from doing this. I want to do \nit. You want to do it. We are prohibited by law from doing it.''\n  Mr. President, that simply does not make sense as we approach the \nnext century. Workers in this country need more flexibility.\n  Mr. President, earlier this month the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee passed this bill, a bill that would reduce some of \nthe stress on America's working families by making the American \nworkplace more family friendly.\n  As chairman of the Employment and Training Subcommittee, I handled \nthis bill and we held several hearings. The hearings strengthened my \nconviction that this bill is long overdue.\n  Senator Jeffords, the chairman of the committee, was on the floor a \nfew minutes ago and talked about Christine Korzendorfer, a woman, a \nmother of several children, who works at TRW. This is what she said, \nand I quote. She is talking about overtime pay. ``Pay is important to \nme.'' That is important. ``However, the time with my family is more \nimportant. If I had the choice,''--if I had the choice--``there are \ntimes when I would prefer to take comp time in lieu of overtime. What \nmakes this idea appealing is that I would be able to choose what option \nbest suits my situation.''\n  Mr. President, that pretty well sums it up. Individual choice is \nreally what this is all about. It is the Christine Korzendorfers of \nthis country, the hard-working Americans, who know best what kind of \nwork schedule fits their needs. Giving these workers the freedom of \nchoice is the purpose of this legislation. The bill before us today, S. \n4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, will amend the Fair Labor \nStandards Act to finally provide employers and employees in the private \nsector with\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nthe same benefits public-sector employees have enjoyed for many, many \nyears.\n  The bill contains three options for making the workplace more \nflexible--compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime pay, \nbiweekly work schedules, and flexible credit hours.\n  Participation, Mr. President, is voluntary. Let me stress this again \nand again. You are going to hear this word from me throughout this \ndebate. It is voluntary. No one has to do it. If the employee does not \nwant to do it, the status quo prevails. The employer has to want to do \nit, the employee has to want to do it before this law really even kicks \nin.\n  Mr. President, I think that most people would be shocked if they knew \nthat current law prohibits, absolutely prohibits, employees and \nemployers from making the types of arrangements and agreements that \npeople in the public sector can do today.\n  If that law was not in effect today, if that law did not prohibit \nthat type of arrangement, do you think, Mr. President, Members of the \nSenate, that anyone would come to the Senate floor and offer a bill to \ndo that? Would anyone come to the Senate floor and offer a bill that \nsaid the Federal Government is going to step in and tell employees and \ntell workers in this country that, if you want to make an arrangement \nwith the employer that allows you more flexibility in your life, that \nallows you to better decide when you are going to work, how you are \ngoing to work--does anybody think that bill would pass?\n\n  Does anybody think that the Federal Government, if it did not have \nthat law in effect today, that we would want to put that law into \neffect? The answer obviously is no. I think it tells us something when \nwe look at that answer and look at the question in that way. Such a \nbill obviously would never pass.\n  Mr. President, the Fair Labor Standards Act and its underlying \nregulations simply do not allow private-sector employers to meet the \ndemands of their employees for more flexibility in various forms of \ncompensation. As a result, working families are faced with tremendously \ndifficult decisions.\n  For example, will a mother sacrifice hard-earned vacation time off to \ntake her child to the doctor or to the hospital? Should she forgo the \ncompensation to make sure her sick child is properly cared for? Should \nshe try to run home for an hour here or 20 minutes there? Can a single \nparent afford to leave work early to attend a teacher conference, to \nhelp chaperone a class trip? Will a single parent ever find the time to \npursue greatly needed continued education? These are the options that \nthis bill will give.\n\n  I see, Mr. President, my colleague from Texas is on the floor. She \nhas worked long and hard to bring this bill to the floor. I \ncongratulate her for her great work. I yield to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I want to thank Senators Jeffords and DeWine and Senator Ashcroft for \ntheir commitment to this bill. They have followed it through all the \nway from the beginning--Senator Ashcroft, as the key sponsor, and \nSenators DeWine and Jeffords, as the chairman of the subcommittee and \nfull committee that shepherded this bill through because they believed \nso much in what this bill can do for the more than 60 million workers \nin this country, including 28 million women, who are paid by the hour.\n  I was just listening to what Senator DeWine was saying, and I have to \nsay, step back a minute and think about the fact that the Federal \nGovernment is saying to the hourly employees of this country, ``You \ncannot go in and ask your employer to take off at 3 o'clock on Friday \nand work until 7 o'clock on Monday.'' You cannot do that because the \nFederal law says your employer cannot offer you that option. So if your \nchild is playing in a soccer game or a football game on Friday \nafternoon at 3 o'clock, which many schools across our country do have \nin their schedules, you cannot go in and get that opportunity to see \nyour child, because the Federal Government says you cannot do it.\n  Now, if you were a Federal employee you could do it because Federal \nemployees have that option. If you are a salaried employee, you could \ndo it. It is hourly employees who are not able to say, ``I want to work \ntwo extra hours on Monday so I can take off at 3 o'clock on Friday.''\n  Mr. President, all this bill does is give the same option to hourly \nemployees that every Federal employee and every salaried employee has \nin our country. It is just amazing to me we did not do this years ago. \nIt was only Senator Ashcroft who came in and said, ``Why have we not \ndone this?'' Many of us were not even fully aware of the impact our out \nof date labor laws were having on Americans' modern lifestyles.\n  What are our modern lifestyles? Mr. President, over two-thirds of the \nwomen who have school-age children in this country are working outside \nthe home. When the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed, we had a lot of \nmoms that could and that chose to stay home. Today, there are 58.2 \nmillion women in the workforce, and roughly half--28 million--are paid \nby the hour. The other half are salaried employees or self-employed. \nThe biggest stress factor they have in their lives is the inability to \nfind the time in the average day to do the things they need and want to \ndo for themselves and their families. Working mothers and their \nchildren want to be able to share more of life's activities--to be able \nto go to the PTA meeting, the soccer game, the football game, and still \nbe able to make a full-time salary and make ends meet at the end of the \nmonth.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act will enable those working mothers \nto do just that. Senator Ashcroft and I have made sure that these \npeople who are working hourly are not going to lose their salaries \nbecause they do have budgets. They have to meet the mortgage payment. \nThey have to meet the car payment or the rent payment. They simply \ncannot afford to take time off without pay, as the President and some \nMembers of Congress have called for.\n  That is the beauty of this bill. It allows the employee to be paid, \nwhile adding flexibility to their work week.\n  Another aspect that Americans like so much about this bill is it \nwould allow an hourly employee to say, ``I would like to work 9 hour \ndays and take every other Friday off work, with pay.'' Federal \nemployees have this option. Salaried employees have this flexibility.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it is important to keep in mind that these \nscheduling options are all voluntary. There is nothing that requires an \nemployer or an employee to choose any of these options. If any employee \nis asked to work overtime, that employee keeps the right to say \n``Great, I want time-and-a-half pay,'' end of story. But if the \nemployee says, ``I want to take time-and-a-half in paid time off and \nnot outright pay now,'' or ``I would like to go ahead and work the \nextra hours and bank that time so that when my child's soccer game is \nscheduled'' that employee will have that option, in cooperation with \nthe employer.\n  And because this added flexibility and free time for employees has \nbeen proven to boost morale and improve productivity, giving hourly \nemployees these added freedoms becomes a win-win situation for employee \nand employer alike. In short, this bill makes imminent sense. My only \nsurprise is that we did not update this antiquated labor law earlier.\n  I commend Senator Ashcroft, I commend Senator DeWine, and I commend \nSenator Jeffords for helping us get this bill to the floor so that we \nwill be able to finally say to the 28 million women that are hourly \nwage working women and the 30 million hourly wage working men in \nAmerica, ``You now have the same freedom to schedule time to spend with \nyour loved ones that the rest of the workforce enjoys.'' For the \nFederal Government to stand in the way of those two individuals and \nsay, ``No, you cannot do this because Big Brother Federal Government in \nWashington said 30 years ago when there were not very many working moms \nin the workplace, in a whole different era, that you could not do it.'' \nMr. President, we must enter in to the 1990's and update our labor laws \nto address the needs of the struggling hourly wage families in this \ncountry.'' We are going to let the marketplace work and we are going to \ntake one source of\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\nstress off the hourly employee in this country who wants to spend time \nat home with their children, time catching up on errands, or just time \nrelaxing with loved ones and friends.\n  That is what the Family Friendly Workplace Act does. That is why I am \nhappy to be a cosponsor with Senator Ashcroft, and give the 28 million \nwomen and 60 million working Americans in this country the same \nscheduling freedom that other employees in this country have had for \nyears. Those Americans who work so hard day in and day out at their \njobs, then have that extra burden of having to work when they come \nhome. Most do not come home from work and sit in a chair and rest. They \ncome home from work and they fix dinner for the kids, they fix lunch \nfor school tomorrow, and then they do homework with the kids or \nwhatever it is that has to be done. Their day is not over at 5 o'clock. \nFrom time to time, they need to be able to take entire days or even \nweeks off from work. The Family Friendly Workplace Act will allow them \nto save up the hours to do that. Mr. President, we cannot give \nAmerica's hardworking families any more than 24 hours in the day, but \nwe can do the next best thing by enacting this important legislation.\n  I thank Senator DeWine for yielding the floor. I hope we will be able \nto talk about this for a long time to come because if the Democrats are \nindeed going to filibuster and keep the Senate from responding to the \nneeds of America's workers who overwhelming support this bill, then I \nam ready to talk for a long time. This bill means a lot to me and it \nwill mean a lot to the families of our country. If we have to stand on \nour feet and talk for 2 weeks, count me in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague from \nTexas for not only an excellent statement but for the tremendous work \nshe has done, not just on this bill, but on many pieces of legislation \nthat really reflect how American families live today.\n  Government, many times, has a hard time keeping up with changes in \nsociety. She has worked, for example, on the homemaker IRA bill, \nanother bill that, again, tracks the changes in society and gives \nfamilies flexibility to allow them to make adjustments in their life, \nto live their lives the way they want to live them. I congratulate her \nfor her great work and look forward to working on this bill and \ncontinuing this debate in the future.\n\n  Mr. President, I think one of the points that my colleague from Texas \nmade very well is that this bill--the current law discriminates against \nhourly workers. We have a situation today where two people can be \nworking together, one is a salaried employee, the other is an hourly \nemployee, and the hourly employee, really because of the way the law is \nwritten, because of a quirk of history, legislative history, the hourly \nemployee does not have the same flexibility today that a salaried \nemployee does. The salaried employee can make an arrangement with the \nemployer to shift time, to be gone a Friday afternoon, to work extra \nsome other time, that flexibility is not available to the hourly \nemployee. That is discrimination. That is wrong. That is what this bill \nis aimed at rectifying.\n  Mr. President, it is also discrimination to say if you work for the \nFederal Government or if you work for local government, you have to \nfollow one set of rules and you have many options as far as the time \nyou work. But if you work in the private sector, the Federal Government \nsays, ``Oh, no, you do not have that flexibility.'' That is \ndiscrimination. Again, that is what this bill is designed to rectify, \nchange, and stop that discrimination.\n  S. 4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act, Mr. President, will finally \nprovide the flexibility that today's work force so desperately needs. \nThe act will allow employers and employees to mutually agree, \nvoluntarily, on whether an employee will receive overtime compensation \nin the form of the traditional time and a half--money; or, that same \ntime and a half as compensatory time off. That choice this bill gives \nto that employee and that employer.\n  Employers and employees will be able to mutually agree to biweekly \nwork schedules instead of the traditional workweek. Employers and \nemployees will be able to mutually agree on the use of flexible credit \nhours. These choices will alleviate the pressures working women, single \nparents, constantly face today, Mr. President, in their attempt to \nbalance the responsibilities at work with their obligations to their \nchildren, their obligations to their family.\n  The cornerstone to each of these options is this foundation of \nchoice. It is voluntary. It is giving the employee one more tool. Mr. \nPresident, I and my colleagues are not alone in recognizing that our \nwork force, our workplaces have changed.\n  We are not alone in understanding that the Fair Labor Standards Act \npassed many, many years ago no longer in this respect totally meets \nworkers' needs. We are not alone in understanding that it is time for \nchange.\n  A 1994 study by the Department of Labor stated that the primary \nconcern of two-thirds of working women with children was the difficulty \nin balancing work and family. No surprise. A poll taken by Money \nmagazine, just published in this May's issue, states, ``Sixty-four \npercent of the public and 68 percent of women said that if they had a \nchoice between taking cash or time off for working overtime they would \ndefinitely choose the time.'' Let me repeat that. Two-thirds said if \nthey had a choice they would choose the time. It is a question of \nchoice.\n  The point is, Mr. President, that current law does not give the \naverage American worker--the person who is working in the private \nsector, the person who is working paid by the hour--does not give them \nper law that choice, and, in fact, prohibits employers and employees \nfrom making that choice; that determination. In that same poll, Mr. \nPresident, 82 percent said they would support the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act.\n  An article in the Cincinnati Enquirer read, ``A little flexibility \nwould be a godsend to good workers who also want to be good parents.'' \nThe article went on to say, ``It could benefit employers, too, who find \nit easier to recruit and retain productive workers.''\n  An article in the Akron Beacon Journal quoted Ann Morris as saying \nvery simply and for obvious reasons, ``In the long run, my time is more \nimportant than the extra dollars.''\n  Mr. President, furthermore, the President of our country, President \nClinton, has stated on more than one occasion that he understands the \nneed for more flexibility in the workplace and that he favors \nopportunities for workers, such as compensatory time in lieu of \ntraditional overtime pay, flexible credit hours, and biweekly work \nschedules. This is what he said at the Democratic National Convention. \nI quote President Clinton. ``We should pass a flextime law that allows \nemployees to take overtime pay and money, or time off, depending on \nwhat is better for their family.''\n  In describing his own initiative, this is what President Clinton \nsaid:\n\n       This legislative proposal is vital to American workers--\n     offering them a meaningful and flexible opportunity to \n     balance successfully their work and family responsibilities. \n     The legislation will offer workers more choice and \n     flexibility in finding ways to earn the wages they need to \n     support their families while also spending valuable time with \n     their families.\n\n  Mr. President, these options have been on trial in the public sector. \nIt is not as if we do not have a wealth of experience in this area. We \ndo have years and years of experience, and thousands and thousands of \nemployees who have benefited from this.\n  It is always instructive, I think, before Congress to act to look to \nsee what experience we have. I think this has shown, Mr. President, \nthat this is clearly what we need to do because the experience has been \nin fact good.\n  This is what President Clinton has to say about this. Let me quote:\n\n       Broad use of flexible work arrangements to enable Federal \n     employees to better balance their work and family \n     responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job \n     satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.\n\n  That is the view our President expressed on July 11, 1994. The \nPresident recognized that people sometimes have to struggle very hard \nto balance the demands of work and families.\n  A couple of years after he made that earlier statement, the President \nwent even further calling on all Federal agencies to develop a plan of \naction for better implementation of these flexible work schedules. \nAgain I quote:\n\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\n\n       I am directing all executive departments and agencies to \n     review their personnel practices and develop a plan of action \n     to utilize the flexible policies already in place . . . \n     flexible hours that will enable employees to schedule their \n     work and meet the needs of their families.\n\n  That is from a Presidential memorandum dated June 21, 1996.\n  Finally, in his State of the Union Address, this is what the \nPresident said. ``We should pass flextime so workers can choose to be \npaid overtime and income, or trade it in for time off to be with their \nfamilies.''\n  This is a quote the Democratic Leadership Council:\n\n       Public policy should support two-parent families by giving \n     them as much flexibility as possible to balance family and \n     income needs. The tools and protection workers need in the \n     information age are different from those required in the \n     industrial era. The Fair Labor Standards Act needs to be \n     modernized. Even with squeezed family budgets, for some \n     workers time off may be as valuable as extra money.\n\n  Mr. President, this type of bipartisan support I think provides us \nwith a remarkable opportunity. A Democratic President and Republican \nand Democratic leaders in Congress are united on an important national \nissue facing the American workplace. We may never have a better \nopportunity to pass this legislation.\n  For the sake of those Americans who are faced daily with the \ndifficult challenge of deciding between their livelihood, their family, \ntheir employers, and the American work force as a whole, I urge swift \npassage of this bill.\n  I would like, Mr. President, to take just a moment--I am sorry my \ncolleague from Minnesota is not here. He indicated that he was looking \nforward to continuing this debate. I know he will in the weeks ahead. \nHe had to leave to attend a budget hearing. But I would like to briefly \naddress several comments that he made when he talked about this bill. I \nrather jokingly, as he was leaving the floor, said to him that the bill \nhe had described was not the bill that I thought we passed out of the \ncommittee. Let me explain to my colleagues.\n  He cited four problems that he saw with this bill. The first was he \nsaid it was a pay cut. He said that overtime should be sacred. Mr. \nPresident, he is absolutely right. Overtime should be sacred. Overtime \nis sacred in this bill.\n  What we are simply saying is that if an employee, because of his or \nher family situation, or for whatever reason, decides that they would \nrather take time and a half in time at some other date instead of \nmoney, they have the option to do that providing both the employee and \nemployer want to do that. That is all it says. That is flexibility. \nThat is allowing workers who work by the hour to get paid by the hour, \nto have the same rights Federal workers have, that State workers have, \nand the same rights that salaried employees have today.\n  So it preserves the concept of overtime, and time and a half. In \nfact, with that time and a half it gives it more flexibility. It gives \ncertainly more potential value for the employee because it allows the \nemployee to decide how to take that.\n  My colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, also said it cuts \nbenefits. It is simply not true. We will have the opportunity to talk \nabout this at length. There has been no evidence brought forward that \nshows this at all. The facts simply aren't there.\n  He also said that it abolishes the 40-hour work week. That is not \ntrue. It just isn't true. I ask what is wrong with an employee having \nthe option to design his or her biweekly time with the consent of the \nemployer, if they both want to do it? What is wrong with them designing \nthe work week that says the employee will have every second Friday off? \nMaybe he or she wants to spend time with their family. Maybe they want \nto volunteer. Maybe they want to go fishing. Maybe they want to go \nhunting. It is not Government's business.\n  The current law prohibits employees and employers who do not work for \nthe Federal Government and who work by the hour from being able to make \nthat kind of an arrangement. Is that an attack on the 40-hour workweek? \nI don't think so. And I don't think the American worker thinks so \neither.\n  My colleague talked about enforcement. We listened to the testimony. \nWe listened to the complaints that were made and the criticisms of the \nbill. And some of them, quite frankly, were justified. No bill is \nperfect, as it is introduced. We took those criticisms, and altered the \nbill to try to deal with the constructive criticism from the other side \nof the aisle.\n  This is a better bill as it comes to the floor, quite frankly, than \nit was when we started.\n  My colleague suggested that they certainly get credit for that. But \nthe enforcement is there. The enforcement is there. It relies on the \ncurrent enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act--enforcement that \nhas been in place. The mechanism is there. And it provides very, very \nspecific and tough penalties if, in fact, an employer in any way tries \nto coerce an employee, if they in any way try to abuse the privileges \nthat are given employees and employers in this bill.\n  So I look forward, Mr. President, to having the opportunity to \ndiscuss this bill in the future.\n  I yield to my colleague from New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3881-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3890-S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISPOSITION OF LOOTED ARTWORK\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, when the Banking Committee began the \ninquiry into Swiss banks, we had no idea where the trail would lead. We \nknow that the Nazis had looted personal belongings of millions from all \nover Europe--gold, personal matters, bank accounts. But we really did \nnot know how much help--I say ``help''--that the Nazis had in disposing \nof this loot. We are beginning to get some idea. Now we have a better \nidea.\n  We know that Swiss banks facilitated the looting of gold from all \nover Europe. We know that the accounts of great numbers of Holocaust \nvictims were never returned by Swiss banks to their heirs. But we also \nknow that our Nation had similar problems. Other nations had similar \nproblems and participated. France was one of them.\n  I am shocked to see a December 1995 report which I am holding here \nfrom the French Ministry of Justice.\n  Mr. President, this report details an audit of some of France's most \nprestigious museums and explains how these museums for over 50 years \nmanaged to hide their ownership of almost 2,000 works of art--1,955 \nworks of art, to be precise, art that was looted from the victims of \nthe Holocaust and deposited with these museums during the war, some of \nthem sold on the so-called black market by the Nazis, who stripped \nEurope, who stripped individuals as they came through with their \nkilling machine and sold the art or deposited it with these museums \nthat knew they were not the true owners who were selling it to them.\n  Curator after curator cared more about the so-called, to use their \nwords, sanctity of their collections, the museum's collections than for \njustice of the family from which art work was stolen. This is \nunconscionable for the museum to be saying, and I quote the museum in \nVersailles, the curator said, ``Each and every one of these works has \nits proper place in our collections.'' Do not disturb them. It does not \nmatter that they were stolen. It does not matter that it was their \nproperty.\n  The report also quotes a curator from the Musee d'Orsay as having \nsaid that a painting held in his collection by Gustave Courbet, the \ngreat painting of the Cliffs at Etretat After a Storm--and here is a \nphotograph of that painting; it is one of the great masterpieces of the \nworld--is one of the masterpieces that we would have to buy at a great \nprice if we did not already have it.\n  Well, they may have it, but who does it rightfully belong to? Are we \nsaying that the great art museums of the world, and particularly in \nFrance, have a right to keep this stolen art work?\n  Mr. President, this painting sits today in the Musee d'Orsay and the \nsimple matter is that it does not belong to that museum. This painting, \nalong with thousands of others and with other art objects in the French \nmuseums, should be immediately turned over to an independent authority \nto quickly establish its rightful ownership. The French Government has \nestablished a commission to study the problem but the true owners \nshould not have to put up with the delays that go along with \ncommissions like this. It has been 50 years, as the report states. The \nFrench museums have made little\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\nor no attempt to find either the heirs or the owners of these art \nworks. These works have appeared in exhibits numerous times, have been \nin possession of the most prominent art museums in the world. The \nprocess of returning these works of art must be put in the hands of a \nparty that can search for true owners and do so without a worry whether \nor not they fit neatly into museum collections. After more than 50 \nyears, it is time for justice. And just as we seek that proper \naccounting from the Swiss bankers, it is time that French museums do \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, almost 3 weeks ago, I wrote to the French Ambassador, \na letter dated April 8, which I will submit for the Record and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n           Affairs,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 1997.\n     His Excellency Francois Bujon de l'Estang,\n     Ambassador, The French Embassy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Bujon de l'Estang: As you are probably \n     aware the Senate Banking Committee, of which I chair, is \n     currently conducting an investigation into the disposition of \n     heirless assets belonging to victims of the Holocaust. One of \n     the subjects of our investigation is the disposition of \n     artwork looted by the Nazis during the Second World War. It \n     is my understanding that there are currently 1,995 pieces of \n     such artwork in storage in Paris. Could you please provide me \n     with a descriptive list of this artwork. Additionally, could \n     you inform me of the steps your country has taken to identify \n     the rightful owners of these works of art and the numerous \n     dormant French bank accounts belonging to victims of the \n     Holocaust. Thank you for your cooperation in this very \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alfonse D'Amato,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. My office has been in touch with the French Embassy and \nhas been assured of their cooperation repeatedly. I told them I was \ngoing to come to the floor today. We called them. We were assured by \nthe Ambassador's secretary, oh, yes, we are going to get you this \ninformation.\n  This is not a great secret. This Justice Ministry report again goes \nback to 1995. The quotes that I have given you come from this report in \nterms of the attitude of the museums.\n  So whether it is ``Cliffs at Etretat'' or whatever artwork it is that \nhas been stolen and taken illegally, it is time now for a proper \naccounting. That is what we seek. We will continue to pursue this \nmatter. I hope that the French Ambassador and the French Government \nwould begin to work with us in accommodating justice.\n  I thank my friends. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, recently our colleague, Senator Moynihan, \nsecured, or maybe not so recently, his FBI file, and it is interesting \nthat in 1961, in a memorandum suggesting a meeting between himself and \na then very youthful Daniel Patrick Moynihan, J. Edgar Hoover wrote, \n``I am not going to see this skunk.''\n  Now, the Senator from New York has been called many things, as we all \nhave in the course of our careers, but after considerable amount of \nreflection I concluded that the only way in which this moniker could \nstick would clearly be in a way that J. Edgar Hoover did not intend, \nand that is that the distinguished Senator from New York has long and \noften been a skunk at the garden party of the intellectually \ncomfortable, challenging our thinking about the status quo.\n  Most recently, he has brought this very considerable skunk-like \npresence to the matter of America's intelligence bureaucracy in the \npost-cold-war era. He has asked why it is that our vast intelligence \napparatus, built to sustain America in the long twilight struggle of \nthe cold war continues to grow at an exponential rate? Now that that \nstruggle is over, why is it that our vast intelligence apparatus \ncontinues to grow even as Government resources for new and essential \npriorities fall far short of what is necessary? Why is it that our vast \nintelligence apparatus continues to roll on even as every other \nGovernment bureaucracy is subject to increasing scrutiny and, indeed, \nto reinvention?\n  Our colleague's answer is an important one for all of us to reflect \non. The answer is secrecy and bureaucracy. It is secrecy that conceals \nstructure, budgets, functions, and critical evaluation from the public, \nthe executive branch and most Members of Congress, including those on \nappropriate oversight committees. It is bureaucracy, the nature of the \nself-perpetuating institution like any of our intelligence agencies, \nthat leads to an ongoing redefinition of purpose and ongoing creation \nof redundant systems and ongoing expansion of scope.\n  The first component, secrecy, means that the normal active tools of \ndemocracy, that is, press scrutiny, public debate, and appropriate \noversight from executive and the congressional branches, are absent. \nAnd the second component, bureaucracy, means that reform, downsizing, \nreorganization, and elimination of redundancies cannot come from within \nbecause, as the Senator from New York demonstrates, our intelligence \napparatus is merely following the norms of all agencies.\n  This suggests that the intelligence bureaucracy will not, indeed \ncannot, change until we act on the cultural barriers to reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of the remarks of our \ncolleague, the senior Senator from New York, at Georgetown University's \nMarvin H. Bernstein Lecture be printed in the Record. I commend this \nimportant commentary on the problems of bureaucracy and secrecy to all \nof my colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Secrecy as Government Regulation\n\n                  (By Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan)\n\n       Marver Bernstein was a scholar of great range and \n     authority, but his primary work concerned government \n     regulation, notably his celebrated editorship of Volume 400 \n     of The Annals: The Government as Regulator. In that \n     tradition, I would like to consider secrecy as a form of \n     government regulation.\n       If at times my account appears more anecdotal than \n     analytic, I plead that data is the plural of anecdote.\n       And so we begin of a morning early in January, 1993, when I \n     paid a farewell call at the White House on George Bush, a \n     fine friend and a fine President. As I was leaving the Oval \n     Office, his redoubtable Chief of Staff James A. Baker, III \n     ran into me, and asked if I might wait for him in his office \n     until he had finished some business with the President. I \n     went down the hall, was served coffee, and awaited his \n     pleasure.\n       In time he returned to his office, went out, and came back \n     with a small stack of what seemed like magazines. Baker \n     wanted to show me what had become of the morning intelligence \n     summary.That is to say, the National Intelligence Daily, or \n     ``NID'', which the Central Intelligence Agency had begun back \n     in 1951. It used to be ten or twelve pages long, plain cover, \n     Top Secret. Some three hundred copies were printed. The real \n     stuff, Baker now showed me half a dozen national intelligence \n     dailies from half a dozen national intelligence agencies. \n     Some had photographs on the cover, just like the Washington \n     Post. Some were in color, just like the Washington Times. The \n     Chief of Staff explained it was necessary for him to arrive \n     at dawn to read them all, try to keep in mind what he had \n     already read in the press or seen on television, and prepare \n     a summary for POTUS. As Paul C. Light would have it, \n     government had thickened and heightened; someone now had to \n     summarize the summations.\n       I left musing about this. I had a passing acquaintance with \n     public administration theory, having been patiently \n     instructed by James Q. Wilson and Stephen Hess. I knew \n     Anthony Downs. Had even spoken to Luther C. Gulick as he \n     approached his 100th birthday in a hamlet on the banks of the \n     St. Lawrence River. I was beginning to be familiar with the \n     new ``institutional sociologists'' such as Paul DiMaggio, \n     Walter Powell, Howard Aldrich. I had read with great profit \n     the works of Suzanne Weaver and Robert A. Katzmann in the \n     M.I.T. series on Regulatory Bureaucracy. And a common theme \n     was emerging. To cite DiMaggio and Powell, ``Organizations \n     are still becoming more homogeneous and bureaucracy remains \n     the common organizational form.''\n       Light calls this ``isomorphism,'' In a 1978 lecture drawing \n     on Wilson, and through him on to the 19th century German \n     sociologist Simmel, I had propounded ``The Iron Law of \n     Emulation.'' Organizations in conflict become like one \n     another. (Simmel had noted that the Persians finally figured \n     out it was best to have Greeks fight Greeks.) The United \n     States Constitution assumed conflict\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\n     among the three branches of government; I traced conflict \n     techniques among them ranging from office buildings to \n     personal staffs to foreign travel. Now, however, one's \n     attention was directed to conflict techniques employed by \n     agencies within one branch, the Executive.\n       The intelligence community called out for attention. \n     Perhaps it was the room I had just left, this southwest \n     corner room in the White House. I was there on the early \n     afternoon of November 22, 1963, awaiting news from Dallas. \n     The door burst open; in rushed Hubert H. Humphrey. ``What \n     have they done to us?'' he gasped. By ``they'' we all knew; \n     the Texans, the reactionaries. Later in the day one learned a \n     suspect had been arrested; associated with Fair Play for \n     Cuba. At midnight I met the cabinet plane that had been \n     halfway to Japan. I sought out the Treasury official in \n     charge of the Secret Service. We must get custody of Oswald, \n     I pleaded. Else he will never get out of that jail alive.\n       After Oswald was shot, I went round in the company of John \n     Macy, head of the Civil Service Commission, pleading that an \n     investigation had to look into the jaws of hell, else we \n     would be living with a conspiracy theory the rest of our \n     lives. I carried with me a recently reprinted book of the \n     post-Civil War era which ``proved'' that the Jesuits \n     assassinated Lincoln:\n       ``Booth was nothing but the tool of the Jesuits. It was \n     Rome who directed his arm, after corrupting his heart and \n     damning his soul.''\n     And, of course, today something like half of all Americans \n     think the CIA was involved in the assassination of President \n     Kennedy. There is even a Hollywood movie to prove it.\n       Nor can the historians disprove it. The records are sealed. \n     We have an Assassination Records Review Board that lets some \n     things out; not much. Recently, an eminent author wrote to \n     tell me of a meeting with some CIA officials a few years ago \n     in an effort to get some information on how the agency \n     handled the aftermath of the assassination:\n       ``Surely, I said, the agency has an interest in countering \n     such a widely shared conspiracy theory with the truth. I got \n     . . . blank stares.''\n       In his classic study, The Torment of Secrecy, which \n     appeared in 1956, Edward A. Shils defined secrecy as ``the \n     compulsory withholding of information, reinforced by the \n     prospect of sanctions for disclosure.'' But secrets are \n     disclosed all the time, and sanctions for disclosure are rare \n     to the point of being nonexistent. (In the eighty years since \n     the Espionage Act of 1917, only one person has been sent to \n     prison simply for revealing a secret, as against passing \n     material to a foreign power.) In 1995, I was asked to write \n     an introduction to a paperback edition of Shils' work, and \n     came up with the thought that secrecy is a form of government \n     regulation. If this were so, we could look for the patterns \n     those institutional sociologists keep coming up with.\n       Begin with Max Weber and his chapter, ``Bureaucracy'' in \n     Wirschaft und Gescllschaft (Economy and Society), published \n     after his death in 1920, but most likely written in part \n     prior to World War I. He writes:\n       ``Every bureaucracy seeks to increase the superiority of \n     the professionally informed by keeping their knowledge and \n     inventions secret. Bureaucratic administration always tends \n     to be an administration of `secret sessions' in so far as it \n     can, it hides its knowledge and action from criticism.\n       ``The pure interest of the bureaucracy in power, however, \n     is efficacious far beyond those areas where purely functional \n     interests make for secrecy. The concept of the `official \n     secret' is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and nothing \n     is so fanatically defended by the bureaucracy as this \n     attitude, which cannot be substantially justified beyond \n     these specifically qualified areas. In facing a parliament, \n     the bureaucracy, out of a sure power instinct, fights every \n     attempt of the parliament to gain knowledge by means of its \n     own experts or from interest groups. The so-called right of \n     parliamentary investigation is one of the means by which \n     parliament seeks such knowledge. Bureaucracy naturally \n     welcomes a poorly informed and hence a powerless parliament--\n     at least in so far as ignorance somehow agrees with the \n     bureaucracy's interests.''\n       The Federal Bureau of Investigation is nearest the ``ideal \n     type'' of such a bureaucracy, and has the longest experience \n     of the secrecy system that developed in the United States \n     from the moment of our entry into the First World War and the \n     enactment of the Espionage Act of 1917. The system began as a \n     mode of defense against foreign subversion, frequently \n     exploiting the divided loyalties of recent immigrants, and \n     not infrequently stigmatizing an entire class of perfectly \n     loyal citizens. This pattern persisted through the inter-war \n     period, the Second World War, and onto the Cold War. From \n     eminences such as Theodore Roosevelt who in 1917 sounded the \n     warning against ``the Hun within,'' on to the obscenities of \n     the McCarthy era, down to the present when, if I do not \n     mistake, Islamic Americans are going to find themselves under \n     surveillance, as it were.\n       I offer this proposition. The attempts at subversion were \n     real, but never of truly serious consequence. The one \n     exception was the atomic espionage at Los Alamos. But even \n     that was temporary. Soviet scientists would have developed an \n     atom bomb on their own; as they did a hydrogen bomb. \n     Espionage is intriguing, but data analysis is more rewarding. \n     One thinks of the poster in the headquarters of the Internal \n     Revenue Service. ``It Took an Accountant to nail Al Capone.'' \n     The problem is that in this, as in much else, the American \n     public, and the Congress at time, were led to believe that it \n     took the more secretive FBI.\n       It happens this is not true, but heaven help anyone who \n     suggested otherwise at mid-century. Or such was my \n     experience. As an aide to Governor Averell Harriman of New \n     York in the 1950s. I became interested in the subject of \n     organized crime after a State Trooper came upon an \n     extraordinary assembly of mob leaders from around the nation \n     that convened in the hamlet of Apalachin in the Southern Tier \n     of New York. I became peripherally involved as a Senate \n     staffer with Robert F. Kennedy, who was pursuing the subject. \n     In July, 1961, I published an article in the Reporter \n     magazine entitled, ``The Private Government of Crime,'' in \n     which I argued that from its roots in prohibition, which was \n     a large scale manufacturing and marketing activity, that \n     there was something that could reasonably be termed organized \n     crime, that it was serious, and that we had not found a way \n     of dealing with it. Why, I asked, did American government \n     have so little success in dealing with this phenomenon? My \n     general thesis was that there was insufficient organizational \n     reward. Almost in passing, I noted that the FBI, which had \n     ``not hesitated to take on the toughest problems of national \n     security . . . has successfully stayed away from organized \n     crime.'' It got you nothing but institutional trouble.\n       By now I had joined the Kennedy administration as an aide \n     to then-Secretary of Labor Arthur J. Goldberg. In a matter of \n     weeks from the publication of the article, the Department of \n     Labor building on Constitution Avenue was literally raided by \n     G-Men. They hit the Secretary's floor in unison, went door to \n     door, told everyone save the hapless author but including the \n     Secretary himself, that a dangerous person had infiltrated \n     their ranks with the clear implication that he should go. I \n     can't demonstrate this but offer the judgment that at this \n     time in Washington at any other department the person in \n     question would have gone. Hoover had files on everyone, or so \n     it was said. He and Allen Dulles at the CIA were JFK's first \n     announced appointments, rather reappointments.\n       The Department of Labor was different only insofar as \n     Arthur J. Goldberg was different. On August 2, C.D. ``Deke'' \n     DeLoach had informed the Secretary that ``it would appear to \n     be impossible to deal with Moynihan on a liaison basis in \n     view of his obvious biased opinion regarding the FBI.'' The \n     Secretary called me in, said: ``Pat, you have a problem. Go \n     and explain your point of view to the Director.'' The next \n     day, DeLoach agreed to see me, but made plain he could barely \n     stand the sight. There is a three-page, single-space \n     memorandum of the meeting in my FBI file, sent to the \n     Director through John Mohr. It concluded:\n       ``Moynihan is an egghead that talks in circles and \n     constantly contradicts himself. He shifts about constantly in \n     his chair and will not look you in the eye. He would be the \n     first so-called ``liberal'' that would scream if the FBI \n     overstepped its jurisdiction. He is obviously a phony \n     intellectual that one minute will back down and the next \n     minute strike while our back is turned. I think we made \n     numerous points in our interview with him, however, this man \n     is so much up on ``cloud nine'' it is doubtful that his ego \n     will allow logical interpretation of remarks made by other \n     people.''\n       The Director appended a handwritten notation, ``I am not \n     going to see this skunk.''\n       I survived: in part, I think, because the agency had no \n     fall-back position. One raid had always done the trick; no \n     Secretary ever asked that a 34-year-old get in to see the \n     Director.\n       Organizational maintenance is nowhere more manifest, and at \n     times ruinous, than in matters of national security. Hoover \n     was present at this creation during the war hysteria of 1917 \n     and 1918 and the anti-radical rumpus that followed, including \n     Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer's celebrated raids. The \n     FBI was on to Communist activities fairly early on, and not \n     about to cede territory. Richard Gid Powers has related the \n     struggle with the Office of Strategic Services during World \n     War II--Hoover wanted to go overseas. There were social \n     tensions, as Powers records. ``Oh So Social,'' for the Office \n     of Strategic Services; ``Foreign Born Irish,'' for the FBI.\n       However, there is another perspective, perhaps best evoked \n     by the tale of British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, \n     sometime head of the Transport and General Workers Union, on \n     his return from the 1945 Potsdam conference. What, he was \n     asked, were the Soviets like? ``Why,'' he replied, ``they're \n     just like the bloody Communists!'' By contrast, it is quite \n     possible that Harry S. Truman had never met a Communist until \n     he sat down with Stalin at the same conference. Similarly, \n     Hoover may never have met a Communist in his own circles. It \n     was a matter of regionalism, in what was then a much more \n     regional nation. The clandestine activities of the Communist \n     Party of the United States of America were common knowledge \n     within political and intellectual circumstances of Manhattan \n     in the 1930s. They were a given. Such urbanity, if that is \n     not an offensive phrase, was unknown to the ward politics of \n     Kansas City, and equally to the Protestant churches in young \n     Hoover's Seward Square on Capitol Hill.\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\n       In this sense, it was as easy for Harry S. Truman to \n     believe that there were no Communists in government as for J. \n     Edgar Hoover to believe they were everywhere. Neither had \n     any experience with a political community in which some \n     persons were Communists, some had been, some had nuanced \n     differences, some implacable hostility. The world, you \n     might say, of Whittaker Chambers. Or, for that matter, the \n     late Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation \n     of Teachers. His February 1997 obituary records his \n     struggle with Communists in the teachers' unions of New \n     York City in the 1950's. Thus: ``The anti-Communist \n     Teachers Guild was a weak group of 2,400 members.''\n       In the tumult and torment that followed World War II, it \n     would appear that at first Hoover tried to ``warn'' Truman of \n     suspected Communists in or about the American government. We \n     have in the Truman Library a four-page letter of May 29, \n     1946, from the Director to George E. Allen, then head of the \n     Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and a friend of the \n     President, concerning ``high Government officials operating \n     an alleged espionage network in Washington, D.C., on behalf \n     of the Soviet Government.'' Almost everyone of consequence \n     was implicated. First of all, ``Under Secretary of State Dean \n     Acheson,'' ``Former Assistant Secretary of War John J. \n     McCloy,'' ``Bureau of the Budget--Paul H. Appleby.'' It \n     happens I had a slight acquaintance with McCloy, rather more \n     with Acheson, and was close to Appleby. Anyone with the least \n     sense of the Marxist mindset would instantly understand that \n     such men lived in a wholly different world.\n       There now commenced a tragedy of large consequence and \n     continued portent. On December 20, 1946, Meredith Gardner of \n     the Army Signal Agency across the Potomac ``broke'' the first \n     of the coded VENONA dispatches sent mainly by the KGB from \n     New York to Moscow. It was dated December 2, 1944. There were \n     names of the principal nuclear physicists working at Los \n     Alamos. Treason most vile had indeed taken place, was still \n     going on, was indeed occurring, even as Acheson and Newman \n     and Marks and others worked at establishing some kind of \n     international post-war regime to control the bomb. They knew \n     well enough that the bomb would not remain a secret long. \n     Science does not keep secrets. But they did not know that the \n     Soviets had got hold of our plans, and in consequence, would \n     get their own bomb two to three years sooner than otherwise, \n     and hence would want no part of an international regime.\n       They did not know because J. Edgar Hoover did not tell \n     them.\n       Army Signals decrypted the cables, leaving it to the FBI to \n     identify the individuals designated by code words. Julius \n     Rosenberg was LIBERAL. Another atomic spy, the 19-year-old \n     Harvard graduate Theodore A. Hall, was MLAD (Russian for \n     ``youngster'').\n       The National Security Agency has now made public the VENONA \n     decryptions.\\8\\ We never broke more than perhaps 10 percent \n     of the traffic, such is the impenetrability of one-time pads. \n     But all of a sudden, in 1995, the American public learned \n     what we had known.\n       The awful truth, however, is that when the President of the \n     United States needed to know this, which is to say Harry S \n     Truman, he was not told.\n       As best we know, and we never will know until the FBI opens \n     its own files, President Truman was never told of VENONA. Nor \n     it would appear, was Attorney General Tom Clark.\n       The consequences for American foreign policy were almost \n     wholly negative. The realism about the Soviet Union \n     exemplified by George Kennan, and embodied in the policies of \n     such as Acheson and McCloy, gave way to an agitated anxiety, \n     rhetorically on the part of Republicans, but as a matter of \n     practice and policy on the part of Democrats. A realist view \n     would have seen the Soviet Union as an absurdly overextended \n     colonial colossus which would collapse one day, essentially \n     along ethnic lines. (What, after all, had happened to the \n     other European empires in the second half of the 20th \n     century!) Instead, Democrats, launched an invasion of Cuba, \n     bringing the world close to a nuclear exchange, and leaving \n     an absurd problem with us to this day. Off we went to \n     Vietnam, quite oblivious to the Russian-Chinese hostilities \n     that broke out at the same time. And so on. In 1974, Donald \n     L. Robinson described this as ``The Routinization of Crisis \n     Government.'' After all, regulatory regimes seek routine!\n       Part of this disorder may be ascribed to the development of \n     a vast culture of secrecy within the American government \n     which hugely interfered with the free flow of information. \n     The Central Intelligence Agency came into being, rather to \n     the annoyance of the FBI which was slow to cooperate with it. \n     (For that matter, it was not until 1952 that the Pentagon \n     felt comfortable enough with the CIA to share the VENONA \n     decryptions.) Scientists such as Frederick Seitz protested \n     secrecy, but with small success. The problem was that the \n     secrecy was secret. No one knew what was in the NID. And so \n     matters of large import were never really debated.\n       The most important area was that of the Soviet economy. \n     From the mid-1960s on, the intelligence community perceived \n     the Soviets growing at a considerably greater rate than the \n     United States. Inevitably, a ``crossover'' point would come \n     when the GDP of the USSR would exceed that of the United \n     States. In fairness, in the early years there were outside \n     economists who seemed to agree, notably Samuelson. But \n     this fell off. In the summer of 1990, Michael J. Boskin, \n     then-chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, \n     testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on \n     this matter. He estimated that Soviet GNP came to ``only \n     about one-third of the GNP of the U.S.'' He volunteered \n     that ``as recently as a few years ago, the CIA estimates \n     were at 51 percent.'' In a question, I noted that the \n     highest published figure was 59%, but that the secret \n     estimates were even higher. It is hard not to conclude \n     that the Agency had simply acquired an institutional \n     interest in the view that the Soviets were gaining on us. \n     We will debate for some time--say a century--whether the \n     arms build-up, begun by President Carter in the Cold War \n     mode, but continued for some time by President Reagan, \n     somehow ``bankrupted'' the Soviet Union. But the Cold War \n     did end, and the West did prevail. There cannot be too \n     much fault to be found with this outcome. But surely there \n     are lessons.\n       The first lesson is that a culture of secrecy kept the \n     nation from learning the extent of Communist subversion in \n     the 1930s and 1940s. (Subversion was present from the first. \n     John Reed was a paid Soviet agent. But it didn't much matter \n     until World War II came in sight.) Unlike the anti-German \n     hysteria of the First World War, and the anti-Japanese \n     hysteria of the Second, concern with Communist subversion \n     from the 1930s into the Cold War was entirely appropriate. \n     Even so, the Soviet success was limited, and was waning by \n     the time we began to be aware of it. (The Soviet threat was \n     another matter; an adversary with nuclear weapons, comething \n     wholly new to the human condition.) ``The American visage \n     began to cloud over,'' Shils wrote:\n       ``Secrets were to become our chief reliance just when it \n     was becoming more and more evident that the Soviet Union had \n     long maintained an active apparatus for espionage in the \n     United States. For a country which had never previously \n     thought of itself as an object of systematic espionage by \n     foreign powers, it was unsettling.''\n       The larger society, Shils continued, was ``facing an \n     unprecedented threat to its continuance.'' In \n     these circumstances, ``The phantasies of apocalyptic \n     visionaries now claimed the respectability of being a \n     reasonable interpretation of the real situation.'' A \n     culture of secrecy took hold within American government \n     which abetted a form of threat analysis which led to all \n     manner of misadventure.\n       The permanent crisis perceived in Washington was surely \n     overdone.\n       I offer what follows somewhat as conjecture, but with a \n     measure of conviction. The Soviet Union never intended to \n     invade Western Europe, or generally speaking, engage in a \n     third World War with the West. The leaders in Moscow were, \n     for a while there at least, Marxist-Leninists. That doctrine \n     decreed that class revolution would come regardless. It had \n     been hoped for in 1919-20, again in 1945-48. It hadn't \n     occurred, but it surely would. In the meantime, build \n     socialists at home. Early in the Cold War the United States \n     developed surveillance techniques, beginning with the U-2 \n     ``spy plane'' and leading on to satellite imagery of today's \n     National Reconnaissance Office.\n       I conjecture that this technology, and associated \n     underwater devices, gave us first of all the security of \n     knowing we would get a heads up on any serious Soviet \n     preparations for an attack. Not, perhaps, a spasmodic nuclear \n     strike by a crazed commander but anything approaching \n     mobilization of the sort that said to have triggered World \n     War I. (Once one side starts, the other must start, else a \n     five-day advantage prove decisive, etc., etc.)\n       Similarly, in time, the Soviets had their own satellites: \n     could track NATO forces, the various U.S. Fleets, our bombers \n     and so forth. We never planned to invade the Soviet Union. We \n     were obsessive about the Western Hemisphere: nothing new \n     since Monroe's time. And seemingly incapable of understanding \n     that when an idea dies in Madrid, it takes two generations \n     for word to reach Managua. But never warlike as regards the \n     Soviet Union itself.\n       A second lesson is less sanguine. The Cold War has \n     bequeathed us a vast secrecy system, which shows no sign of \n     receding. It has become our characteristic mode of governance \n     in the Executive Branch. Intelligence agencies have \n     proliferated; budgets continue to grow, even as the military \n     subsides. Every day we learn of some new anomaly. As, for \n     example, the Commerce Department employee who took his Top \n     Secret clearance with him to the Democratic National \n     Committee. (Look for the day when it is a mark of \n     institutional prestige to have an honest-to-goodness spy \n     discovered within one's ranks!) In 1995, there were 21,871 \n     ``original'' Top Secret designations and 374,244 \n     ``derivative'' designations. Madness.\n       In the meantime, as old missions fade, the various \n     intelligence agencies seek new ones.\n       This has been painful to observe. I cannot say I could wish \n     for the return of J. Edgar Hoover, as he thought I was a \n     skunk. But someone needs to learn from Hoover's caution about \n     taking on problematic missions. For example, keep the CIA out \n     of drug trafficking. Stick to terrorism and weapons \n     technology, including, of course, biological weapons. Same \n     for most of the other agencies that now fill up our \n     embassies, turning our ambassadors into room clerks.\n       And so to sum up. The twentieth century saw the rise of the \n     administrative state.\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\n     Government regulation has become the norm. However, we have \n     developed not one, but two regulatory regimes. The first is \n     public regulation for which we developed all manner of \n     disclosure, discovery, and due process. This regime is under \n     constant scrutiny. Thus, the 104th Congress enacted the \n     Congressional Review Act which establishes a sweeping \n     procedure whereby Congress, with Presidential approval, can \n     nullify regulations.\n       There is, however, a second regulatory regime concealed \n     within a vast bureaucratic complex. There is some \n     Congressional oversight: some Presidential control. Do not \n     overestimate either. Not that the public is excluded \n     altogether, save as bureaucracies or bureaucrats think it to \n     their advantage to make some things pubic. As, for example, \n     it being budget time, we find on the front pages the report \n     that:\n       ``The Central Intelligence Agency has severed its ties to \n     about 100 foreign agents because they committed murder, \n     torture and other crimes. . . .''\n       This is surely a welcome development. Although it could be \n     asked why in the first instance public monies were disbursed \n     to murderers, torturers and sundry criminals.\n       This second regime is in need of radical change. We have \n     sensed this for some time. But I now submit that change will \n     only come if we recognize it as a bureaucratic regime with \n     recognizable and predictable patterns of self-perpetuation \n     which will never respond to mere episodic indignation.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to \nspend a few more minutes helping those watching understand exactly what \nsignificant opportunities we are talking about with the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act. It is our effort to try to give to people who are on \nhourly working arrangements the ability to develop flexible working \nschedules--to do it in the same way as has been possible for Federal \nworkers so situated for the last--well, during the 1970's, 1980's and \ninto this decade of the 1990's.\n  The attempt to offer the ability to work flexible schedules is a \nresult of people feeling the stress of the job that tugs them away from \ntheir families. In order to understand the true nature of workers' \nstress and the benefit they would gain from flexible work schedules, I \nwould like to read some letters that have been sent to our office. Here \nis a letter that says:\n\n       Dear Senator Ashcroft. I'm a 29-year-old working mother. I \n     have a 2-year-old daughter and am pregnant and due in \n     November. I recently heard about your Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act. Under current law where I work does not allow \n     me to have a flexible work schedule. They are not allowed by \n     the law to let us work less than 40 hours one week and then \n     more than 40 hours the next. In my current condition, I need \n     to be able to take off for doctors' appointments. Due to the \n     fact that I have a complication in my pregnancy, I have more \n     appointments than average. If I was able to take off more one \n     week and work more the next, it would be very helpful to me \n     and other mothers in Missouri.\n\n  That is perfectly stated. Here is another letter:\n\n       My 2-year-old daughter is healthy but there are some days \n     she needs extra attention and some days that she is sick. \n     Some days she is just 2.\n\n  Meaning the terrible 2's, I suppose.\n\n       If I was able to take time I need for some mornings and to \n     make it up at lunch or the next week, it would make my life \n     much easier.\n\n  Here is another letter:\n\n       It's been a struggle for me to be able to arrange for \n     doctor appointments, be home when my child is ill and my \n     three children are always sick at different times. Or when my \n     babysitter has been unable to take my children because of \n     illness. Not all of us have spouses or family members who can \n     fill in for us or when we need to be there for our children. \n     My husband works out of town on many occasions and is unable \n     always to be around when needed.\n       Working parents are not asking for special favors, just a \n     way to be able to meet the demands of both our jobs and \n     families. The Family Friendly Workplace Act would help solve \n     the problem of inflexibility in the workplace. Being able to \n     arrange biweekly work schedules would be very helpful in \n     meeting the needs of our families. I would be able to take \n     the time off for doctors' appointments or to leave a couple \n     hours early one day if the babysitter calls to tell me my \n     child has a fever. Being able to make that time up the next \n     week would certainly take off a lot of the pressure and the \n     stress of taking these last few hours of leave time or \n     potentially being on leave without pay.\n\n  Here is an individual working because they need the money. When a \nlittle crisis arises, because flextime is not available, they have to \nleave the office without pay. She goes on to say:\n\n       The option of taking compensatory time in lieu of monetary \n     compensation would also be very valuable to working parents \n     who just need the time off.\n\n  Here is another.\n\n       Presently I enjoy flexible schedules. The extra day off [I \n     have] during the week allows me to spend one-on-one quality \n     time with my 5-year old daughter. She will start kindergarten \n     this fall, which makes these girls-only days especially \n     meaningful for both of us. Additionally, I can schedule many \n     doctors' appointments as well as other appointments for me \n     and my children on this day off. This allows me to save my \n     accrued sick or vacation leave for a time when I really need \n     the sick leave or can take a well planned family vacation.\n       As a supervisor, I currently have the flexibility in my \n     schedule from week to week. However, my staff are not given \n     the same opportunity, although many of them would be able to \n     utilize and benefit from it.\n\n  Kind of interesting to me. Here is the supervisor that has the flex \ncapacity, says that the staff ought to have the same thing. This is \nreally the crux of what we are talking about in this bill.\n\n       My staff are not given this same opportunity although many \n     of them would be able to utilize and benefit from it.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I am reluctant to exercise this advantage, however, of mine \n     because it seems unfair to me that I have something that my \n     employees do not. I understand that this bill would require \n     that this opportunity be afforded to all employees, not just \n     those in management or supervisory positions.\n\n  Here is another letter from a constituent:\n\n       Time with my children is very important and, unfortunately, \n     working outside the home is important, too. My children will \n     only be young once, and missing parts of their development is \n     a very important part that I can never replace. I would like \n     to better balance my family life and my work life. And I \n     think the Family Friendly Workplace Act is an excellent \n     opportunity for working parents.\n\n  Here is a letter from a schoolteacher:\n\n       I ask that you support the bill as I think it would be a \n     great benefit to all citizens in this country. As an \n     educator, I feel that this would allow parents time to be in \n     school with their children. Time and time again, parents \n     relate to me that they cannot come to school for conferences \n     or other meetings because they have to work. This bill would \n     allow some flexibility in the workplace.\n\n  Another letter. I think this letter is very interesting. This writer \nused to be a Federal employee and is now working in the private sector. \nThe individual writes:\n\n       I have worked in the Federal Government with a flexible \n     schedule based on 80 hours and enjoyed it.''\n\n  That means you work an average of 80 hours over 2 weeks.\n\n       Now that I have left the Federal work force, I have \n     questioned why this same opportunity is not available to me \n     in the private sector. As an American, this disappoints me \n     greatly. The Government does not have enough confidence in me \n     to allow me to make a decision to not take overtime pay if I \n     exceed 40 hours a week. By pretending to protect me, they \n     have hurt me. My company cannot pay me overtime, so I cannot \n     take time off next week. I would like to see the same \n     benefits that Federal workers have, be offered to the private \n     sector.\n       Another example is the vacation time,\n\nthe writer goes on to say:\n\n       What I receive in industry isn't near that what the Federal \n     Government provides. Three-day weekends were great while they \n     lasted--even 4-day weekends allowed the family to get away \n     for a short trip, which is about all we can ever afford \n     anyhow, and I still have discretionary time for kids, doctor \n     visits, and other needs.\n\n  Here is a letter from a schoolteacher:\n\n       As an elementary teacher I feel parents need to have time \n     off to help in their child's classroom and attend \n     conferences. The children have the real benefit of this bill, \n     if it passes, because they will know that their parents \n     really do care about them and their progress in school.\n\n  We will have an opportunity to debate and discuss this matter fully. \nI thank the majority leader, Trent Lott, for allowing us to have this \ntime this afternoon to bring this bill forward. It is pretty clear that \nthe supplemental appropriations will take precedence over this bill \nwhen we reconvene next week and that budget matters will have priority \nand be the subject of our\n\n[[Page S3895]]\n\ndeliberations. But, because this measure was the next measure to come \nup after those come before us, the majority leader let us have a start \non this important issue this afternoon.\n  I look forward to the time when these other measures--which are very \nimportant and require our attention--will have been settled and we can \nget back to this all-important issue of allowing workers to have the \nflexibility to spend time with their families. It is as important as \never to allow workers in the private sector who are paid hourly wages \nto have the same benefits that Federal Government workers have had \nsince 1978.\n  So I thank the majority leader for giving us the opportunity to begin \nthis bill now. It will be necessary for us to bring the bill down so we \ncan proceed to other matters. I close by thanking my good friends who \nhave helped in this measure. Perhaps the most responsible for the \nsignificant progress we have made is Senator DeWine of Ohio, in whose \nsubcommittee this bill was heard and whose leadership has resulted in \nit being one of the first pieces of major legislation brought to the \nfloor during this session of the Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Missouri \nfor the excellent statement and explanation about his bill and also \ncongratulate him for bringing this bill to the floor. As he stated, we \nknew as we began the debate today that we would only just get started \nand that, because of concerns about the budget and other scheduling \nmatters on the floor, we would have to ask to have this bill pulled \ndown temporarily. We will be back on this bill. It is a very important \nbill to American workers. It is a question of fairness. It is a \nquestion of equity. It is a question of really trying to bring our laws \nup to date to reflect the reality of how people live their lives today, \nthe reality of the American workplace.\n  It is a bill about eliminating discrimination. The current law, \nfrankly, as we talked about it, does in fact discriminate against \nhourly workers who are in the private sector who do not have the \nbenefit of working for the Federal Government.\n  So, at this point I do ask unanimous consent to withdraw the motion \nto proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the motion is withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3894-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks in \nmorning business. Today, as most people recognize, is a national day \nfor prayer. We have also been talking about a very important thing \nregarding families and a bill that has been put forward to try to help \nfamilies be able to do their job better.\n  What I would like to speak about a little bit today is building off \nof that statement and also off the National Day of Prayer to talk \nabout, overall, the culture of America and what has happened to our \nNation, what has happened in our culture. I think it probably would \ncome as no surprise, unfortunately, to most people that our culture is \nin difficulty and has been having a great deal of problems lately.\n  I have been looking at and studying this issue for some period of \ntime. Plus, as I travel across my State, as I travel across Kansas, I \nhear more and more people mentioning how much difficulty they think the \nculture is in, how much they feel like they are fighting culture just \nto raise their kids and raise their families. I would like to take the \nSenate's time for just a few minutes to describe where are we today in \nthis culture. Why do we need things like flexibility for families to be \nable to be families again? Why do we need to do those things?\n  Let us look at some of these charts. I apologize ahead of time for \nhow discouraging they are, because they are. As you look at these \nthings--look at this. This is child abuse and neglect reports in \nAmerica. We are talking, in 1976, about 500,000 of them, which was a \nlot at that point in time. But consider where we are today: 3 million \nin 1995 reported, of child abuse and neglect cases reported on an \nannual basis, 3 million. That is a high percentage of our children \nbeing recorded in this. This is a terrible situation and, \nunfortunately, an indictment of the culture.\n  Let us look at out-of-wedlock births. This is something that has \nreceived a lot of attention overall in our society. Consider where we \nwere in 1960--about 5 percent. And you can go back earlier in time and \nit stays at about this 3 to 5 percent level. Consider where we are \ntoday--30 percent. About one in every three children born in America \ntoday is born to a single mom. That is a tough situation. In our inner \ncities--in the District of Columbia we have here, that figure gets up \nto nearly 60 to 70 percent.\n  My wife and I have three children. It is tough enough for two of us \nto raise them, let alone without flexible time to be able to get off \nfrom work, and let alone without being born into a situation where you \nstart out with one parent just at the very outset.\n  The next chart, violent crimes taking place in our society. \nUnfortunately, I think everybody knows the situation here, but look at \nthe staggering numbers--staggering numbers. In 1960, we are talking \nabout violent crime offenses--rape per 100,000, we had about between \n100 to 200 per 100,000 citizens in the country in 1960. Look at where \nwe are today. We are up at nearly 800 per 100,000 people. Look at that \nperiod of time, 1960 to 1993, 33 years, and we go up nearly sevenfold \nin violent crimes, sevenfold.\n  My own staff here in Washington, DC, and I have only been here now 4 \nmonths, three of them have been burglarized, my own staff here in \nWashington, DC. This is across the country what is taking place. This \nis just a horrendous number, if you look at that.\n  Take a look at this. This one is sad, about the hopelessness of some \nof our kids in this society. Just think about the concept even of a \nteenager, somebody who is just looking at getting into life and into \nwhat should be the flowering, the spring of his or her life, committing \nsuicide; having, actually, the mental thought that I should end this \nlife. To me that is just--it is almost unthinkable, anyway; abhorrent. \nWhat has happened in our culture? These are again per 100,000. We used \nto have about 3 in 1960. We are up to nearly 12; quadrupled in a 35-\nyear time period, of teens being hopeless. How much more do they \nreflect the rest of teenagers who have thought about this and decide, \nwell, I am not willing to quite take that step? It has quadrupled in 35 \nyears, in the state of our society.\n\n  What about marriages ending in divorce? Do not hear me to say I am \nperfect or my family is perfect. We have had divorces in our family, \ntoo, just like every family in America. But look at the numbers, \nbecause they are staggering; they really are. In 1920, about 10 or 11 \npercent of marriages ended in divorce. Where are we today? Nearly 50 \npercent; nearly 50 percent. And it affects all families everywhere. It \naffects my family, too. Look at that.\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\n  What does it lead to overall? This is a chart of a Fordham University \nstudy on the culture. They have tracked the culture in America since \n1970, and they use a whole set of different factors, some of which I \nwould not consider; in others, I would add additional factors. But they \noverall said the culture, in their objective assessment, has declined \nfrom, in 1970, a 73 percent objective number to a 38 percent objective \nnumber--in half, the cultural decline in America, in a period--look at \nthe time period we are talking about here--25 years. Is this \nincredible?\n  I think on our National Day of Prayer we ought to be praying about \nthe culture. And we ought to be thinking about what we can do ourselves \nand what we can do corporately in this society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3895-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3896-S3898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are times when I listen to the \nremarks of another Senator that I realize the statement being made is \nmost significant. That was my feeling recently as I sat next to the \njunior Senator from Massachusetts. Senator John Kerry spoke to the \nnational meeting of AIPAC--The America-Israel Political Action \nCommittee--here in Washington, DC. This was a bipartisan meeting of \nAIPAC members from throughout our Nation.\n  In a strong worded presentation, Senator Kerry made an appeal for the \nUnited States to be a true friend of Israel. I, particularly, agreed \nwith my friend as he forcefully said:\n\n       As a democracy, Israel has both the burden and the glory of \n     a vigorous public square. We as Americans must be the truest \n     and best kind of ally--both forthright enough to say what we \n     think--and steadfast enough to stay the course during the \n     hard passages as well as the easy ones.\n       Herzl's famous words--``If you will it, it is no dream''--\n     signify the promise and the greatest power of Israel--and the \n     hope, after half a century, that a fair and secure peace is \n     finally within reach. For our part, we must leave here more \n     committed than ever to support Israel in the exacting, \n     essential, and sometimes tense search for that dream. I think \n     its fair to say that the ashes of Holocaust victims were \n     scattered on the wind.\n       But that wind also carries on it their prayers and \n     purpose--above mountains and sea, across hundreds or \n     thousands of miles, so that the pain of history is redeemed \n     in the land of Israel. It is a sacred place--for them, for \n     their people who live there, and for all the world. So let us \n     now resolve again that the day will never come for Israel \n     when the redemption is put at risk--when any of us would ever \n     have to repeat Schindler's cry and say: We could have done \n     more.\n\n  Mr. President, the days seem to be disappearing when a Senator \ncompliments another Senator who sits on the other side of this aisle by \nmaking the Senate aware of a significant accomplishment of a colleague. \nFor myself, I would like to restore that tradition.\n  Senator Kerry's statement was one of the best I have heard. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kerry's speech to AIPAC \nbe printed in the Record. It is one, I believe, all Members of Congress \nand many citizens of this great Nation of ours should read, \ncontemplate, and discuss.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Senator John F. Kerry--Address Before AIPAC--Washington, DC--April 7, \n                                  1997\n\n       I really want to share with you that I am honored to be \n     here tonight--and I'm privileged to stand up here tonight and \n     represent the Senate in bi-partisan fashion--because I share \n     your cause, and I also want to pay you respect for the way \n     that you fight the battle. The way that you do so literally \n     does honor to our democracy. The letters you write, the phone \n     calls you make, involvement in our campaigns, your \n     willingness to come to Washington, your commitment to, and \n     search for the truth, is the way it is supposed to be, and \n     you set an example for this country.\n       I was delighted to participate just a few days ago with \n     Steven in Boston in a Washington club event. And I think it \n     renewed in me my sense, in the intimacy and in the exchange, \n     the dialogue, that meetings like that really give a \n     continuing vitality to a fundamental truth that Israel and \n     the United States do share great ideas as well as a great \n     alliance; and security of Israel is indispensable to the \n     security of the United States of America.\n       But you know, in truth, our two nations really share \n     something much more than that, and I think you know it. As \n     Prime Minister Netanyahu stated so eloquently tonight--and \n     what a privilege it was to be able to listen to the truth \n     that he spoke this evening--Israel and the United States are \n     neither of us just a place in the land, a piece of geography; \n     both of us are founded on a shining vision of human dignity \n     and purpose.\n       The Jewish people have taught the world much about dignity \n     and purpose because they have preserved their vision through \n     two thousand years of exile and persecution. And they had to \n     outlast history's fiercest fires of hate.\n       Teresa and I watched Schindler's List as 25 million other \n     Americans did a few weeks ago. We were obviously left asking, \n     as anyone in their right mind and conscience would, why--\n     why--why? But I remembered my trip to Israel, as we all do. \n     My first visit to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem. And I will never \n     forget one sight there that stood out above all others--not \n     the documents or the photographs as stark as they are--but a \n     small child's single lonely shoe, which brought home to me \n     the incomprehensibility of the Holocaust expressed on the \n     most human of scales.\n       Again, as I watched this movie about a handful who entered \n     the Nazi hell and returned, a small remnant who proved that \n     millions did not have to perish, I thought of the words of \n     Elie Wiesel about others who could have acted to prevent, to \n     stop, to oppose this crime of the century: ``Not all were \n     guilty,'' he said, ``but all were responsible.''\n       Schindler himself was a rogue and a philistine, whose \n     transformation was heroic--but it was all too rare. Too many \n     of the God-fearing forgot God. And at the end of the movie, \n     after the Nazis have surrendered and Schindler is preparing \n     to escape, he cries that he had not done all he could have \n     done--or early enough. He could have done more--sold a watch, \n     a lapel pin, a car to secure the lives of others. And so many \n     could have done more in Germany and elsewhere--and yes, done \n     more in America, and in the highest places of power in \n     Washington.\n       And as we know--and I say we, all of us, with connections \n     of any kind with Israel--anti-semitism did not disappear with \n     the ashes of Auschwitz. Over fifty years after the end of \n     World War II, the ancient evil still stalks our time--\n     striking at Jews around the world and at the Jewish people \n     and the Jewish soul of the state of Israel. What Robert \n     Wistrich called the longest hatred continues to reach far and \n     wide. An explosion ruins a peaceful afternoon in a street \n     cafe in Tel Aviv. There are bombings in a Jewish Community \n     Center in Argentina; the rising popularity of the National \n     Front in France; the prevalence of Skinhead violence and \n     murders in Germany; the arson of Warsaw's last synagogue; the \n     anti-Jewish scape-goating and conspiracy of Louis Farrakhan \n     and the militia groups; the Nazi-like images of Jews in the \n     press in Egypt and Syria, and the blatant anti-Jewish hatred \n     of Hamas proclaiming: ``We worship God by killing Jews.''\n       These are different sins, but they are rooted in the same \n     anti-Semitic temptation. Some cannot face the truth, or the \n     twisted hates in their own soul, even today in this country, \n     or the rationalizations for the sake of political advantage \n     or profit. As the youth of Europe ask about the Holocaust and \n     challenge their parents about what they did or didn't do, the \n     legacy of collaboration and oppression still emerges from \n     under the rocks of a hidden history. We have just witnessed \n     the end of the myth of Swiss neutrality--and we are beginning \n     to look anew at what happened to the stolen property of Jews \n     in Vichy France and Peronist Argentina.\n       So the question must be asked: Would active resistance to \n     the Holocaust or the preceding anti-Semitism have made a \n     difference? I am not naive about the brutality with which the \n     Nazis often responded to dissent. But in recent years, from \n     the Philippines to Haiti to South Africa, to the former \n     Soviet union, resistance and dissent--and pressure from the \n     outside--changed the course of events. And it is no excuse \n     for citizens or the Church or other leaders of the world to \n     say that it would not have worked. For the most part, they \n     did not even try--and that is the shame of a century.\n       So the millions who watched ``Schindler's List'' must \n     contemplate, then amid the tears and heavy hearts, the deeper \n     lesson that we carry out of this blood-stained century. \n     Speaking out against injustice, acting to end bigotry, \n     raising our collective consciousness and looking honestly \n     into the unsparing heart of conscience, and standing up for \n     what is right and hopeful. This is the collective burden--the \n     collective burden and I say privilege of all of us who live \n     today. It is a collective responsibility that we must meet--\n     in our own country--and for so many of us, in the other \n     country of our hearts--the land of Israel.\n       So we need AIPAC's unwavering voice on this long and \n     winding road to peace in the Middle East. And the journey is \n     harder now than it was a year ago, harder than it was a month \n     ago, harder than it was a few weeks or days ago because we \n     must remind the world that peace is more just than a piece of \n     paper; it is the replacement of death with life, of danger \n     and violence with the laughter of children whose \n     playgrounds no longer need to be guarded with guns, Arab \n     or Israeli. Oh yes--the peace process has delivered a \n     certain amount to Israel--diplomatic, economic, and \n     political benefits--but again in a simple truth--it has \n     not delivered full or real security. It is not peace when \n     seven Israel girls are murdered at the Jordanian border. \n     It is not peace when three more innocent people are killed \n     on the eve of Purim in\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\n     Tel Aviv, with fifty more injured--among them many \n     children--cut and bleeding from broken glass and nails \n     embedded into the bomb. It is not peace when people cannot \n     get safely on a bus and arrive home to the embrace and joy \n     of family.\n       No--that is not peace--but I state emphatically--it is a \n     reason why the peace process must go on--not naively, not in \n     a rush, not on a fragile foundation--but it must go on in a \n     genuine search for real peace--and for the real security \n     which defines peace.\n       So frankly, we all have to work harder, we have to work \n     harder to make real the peaceful dreams of millions of \n     Israelis and millions of others in the world, who look to \n     part of the world for peace. And all of us cannot continue to \n     be held hostage to Hamas and Hezbollah. We must all of us \n     reject the absurd, dishonest and cruel approach--the \n     propaganda, if you will--from some Palestinians--the attempt \n     by some Arafat advisers--to equate terrorist attacks with \n     Israel's decision to construct new housing in Jerusalem, \n     however controversial that decision may be. It is one thing \n     for the Palestinians and others to hear Prime Minister \n     Netanyahu say it, but I want to say it also: Terrorism is an \n     incontrovertible evil, and an unacceptable response. The idea \n     that every bitter dispute between Israelis and the \n     Palestinians can justify Palestinian violence, or justify \n     Arafat's winking at it, or should warrant the release of yet \n     most Hamas leaders, or could excuse the PLO's failure to \n     rewrite its covenant--all this reflects a moral blindness, a \n     failure of courage that only encourages the cowards, the \n     haters and the killers. As Israel is assailed with almost \n     unrelenting fury and Prime Minister Netanyahu is all but \n     demonized by the world press, the parting cry of Schindler--I \n     could have done more--that cry ought to resonate in this \n     room. Are we speaking up enough against a one-sided \n     enforcement of the Oslo Accords? Are the supporters of Israel \n     who did not support Netanyahu now less willing to rebut \n     inaccuracies and attacks than they were when Rabin and Peres \n     were in office? Did too many people just breath a sign of \n     relief when Israel in a single day carried out the withdrawal \n     from Hebron rather than shouting their support in words, \n     letters and op-eds? Will we demand again and again that Iran, \n     Iraq, and Syria be held accountable for Hezbollah and Hamas? \n     Will we insist, over and over, that our Arab friends must \n     move forward with full diplomatic relations with Israel? Will \n     we make clear that the reinstitution of the Arab boycott of \n     Israel is not only morally repugnant but unacceptable to all \n     Americans?\n       Let me say to you with humility and respect that this all \n     must happen first of all in AIPAC--or it will not happen at \n     all. Now I know that not everyone in this room completely \n     shared the vision of Rabin or Peres about the peace process. \n     Just as I know that not everyone in this room today shares \n     the vision of Prime Minister Netanyahu. Nor is that diversity \n     of opinion here different from what is going on in Israeli \n     living rooms or in the Knesset. There is a distrust of the \n     process, of Arafat, and there is division over how to \n     proceed--or in some quarters whether to proceed at all. But \n     one thing is clear, you know and we know it, an overwhelming \n     majority of people--there and here--seek, work and pray for \n     peace--not a passing illusion--but the reality of a solid, \n     meaningful, secure and reliable peace. As Americans, we owe \n     it to our Israeli partners to stand with them so that they \n     can negotiate from greater strength--to be an ally beside \n     them, not an ally that undermines them. Israel will and \n     should choose its own leaders, its own policy, its own \n     bargaining position; and the United States cannot and should \n     not dictate the outcome.\n       Let me state it as plainly as I can: The U.N. Security \n     Council has no right to impose insecurity on Israel. \n     President Clinton was right to veto the Security Council \n     resolution on Har Homa--and the United States can and should \n     veto any other similar, one-sided measures that bring \n     discredit on nations such as France and Russia--whose own \n     anti-Semitic records now rebuke their anti-Israel votes.\n       And I also say to you that for the parties to move ahead--\n     and I believe they will--for the peace to proceed--and I \n     believe it will--AIPAC must be both vigilant and tireless. \n     Legitimate criticism of Israel should be heard, yes. But \n     malicious charges without foundation have no place in our \n     policy debates--as when a shameless Syria sought to blame \n     Israel for intra-Syrian terrorism in Damascus. Last month, on \n     national television, repeated media questions about Israel's \n     alleged failure to carry out its obligations in Hebron were \n     forcefully rebutted by the State Department's Dennis Ross. \n     But they easily could have been accepted by a less \n     knowledgeable guest. It is critical--and this is your role, \n     and ours, as we listen to you--critical that the American \n     public be kept accurately informed about the obligations of \n     Palestinians--and whether they are being fulfilled. What \n     Prime Minister Netanyahu calls lapses in reciprocity are not \n     side issues, but central ones. Such lapses wouldn't be \n     accepted in our arms reduction talks with Yeltsin, they \n     wouldn't be accepted in our trade negotiations with China. \n     How can they be ignored in the life or death arena of the \n     Middle East? Signed agreements have to mean something. They \n     build confidence. They are the road to future negotiations. \n     And broken commitments--or neglected ones--foretell other \n     betrayals to come. Both parties must be held to the same high \n     standard.\n       In each of my visits to Israel, I have had the privilege of \n     seeing first-hand the special dangers of the Middle East, and \n     of beginning to comprehend the special nature of the Middle \n     East. On one occasion I became an honorary Israeli Air Force \n     pilot when I was allowed to fly an air force jet from the \n     Ovda Airbase. I want you to know it did not come easily. I \n     was frustrated, at one of those terrible, boring luncheons \n     when you're on those journeys, and this great colonel--he \n     was an ace in the war, several times an ace--was sitting \n     next to me, and I'm a pilot and I love to fly every chance \n     I get. And I kept saying, you're sure Tel Aviv won't let \n     me go flying? And finally I persuaded him to make a last \n     phone call, and he came back to me in the middle of a \n     meal, and said to me, ``Senator, I hope you haven't eaten \n     too much. We're going flying.''\n       So I raced down to the tarmac, and they had a helmet and a \n     suit for me, and put me in the front seat. He said ``I don't \n     have time to do the run-up with you or anything, but the \n     minute we're off the ground, it's your airplane.'' And I \n     said, boy this guy is trusting. I didn't even tell him if I'd \n     ever flown a jet before. So we took off into the sky, he gave \n     me the airplane the moment we took off, and the next thing I \n     know, he says point-blank into my helmet, ``Senator, you are \n     about to go into Egypt airspace.'' So I immediately ground \n     the stick in and turned, and within a matter of minutes, this \n     United States Senator came close to violating the airspace of \n     Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. let me tell you something, I \n     learned a magical lesson: The promise of peace must be secure \n     before the promised land is secure on a thin margin of land.\n       Back on the ground on that first trip, I, like so many of \n     my colleagues, toured the beautiful country from Kibbutz \n     Mizgav Am to Masada to the Golan. I stood in the very shelter \n     in a kibbutz in the north where children were attacked and I \n     looked at launching sites and impact zones for Katousha \n     rockets. And like many visitors, I was enthralled by Tel \n     Aviv, moved by Jerusalem and inspired by standing above \n     Capernum, looking out over the Sea of Galilee, where I was \n     bold enough to read aloud the Sermon on the Mount to those \n     who were traveling with me. And I met people of stunning \n     commitment, who honestly and vigorously debated the issues as \n     I watched and listened intently. I went as a friend by \n     conviction; I returned a friend at the deepest personal level \n     with new connections, new understanding.\n       Who would have thought so much would have changed since \n     that first journey of 1986. But still the Middle East remains \n     a place of deep and disturbing contradictions. Israel's \n     oldest Arab peace partner--Egypt--has a press obsessed with \n     Nazi-like images of Jews and Israel. At the same time, a \n     Jordanian soldier murders seven Israeli school girls and \n     Jordan's King Hussein pays a personal, poignant, eloquent and \n     historic shiva call on their families.\n       Through all these contradictions let no one doubt the \n     importance of the road we are on, for the truth is that \n     Hussein's beautiful gesture to a nation all too used to \n     mourning alone is a symbol of real progress. Without Oslo, it \n     would not have happened. It's not that sympathy calls make \n     the peace process worthwhile; it's that bridges between \n     leaders and their people are being built.\n       Needless to say, there is a very long journey yet ahead of \n     us, and we must march through criticism abroad, and at home, \n     and internally, and in Israel.\n       As a soldier in Vietnam, who came home to oppose the war, I \n     must say to you that I don't see that kind of criticism as \n     being un-patriotic. For nations like Israel and America that \n     are founded on principles and not just as places, dissent can \n     be the loyalist act of all, and lively debate the living \n     proof of freedom.\n       As a democracy, Israel has both the burden and the glory of \n     a vigorous public square. We as Americans must be the truest \n     and best kind of ally--both forthright enough to say what we \n     think--and steadfast enough to stay the course during the \n     hard passages as well as the easy ones.\n       Herzl's famous words--``If you will it, it is no dream''--\n     signify the promise and the greatest power of Israel--and the \n     hope, after half a century, that a fair and secure peace is \n     finally within reach. For our part, we must leave here more \n     committed than ever to support Israel in the exacting, \n     essential, and sometimes tense search for that dream. I think \n     it's fair to say that the ashes of Holocaust victims were \n     scattered on the wind. But that wind also carries on it their \n     prayers and purpose--above mountains and sea, across hundreds \n     or thousands of miles, so that the pain of history is \n     redeemed in the land of Israel. It is a sacred place--for \n     them, for their people who live there, and for all the world. \n     So let us now resolve again that the day will never come for \n     Israel when the redemption is put at risk--when any of us \n     would ever have to repeat Schindler's cry and say: We could \n     have done more.\n       I might say to you on a personal note that that imperative \n     has been clear since long before the Holocaust. I learned it \n     and I learned how long it has endured in an emotional moment \n     on top of Masada, when I stood on that great plateau where \n     the oath of new soldiers used to be sworn against the desert \n     backdrop and the test of history. I spent several hours with \n     my guide and friend Yadin Roman. On top, we argued, we \n     debated, at his insistence whether or not in fact Josephus \n     Flavius was correct in his account of the siege--whether \n     these really were the last Jews fighting for\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\n     survival--whether they had escaped since no remains were ever \n     found. And we journeyed back and forth through the \n     possibilities and finally, after our journey through \n     history--which we resolved with a vote in favor of history as \n     recorded--Yadin motioned to me and said come over here and \n     stand with those that we were travelling with, and we stood \n     at the edge of the chasm looking out across the desert, \n     across to the mountains at the other side. And we stood as a \n     group, and altogether, at his command, we shouted across the \n     chasm--across the desert--across the silence--Am Yisrael \n     Chai. And back a slow, echoing voice speaking to us through \n     history came the word Am, Yisrael Chai. Israel lives. The \n     State lives. The people of Israel live. And that is the cause \n     of America, it is the cause of people of conscience all \n     across this planet, and that is why I am proud to be here \n     with you tonight.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I think our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives deserve a great deal of praise for what they did \nyesterday. They passed a bill that would save the lives of many gravely \nthreatened young people in this country. I am referring, of course, to \nthe Adoption Promotion Act of 1997, the Camp-Kennelly legislation, \nwhich passed the House by an overwhelming vote of 416 to 5.\n  For the children in foster care in this country, the average time \nthey spend in foster care is almost 2 years. That is just the average \ntime. These 2 years are often the most important time in that child's \ndevelopment. We need to do everything we can to get these children in \nsafe, stable, permanent, loving adoptive homes.\n  Why are these children being kept in foster care for so long? I said \nthe average time was 2 years. Sometimes it is 3, 4, 5 years. Sometimes \nthe most important years of their lives are spent in foster care, and \nsometimes they move from foster home to foster home to foster home. Why \ndo they get shoved from one home to another? Why do they spend so many \nyears in foster care? One reason is that, in some of these cases, the \nchild protective services feel hemmed in by a misinterpretation of a \nFederal law, a well-intentioned Federal law that this Congress passed \nin 1980, a law that has done a great deal of good, but a law that \ncontains one provision that I believe has caused a great deal of harm \nand has caused a great deal of confusion.\n  Under this 1980 law, the Federal Child Welfare Act, for a State to be \neligible for Federal matching funds for foster care expenditures, that \nState must have a plan for the provision of child welfare services \napproved by the Secretary of HHS. The State plan must provide, that in \neach case, reasonable efforts will be made, first, prior to the \nplacement of a child in foster care to prevent or eliminate the need \nfor removal of a child from his home and, second, to make it possible \nfor the child to return to his home.\n  In other words, Mr. President, no matter what the particular \ncircumstances of a household may be, the State must make reasonable \nefforts to keep that household, that family together, and then to put \nit back together if it falls apart.\n  There is very strong evidence, evidence that I have seen firsthand as \nI have traveled the State of Ohio and talked to people who are \nprofessionals in this field, talked to judges, talked to child services \nworkers, very strong evidence that reasonable efforts have, in some \ncases, become extraordinary efforts, efforts to keep families together \nat all costs, efforts to keep families together that are families \nreally in name only. This has resulted in children being put back in \nabusive homes, put back in situations where no child should have to \nexist or live.\n  Every day in this country, three children die of abuse or neglect. \nChildren who are being abused by their parents should simply not be \nreunified with those parents. That is common sense. The legislation \npassed yesterday by the House of Representatives makes it clear, by an \noverwhelming vote, that this is what the House thinks.\n  Now is the time for the Senate to take action. We have a very good \npiece of legislation, the Chafee-Rockefeller bill, of which I am \nhonored to be a cosponsor, that has been introduced in this body. It is \na piece of legislation that contains many good provisions. One of the \nprovisions it contains is identical language to what the House passed \nyesterday to simply say what we all know in our heart was intended by \nthe 1980 act, and that is, yes, we should make reasonable efforts to \nput families back together, we should try to help them, but--but--when \nthose decisions are made at the local, county level or city level, the \npeople who make those decisions must always put safety and the welfare \nof that child first. The safety of the child must always be paramount. \nThat is good common sense; it is good legislation.\n  We are halfway there. Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to complete \nthe action and send that bill on to the President. The President has \nalready said that he supports this language, that he supports this \nconcept, that there is, in fact, a problem. The Senate should act very \nquickly and move on this legislation and really plug this loophole, \nwhich has caused a great deal of pain and many problems for our young \npeople in this country today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

Mr. President, May 1 is a special day in the United \nStates of America. It has been designated and observed as a national \nday of prayer. Citizens across the country--having recognized that \nthose of us in positions of responsibility need the kind of wisdom to \nallow us to make good decisions--have today been observing this \nNational Day of Prayer in our behalf. I rise to thank them.\n  Abraham Lincoln, in the midst of the crisis that perhaps did more to \nthreaten this country and at the same time, more to unify it than any \nother crisis in history, continued to have a strong commitment and \ndedication to the concept of prayer when he called upon the Nation to \nreserve a time for repentance, for introspection, and for prayer.\n  This Nation has survived great challenges--yet still faces great \nchallenges. I believe that its success in the face of challenge in \nlarge measure is due to the fact that people have prayed.\n  A couple thousand years ago, when the Apostle Paul was writing a \nletter to his friend Timothy, he advised Timothy to say, ``Pray for \neach other and pray especially for those who are in authority that we \nmay lead quiet and peaceable lives in all Godliness and honesty.''\n  I think that was good advice 2,000 years ago, and it is good advice \ntoday.\n  I rise today, as we close this day in the U.S. Senate, to say to \nthose Americans who have been a part of this observance, referred to as \nthe ``National Day of Prayer,'' thank you for your prayers and, as a \nmatter of fact, I think all America owes a debt of gratitude to those \nwho have carried the well-being and welfare of this country to God in \nprayer on a regular basis. It is with that in mind that I believe the \nNational Day of Prayer is a strong symbol that we have prayer all \nyear--on a continuing basis so that we might do things that advance the \nvery cause for which I think God sent his Son to the world--that we \nmight live life and live it more abundantly. That is the true position \nof Government, that we would create conditions under which people could \nlive and live in greater abundance and greater freedom.\n  So I take this moment to reflect upon those who have cared enough to \npray for us and to extend to them my appreciation for what they have \ndone in our behalf.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3898-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3898-S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSION OF GRATITUDE FOR PATTY MCNALLY, EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT PROTOCOL \n                                OFFICER\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, this Saturday, May 3, marks the 50th \nanniversary of sculptor Korczak Ziolkowski's arrival in the Black Hills \nto accept the invitation of the Lakota to create a memorial to honor \nthe great warrior and chieftain, Crazy Horse. Carving this great \nmonument in the mountain became his life's work, and indeed, the life's \nwork of generations of his family.\n  He was joined at Thunderhead Mountain by Ruth Ross on June 21, 1947, \nwho is now a dear friend of mine. The two married 3 years later, and \ntogether they made a life raising their 10 children and slowly shaping \nthe mountain into the form of Crazy Horse, sitting atop his steed with \nhis arm outstretched toward the homelands of the Lakota. Its scale is \ndifficult to comprehend. His face alone is so large that all four faces \ncarved on Mount Rushmore could fit on its expanse. When it is finished, \nthe sculpture will be taller than both the Washington Monument and the \nGreat Pyramids. These figures are made all the more remarkable by the \nfact that all of the work at the memorial is privately financed, with \nno support from Government funds. Although Korczak died in 1982, Ruth \nand the children have proudly carried on with this vision.\n  No less remarkable is the extraordinary effort made by the Ziolkowski \nfamily to educate thousands about the lives of Crazy Horse and the \nLakota people, and to improve the lives of Native Americans around the \ncountry. Through the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation, the family \noversees a cultural and educational center offering college courses, a \nresearch library, the Indian Museum of North America and educational \noutreach programs. In addition, the Crazy Horse Memorial Native \nAmerican Scholarship Program has already awarded a total of $175,000 in \neducational grants. Ultimately, the family hopes to fulfill Korczak's \ndream of opening a university and medical center on these grounds.\n  Korczak liked to call himself a ``storyteller in stone,'' and \nbelieved that the monument was a noble offering to a man who led his \npeople in battle at Little Bighorn and died before surrendering himself \nto a white man's prison. I commend Ruth and all the Ziolkowski family \nin their 50th year of fulfilling this vision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3899-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, next week Dr. Paul Kaminski will step down \nafter an extraordinary 3-year tenure as Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition. In this short period of time, Dr. Kaminski and his \nacquisition team at the Pentagon have made dramatic steps to turn our \nprocurement culture around, making it more flexible, more creative, and \nsmarter.\n  Under Dr. Kaminski's leadership, the Department of Defense has \nsuccessfully implemented three major pieces of acquisition reform \nlegislation: Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, the Federal \nAcquisition Reform Act, and the Information Technology Management \nReform Act. Those of us who worked hard to enact this legislation \nappreciate the energy that Dr. Kaminski and others have dedicated to \nputting it into practice.\n  But the turnaround in the procurement culture has required far more \nthan the implementation of new laws. Dr. Kaminski and his team have \nplaced the Department of Defense at the forefront of acquisition reform \nby doing the hard work to revise and simplify thousands of military \nspecifications, to implement streamlined management practices through \nintegrated process teams and the single process initiative, and to make \nacquisition reform work where the rubber meets the road in tens of \nthousands of individual contracts awarded every year.\n  Under Dr. Kaminski's leadership, the Department of Defense has \nsubstantially reduced acquisition lead times, reduced the layers of \nredtape that have often burdened the acquisition system, accelerated \nthe process of incorporating emerging commercial technologies into \nweapons systems, and simplified the small purchases through the use of \nthe IMPAC credit card. Most impressive of all, Dr. Kaminski has \nachieved all of this while skillfully managing a steep reduction in the \nsize of the acquisition work force--the career professionals who have \nborne the brunt of implementing the new acquisition system.\n  The Congress and the Nation owe Dr. Kaminski a debt of gratitude for \nhis selfless service to the interests of the taxpayer and the national \ndefense. I know my colleagues join me in wishing Paul all the best in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3899-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 867.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe application of the passive loss limitations to equine activities; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the equine tax fairness act of 1997\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code to modify application of passive loss \nlimitations to horse activities.\n  This week the eyes of the sporting world are focused on the 123d \nrunning of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, KY. \nWhile it is considered one of the greatest sporting events in the \nworld, the Kentucky Derby is part of a much larger and broader horse \nindustry--one that has a $112 billion economic impact in the United \nStates and supports 1.4 million jobs.\n  Whether it is owning, breeding, racing, or showing horses--or simply \nenjoying an afternoon ride along the trail--1 of 35 Americans is \ntouched by the horse industry. There are 6.9 million horses in the U.S. \ninvolving more than 7.1 million Americans as horse owners, service \nproviders, employees and volunteers. In Kentucky alone, the horse \nindustry has an impact of $3.4 billion, involving 150,000 horses and \n52,900 employees.\n  What supports the industry--including the job base, the breeding \nfarms, and the revenue stream in the form of $1.9 billion in taxes to \nall levels of government--is the investment in the horses themselves. \nThe horse industry relies on outside investment to operate, just as \nother businesses do. Without others willing to buy and breed horses, \nthe 1.4 million jobs supported by this industry are at stake.\n  Since the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the horse industry has experienced \na near-devastating decline with job losses occurring at racetracks, \nhorse farms, and industry suppliers. In addition, hundreds of breeding \nfarms have gone out of business. Most horse owners and breeders believe \nthat the limits on passive losses are a major reason for the decline as \nwell as for the chilled interest of investors in horses. Since the mid-\n1980's, the number of horses bred and registered has decreased--leading \nto losses in jobs and revenues for the States.\n  The 1986 act indicates that in order to satisfy the material \nparticipation requirement, a person's involvement must be regular, \ncontinuous, and substantial. However, the horse industry is unique, and \nthe passive loss rules are difficult for some to satisfy. Because of \nthe expertise and physical ability that is required, many owners cannot \nride, train, breed and show their horses.\n  The bill I introduce today will alter these requirements to make them \nfair, workable, and enforceable. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 675\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equine Tax Fairness Act of \n     1997''.\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\n     SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF PASSIVE LOSS LIMITATIONS TO EQUINE \n                   ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Determination of Material Participation.--Subsection \n     (h) of section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (defining material participation) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(6) Treatment of equine activities.--\n       ``(A) In general.--A taxpayer shall be treated as \n     materially participating in an equine activity for a taxable \n     year if--\n       ``(i) the taxpayer's participation in such activity for \n     such year constitutes substantially all of the participation \n     in the activity of all individuals for such year, other than \n     individuals--\n       ``(I) who are not owners of interest in the activity,\n       ``(II) who are retained and compensated directly by the \n     taxpayer, and\n       ``(III) whose activities are subject to the oversight, \n     supervision, and control of the taxpayer, or\n       ``(ii) based on all of the facts and circumstances, the \n     taxpayer participates in the activity on a regular, \n     continuous, and substantial basis during such year, except \n     that for purposes of this clause--\n       ``(I) the taxpayer shall not be required to participate in \n     the activity for any minimum period of time during such year, \n     and\n       ``(II) the performance of services by individuals who are \n     not owners of interests in the activity shall not be \n     considered if such services are routinely provided by \n     individuals specializing in such services and such services \n     are subject to the oversight, supervision, and control of the \n     taxpayer.\n       ``(B) Partners and s corporation shareholders.--Subject to \n     paragraph (2), the determination of whether a partner or S \n     corporation shareholder shall be treated as materially \n     participating in any equine activity of the partnership or S \n     corporation shall be based upon the combined participation of \n     all of the partners or shareholders in the activity.\n       ``(C) Equine activity.--For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     term `equine activity' means breeding, racing, or showing \n     horses.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the amendments made by \n     section 501 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 676. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe standard mileage rate deduction for charitable use of passenger \nautomobiles; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the charitable equity mileage act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the past week, we have heard a great \ndeal of discussion regarding voluntarism in America. In Philadelphia, \nPresident Clinton has been joined by former President Bush and former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, in what has been \nstyled a voluntarism summit.\n  On the floor of the Senate, we have been attempting to move \nlegislation, which I believe should not be controversial, that would \nprotect volunteers from fear of legal actions resulting from their \nefforts. I would hope that the impasse over this bill could be broken \nand we could move forward on this important bill.\n  In the spirit of encouraging more volunteer efforts in America, I am \ntoday introducing the Charitable Equity Mileage Act of 1997. This bill \nwill increase the standard mileage rate deduction for charitable use of \nan automobile from 12 cents a mile to 18 cents a mile. I think this \nbill should be unanimously supported by my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. President, many of our citizens who volunteer for charitable \nactivities incur expenses for which they are not reimbursed. For \nexample, when an individual uses his or her automobile to deliver a \nmeal to a homebound elderly individual, or to transport children to \nScouting activities, the volunteer usually pays the transportation cost \nout of pocket with no expectation of reimbursement.\n  I believe the costs associated with charitable transportation \nservices ought to be deductible at a rate which fairly reflects the \nindividual's actual costs. This is especially important for volunteers \nliving in rural States who have to travel long distances to provide \ncommunity services.\n  Congress in 1984 set the standard mileage expense deduction rate of \n12 cents per mile for individuals who use their automobiles in \nconnection with charitable activities. At the time, the standard \nmileage rate for business use of an automobile was 20.5 cents per mile. \nIn the intervening 13 years, the business mileage rate has increased to \n30.5 cents per mile but the charitable mileage rate has remained \nunchanged at 12 cents per mile because Treasury does not have the \nauthority to adjust the rate.\n  By raising the charitable mileage rate to 18 cents a mile, my \nlegislation restores the ratio that existed in 1984 between the \ncharitable mileage rate and the business mileage rate. In addition, the \nlegislation authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the \ncharitable mileage rate in the same manner as is currently allowed for \nbusiness mileage expenses.\n  All of us agree that with the changing role of the Federal \nGovernment, we need to do more to encourage voluntarism in our country. \nVolunteers who provide transport services should be allowed to deduct \nsuch costs at a rate which fairly reflects their true out-of-pocket \ncosts. That is precisely what this bill does and I urge my colleagues \nto join with me in sponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter of support for my bill from the \nAmerican Legion and I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

INCREASE IN STANDARD MILEAGE RATE EXPENSE DEDUCTION \n                   FOR CHARITABLE USE OF PASSENGER AUTOMOBILE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 170(i) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to standard mileage rate for use of \n     passenger automobile) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Standard Mileage Rate for Use of Passenger \n     Automobile.--\n       ``(1) General rule.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     for purposes of computing the deduction under this section \n     for use of a passenger automobile, the standard mileage rate \n     shall be 18 cents per mile.\n       ``(2) Taxable years beginning after 1998.--Not later than \n     December 15 of 1998, and each subsequent calendar year, the \n     Secretary may prescribe an increase in the standard mileage \n     rate allowed under this subsection with respect to taxable \n     years beginning in the succeeding calendar year if the \n     Secretary determines that such increase is necessary to \n     reflect increased costs in the use of passenger \n     automobiles.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1996.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: The American Legion fully supports \n     the ``Charitable Travel Equity Act of 1997,'' to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the standard \n     mileage rate deduction for charitable use of passenger \n     automobiles.\n       Not only does The American Legion applaud the increase in \n     the mileage rate deduction, but more importantly this measure \n     fixes the problem that has not allowed for incremental \n     increases without an act of Congress action. The standard \n     mileage rate deduction for business use of passenger \n     automobiles has increased significantly while no adjustments \n     were made in the charitable use rate. Granting the Secretary \n     the authority to make prescribed adjustments will provide \n     fairness and promote additional volunteerism.\n       Thank you for your continuous leadership on behalf of \n     America's veterans and their dependents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Steve Robertson,\n                        Director, National Legislative Commission.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN:\n  S. 677. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1994, \nto provide the descendants of the children of female U.S. citizens born \nabroad before May 24, 1934, with the same rights to U.S. citizenship at \nbirth as the descendants of children born of male citizens abroad; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         THE EQUITY IN TRANSMISSION OF CITIZENSHIP ACT of 1997\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that \nwill amend legislation written by my former colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, and enacted into law. \nThree years ago, Senator Simon was the leader in enacting the \nImmigration and Nationality and Technical Corrections Act of 1994. My \nbill seeks to add a further correction to the Immigration and \nNationality Act, so that the spirit and intent of Senator Simon's work \nis enacted into law.\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\n  Prior to 1934, a child born overseas to a U.S. father and a foreign \nmother was recognized by the United States as a U.S. citizen. However, \na child born overseas to a U.S. mother and a foreign father was \nconsidered to be a foreign national, not a U.S. citizen. Effectively, \ntherefore, before 1994, U.S. fathers could pass on their citizenship to \nchildren born overseas, but U.S. mothers could not. Senator Simon \nsought to remedy this gender inequality by automatically granting U.S. \ncitizenship to those individuals born overseas to U.S. mothers before \n1934. Under his legislation, the Immigration and Nationality and \nTechnical Corrections Act of 1994, the children of American mothers and \nforeign fathers became U.S. citizens.\n  His legislation also contained language to address the third \ngeneration--the children of these children. It is likely that the \ngrandchildren of the U.S. mothers and foreign fathers would have been \nU.S. citizens had their children been U.S. citizens. Therefore, the \n1994 law also granted U.S. citizenship to these grandchildren.\n  This provision granting citizenship to the grandchildren, however, \ncontradicted another section of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n[INA]. INA states that in order to transmit U.S. citizenship from a \nparent to a child born overseas, the parent must have lived in the \nUnited States for 10 years. A U.S. citizen who has a child overseas \nneeds to have lived in the United States over a 10-year period to pass \non U.S. citizenship to his or her children. This transmission \nrequirement is gender neutral, and applies to all U.S. citizens who \nhave children overseas.\n  Senator Simon's law did not specifically waive this transmission \nrequirement for the third generation, although the language of the bill \nclearly stated that it intended to grant citizenship to the \ngrandchildren of the American mothers. The lawyers at INS have \nconcluded that the transmission requirement must be met in order to \npass citizenship onto the grandchildren of the American mothers and \nforeign fathers. In other words, INS is requiring the third generation \nto show that the second generation lived in the United States for 10 \nyears in order to pass citizenship to the third generation.\n  This is impossible given that the second generation was never allowed \nto live in the United States because they were not citizens until 1994. \nThus the provision of the 1994 law granting citizenship to these \ngrandchildren was never implemented.\n  The purpose of my bill is to waive the transmission requirement for \nthe grandchildren of the American mothers and foreign fathers. The \nthird generation will not have to show that the second generation lived \nin the United States for 10 years. They will be granted citizenship \neven though their parents did not live in the United States for 10 \nyears. This bill will help a small number of people who should have \nbeen U.S. citizens by birth. It will ensure that the spirit of Senator \nSimon's legislation is enacted into law. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 677\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equity in Transmission of \n     Citizenship Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) since the children born abroad to United States citizen \n     mothers before May 24, 1934, only became entitled to claim \n     United States citizenship, acquired at birth, as of October \n     25, 1994, with the enactment of Public Law 103-416, they were \n     not legally admissible into the United States as citizens \n     prior to that date; and\n       (2) therefore, they could not meet the residency \n     requirements to transmit United States citizenship onto their \n     children as the children of male United States citizens \n     could.\n\n     SEC. 3. EQUAL TREATMENT OF CHILDREN BORN ABROAD OF FEMALE \n                   UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN CONFERRING \n                   CITIZENSHIP TO CHILDREN BORN ABROAD.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 101 of Public Law 103-416 is \n     amended by amending subsection (d) to read as follows:\n       ``(d) Waiver of Transmission Requirements.--The parental \n     physical presence requirement contained in section 301(g) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act shall not apply to any \n     person born before the date of enactment of this Act who \n     claims United States citizenship based on such person's \n     descent from an individual described in section 301(h) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall be deemed to have become effective as of October 25, \n     1994.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 678. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ncircuit and district judges, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   the federal judgeship act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. In that regard, today being Law Day I think we should \nhonor the Federal judiciary. We have a political climate where many of \nmy colleagues bash the Federal judiciary on a daily basis and propose \nlegislation that threatens a time-honored independence of the Federal \njudiciary. I think our Nation's judges deserve our respect, admiration, \nand support--not our disdain, scorn, and antipathy. Anywhere you go in \nthe world you will find that one of the things that stands out, one of \nthe things admired most about the United States, is the independence of \nour Federal judiciary.\n  For the past 200 years, they protected the freedoms and fundamental \nrights we all take for granted. You could ask, where would our \ncherished rights like first amendment-protected free speech and the \nright of religious freedom be without the Federal courts? It is ironic \nthat the right of free speech that the Federal judiciary bashers take \nfor granted in the war against judges has been protected time and time \nagain by those very same judges.\n  It is our independent judiciary that handed down landmark decisions \nlike Brown versus Board of Education. Without our independent \njudiciary, how long would African-American children have to suffer \ndeplorable conditions in substandard schools? I remember after Brown \nversus Board of Education, we had the bumper stickers and billboards, \n``Impeach Earl Warren,'' and ``Impeach the Supreme Court.'' Well, only \nbecause they were politically independent could they hand down a \ndecision so unpopular at the time, but so recognized today universally \nas the right decision. I shudder to think where we would be today with \nFederal judges who are tied to the political whims of the moment. We \nshould talk about where the country would be without independent \nFederal judges.\n  The nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United States has proposed \nchanges in the makeup of our courts. It has been 7 years since Congress \nlast seriously reexamined the caseload of the Federal judiciary.\n  Mr. President, our judges do an admirable job under tough conditions. \nThey endure constant criticism and heavy caseloads. Contrary to what \nsome of my Republican colleagues have stated, there is a need for more \nFederal judges.\n  The Judicial Conference of the United States, the nonpartisan \npolicymaking arm of the judicial branch, believes that the continuing \nheavy caseload of our courts of appeals and district courts merit \nadditional judges. Overworked judges and heavy caseloads slow down the \njudicial process, and as we all know, justice delayed is justice \ndenied. Mr. President, we must act now.\n  Mr. President, on Law Day, a day to commemorate our Nation's legal \nsystem and the freedoms it is designed to protect, I introduce the \nFederal Judgeship Act of 1997. This legislation, identical to the \nrecommendations of the nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the United \nStates, would create 12 additional permanent judgeships and five \ntemporary judgeships for the U.S. Court of Appeals; and 24 additional \npermanent judgeships and 12 temporary judgeships for the U.S. district \ncourts.\n  In 1984, Congress passed a bill to address the need for additional \njudgeships. Six years later, in 1990, Congress again fulfilled its \nconstitutional responsibility and enacted the Federal Judgeship Act of \n1990 because of a sharply increasing caseload, particularly for drug-\nrelated crimes.\n  It is now 7 years since Congress last seriously reexamined the \ncaseload of the Federal judiciary and the need for more Federal judges. \nLet us act now.\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\n Let us fulfill our constitutional responsibilities. Let us ensure that \njustice is not delayed or denied for anyone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 679. A bill for the relief of Ching-hsun and Ching-jou Sun; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a private \nrelief bill that is based on careful reflection and a sincere desire to \nhelp a family of importance to me and my State of West Virginia.\n  This is an effort to assist an individual named Jack Sun who is a \nprominent international businessman and multinational manager with \npermanent residence status in the United States. Mr. Sun sought and \nobtained permanent residence in the United States to enable him to \npursue economic business and ties between his native Taiwan and the \nUnited States.\n  Of great significance to West Virginia, in his capacity as Chairman \nof Taiwan Aerospace Corp., Jack Sun has been instrumental in forging a \nTaiwan/United States joint venture named Sino Swearingen, Inc., that \nwill build state-of-the-art business jets in my home State of West \nVirginia. Taiwan Aerospace Corp., and its Taiwanese coinvestors have to \ndate committed an amount in excess of $150 million to finance this \njoint venture. Sino Swearingen, Inc., is expected to employ around 800 \npeople at this West Virginia site when it becomes fully operational.\n  As someone who knows Jack Sun personally and has worked closely with \nhim to pursue this new investment and jobs opportunity for West \nVirginia, I know him to be an honorable individual. He is an \ninternationally respected business leader, well known to the American \nbusiness community. Jack Sun has worked extremely hard to develop and \nmaintain strong personal and business ties in the United States. In \naddition to his business activities, Jack Sun is active in the cultural \nand academic life of both Taiwan and the United States. He also sits on \nthe University of Southern California School of Business \nAdministration's CEO board of advisors.\n  Jack Sun, in his capacity as president of Pacific Electric Wire & \nCable Co., Ltd, has, over the past 10 years, directed significant \ninvestments into the United States and has created thousands of jobs \nfor Americans. Mr. Sun is the president of Pacific USA Holdings Corp. \nheadquartered in Dallas, TX. Pacific USA Holdings Corp. is a \ndiversified holding company whose business activities encompass \ncommercial banking, home building, mortgage and investment banking, \nproperty development, insurance and technology services, to name but a \nfew. Pacific USA Holdings Corp. and its subsidiaries now employ more \nthan 2,000 U.S. workers.\n  Jack Sun also serves as director of the Iridium project which is an \ninternational alliance sponsored by Motorola, Inc., whose purpose is to \ncreate a global network of telecommunications systems through the use \nof low-orbiting satellites.\n\n  The purpose of this private bill is to attempt to assist Jack Sun in \nexpediting the completion of the permanent residence process that is \nwell underway through conventional procedures for his two youngest \nchildren, Ching-Jou Sun, age 8, and Ching-Hsun Sun, age 6. Jack Sun's \nthree eldest children received their permanent residence status on \nApril 28, 1992.\n  Regarding this bill, in July, 1995, a petition for alien relative was \nfiled on behalf of ching-jou and Ching-Hsun Sun. The Immigration and \nNaturalization Service approved the petitions on January 30, 1996. Upon \napproval of the petitions, the children were assigned a priority date \nof July 26, 1995.\n  However, Jack Sun and his attorney have been informed by the \nDepartment of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, that in the \npreference category for which Ching-Jou and Ching-Hsun Sun have been \napproved, the number of people approved for issuance of visas far \nexceeds the number of visas currently available for actual issuance. \nConsequently, the children have been assigned a priority date that is a \nplace on the waiting list. The National Visa Center states that based \nupon the current conditions and backlog, the priority date held by \nChing-Jou and Ching-Hsun Sun will not be reached for more than 4 years.\n  Ching-Jou and Ching-Hsun Sun are now in the process of waiting for \ntheir green cards which would enable them to live and go to school in \nthe United States with their sisters and brother. To add to the \nproblem, during this waiting period, the children cannot even travel \nwith their father and family in the United States. The children cannot \nobtain even a visitor's visa because they have already indicated their \nimmigration intent.\n  Although the petitions were approved on behalf of Ching-Hsun Sun and \nChing-Jou Sun, the prolonged continuation of the waiting period has \ncreated personal hardships for Jack Sun, and his family. Jack Sun's \nthree oldest children permanently reside in Pasadena, CA. The two \noldest daughters presently attend the University of Southern \nCalifornia. Jack Sun simply would like his family to be together as \nmuch as possible. This means he wishes to be able to travel with his \nchildren to the United States, and to unify his family. Under the \npresent circumstances, the family is split, three children holding \npermanent residence status and living in the United States, while the \ntwo youngest children have to remain in Taiwan during this prolonged \nwaiting period and the potential 6 year delay before achieving visas \nfor permanent residence status.\n  This forced separation creates a particular hardship because of the \nages of the children. The children are not permitted to travel with \ntheir father and are separated from their father and siblings for years \nto come. Jack Sun frequently and extensively travels to the United \nStates to oversee his business operations.\n\n  There is simply no further administrative procedure to use to resolve \nthis situation for the Sun family and these two children. They are \nconfronted with an extraordinarily long delay waiting for visas already \napproved to actually become available. No administrative remedy exists \nto cure this situation. No further relief is available from the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service or any other agency. The \nrelevant administrative agencies, including the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and the National Visa Center at the State \nDepartment, have informed Jack Sun and his attorney that there is no \nadministrative vehicle to expedite conclusion of the permanent \nresidence process.\n  Therefore, I have decided to seek a legislative remedy for Jack Sun's \nfamily. After carrying out all the steps needed to obtain approval for \nresident status, they face a 6-year waiting period that now condemns a \nfather and children to prolonged periods of separation.\n  Because of my respect for Jack Sun and deep appreciation for the role \nhe has played in locating a major new source of jobs and opportunity \nfor West Virginians, I am asking Congress to take the legislative \naction required to relieve a family of undue hardship and separation \nsolely resulting from the grim reality that two children would \notherwise have to wait 6 years to get visas they already have been \napproved for. I believe this is just the example of an extraordinary \npersonal situation that merits congressional assistance and action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal building and U.S. courthouse \nlocated at 300 Northeast First Avenue in Miami, FL, as the ``David W. \nDyer Federal Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n              david w. dyer federal courthouse legislation\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I have the distinct pleasure to \nintroduce legislation that would redesignate the Old Federal Courthouse \nin Miami, FL, the ``David W. Dyer Federal Courthouse.''\n  Residing behind the bench for over 30 years, Judge Dyer distinguished \nhimself as one of the finest jurists in the State of Florida, and his \ncommitment to public service dates back to his service in the U.S. Army \nduring World War II.\n  In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the District \nCourt for the Southern District of Florida. At the time the Southern \nDistrict included Tampa, Jacksonville, and Miami. The following year \nthe district was pared down and he became the initial chief judge of \nthe reconfigured Southern District. Judge Dyer would continue to serve \nin this capacity for the next 4 years.\n  President Lyndon Johnson then appointed him to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1966. This marked the first time that \nanyone from Miami had been honored with the opportunity to serve on the \ncourt of appeals. In 1977, Judge Dyer rose to the position of senior \njudge for the fifth circuit and carried this status over into the \nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  During the turbulent 1960's, Judge Dyer participated in a number of \ncivil rights cases. This period was an era when the Federal courts were \ncalled to implement the constitutional ideal of equal justice under the \nlaw for all Americans. It was a proud time in our legal history and \nJudge Dyer is part of that legacy. In one such case, he was responsible \nfor the desegregation of the restaurants on the Florida Turnpike.\n  Judge Dyer served his community in a variety of other capacities. He \nis a former member of the board of governors and executive committee of \nthe Florida Bar, as well as the board of governors of the Maritime Law \nAssociation. He also served as president of the Dade County Bar, the \nlargest in Florida.\n  Judge Dyer has been an inspirational model for two generations of \nlawyers. He has shown through his example what integrity of character, \nsound judgment, and courage of conviction can achieve in implementing \nour highest ideals.\n  Mr. President, Judge Dyer spent much of his life working out of the \nOld Federal Courthouse in Miami. Passage of this legislation to \nredesignate the building in Judge Dyer's name would be a small, but \nfitting token of appreciation that America and its judicial system owe \nJudge Dyer for his years of distinguished service. I urge my colleagues \nto support me in enacting this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Ford):\n  S. 682. A bill to amend title 32, United States Code, to make \navailable not less than $200,000,000 each fiscal year for funding of \nactivities under National Guard drug interdiction and counterdrug \nactivities plans; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n       NATIONAL GUARD COUNTERDRUG STATE PLAN PROGRAM LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the National Guard has a history of superb \nperformance in supporting the needs of law enforcement agencies and \ncommunity antidrug coalitions. Every day the National Guard has nearly \n4,000 soldiers and airmen on full-time counter drug duty. Three-hundred \nand seventy-three in support of the Drug Enforcement Agency [DEA], 625 \nin support of U.S. Customs, and 3,000 more in support of local, State, \nand Federal law enforcement agencies in every State in the Nation.\n  Unfortunately, for the last 5 years, this successful program has been \non a budget rollercoaster. For example, funding for the fiscal year \n1998 National Guard Counterdrug State plans program will result in a \n42-percent cut in the amount actually available to State plans from the \nfiscal year 1997 level. It is tough to maintain program consistency \nwhen the funding level fluctuates each year. Legislation I am \nintroducing today, along with Senator Ford, the co-chairman of the \nNational Guard Caucus, will stabilize funding for the National Guard \nCounterdrug State plans program at no less than $200 million each \nfiscal year.\n  Iowa law enforcement, as well as law enforcement across the United \nStates, relies heavily on the help of the National Guard in their drug \nfighting efforts. The National Guard provides personnel and equipment \nto local law enforcement agencies. Guard men and women assist with \nanalytical and technical support so that criminal investigators can be \nout on the street. The Iowa High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \n[HIDTA] task force plans to utilize National Guard support as part of \ntheir efforts to fight methamphetamine trafficking in Iowa. Guard men \nand women also work in partnership with the Community Anti-drug \nCoalition of America and expect to reach 10 million young people in the \ncountry to help educate and motivate them to reject the use of illegal \ndrugs.\n  As we face unprecedented drug problems in Iowa and across the Nation, \nit is necessary to maintain consistent funding for the drug fighting \nefforts of the National Guard. Not only does the National Guard \nCounterdrug Program free up criminal investigators to fight crime on \nthe streets, it provides an avenue for cooperation that makes \nenforcement more efficient as well. This program traditionally enjoys \nbipartisan support and affects law enforcement all across the United \nStates. I encourage my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 683. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the bicentennial of the Library of Congress; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n     the library of congress bicentennial commemorative act of 1997\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould authorize the minting of silver $1 coins and gold $5 coins in \ncommemoration of the bicentennial of the Library of Congress. The year \n2000 will mark this important event for the Congress and the Nation. \nOver the past two centuries, the U.S. Congress has built its library \ninto America's library and the greatest repository of recorded \nknowledge and creativity in the history of the World.\n  Proceeds from the coin will help the library support bicentennial \nprograms, educational outreach, and other activities including programs \nwith schools and libraries across the Nation.\n  The Library of Congress' bicentennial merits a U.S. commemorative \ncoin. The library is an institution that has an enduring effect on the \nNation's culture and history. As vice chairman of the Joint Committee \non the Library, I am pleased to offer this legislation and I welcome \nand encourage my colleagues to join as cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Grams, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 684. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to provide assistance to local educational \nagencies in cases of certain disasters, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                      disaster relief legislation\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, last week on several occasions I spoke \nabout the devastating impact of the floods along the Red River Valley \non the residents of the communities in North Dakota, South Dakota, and \nMinnesota.\n  I note that the current occupant of the chair sent me a very gracious \nnote about the fact that he has relatives in North Dakota. I want to \nacknowledge his offer to help, which we appreciate very much.\n  The impact of the floods on small communities and the city of Grand \nForks, ND has been extraordinary. In Grand Forks alone, more than \n60,000 residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters. Much of \ndowntown Grand Forks has been destroyed by fires, and an estimated 28 \nto 35 schools and higher education facilities have been severely \ndamaged or destroyed by the floods.\n  This disaster has left more than 11,000 elementary and secondary \nstudents and 10,500 university students\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\nwithout school facilities for classroom instruction. Many of these \nelementary and secondary students are attending classes in more than 30 \nschool districts across the State. The North Dakota Office of \nManagement and Budget has estimated that damage to local education \nfacilities, as well as the unanticipated costs to provide education \nservices for displaced students around the State, may exceed $250 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, local school districts and the North Dakota University \nsystem will need considerable assistance from the Department of \nEducation and the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] to fully \nrecover from this terrible disaster. I have been advised that FEMA, \nunder the Robert Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, \nhas the authority to provide assistance to local governmental agencies \nincluding school districts and the North Dakota University system, for \nrepair of educational facilities.\n  FEMA, however, does not have authority under the Stafford Act to \nassist or reimburse a local school district for providing unanticipated \neducational services to displaced students.\n  Such emergency educational assistance was available in the past to \nlocal school districts from the Department of Education under Impact \nAid, section 7--assistance for current school expenditures in cases of \ncertain disasters. This law, unfortunately, was repealed in 1994 during \nconsideration of the Improving America's School Act.\n  Prior to 1994, for example, school districts affected by natural \ndisasters including Hurricane Andrew--1992--in Dade County, FL, and \ncommunities in 7 states impacted by the Midwest floods--1993--were \neligible for disaster assistance to meet emergency education operating \nexpenses. In North Dakota, more than 30 school districts throughout the \nState are assisting 11,000 displaced students from the Grand Forks \narea. Another 30,000 students in Minnesota are displaced and attending \nclasses in school districts across the State. These school districts \nare in urgent need of similar emergency assistance.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to restore the \nauthority to provide this emergency education operations assistance for \nelementary and secondary schools. I am very pleased that Senators \nDaschle, Johnson, Dorgan, Wellstone, and Grams are joining me as \ncosponsors of this bill.\n  Under this legislation, FEMA would be authorized in section 403--\nessential assistance--to provide disaster assistance including \ntransportation, emergency food services, and the costs for providing \neducational services to students who formerly attended other schools, \nincluding private schools, that were damaged or destroyed by disaster. \nThis emergency assistance would also be available to schools funded by \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs provided the schools are in the area that \nhas been declared a major disaster by the President.\n  As FEMA currently has the authority to restore educational \nfacilities, I believe the agency is best equipped to respond quickly to \nthe emergency operating needs of school districts affected by \ndisasters. As I noted earlier, school districts in 7 states affected by \nMidwest floods and Dade County schools impacted by Hurricane Andrew \nbenefited from this emergency assistance in 1992-94. There is no \nquestion that school districts in North Dakota, South Dakota, and \nMinnesota urgently need similar assistance. I intend to offer this \nlegislation as part of the supplemental disaster assistance measure \nwhen it reaches the Senate floor. I hope my colleagues will support \nthis urgent need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 685. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe work opportunity tax credit for an additional fiscal year; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n         LEGISLATION TO EXTEND THE WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nwould provide for a 1-year extension of the work opportunity tax \ncredit, authorizing the credit beyond this fiscal year through the end \nof fiscal year 1998.\n  My colleagues know well the history behind the work opportunity tax \ncredit. It is the successor to the targeted jobs tax credit which \nexpired 2 years ago and which received some criticism that it was an \nineffective incentive mechanism. However, Congress felt that there \ncould be some type of worthwhile incentive which could encourage \nemployers to hire individuals from economically disadvantaged groups, \nand as a result, the credit was revised, renamed the work opportunity \ntax credit, and incorporated into the Small Business Job Protection Act \n(P.L. 104-188), which the Congress passed and the President signed into \nlaw last year.\n  The revised tax credit, with tougher standards, such as in the area \nof certification and retention requirements, was authorized for 1 \nfiscal year and is set to expire on September 30, 1997. The legislation \nI am introducing today would simply provide for an extension of the \nwork opportunity tax credit for 1 additional fiscal year, through \nSeptember 30, 1998.\n  There are several reasons for the extension. First, employers now \nhave a tax incentive to hire individuals from targeted economically \ndisadvantaged groups, providing these individuals with jobs and \nvaluable work experience. In the wake of the historic welfare reform \nlegislation which was signed into law last year, I believe this \nincentive to put people to work is a vital one, and it should be given \nthe opportunity to work.\n  Second, Congress authorized this credit for 1 year to allow the \nDepartment of Labor, the Department of the Treasury, and the Congress \nto study the costs and benefits of the credit. To date, there are no \nstatistics available. And while we await a more complete set of \nstatistics on how the revised tax credit is performing, I believe the \nCongress should begin consideration of an extension of this credit to \nallow more employers to take part in the program and to provide an \nassurance to employers and potential employees alike that there is an \nincentive which is available to stimulate job opportunities. The sooner \nwe are able to provide an extension for the credit, the more secure \nboth the employers and the employees who take part in this credit will \nbe.\n  In addition, authorizing the credit for an additional fiscal year \nwill provide this Congress with a set of statistics available from \nmultiple fiscal years, not just 1, allowing us to better assess the \ncosts and benefits of the WOTC.\n  I am hopeful that the revised tax credit will prove more successful \nthan its predecessor. I have long been a supporter and advocate for the \npromotion of job opportunities and job training for at-risk youth and \nex-offenders, in particular. Any incentive to put more Americans to \nwork should be given the chance to succeed; 1 year is simply not \nenough.\n  With that, I ask this bill be referred to the appropriate committee. \nDuring the 105th Congress, a number of tax proposals will be under \nconsideration, and it is my hope that, by introducing this measure, the \nwork opportunity tax credit does not get lost in the shuffle and expire \nprematurely.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 685\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF WORK OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT.\n\n       Section 51(c)(4)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to termination) is amended by striking ``September \n     30, 1997'' and inserting ``September 30, 1998''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. \n        Torricelli):\n  S. 686. A bill to establish the National Military Museum Foundation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n            NATIONAL MILITARY MUSEUM FOUNDATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing on behalf of \nmyself, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Torricelli, legislation to create a \nNational Military Museum Foundation. The purpose of this legislation is \nto encourage and facilitate private sector support in the effort to \npreserve, interpret, and display the important role the military has \nplayed in the history\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\nof our Nation. This legislation is, in my judgment, crucial at this \nparticular moment in history, when we are on the verge of jeopardizing \ntwo centuries worth of military artifacts and negating the possibility \nof such collections in the future.\n  It has been the long-standing tradition of the U.S. Department of War \nand its successor, the Department of Defense, to preserve our historic \nmilitary artifacts. Since the days of the revolution to the conflict in \nBosnia, Americans have been proud of the role that our military has had \nin safeguarding our democracy, and we have tried to ensure that future \ngenerations will know that role. Over the years we have accumulated a \npriceless collection of military artifacts from every period of \nAmerican history and every technological era. The collection includes \nflags, uniforms, weapons, paintings, and historic records as well as \nfull-size tanks, ships, and aircraft which document history and provide \nprovenance for our Nation and armed services.\n  In recent years, however, the dedicated individuals who identify, \ninterpret, catalog, and showcase those artifacts have found themselves \nshortchanged and shorthanded. With financial resources diminishing, not \nonly are we cheating ourselves out of the military treasures currently \nwarehoused out of public sight, but we are in danger of lacking the \nfunds to update our collections with new items.\n  ``A morsel of genuine history,'' wrote Thomas Jefferson to John Adams \nin 1817, ``is a thing so rare as to be always valuable.'' Mr. \nPresident, today, significant pieces of our military history are being \nlost, shoved into basements, or subject to decay. With each year also \ncomes less funding, and our artifacts are multiplying at a pace that \nexceeds the capabilities of those who are trying to preserve them. \nSince 1990 alone, the services have closed 21 military museums and at \nleast 8 more are expected to close in the next few years.\n  We cannot let this proceed any further. Military museums are vital to \ndocumenting our history, educating our citizenry, and advancing our \ntechnology. More than 81 museums in 31 States and the District of \nColumbia daily instill Americans from veterans to new recruits to \nelementary school students with a sense of the sacred responsibility \nthat military servicemen bear to defend the values that have made this \ncountry great.\n  Military museums teach our servicemen the history of their units, \nenhancing their understanding both of the team of which they are a part \nand the significance of the service they have pledged to perform. And \nwhen a museum makes history come alive to young children, those \nchildren learn for themselves what this country stands for and the \nsacrifices that have been made to preserve the freedoms we often take \nfor granted.\n  Many of our servicemen have learned their military history through \nthese artifacts rather than textbooks, and many of our technological \nadvances have come as a direct result of these artifacts. The ship \nmodels and ordinances at U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, MD, \nfor example, have been used by the Academy's Departments of Gunnery and \nSeamanship. It has also been reported that a study of an existing \nmissile system, preserved in an Army museum, saved the Strategic \nDefense Initiative $25 million in research and analysis costs. These \nmuseums serve as laboratories where engineers can learn from the \nlessons of the past without going through the same trial and error \nprocess as their predecessors.\n  Yet without adequate funding, these benefits will be lost forever. \nAccording to a 1994 study conducted by the Advisory Council on Historic \nPreservation entitled, ``Defense Department Compliance with the \nNational Historic Preservation Act,'' the Department of Defense's \nmanagement of these resources has been mediocre, with the cause \nattributed to inadequate staffing and funding.\n  More than 80 percent of the museums studied said their survival \nrelies heavily on outside funding. When asked about their greatest \nneeds, the response was nearly always staff and money. And those \nmuseums that reported sufficient staffing from volunteers nevertheless \nsaid that the dearth of funds for restoration and construction \nparalyzed them from fully utilizing the available labor.\n  According to the study, money is so tight that brochures and \npamphlets are often unaffordable, leaving visitors with no explanations \nabout the objects they have come to see. A young child might be duly \nimpressed by the sight of a stern-faced general, but the historical \nlesson is greatly diminished if the child is not told the significance \nof the event portrayed or why the general looked so grim that day.\n  Perhaps most distressing, the study reported ``substantial \ncollections of rare or unique historical military vehicles and \nequipment that are unmaintained and largely unprotected due to lack of \nfunds and available expertise.'' In addition, the museums were found to \nbe struggling so much with the care of items already in house, that \nthey were unable to accept new ones. With a new class of military \nartifacts from the Vietnam and gulf wars soon to be retired, one \nwonders whether those artifacts will be preserved. If we do not take \naction to save what we have and acquire what we don't, future \ngenerations will see these pockets of negligence as blank pages in the \nliving history books that these museums truly are.\n\n  Only a Foundation can address these problems. The alternate \nsolution--to press the services to devote more money to these \ninstitutions--is implausible in this budgetary climate. The Secretary \nof Defense must place his highest priority on the readiness of our \nforces. Closely allied to that priority is the effort to improve the \nquality of life for our citizens on active duty. And, as aging \nequipment faces obsolescence, the Secretary has indicated that the \nfuture will bring an increased emphasis on replacing weapons systems. \nBy all realistic assumptions, the amount of funds appropriated for \nmuseums is likely to continue downward.\n  My bill recognizes the growing need for a reliable source of funding \naside from Federal appropriations. A National Military Museum \nFoundation would provide an accessible venue for individuals, \ncorporations, or other private sources to support the preservation of \nour priceless military artifacts and records. A National Military \nMuseum Foundation could also play an important role in surveying those \nartifacts that we know to exist. Currently, there is no museum \noversight or coordination of museum activities on the DOD level. A \nwide-ranging Foundation survey would therefore not only eliminate \nduplication, but would most likely discover gaps in our collections \nthat must filled before it is too late.\n  Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Defense would \nappoint the Foundation's Board of Directors and provide basic \nadministrative support. To launch the Foundation, the legislation \nauthorizes an initial appropriation of $1 million. It is anticipated \nthat the Foundation would be self sufficient after the first year. This \nis a small price to pay to save some of our most precious treasures.\n  This legislation is modeled on legislation that established similar \nfoundations, such as the National Park Foundation and the National Fish \nand Wildlife Foundation, both of which have succeeded in raising \nprivate-sector support for conservation programs. My bill is not \nintended to supplant existing Federal funding or other foundation \nefforts that may be underway, but rather to supplement those efforts.\n  The premise for establishing a national foundation is, in part, to \nelevate the level of fundraising beyond the local level, supplementing \nthose efforts by seeking donations from potentially large donors. I \nalso want to emphasize the inclusiveness of the Foundation, which will \nrepresent all the branches of our armed services.\n  Mr. President, statistics reveal that foundations established without \nthe mandate of a Federal statute and the backing of an established \nagency seldom succeed. With ever-diminishing Federal funds, we cannot \nexpect the Department to put our military museums ahead of national \nsecurity. Truly, an outside source committed to sustaining our museums \nis imperative. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS:\n  S. 687. A bill to enhance the benefits of the national electric \nsystem by encouraging and supporting State programs for renewable \nenergy sources,\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\nuniversal electric service, affordable electric service, and energy \nconservation and efficiency, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM PUBLIC BENEFITS PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, America is currently considering an \nextremely important and contentious issue: Should we restructure the \nsystem by which we obtain our electric energy? And if so, how should we \ngo about doing this? Hardly a day goes by in which one cannot find a \nnews article on this subject. Across our Nation, 44 States have taken \non the issue of restructuring, either in legislative debate or through \nthe implementation of pilot programs. And even here in Congress, there \nare a number of proposals, in both the House and Senate, which address \nthe various factors affecting the electric industry.\n  Advocates on all sides are debating whether the Federal Government \nshould direct States to move to a restructured system, both in terms of \nhow they should do it and when.\n  There are a number of ideas being offered as to whether utilities \nshould be allowed to recover costs that were incurred under a regulated \nsystem, and if so, in what manner and to what degree. Who should bear \nthe burden? The rate payer? The tax payer? The share holder?\n  Arguments have been made for and against Federal protection of public \npower, both in terms of market power and fiscal subsidies. Must \ncompanies divest according to function? Does a municipality's tax \nexempt bond authority give it an advantage over the tax deferrals of \nthe utility, or the less-than-cost loans to the cooperative?\n  Mr. President, we continue to hear a great deal about how the effort \nto restructure the electric power industry may affect the Nation's \neconomy. What is not being discussed, and what I believe is equally \nimportant, is how these changes will affect our society as a whole. How \nwill it impact on the Nation's poor? How will it affect our children's \nhealth? How will restructuring affect our environment?\n  Well, it doesn't have to be an either/or choice. In fact, it can't \nbe. As we move towards a restructured industry, we must consider the \nissues not only in terms of what they mean to our economy, but also in \nterms of what they mean to our society. We must secure and enhance the \npublic benefits that until now have been provided by the electric \nindustry's unique structure and regulatory traditions. This can only be \nachieved by including certain safeguards in any new regulatory \nstructure from the outset, before dramatic changes unravel the gains \nthis industry has made.\n  I rise today to introduce the Electric System Public Benefits \nProtection Act of 1997. This bill acknowledges the responsibility we \nhave to our Nation, to its people and to the environment as we reassess \nthe future of the electric power industry. It directly addresses the \nnumerous public benefits we enjoy from our electric power structure, a \nsystem that has a unique impact on how we live. And it does this while \ncreating a setting within the electric industry which promotes \ncompetition.\n\n  Under the system in effect today, electric utilities have been \ngranted franchises in order to serve the public good. In return for a \nguaranteed return on their investments, the utilities have, to varying \ndegrees of success, implemented many public purpose programs from which \nwe benefit. These initiatives have addressed the need for alternative \nfuels, assistance to needy and remotely located consumers, energy \nefficiency projects, and environmental safeguards. While the industry \nhas made significant progress in the past few decades, recent years \nhave seen a steady decline in investments relating to these \ninitiatives. As the electric industry moves closer to competition and \nderegulation, utilities are becoming less inclined to support public \npurpose programs without a guaranteed return.\n  My legislation creates a national electric system public benefits \nfund to enable and encourage State programs for renewable energy \ntechnologies, energy efficiency, low-income assistance, and universal \naccess. It is supported by a broad-based, competitively neutral, \nsystems benefits charge levied as a wires charge on all interconnected \ngeneration for sale on the electricity market. Revenues from the fund \nwill be used to match funds raised by the States for the same public \npurposes and support the continuation and expansion of the benefits we \nenjoy today.\n  A study of history divulges two important facts about energy \nefficiency. The first is that the potential for cost-effective savings \nfrom accelerated investments in energy efficiency is very large. Yet \ntrends over the last few years raise serious questions about utilities' \ncommitments to energy efficiency programs. Based on the uncertainty \nsurrounding the change within the industry, many utilities have \nadmitted that they have already cut programs and are planning on \nreducing or eliminating more. While this uncertainty makes long-term \npredictions in this area difficult, the Energy Information \nAdministration has projected a 13-percent reduction in direct utility \nexpenditures on energy efficiency programs during the period 1995 until \n1999. My bill affords States the opportunity to make necessary \ninvestments in efficiency technologies.\n  The second important fact we have learned is that there exist \nsignificant structural and informational market barriers to the \ndeployment of investments in energy efficiency in the absence of \ntargeted programs. My bill will help negotiate these barriers within \nthe industry.\n  One of the benefits of energy efficiency is that reduced consumption \navoids many of the environmental impacts associated with electric \ngeneration. The alternative is potentially devastating. In a recent \nnational survey, respondents were advised that changes in how the \nutility industry operates could lead to further cutbacks in traditional \nefficiency programs. Seven out of ten Americans, polled across the \nNation, stated that they support mandatory investments in energy \nefficiency, even if it means higher electric rates. They realize that \nwhat we invest today may save us billions of dollars during our \nlifetimes and those of our children.\n\n  The loss of public purpose programs will affect one group in \nparticular. For middle class families, the energy crisis of the 1970's \nis only a memory; for low-income customers, the energy crisis never \nended. A recent study in my State of Vermont showed that residential \ncustomers in general spend 3.8 percent of their income on energy, while \nlow-income households spend 15 to 20 percent, and in some cases even \nmore. Unaffordable utility costs are a leading cause of loss of housing \nfor low-income families. Yet another study found that visits by \nindividuals from low-income households to emergency rooms increased \nafter periods of severe weather, when those families had to make the \nchoice to heat or eat.\n  It is also clear that low-income families face greater barriers than \nother groups of customers to implementing the energy conservation \nmeasures I spoke of earlier, measures that would reduce their energy \ncosts. Low-income families are more likely to live in rental property, \nin which they have neither the right to make major modifications \nthemselves nor the ability to persuade their landlords to make energy \nconservation investments in their housing. While there are low-income \nhomeowners, their incomes are generally insufficient to fund \nimprovements in energy efficiency. My bill will provide a mechanism to \nhelp circumvent many of these barriers.\n  In considering the impact of restructuring on the Nation's poor, we \nmust also keep in mind that low-income customers are unlikely to be an \nextremely attractive and highly sought after segment of the electricity \nmarket. They are more likely than other customers to have difficulty \npaying their bills. They are more likely to require payment \narrangements and other labor intensive involvement from the utility \ncompany. And they are less likely to use large quantities of \nelectricity which might qualify them for volume discounts. We must \naccept the fact that access to electric power is a necessity in our \nsociety. My legislation will help guarantee that everyone has equal \naccess to the benefits of the electric industry. It will target, \nthrough the encouragement and development of cooperatives and other \nmarket mechanisms, the millions of Americans who are from low-income \nfamilies, remote rural areas and other groups who lack\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\nmarket power. In short, Mr. President, it ensures that essential \nservices remain affordable and the benefits of competition are \navailable to all utility customers.\n  We have learned the hard way that the Nation's economic well-being \ncan be put at risk by rapid spikes in world energy prices. Future \ndislocations could result from fossil fuel supply interruptions or \nproblems associated with nuclear powerplants. History teaches us that a \npolicy of prudent energy diversification is a form of national economic \nsecurity that is well worth purchasing.\n  Additionally, renewable energy sources are good for our environment. \nEvery megawatt of electricity generated by a wind turbine displaces \nanother from a fossil fuel source and lessens the environmental impact \nof the industry.\n  Yet, the future of renewable energy is in doubt. I would like to \ndirect your attention to this chart. Scientists tell us that, despite \nthe obvious advantages I have cited, the amount of electricity from \nrenewable sources is projected to remain stable at about 2 percent well \ninto the future. My legislation establishes a renewable portfolio \nstandard for all electric generation companies. It begins with 2.5 \npercent in the year 2000 and slowly grows to 20 percent in the year \n2020. These are not arbitrary numbers. They are based on information \nprovided by the electric industry and account for realistic constraints \non how fast these sources can develop.\n  This bill enables States to play an active role in the development \nand fielding of alternative fuels technology. It recognizes the \nimportance of fuel diversity, and it guarantees that renewable energy \nsources will play a significant role in this diversification and in \nproviding consumer choice in the restructured industry.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly concerned about what may be the \nsingle greatest market failure of the electric power industry: the \nprotection of our environment. The electric industry accounts for about \n3 percent of the Nation's gross domestic product, yet it accounts for \nup to two-thirds of some of the country's deadliest pollutants. We have \nworked hard to reduce this problem, and there is no doubt that some \nsuccess has been achieved. But it is not enough.\n  Electric powerplants emit 65 percent of the Nation's annual total of \nsulfur dioxide, an invisible gas that adversely affects our health and \nenvironment. Asthmatics are particularly vulnerable to this pollutant. \nThe leading cause of chronic illness in children, cases of this disease \nare climbing at a sharp rate and are exacerbated by our deteriorating \nenvironment.\n  Sulfur dioxide also is the principal cause of acid rain. This chart \nillustrates the fact that while the annual emissions of sulfur dioxide \nare expected to come down slightly in future years, this decline is not \nsufficient. My bill would cause a dramatic change by the year 2005, \ndecreasing the amount of this deadly gas from electric powerplants by \nroughly 60 percent.\n  This next chart reveals the problem this Nation will face in the \nfuture as increasing amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the \nair from the electric industry. Powerplants currently generate close to \n40 percent of the nationwide emissions of this pollutant, a gas chiefly \nresponsible for global warming and the creation of a greenhouse effect. \nThe resulting climate change has the potential to inflict devastating \ndamage on our environment for many years, well into the future. Unlike \nother pollutants, carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for decades. \nIf we are to protect our children's future, we must act now. As you can \nsee, my bill, designed to bring the industry back to the 1990 standard, \nrequires a significant 13 percent reduction by the year 2005 and will \ndouble that by the year 2015.\n  This legislation would bring about a major reduction in nitrogen \noxide emissions. The electric power industry is the single largest \nsource of this pollutant. Nitrogen oxide emissions are particularly \noffensive to me as a Vermonter because of the extreme ozone problem \nthey present. There are days now when, standing atop Mount Mansfield, I \ncan not make out the water tower on Mount Elmore, not even 20 miles \naway. This is disgraceful, and it is a problem faced in many areas \nacross this Nation.\n  Nitrogen oxides are now blamed for significant health problems as \nwell. Scientists recently discovered that this pollutant may be \nresponsible for increasing levels of cancer cases and breathing \ndisorders. As depicted on this chart, my legislation will mandate a 70 \npercent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants by the \nyear 2005.\n  Cognizance of these environmental problems cuts across party lines. A \nrecent poll in the State of Texas shows that 7 out of 10 residents who \ndefine themselves as very conservative favor significantly stronger \nenvironmental standards. In fact, in the nationwide survey I spoke of \nearlier, 80 percent of the respondents agreed that we need to act on \nthe problem.\n  Mr. President, we need to fix the problems attributable to electric \npower production. But as we move to a restructured industry, we need to \nfix it in a fair, competitively neutral manner. This bill does just \nthat. Setting a single, nationwide emissions standard for all \ngenerators which use combustion devices to produce electricity, it says \nstop to some of the Nation's dirtiest powerplants. It means we as \nAmericans will no longer tolerate the idea of giving a free ride to \nthose that can't meet the standard. It levels the playing field so that \nall generators can compete in the market on an equal footing and with \nthe same environmental responsibilities as their competitors.\n  Finally, we need to give people the information they need to make \nintelligent choices regarding their electricity. My bill directs the \nSecretary of Energy to establish a system whereby electric service \nproviders must disclose to the consumer adequate information on \ngeneration source, emissions and price. Only when the consumer has the \nability to compare can we say we have a truly competitive market.\n  In closing, I want to emphasize that any restructuring of the \nNation's electric power industry must address the economic and the \nsocial aspects of the issue. It is not an either/or choice. We must do \nboth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 687\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize \nPresidential Honors Scholarships to be awarded to all students who \ngraduate in the top 5 percent of their secondary school graduating \nclass, to promote and recognize high academic achievement in secondary \nschool, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n            THE PRESIDENTIAL HONORS SCHOLARSHIP ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to reintroduce \nPresident Clinton's proposal, the Presidential Honors Scholarship Act \nof 1997. I first introduced this bill on behalf of the administration \nlast September--and I have included a very similar proposal in my own \ncomprehensive higher education legislation, known as the Get Ahead Act. \nI am honored to have the opportunity to reintroduce this measure for \nthe President, who continues his endless efforts at improving American \neducation and making sure that college is affordable to all Americans.\n  Most people are probably not familiar with Presidential Honors \nScholarships, but I think many people have heard of the idea of merit \nscholarships. It is pretty simple. Under the bill, all students in \npublic and private schools who graduate in the top 5 percent of their \nclass would be designated as Presidential honors scholars and would \nreceive a $1,000 scholarship to college. The scholarship could be used \nduring their freshman year at the college of their choice, and the \nscholarship would not be used in determining eligibility for other \nfinancial aid.\n  I strongly support merit scholarships for two reasons. First, we need \nto start rewarding excellence in educational achievement. Under the \nleadership of President Clinton, 4 years ago Congress passed \nlegislation that encourages States to set high academic standards for \ntheir students. This proposal builds on that idea by rewarding those \nstudents who meet those high standards. Students who work hard and \nsucceed ought to be recognized and rewarded.\n  Second, by providing scholarship moneys, this bill will help \nthousands of students in paying for the costs of a college education, \nwhich, I might add, is becoming more and more difficult for middle-\nclass families. I realize that $1,000 does not go a long way in paying \nfor a public college education, not to mention the costs of a private \ncollege. But, it will be of some help, and for those who choose to go \nto a community college, it will pay for about two-thirds of the cost.\n  Mr. President, I suspect that we will be debating higher education \nmore than once this year. There is much to be done. We need to provide \na tax deduction for the costs of college. We should allow penalty-free \nwithdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts to pay for college. We \nshould make permanent the employer-provided education tax exclusion. We \nneed to expand the Pell Grant Program. And, we need to reauthorize the \nHigher Education Act.\n  In that process, however, let us not forget merit scholarships. It is \nnot the answer, but it is part of the answer. It is a piece of the \npuzzle. And while some would say that it is a small piece, it plays an \nimportant role in being the one piece that rewards those students who \nreach for excellence.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and with President \nClinton in seeing that this proposal becomes law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Dorgan, \n        Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Daschle, and \n        Mr. Robb):\n  S. 690. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove preventive benefits under the Medicare Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n              the colorectal cancer screening act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Colorectal \nCancer Screening Act of 1997 with my colleagues Senators Cochran, \nConrad, Dorgan, Moseley-Braun, Reid, and Rockefeller.\n  Let me share some tragic facts about colorectal cancer. According to \nthe American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is the second most \ndeadly cancer based on the number of annual deaths. While breast cancer \nprimarily afflicts women and prostate cancer is a disease of men, \ncolorectal cancer strikes both men and women of all races, resulting in \nthe high number of patients and the corresponding high number of \ndeaths.\n  This year alone, 140,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colon \ncancer and 54,000 Americans will die from the disease. In my own State \nof Louisiana, 2,200 new cases of colon cancer will be diagnosed this \nyear and it will take the lives of 920 people. Yet, as is the case with \nmost cancers, colon cancer is preventable and curable if detected \nearly.\n  The tragedy of colorectal cancer is that physicians have proven means \nto detect colorectal cancer early but these tests must be made \navailable to people on a widespread basis. Death from this terrible \ndisease can be reduced significantly by early detection. We know \npolyps, the initial presentation of early cancers, if detected early \ncan be treated without major surgery while expensive, major surgery in \na hospital is the only successful treatment for more advanced cancers.\n  While many private health plans are starting to provide coverage for \ncolorectal cancer screening, Medicare--which covers older Americans who \nare most at risk--does not. The Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 1997 \nwould make colorectal cancer screening available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries to improve the chance for early detection and diagnosis.\n  The type and frequency of screening I suggest in my bill are \ncompatible with the recommendations of several large physician groups \nas well as the American Cancer Society. It covers all the procedures \nthat are currently used today but the type of screening process will \ndepend on the patient's risk factors for colon cancer. Patients at \nhigher risk, for example someone whose parent had colon cancer, receive \nmore aggressive screening than someone with a normal risk for colon \ncancer.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is not procedure specific. Although \nseveral screening tests for colorectal cancer are currently available, \nthe best method for early detection has not been determined. Some tests \nare very simple and can be performed by any doctor. Others, such as \nbarium enema and colonoscopy, are technically more difficult and \nrequire special equipment and facilities. Some tests only evaluate part \nof the colon.\n  My bill basically recognizes that we need to start screening people \nright away. The Congress should not prevent seniors from getting \nscreened because there is disagreement over which procedures are best. \nThat is a decision best made by doctors, not the Congress. This bill \nwould mandate that seniors on Medicare have access to all the screening \nmethods currently used by doctors. In 2 years, the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services will report back to Congress on which tests are\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\nthe best and most cost-effective means of detecting colon cancer. If it \nis determined that a procedure is being used that is not effective, \nMedicare will no longer cover it. HHS will also study the needs of \nAfrican-Americans who are at high risk for colon cancer and have a \nhigher mortality rate. It makes much more sense for the experts in \ncolon cancer, not the Congress, to determine the best, most cost-\neffective screening techniques all the while making this important \nservice available immediately to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  This kind of preventive tool is critical in our battle against colon \ncancer. It will improve the quality of life for Medicare beneficiaries \nand save Medicare money in the long run by reducing the high costs of \ntreating advanced colorectal cancer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this \nlegislation this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nbill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 690\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

COVERDELL (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 53\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. McConnell, \nMr. Abraham, and Mr. Santorum) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n543) to provide certain protections to volunteers, nonprofit \norganizations, and governmental entities in lawsuits based on the \nactivities of volunteers; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Protection Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n     is deterred by the potential for liability actions against \n     them;\n       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n     organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n     associations, social service agencies, educational \n     institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n     affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n     directors and service in other capacities;\n       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n     is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n     programs than would be obtainable if volunteers were \n     participating;\n       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n     effective social service programs, many of which are national \n     in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n     represent some of the most successful public-private \n     partnerships, protection of volunteerism through \n     clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n     assumed by the volunteer in connection with such \n     participation is an appropriate subject for Federal \n     legislation;\n       (5) services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit \n     organizations would often otherwise be provided by private \n     entities that operate in interstate commerce;\n       (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher \n     costs in purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance \n     markets, to cover their activities; and\n       (7) clarifying and limiting the liability risk assumed by \n     volunteers is an appropriate subject for Federal legislation \n     because--\n       (A) of the national scope of the problems created by the \n     legitimate fears of volunteers about frivolous, arbitrary, or \n     capricious lawsuits;\n       (B) the citizens of the United States depend on, and the \n     Federal Government expends funds on, and provides tax \n     exemptions and other consideration to, numerous social \n     programs that depend on the services of volunteers;\n       (C) it is in the interest of the Federal Government to \n     encourage the continued operation of volunteer service \n     organizations and contributions of volunteers because the \n     Federal Government lacks the capacity to carry out all of the \n     services provided by such organizations and volunteers; and\n       (D)(i) liability reform for volunteers will promote the \n     free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n     commerce and uphold constitutionally protected due process \n     rights; and\n       (ii) therefore, liability reform is an appropriate use of \n     the powers contained in article 1, section 8, clause 3 of the \n     United States Constitution, and the fourteenth amendment to \n     the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the \n     interests of social service program beneficiaries and \n     taxpayers and to sustain the availability of programs, \n     nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that \n     depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws to \n     provide certain protections from liability abuses related to \n     volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental \n     entities.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to \n     the extent that such\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\n     laws are inconsistent with this Act, except that this Act \n     shall not preempt any State law that provides additional \n     protection from liability relating to volunteers or to any \n     category of volunteers in the performance of services for a \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This Act \n     shall not apply to any civil action in a State court against \n     a volunteer in which all parties are citizens of the State if \n     such State enacts a statute in accordance with State \n     requirements for enacting legislation--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this Act \n     shall not apply, as of a date certain, to such civil action \n     in the State; and\n       (3) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as \n     provided in subsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable \n     for harm caused by an act or omission of the volunteer on \n     behalf of the organization or entity if--\n       (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n       (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n     licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n     authorities for the activities or practice in the State in \n     which the harm occurred, where the activities were or \n     practice was undertaken within the scope of the volunteer's \n     responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity;\n       (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal \n     misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a \n     conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of \n     the individual harmed by the volunteer; and\n       (4) the harm was not caused by the volunteer operating a \n     motor vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which \n     the State requires the operator or the owner of the vehicle, \n     craft, or vessel to--\n       (A) possess an operator's license; or\n       (B) maintain insurance.\n       (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to \n     Organizations and Entities.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect any civil action brought by any nonprofit \n     organization or any governmental entity against any volunteer \n     of such organization or entity.\n       (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--\n     Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the \n     liability of any nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity with respect to harm caused to any person.\n       (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the \n     laws of a State limit volunteer liability subject to one or \n     more of the following conditions, such conditions shall not \n     be construed as inconsistent with this section:\n       (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n     including mandatory training of volunteers.\n       (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n     liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the \n     same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or \n     omissions of its employees.\n       (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of \n     a State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n       (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n     individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n     volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n     financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n     policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a \n     risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n     arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization \n     or entity will be able to pay for losses up to a specified \n     amount. Separate standards for different types of \n     liability exposure may be specified.\n       (e) Limitation on Punitive Damages Based on the Actions of \n     Volunteers.--\n       (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may not be awarded \n     against a volunteer in an action brought for harm based on \n     the action of a volunteer acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity unless the claimant establishes by clear \n     and convincing evidence that the harm was proximately caused \n     by an action of such volunteer which constitutes willful or \n     criminal misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to \n     the rights or safety of the individual harmed.\n       (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of \n     action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede \n     any Federal or State law to the extent that such law would \n     further limit the award of punitive damages.\n       (f) Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--The limitations on the liability of a \n     volunteer under this Act shall not apply to any misconduct \n     that--\n       (A) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n     defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n     of international terrorism (as that term is defined in \n     section 2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been \n     convicted in any court;\n       (B) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n     Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n       (C) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n     State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n     court;\n       (D) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n     found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; \n     or\n       (E) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n     determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n     alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     be construed to effect subsection (a)(3) or (e).\n\n     SEC. 5. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any civil action against a volunteer, \n     based on an action of a volunteer acting within the scope of \n     the volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization \n     or governmental entity, the liability of the volunteer for \n     noneconomic loss shall be determined in accordance with \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant who is a volunteer shall be \n     liable only for the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to \n     that defendant in direct proportion to the percentage of \n     responsibility of that defendant (determined in accordance \n     with paragraph (2)) for the harm to the claimant with respect \n     to which that defendant is liable. The court shall render a \n     separate judgment against each defendant in an amount \n     determined pursuant to the preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant who is a volunteer under this section, the trier of \n     fact shall determine the percentage of responsibility of that \n     defendant for the claimant's harm.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nvery special\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nAmerican, Ms. Elizabeth O'Donnell of Kenmore, NY. I am proud to \nannounce that Ms. O'Donnell is one of three winners of the 1996 HEROES \nAwards from the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. This honor is \ngiven each year to three individuals who make outstanding and unique \nhumanitarian contributions to local sports programs throughout the \nUnited States.\n  In 1976, Elizabeth O'Donnell abandoned her lifelong dream of \nprofessional ice skating to find a more fulfilling challenge. It was at \nthat time that Ms. O'Donnell left the Ice Capades to teach blind and \nhandicapped people of all ages to ice skate. Motivated by her love of \nthe sport and desire to share the freedom of movement, as well as the \nphysical and psychological benefits which accompany skating, Ms. \nO'Donnell founded the Skating Association for the Blind and Handicapped \n[SABAH].\n  In her 20 years as coach, administrator, and president of SABAH, Ms. \nO'Donnell has taught more than 8,500 physically challenged people to \nleave behind their wheelchairs and crutches and learn to skate with \nspecially designed walkers and harness systems. A number of Ms. \nO'Donnell's students have even learned to overcome their disabilities \nas a result of her coaching techniques.\n  Ms. O'Donnell's work might best be summarized in the words of Buffalo \nmayor, Anthony Massielo, the person who nominated her for the 1996 \nSporting Goods Manufacturers Association HEROES Award: ``For those \npeople who might have known `sports' as an abstract, Elizabeth has \nsucceeded in translating the joy of achievement and accomplishment, \nwhich is so often overlooked in competitive sports, into a triumph of \nspirit.''\n  Mr. President, I want to give my warmest congratulations to Ms. \nO'Donnell and to the people whose lives she helps make better. Her 1996 \nSporting Goods Manufacturers Association HEROES Award is richly \ndeserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3916-3", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3917-S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ``REBUILDING EVERY BURNED BLACK CHURCH''\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the February edition of Delta \nAirline's Sky magazine contained an article about one of this Nation's \nfinest corporate citizens, the International Paper Co.\n  IP has donated lumber and building materials to the National Council \nof Churches in its efforts to rebuild black churches burned by \narsonists in recent years. One such church torched in 1994 was \nFriendship Missionary Baptist in Proctor, Crittenden County, AR.\n  Last year International Paper stepped in to help this congregation. \nToday a new Friendship Missionary Baptist Church is under construction.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend this fine corporate citizen for the \nrole it is playing to reverse the misery and hardship that has been \ncaused by these church burnings.\n  I commend the article to my colleagues and ask that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                       [From Sky, February 1997]\n\n                  Rebuilding Every Burned Black Church\n\n\n  led by ceo john t. dillon, international paper has gone into ``the \n                          blessing business''\n\n                          (By Timothy Harper)\n\n       On Thanksgiving Day 1994, an arsonist apparently torched \n     the Friendship Missionary Baptist Church in Proctor, \n     Arkansas. It was one of the first in a series of deliberately \n     set fires that spread through predominantly black churches \n     across the South. Many Americans, of every color, were \n     appalled. Not just about race and religion, these were \n     attacks on the ideals of equality and freedom in America. Our \n     concept of what constitutes a civilized society was being \n     violated.\n       In subsequent months, dozens more black churches were \n     burned, and by the late spring and early summer of 1996, the \n     incidents had become a compelling national story. The FBI \n     began investigating. The National Council of Churches \n     established the Burned Churches Fund. Churches, companies and \n     individuals across the nation made contributions to help \n     congregations rebuild.\n       Many of the burned churches' congregations were poor, \n     however, and didn't know if they could rebuild, even with \n     donations. Until June 27, 1996, that is. One that date, John \n     T. Dillon, chairman and chief executive officer of \n     International Paper, the world's largest wood products \n     company, quietly told the National Council of Churches that \n     his company would donate lumber and building materials from \n     his company's broad range of construction products.\n       In his private letter to the Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, \n     general secretary of the National Council of Churches, Dillon \n     promised to provide as much as was needed to rebuild every \n     church. He put no ceiling on the amount of material to be \n     donated, or the cost. Dillon merely asked the Council, which \n     is overseeing the reconstruction of the churches, to \n     coordinate the effort to make sure that every church got what \n     it needed to rebuild.\n       Purchase, New York-based International Paper, which had \n     revenues in 1995 of nearly $20 billion and employs about \n     88,000 people around the world, provides the burned churches \n     with lists of the company's wood and building materials, \n     including beams, flooring, walls, sheeting, siding, shingles, \n     doors and countertops. Churches, with the help of officials \n     from the National Council of Churches, check off what they \n     need and send the list back to International Paper. For \n     churches that were burned to the ground, International Paper \n     is providing up to 100 percent of the materials the company \n     has to offer--and absorbing the costs.\n       Today, with a shipment of wood and materials from \n     International Paper, a new Friendship Missionary Baptist \n     Church is under construction near Proctor. ``It's a wonderful \n     thing,'' says Charles Eason, a deacon who is helping oversee \n     the rebuilding. ``We're just a small rural church, and this \n     donation has made the difference for us. We don't know when \n     we would have been able to rebuild without it.''\n       In a memo to International employees explaining the \n     donation, Dillon noted that many of the company's mills and \n     local branches are is small towns across the South. ``Beyond \n     the instant tragedy associated with this wanton \n     destruction, these events strike at the essence of what \n     makes small-town communities so special,'' Dillon wrote. \n     ``For International Paper, small towns and small-town \n     values have long been an important part of our history. \n     The spirit of unity, dedication to purpose and pride in \n     performing well that are so fundamental to these \n     communities have also been indispensable to our company's \n     success. This link, together with the premium we place on \n     corporate citizenship, requires that International Paper \n     respond in this time of need.''\n       The Rev. Albert Pennybacker, who is overseeing the church \n     reconstruction program for the National Council of Churches, \n     says 124 churches were damaged by burnings. Some were rebuilt \n     before the offer from International Paper, but he and \n     International Paper officials estimate that ``several dozen'' \n     churches ultimately will receive free wood and building \n     materials.\n       ``This is a really remarkable gesture by International \n     Paper, a remarkable commitment,'' Pennybacker says. ``We were \n     overwhelmed by [their] generosity.'' Beyond making the wood \n     and materials available, he says, International Paper has \n     made an extraordinary, perhaps unprecedented, promise to make \n     deliveries right to the churches.\n       That is no small or easily fulfilled promise. Since many of \n     the burned churches are in isolated areas, down country lanes \n     or out in the middle of farm fields, on land no one else \n     wanted, those special deliveries are often far off the \n     company's established delivery routes, taking drivers and \n     trucks out of their usual rotations. Moreover, International \n     Paper promised to make deliveries within a few days of \n     receiving orders from the churches, thereby adding many \n     thousands of dollars in staff time and rescheduling headaches \n     to the total cost of the company's donation.\n       Pennybacker says the National Council of Churches \n     originally guessed that the donated materials would be worth \n     $1 million, but he now believes the cost to International \n     Paper could be $2 million or more--at wholesale prices, not \n     counting the considerable costs of delivery. That means an \n     actual savings of several million dollars for churches that \n     otherwise would have to go out and buy their materials at \n     retail prices.\n       International Paper, meanwhile, does not seem to care what \n     the contribution will end up costing. ``This is an open-ended \n     commitment and, frankly, we're not sure just how much it's \n     going to cost,'' says Carl Gagliardi, the International Paper \n     executive coordinating the program out of the company's \n     Memphis, Tennessee, office. ``This is one of the best things \n     this company has ever done. It's been terrific for morale.''\n       Indeed, when International Paper's rank-and-file employees \n     received Dillon's note outlining the company's commitment to \n     the burned churches, many of them clamored to be part of it. \n     A few weeks later, Pennybacker got a call at his office at \n     the National Council of Churches headquarters in New York. An \n     International Paper representative wanted to come in and drop \n     off some donations from employees. Pennybacker expected ``a \n     few thousand dollars, maybe.'' The executive showed up with a \n     big box and dumped on Pennybacker's desk checks worth $37,787 \n     from employees. He turned over another check for the same \n     amount from International Paper, for a total donation of \n     $75,574, and explained that Dillon had decreed that the \n     company would match workers' individual donations dollar for \n     dollar.\n       ``During the past several weeks, I received several notes \n     from employees who were eager to contribute to the fund and \n     were eloquent in expressing their appreciation for the \n     company's support for the rebuilding of the churches and \n     communities that were victimized,'' Dillon said in a follow-\n     up companywide note. ``I am extremely proud, but unsurprised, \n     by the compassion, community concern and civic responsibility \n     represented\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\n     by your contributions to the Burned Churches Fund. It is just \n     another indication of why I feel so strongly about the men \n     and women who make International Paper's team so \n     extraordinary.''\n       One aspect of this story is perhaps even more \n     extraordinary: International Paper did not publicize its \n     donation--no corporate news conference, no announcement, not \n     even a press release. Dillon apparently did not want the \n     donation to be seen as a bid for publicity.\n       The article you are reading would never have been written \n     if the author had not happened to hear about the donation \n     from a Presbyterian minister who has a friend working at the \n     National Council of Churches. When Sky contacted \n     International Paper headquarters, the publicity staff--\n     professionals who are paid well to make sure Dillon and the \n     company look good--agreed to provide copies of Dillon's notes \n     to his company's work force but rebuffed a request to \n     interview the CEO for this article as ``not necessary.''\n       Dozens of black congregations across the South, meanwhile, \n     are eager to sing the praises of International Paper. ``Oh, \n     good!'' Shirley Hines exclaimed when told that Sky was \n     running a story about the International Paper donation. \n     Hines, in charge of the rebuilding committee at Greater Mount \n     Zion Tabernacle Church in Portsmouth, Virginia, says the \n     congregation did not know if the church could be rebuilt \n     after it burned in May 1995; the estimated cost of $340,000 \n     was just too much.\n       International Paper's donation last autumn of wood, doors, \n     wall paneling and other building supplies, however, took care \n     of three-quarters of the cost of materials and let the \n     congregation celebrate Christmas in its new, rededicated \n     church. ``International Paper told us to tell them what we \n     needed. We faxed in a list, and in less than a week it was \n     here. It was unbelievable,'' Hines says. ``If not for \n     International Paper, this church would have had to wait two \n     or three years to reopen, if it ever did.''\n       Hines recalled the dreary day when she, her pastor and \n     several other church members waited in the rain for the first \n     lumber delivery. When the big truck pulled up, she says, they \n     laughed and shouted and cried and danced in the rain, \n     snapping pictures of the forklift unloading the first pallets \n     of wood that would become their new church.\n       ``It made us realize that God is real,'' she says, ``and He \n     is still in the blessing business.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3917-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD STATEMENT HONORING 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WARREN \n                              KIWANIS CLUB\n\n Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMargaret MacArthur. Margaret has been selected to appear at the John F. \nKennedy Center for Performing Arts on May 1, 1997. She will be \nappearing as the sole representative of Vermont in an annual \ncelebration which will host artists from across the Nation.\n  Margaret represents the very best of Vermont. Her talent and hard \nwork have been recognized time and time again. In 1985, she was \nselected by the New England Art Biennial as a New England living art \ntreasure.\n  Margaret's repertoire consists almost exclusively of Vermont and \nother New England folk songs. She embodies the spirit of our Green \nMountain State and has successfully shared its heritage, through music, \nwith people throughout the country. Once again, I would like to extend \nmy best wishes and congratulations to Margaret MacArthur.\n  Mr. President, I ask the following article from the Brattleboro \nReformer be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Brattleboro Reformer, Dec. 6, 1996]\n\n             Local Folk Artist To Perform at Kennedy Center\n\n                            (By Jared Bazzy)\n\n       Marlboro.--Folk singer Margaret MacArthur has been selected \n     to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts \n     in Washington, D.C., this spring, as part of the Vermont \n     State Day celebration.\n       U.S. Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., picked MacArthur to be \n     the lone performer representing the Green Mountain State.\n       Jeffords, who chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Education, \n     Arts, and Humanities, said Thursday, ``Margaret represents \n     what's best about Vermont's history and culture,'' adding, \n     ``This is a wonderful opportunity for visitors from across \n     the nation to hear a true Vermont artist share our \n     heritage.''\n       MacArthur said she was invited a few weeks ago, just after \n     she returned from performing at the Folk Song Society in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       ``But I've never sung at the Kennedy Center for gosh sakes. \n     It's pretty exciting,'' she said in a telephone interview \n     from her home in Marlboro.\n       The Kennedy Center annually celebrates all 50 states with a \n     performance by a local artist from each one. MacArthur will \n     perform May 1, 1997.\n       Accompanying herself at different times on guitar, dulcimer \n     and harp-zither, MacArthur's repertoire consists almost \n     exclusively of Vermont and New England folk songs. She was \n     raised in the Ozarks of Missouri and moved to Vermont in \n     1948. She spends winters in Arizona. Therefore, she also \n     sings many songs from Missouri, nearby Kentucky and Arizona.\n       She said that she will certainly take along her harp-\n     zither, which was given to her by the family of Rawsonville \n     farmer Merle Landsman after it was found in his barn.\n       She said she will perform songs from a collection of 7,000 \n     Vermont songs compiled by Helen Hartness Flanders. Flanders \n     was the wife of the late Sen. Ralph Flanders, and MacArthur \n     enjoys the connection between their lives in Washington D.C. \n     and her performance at the Kennedy Center.\n       ``This will give me a good opportunity to honor her and her \n     collection,'' she said.\n       The New England Art Biennial, panel from the University of \n     Massachusetts, Amherst, chose MacArthur in 1985 as a ``New \n     England living art treasure.'' Her recording career spans to \n     the early 1960s, when she recorded ``Folksongs of Vermont'' \n     on Folkways records. She has since recorded eight more \n     albums, including several with members of her family, who \n     also live in Marlboro.\n       Recent local performance ventures included the Brattleboro \n     Museum and Art Center, as part of a series on farming in \n     Vermont.\n       She is currently completing her 10th recording, which is \n     being produced at Sound Design in Brattleboro and is entitled \n     ``Them Stars.''\n       MacArthur believes it was her work as artist-in-residence \n     in schools throughout the state that brought her to Jeffords' \n     attention. As a visiting artist, she had children set local \n     folk tales to music which culminated two years ago with the \n     production of ``Vermont Heritage Songs.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3918-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROVIDES SECURITY [CHIPS] ACT\n\n Mr. ROBB.

As \nChairman's Award winners, the team will be honored by President Clinton \nat a Rose Garden reception.\n  The Central/Delphi FIRST team helps to open young minds to science, \nmathematics, and technology. Pontiac Central students also have an \nopportunity to work at Delphi during the summer, which helps them \ncontinue learning outside of school and gain valuable on-the-job \ntraining. The innovative CADET program, an extension of Central/Delphi \nFIRST, uses unique activities to promote the fun of math, science and \ntechnology to students at seven elementary and junior high schools. As \nthe presenter of the Chairman's Award said, ``The judges believe that \nthis team has turned many children on to science and math. Through \ntheir strong partnership, FIRST became the avenue for an entire school \nof talented students to reach personal success.''\n  The success of the Central/Delphi team and the FIRST program in \ngeneral is a powerful example of what educators and corporations can do \nto improve opportunities for our young men and women.

Mr. President, everyone agrees that ridding the world \nof chemical weapons is a noble and worthy goal to pursue. These are \nweapons that no nation should have in its stockpile--and that includes \nthe United States. By law, the U.S. stockpile will be destroyed whether \nor not the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] is ever ratified by the \nSenate. Opponents of the Convention support that action.\n  Notwithstanding agreement on the goals of the CWC, we do not believe \nthat this treaty can ever achieve the goals. It will not accomplish its \nobjective of being global, verifiable, and effective ban on these \nweapons. Moreover, because of deficiencies in the treaty--which, by its \nterms, adopting parties must ratify wholesale without amendment--we \nbelieve the United States is better off without the CWC than with it. \nAs a result, we could not support ratification absent certain \ncertifications by the President prior to deposit of our instrument of \nratification.\n  Faced with the fact that the treaty is largely unverifiable, some \nratification supporters argue that no treaty is 100 percent verifiable, \nand that, while not perfect, the CWC is better than nothing, especially \nsince chemical weapons are so morally objectionable. Proponents further \nassert that the CWC is needed because it establishes an international \nnorm that stigmatizes these weapons; that the CWC will bring us some \nintelligence we do not now have regarding the possession and \nmanufacture of these weapons; and that it will provide trade benefits \nto U.S. chemical companies. Finally, they argue that we need to be a \nparty to the treaty to protect our interests as details of \nimplementation are worked out by the various parties.\n  For the sake of argument, even assuming that these relatively modest \nbenefits claimed for the treaty would in fact materialize, we believe \nthese claimed benefits do not outweigh the costs.\n  Opponents are convinced that the costs of ratifying the CWC outweigh \nthe advanced benefits in several important respects, including the \nfollowing: First, it would create a United Nations-style bureaucracy, \n25 percent of the cost of which must be paid for by U.S. taxpayers. \nSecond, it would put American businesses under a financially \nburdensome, security-compromising, and quite possibly unconstitutional \ninspection regime. Third, it would exacerbate the chemical threat we \nface by undermining existing multilateral trade restrictions, \nsanctions, and embargoes the United States has placed on rogue \ncountries like Iran and Cuba. Fourth, it would require information \nsharing that signatory nations, if so inclined, could use to advance \ntheir chemical weapons programs. Fifth, the convention would give the \nNation with the largest CW stockpile--Russia--an excuse to abrogate the \nBilateral Destruction Agreement [BDA] it entered into with the United \nStates to destroy chemical weapons. And this is not hypothetical \nspeculation--there are growing indications Russia does not intend to \ncomply with the BDA, which is much more restrictive than the CWC. \nSixth, the prospect of ratification would create--there are already \nsigns that it is creating--a false sense of security that encourages \nthe United States to let its guard down on defending against the use of \nchemical weapons against American troops. Seventh, it degrades the \nvalue of treaties and moral statements because all nations understand \nit is unenforceable.\n\n  The CWC represents hope over reality. It makes people feel good to \nsay they have done something about a class of weapons we all abhor. But \nsigning this piece of paper is not going to solve the problem--and \nthat's the problem. Hard problems can't be wished away with naive hopes \nand tough talk in the form of yet another international agreement, no \nmatter how many other nations have signed on.\n  If the United States is to make a unique moral statement as \nproponents urge, we shouldn't be stampeded into ratifying this treaty \n``because other nations have.'' The United States passed on joining the \nLeague of Nations even though, as with the CWC, it had promoted the \nLeague in the beginning and many other nations had decided to join it. \nToo often the international community has pronounced itself greatly \npleased at solving the latest crisis with yet another treaty like the \nKellogg-Briand Pact of 1928 which outlawed war as an instrument of \nnational policy. And too often, as here, disappointment has followed \nbecause of the disconnect between the good intentions and the hard \nreality. To the argument that we will look bad because it was our idea \nin the first place, opponents say that real respect is rooted in \nresponsible, honest positions; and that U.S. leadership in taking a \ndifferent approach will be rewarded in the long term.\n  It is not possible to ban the manufacture and possession of chemical \nweapons, and we should not delude ourselves into thinking it is \npossible. What we can do is back up our demand that no one use chemical \nweapons, with international cooperation based on the will to punish \nviolators so severely that use is deterred. That too is not easy; but, \nas the use of nuclear weapons has been deterred, so too can the use of \nchemical weapons be deterred if we have the will.\n\n\n                         THE CWC IS NOT GLOBAL\n\n  The original goal of the CWC was that it would ban the manufacture \nand use of chemical weapons by all the nations of the world. \nUnfortunately, the countries with chemical weapons that we are most \nconcerned about--Iraq, Libya, Syria, and North Korea--have not yet \nsigned the CWC, let alone ratified it. Pakistan, Iran, and Russia also \nhave chemical weapons programs; while they have signed the agreement, \nthey may not ratify. So, the nations that pose the most serious threat \nmay never fall under the CWC's strictures.\n\n  Nor is the CWC global in terms of the chemical substances it covers. \nWhile it prohibits the possession of many dangerous chemicals, two that \nit does not prohibit were employed with deadly effect in World War I: \nphosgene and hydrogen cyanide. But they are too widely used for \ncommercial purposes to be banned, which speaks volumes about this \ntreaty's impracticality.\n  Nor does the CWC control as many dangerous chemicals as does an \nexport control regime currently employed by 29 industrialized \ncountries. The Australia Group regime already controls trade in 54 \nchemicals that could be used to develop chemical weapons. Of the 54 \nchemicals subject to the Group's export controls, 20 are not covered by\n\n[[Page S3920]]\n\nthe CWC. That list of 20 includes potassium fluoride, hydrogen \nfluoride, potassium cyanide, and sodium cyanide, all used in making \nchemical weapons.\n  Finally, there are news reports that Russia has produced a new class \nof binary nerve agents many times more lethal than any other known \nchemical agents. These agents are reportedly made from chemicals used \nfor industrial and agricultural purposes and are not covered by the \nCWC. In February 1997, the Washington Times disclosed that under this \nprogram, ``the Russians could already produce pilot plant quantities of \n55 to 110 tons annually of two new nerve agents--A-232 and A-234. These \nagents can also reportedly be made from different chemical formulations \nallowing the agents to be produced in different types of facilities, \ndepending on the raw material and equipment available. For example, one \nversion of an agent can be produced using a common industrial solvent--\nacetonitrile--and an organic phosphate compound that can be disguised \nas a pesticide precursor. In another version, soldiers need only add \nalcohol to a premixed solution to form the final CW agent.\n\n\n                       THE CWC IS NOT VERIFIABLE\n\n  The second original goal of the convention was that it was to be \nverifiable. CWC negotiators in Geneva were told by then-Vice President \nGeorge Bush on April 18, 1984:\n\n       For a chemical weapons ban to work, each party must have \n     confidence that the other parties are abiding by it. . . . No \n     sensible government enters into those international contracts \n     known as treaties unless it can ascertain--or verify--that it \n     is getting what it contracted for.\n\n  As it turns out, however, the treaty fails to achieve this primary \nobjective as well. A recently declassified portion of an August 1993 \nNational Intelligence Estimate reads:\n\n       The capability of the intelligence community to monitor \n     compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention is severely \n     limited and likely to remain so for the rest of the decade. \n     The key provision of the monitoring regime--challenge \n     inspections at undeclared sites--can be thwarted by a nation \n     determined to preserve a small, secret program using the \n     delays and managed access rules allowed by the Convention.\n\n  Former Director of the CIA, James Woolsey, said in testimony two \nyears ago before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that:\n\n       The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an \n     intelligence perspective, that I cannot state that we have \n     high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, \n     especially on a small scale.\n\n  The problem, of course, is that manufacture of the ingredients used \nin chemical weapons is so common, so universal, and so easy that the \nobstacles to verification are enormous. Processes involved in the \nproduction of pesticides, for example, are strikingly similar to the \nprocesses used to develop weapons like mustard gas. According to a \nJanuary 1992 report by a team of analysts led by Kathleen Bailey of the \nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\n       Countries which have organophosphorus pesticide plants \n     could convert or divert production toward weapons material \n     without major effort. . . . Competent chemical engineers with \n     diversified experience could design equipment capable of \n     meeting minimum operating objectives. . . . Only a few \n     thousand dollars would be needed for piping and seals, \n     several hundred thousand dollars [would be needed] for \n     specialized equipment.\n\n  Not only that, but different processes can be used to produce the \nsame agent. Nations wishing to conceal the development of chemical \nagents can employ multiple processes. Therefore, unearthing a covert \nprogram under the CWC's provisions will be nearly impossible. It just \ndoesn't take much money, much time, much space, or much security to \nproduce chemical weapons.\n  That adequate verification is illusory under this treaty is now \nwidely acknowledged by technical experts and the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity alike. Even supporters of the treaty--like former ACDA \nDirector Ken Adelman--confirm that it is not verifiable. In his \neditorial endorsing the treaty, Mr. Adelman conceded this point up \nfront stating, ``Granted, the treaty is virtually unverifiable. And, \ngranted, it doesn't seem right for the Senate to ratify an unverifiable \ntreaty.''\n\n  We also have the experience of the U.N. team charged with inspecting \nSaddam Hussein's military establishment as proof of the difficulties of \ndetection when a country is determined to develop these weapons. Even \nwith the most intrusive searches--which hundreds of inspectors have \nconducted over five years in Iraq--evidence of weapons development has \nonly belatedly been uncovered. It is likely that Iraq will continue to \nhave a CW program and that the U.N. inspectors will continue to miss \nmuch of it even with intrusive inspection. The CWC's inspection regime \npales in comparison to the regime in Iraq, and the treaty's \nverification provisions will not enable us to catch cheaters.\n  Terrorist groups present a special problem because they can buy \nchemicals locally and manufacture weapons in very small spaces. In \n1995, the Aum Shinrikyo cult in Japan produced sarin gas from \ncomponents bought in Japan, and assembled this noxious agent in a room \n8 by 12 feet in size, using legitimately produced chemicals.\n  In addition to the problems just outlined--of dealing with closed \nsocieties like Iraq, of sorting out the military from the commercial \nmanufacture of chemicals, and of detecting CW activities that might \ntake place in the smallest of nooks and crannies--concealment is also \nfacilitated by the treaty itself because it allows ample time for \ninspected parties to hide what they are doing. Judge William Webster, \nformer Director of the FBI and of the CIA, testified before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee that a facility producing chemical warfare \nagents could be cleaned up--without any trace of chemicals--in under \nnine hours. Judge Webster said:\n\n       Because of the equipment needed to produce chemical warfare \n     agents can also be used to produce legitimate industrial \n     chemicals, any pharmaceutical or pesticide plant can be \n     converted to produce these agents. A nation with even a \n     modest chemical industry could use its facilities for part \n     time production of chemical warfare agents. Libyan Leader \n     Quadaffi, in a speech delivered in October, claimed that the \n     facility at Rabta is intended to produce pharmaceutical, not \n     chemical warfare agents. He proposed opening the complex for \n     international inspection. But within fewer than 24 hours, \n     some say 8\\1/2\\ hours, it would be relatively easy for the \n     Libyans to make the site appear to be a pharmaceutical \n     facility. All traces of chemical weapons production could be \n     removed in that amount of time.\n\n  Therefore, the treaty fails to satisfy its two principal premises: it \nis neither global nor verifiable. Proponents concede this point to one \ndegree or another, but argue that, on balance, it is still better than \nnothing. Opponents believe, to the contrary, that the treaty would \nactually create more problems than it solves.\n\n\n                    WHAT HARM IN APPROVING THE CWC?\n\n  Proponents say the deficiencies in the treaty are outweighed by the \nmoral statement it makes in establishing an international norm against \nthe possession of chemical weapons; by the trade benefits it will bring \nto U.S. chemical companies; and by marginal gains in intelligence if we \nbecome a party to the treaty.\n\n\n                            Moral Statement\n\n  By definition, to have the influence and weight of a moral statement, \nan action must be genuine. A treaty that cannot prevent those who sign \non to it from cheating, and that, even if cheating were discovered, \nwould not apply meaningful punishment to the violator--such a treaty is \nessentially hollow. History shows that hollow declarations are worse \nthan none at all. A commitment honored more in the breach than the \nobservance is not a moral statement; it fools no one and it deters no \none.\n  Proponents of ratification argue that at least this treaty would be a \ntool in the hands of diplomats who would attempt to dissuade cash-\nstrapped countries from selling chemicals to rogue nations to advance \ntheir CW programs. But, countries can easily ignore the treaty and \nexport even the more dangerous chemicals because it is so difficult to \nverify compliance, and because there is no real enforcement mechanism. \nThe CWC will be adhered to by nations that have no intention of doing \nwhat it prohibits --with or without the treaty--and will be ignored by \nthose who choose to ignore it--whether or not they are parties. There \nsimply is no effective enforcement--no ability to catch cheaters and no \npunishment, in any event.\n  Under Article XII of the CWC, parties caught violating treaty \nprovisions are simply threatened with a restriction or suspension of \nconvention privileges.\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\n Those privileges are simply the right to participate in the treaty. At \nworst, a report will be sent to the U.N. General Assembly and the U.N. \nSecurity Council. With no predetermined sanctions in place to deter \npotential violators, the CWC is doomed to ineffectiveness.\n  Finally, there already is an international norm against chemical \nweapons that is both global and verifiable. The 1925 Geneva Protocol \noutlaws the use--not the mere possession--of chemical weapons. In World \nWar II, the Protocol was enforced by the allied leaders' threat to \nrespond in kind to any chemical attack. But after Iraq used chemical \nweapons against its Kurdish population and Iranian soldiers in the late \n1980's, diplomats met to address this heinous war crime. These \ndiplomats, faced with incontrovertible evidence of an Iraqi abrogation \nof the Geneva Protocol, were not able to agree on sanctioning Iraq and \nwe could not even agree to list that country by name in a statement \ncondemning the attack. If the world community could not muster the will \nto punish an obvious violation like that, how are the CWC participants \ngoing to summon the will to sanction a mere possessor or manufacturer \nof these weapons on evidence that may be much less conclusive than the \nproof of use by Iraq?\n\n  Indeed, as in Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale, the real moral \nstatement may be in exposing the naked truth about this ineffectual \ndocument. It could be that, despite all the fine words about the \ntreaty--or the emperor's fine clothes--there is actually nothing here.\n  Given the United States' preeminent position as the sole remaining \nsuperpower after the end of the cold war, we should make a moral \nstatement. We do it by destroying our own stocks--which we are doing; \nby admitting that the CWC is so flawed that it is not effective in its \ncurrent form; by working to develop an effective enforcement regime for \nthe Geneva Protocol; and by pushing forward with our bilateral CW \ndestruction efforts with Russia and, perhaps, other nations.\n  There are many multilateral treaties on the books--such as the Law of \nthe Sea Treaty, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \nDiscrimination Against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the \nChild--that make high moral statements which few pay attention to \nbecause the United States has not ratified them. There are currently 48 \ntreaties pending before the Senate. Because of the United States' \npreeminent position, our unilateral actions often speak louder than \nanything else. To return to the point I made at the outset: we already \nhave a policy in place. Through Public Law 99-145, the United States is \ncommitted to destroying the bulk of its chemical weapons by the year \n2004. Through our actions we demonstrate U.S. leadership in ridding the \nworld of chemical weapons.\n  It matters how we make a moral statement. Papering over a problem \nwith a treaty is not an effective moral statement. If everyone knows \ngoing into it that the CWC, despite its moral pretensions, is \nunverifiable and ineffective, this merely engenders cynicism about \ninternational treaties. The outrage that the use of these weapons stirs \nin us is undermined when we enter a treaty with a nod and a wink.\n\n\n                              Public Harm\n\n  The argument that the treaty may not be perfect but at least it does \nnot do any harm is not only an exceedingly weak justification for the \ntreaty, but an inaccurate one. There are significant public and private \ncosts were we to participate in the CWC.\n  First, it creates a new U.N.-type bureaucracy, a new international \norganization called the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical \nWeapons [OPCW], located in The Hague. The OPCW will oversee \nimplementation of the treaty. Based on studies by the Congressional \nOffice of Technology Assessment [OTA] and the General Accounting \nOffice, total direct costs of the treaty to the U.S. taxpayer could \nreach $200 million annually. That includes the U.S. obligation to cover \none-fourth of the operating budget of the OPCW. This year, the \nadministration is requesting a total of nearly $130 million, of which \n$52 million is destined for the OPCW in The Hague.\n  Moreover, Russia has said it will not ratify the CWC unless it is \ngiven a significant amount of Western aid to pay for the destruction of \nits chemical weapons. The figure often mentioned in this context is \n$3.3 billion. But when Russia realizes the magnitude of the \nundertaking, this may prove to be a drastic underestimation. After all, \ndestruction of the United States chemical stockpile, which is smaller \nthan that of Russia, will cost us at least $11 billion.\n\n\n                        Harm to Private Industry\n\n  Ratifying the treaty would harm U.S. industry in basically three \nways: First, it imposes a costly new regulatory burden on American \nindustry. Second, it is the first arms-control treaty in history that \nsubjects private companies to inspections by agents of foreign \ngovernments, which could well portend a loss of trade secrets. Third, \nfor the first time ever, U.S. citizens will be subject to a treaty that \ninvolves the reach of international authorities, raising significant \nconstitutional issues. Unlike any treaty we have ever ratified, the CWC \nrequires prosecution of individual American citizens for treaty \nviolations. Its inspection regime poses a potential threat to the \nconstitutional rights of U.S. citizens.\n\n\n                           Regulatory Burden\n\n  Every U.S. company that produces, processes, or consumes a scheduled \nchemical will be subject to new regulatory requirements, including a \ndeclaration burden. ACDA estimates that 3,000 to 8,000 companies will \nbe affected, although the OTA estimated in 1992 that 10,000 companies \nwould come under the CWC's strictures.\n  The treaty entails routine inspections of specified chemical \nproducers. ACDA acknowledges that many industries outside the chemical \nindustry will be required to fill out forms and open their books to \ninternational inspectors, including:\n  Sherwin-Williams Co., Safeway Stores, Inc., Quaker Oats Co., Kraft \nFoods Ingredients, Maxwell House Coffee Co., Conoco, Inc., Gillette \nCo., Strohs Brewery, ADM Corn Processing Division, Colgate-Palmolive \nCo., Xerox Corp., Castrol, Inc., General Motors Corp., Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., Simpson Timber Co., Lockheed-Martin Corp., Kaiser Aluminum, \nand Browning Seed, Inc.\n  For some companies, especially small- and medium-sized \nestablishments, the production data reporting requirements in the CWC \nare budget busters. Depending on the types and numbers of controlled \nchemicals made or used by the company, these records can run $50,000 to \n$150,000 per year to maintain and report.\n  The administration provided me with a list of 81 companies in Arizona \nthat could be affected by the treaty because they utilize industrial \nchemicals limited by it. I contacted 25 of those companies to find out \nif it knew about the CWC and its ramifications for them. Many company \nofficials were not aware of the treaty, or were aware of it only \nvaguely. Several reported back with calculations of what compliance \nwould cost them. One Phoenix company estimates an annual cost of \n$70,000 a year to complete the treaty's reporting requirements. \nOfficials at the company also told me that tracking the production and \nuse of industrial chemicals back to 1946, as the treaty also requires, \n``would be impossible because such historical data no longer exists.'' \nAccording to a Tucson construction company, the costs don't end there. \nAs its officials wrote to me: ``In order to state without reservations \nthat we do or do not have in our possession any of the chemicals or \ntheir constituents, we would have to either hire a consultant versed in \nchemistry or put a chemist on our staff for the assurance and \ndetermination of our strict adherence.''\n  Under the treaty, thousands of U.S. companies will be subject to \nroutine inspections. When inspectors show up at its doorstep, one \ncompany said, ``we would be greatly concerned that such a visit might \ncompromise confidential business information.''\n\n\n               Potential Loss of Proprietary Information\n\n  The greatest potential for loss of trade secrets is with the \nchallenge inspections that the treaty allows. These challenges could \noccur at literally any building on U.S. territory--even a company that \ndoes not have a CWC reporting requirement. Sophisticated equipment, \nsuch as mass spectrometers, will be used by the international \ninspectors. They can glean proprietary information, such as the process \nused to\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\nmake a biotechnology product. Also, clandestine sampling and data \ncollection by inspectors would be hard to detect and stop.\n\n  In 1992, the OTA identified examples of proprietary information that \ncould be compromised:\n  The formula of a new drug or specialty chemical;\n  A synthetic route that requires the fewest steps or the cheapest raw \nmaterials;\n  The form, source, composition, and purity of raw materials and \nsolvents;\n  Subtle changes in pressure or temperature at key steps in the \nprocess;\n  Expansion and marketing plans;\n  Raw materials and suppliers;\n  Manufacturing costs;\n  Prices and sales figures;\n  Names of technical personnel working on a particular subject; and\n  Customer lists.\n  Also according to OTA, the means by which sensitive business \ninformation could be acquired by foreign inspectors include the \nfollowing:\n\n       Manifests and container labels that disclose the nature/\n     purity of the feedstock and the identity of the supplier.\n       Instrument panels that reveal precise temperature and \n     pressure settings for a production process.\n       Chemical analysis of residues taken from a valve or seal on \n     the production line.\n       Visual inspection of piping configurations and \n     instrumentation diagrams that could allow an inspector to \n     deduce flow and process parameters.\n       Audits of plant records.\n\n  Clearly, while it is difficult to assess the potential dollar losses \nthat may be associated with the compromise of proprietary business \ndata, information gleaned from inspections and data declarations \nliterally could be worth millions of dollars to foreign competitors, \nand U.S. companies have little recourse against frivolous inspections.\n  Proponents of the treaty note that the Chemical Manufacturers \nAssociation (CMA) supports the agreement despite its inspection regime. \nOpponents note that the CMA represents about 190 of the 3,000 to 8,000 \ncompanies likely to be affected by the treaty. Other trade associations \nrepresenting a larger number of firms, like the Aerospace Industries \nAssociation of America [AIA], whose firms collectively are the second \nlargest U.S. exporter of goods and services, the U.S. Business \nInformation Committee, and the Small Business Survival Committee oppose \nthe CWC.\n\n\n                              Legal Issues\n\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee hearing held on September 10, 1996, \nconfirmed that there are serious legal difficulties associated with the \nCWC. The international inspections it requires may result in violations \nof the constitutional rights of the officers of U.S. firms, \nspecifically their rights under the fifth amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution. Also, attempts to fix these legal shortcomings by \nchanging the implementing legislation confront the problem of striking \na balance between respect for the constitutional rights of American \ncitizens, on the one hand, and the need for international inspectors to \nbe as intrusive as possible, on the other hand. The administration \nbelieves the treaty strikes the right balance. I believe the treaty \ninstitutionalizes the worst of both worlds: an unverifiable treaty \nthat, nevertheless, also infringes on U.S. citizens' constitutional \nrights. We get a company in Phoenix spending a lot of money opening up \nits premises and disclosing corporate information, in exchange for \nwhich we have no assurance at all that we can deter someone preparing \nnoxious chemical agents halfway around the world.\n  As Judge Robert Bork said in a recent letter to Senator Hatch that \ninternational inspectors collecting data and analyzing samples ``may \nconstitute an illegal seizure'' under the takings clause of the fifth \namendment. The U.S. Government owes a citizen just compensation, under \nthis amendment, for an illegal seizure of intellectual property.\n  Participating in the CWC could result in hundreds of millions of \ndollars lost to companies from industrial espionage undertaken during \nor as a result of the international inspection of their facilities. The \nOTA pointed out in a 1993 report that the chemical industry ``is one of \nthe top five industries targeted by foreign companies and governments \nand that the problem of industrial espionage is growing.'' The OTA \nexplained just how much is at stake for any given company: \n``Development and testing of a new pesticide,'' according to the OTA, \n``takes an average of 10 years and $25 million. Innovation in the \npharmaceutical industry is even costlier.'' A new drug, estimates the \nOTA, requires an average of 12 years of research and an after-tax \ninvestment of roughly $194 million--estimated in 1990 dollars.'' And \nplease keep in mind these figures do not include the lost revenues due \nto lost sales.\n  Incidents of industrial espionage are not uncommon. The OTA study on \nthe CWC also discussed the results of a survey of U.S. companies in \nwhich 8 of 11 firms responding reported attempts to misappropriate \nproprietary business information. The 8 affected companies reported a \ntotal of 21 incidents, 6 of which cost the companies $86.25 million.\n\n  The CWC does not have a procedure for victimized companies to recover \ndamages, or to punish any foreign inspectors who participated in the \ntheft of proprietary information. In fact, the treaty explicitly \nprohibits a victimized company from taking legal action against the new \ninternational inspection organization. That leaves the U.S. Government \nto provide indemnity.\n  A CWC proponent, Professor Barry Kellman of DePaul University, wrote \nin 1993 that ``loss or disclosure of confidential information of the \nTechnical Secretariat--the agency created by the treaty--may have \nconstitutional implications because trade secret owners are entitled to \ncompensation'' when there are leaks of proprietary information as a \nresult of government action. So, even treaty proponents say ``just \ncompensation'' for takings under the U.S. Constitution may well come \ninto play. We have not adequately considered what kind of a \ncompensation commitment we are making through this treaty, and what \nkind of an obligation we are letting U.S. taxpayers in for if we ratify \nit.\n  An Impossible Balance: Proponents acknowledge there may be legal \nproblems with the treaty; however, the U.S. Senate cannot tinker with \nthe treaty language. Article XXII says that ``the Articles of this \nConvention shall not be subject to reservations.'' Still, proponents \nclaim that the legal problems can be fixed by carefully crafting the \nimplementing legislation. Fixing the treaty in this way seems doubtful \nat best--at least if the intention is to leave the treaty as anything \nmore than a fragile shell that will fall apart on the first occasion \nthat someone objects to an inspection on U.S. soil. The administration \nhas now agreed to require criminal warrants and a determination of \nprobable cause for every nonvoluntary challenge inspection and to seek \nadministrative search warrants for nonvoluntary routine inspections. \nHow does this square with our international obligation to allow \ninspections to proceed? Constitutional fixes to the implementing \nlegislation will not be compatible with the CWC's dependence on an \nintrusive inspection regime. This incompatibility means that we will \nhave entered into a promise we know, under our Constitution, we will \nnot be able to keep.\n  Rest assured that we will probably be copied--and by nations that may \nhave something to hide. If the United States argues that it can provide \nconstitutional protections with implementing legislation, countries \nlike Iran, China, or Russia, or any other participating nation will be \nable to point to what we've done and similarly modify their \ninterpretation of the CWC to suit their own objectives.\n  Nations of laws like the United States will both comply with the CWC \nand protect constitutional rights, while violators will use \nconstitutional rights to get away with storing or building chemical \nweapons. A global ban on possessing chemical weapons that respects \nconstitutional rights, therefore, can be violated at will. And, an \nairtight ban on possessing chemical weapons--if one were possible--\ncannot protect constitutional rights. Pointing this out is not trying \nto have it both ways; rather, it is acknowledging the futility of \npursuing this kind of solution.\n\n\n              INTELLIGENCE GAINS FROM THE CWC ARE ILLUSORY\n\n                               Terrorism\n\n  A major advantage of this treaty, according to proponents, is that it \nwill provide U.S. intelligence agencies with information they can use \nto protect\n\n[[Page S3923]]\n\nAmerican citizens. One of the more extravagant claims of CWC proponents \nin the administration, in fact, is that participating in the CWC will \nhelp us fight terrorism. During his State of the Union Address in \nFebruary, President Clinton said the CWC would ``help us fight \nterrorism.''\n  His implication departs from the otherwise relatively objective and \nlimited claims made for the treaty. It is unsubstantiated by any \nanalysis or evidence. A declassified section of a Defense Intelligence \nAgency document of February 1996 states: ``Irrespective of whether the \nCWC enters into force, terrorists will likely look upon CW as a means \nto gain greater publicity and instill widespread fear. The March 1995 \nTokyo subway attack by Aum Shinrikyo would not have been prevented by \nthe CWC.''\n  A CIA report of May 1996, a portion of which has been declassified, \nmakes the same point: ``In the case of Aum Shinrikyo, the CWC would not \nhave hindered the cult from procuring the needed chemical compounds \nused in its production of sarin. Further, the Aum would have escaped \nthe CWC requirement for an end-use certification because it purchased \nthe chemicals within Japan.'' The CWC does not help deny terrorists \neasy access to nerve gas and other chemical weapons, among other \nreasons, because terrorists can simply obtain their chemicals in their \nown country for ostensibly legitimate purposes--they do not have to \nimport them.\n\n              Intelligence regarding nations' CW programs\n\n  Nor will participating in what the columnist George Will called ``the \nChemical Weapons Convention's impressively baroque, but otherwise \nunimpressive, scheme of inspection and enforcement'' add much to our \nknowledge of other countries' CW programs. Former Deputy CIA Director \nRichard Kerr said it is true that we will know a lot more about some \ncountries, but only those ``that are least likely to develop and use \nthese weapons.'' We will have gone to a lot of trouble and expense, in \nother words, to learn that Belgium is not violating the treaty. The \ncosts are simply not worth the benefits we gain.\n\n  Our real intelligence payoff, as a general matter, is in intrusive \nU.S. intelligence collection and sophisticated U.S. analysis, not in a \ngroup of international inspectors making spot inspections--looking for \nthe proverbial needle in a haystack--and giving plenty of advance \nnotice to anyone actually suspected of violating this treaty. In fact, \nthe international inspectors themselves, according to former Deputy CIA \nDirector Kerr, will have to rely on U.S. intelligence to be able to do \ntheir jobs. This compromises our own sensitive information and our own \nmethods of collecting that information.\n  Intelligence is difficult to gather in a closed society, and the case \nof United Nations scrutiny of Iraq, which actually used chemical \nweapons to kill thousands of Kurdish noncombatants in 1988, teaches a \nsobering lesson. The team of U.N. inspectors concentrating full-time on \nIraq--which would not, of course, be the case with the OPCW inspectors \nwho will have worldwide responsibilities--has uncovered some new \ndevelopments in Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons program, but even \ntheir most thorough and sustained inspections have not found \neverything. Inspections under the CWC, under far less intensive \ncircumstances, will not hamper a regime determined to have these \nfrightful weapons.\n  Proponents say over and over again that we are better off inside the \ntreaty than outside, because of the store of data we will get out of \nthe reporting regime and the inspection process. But where will this \ninformation come from? Being inside the treaty offers little insight \ninto the actions of potential violators because: First, rogue states \noutside of the treaty will not be inspected by the OPCW; second, the \ntreaty annex states that the OPCW cannot release to any nation \ninformation deemed to be confidential; third, while some OPCW \ninspectors will no doubt be Americans, the treaty annex on \nconfidentiality states that inspectors are required to sign individual \nsecrecy agreements with the OPCW, therefore they can't give American \nintelligence agencies any proscribed information. If we play by the \nrules, just where is this intelligence data going to come from?\n  Finally, history shows that states are not very likely to call \nattention to treaty violations that intelligence-gatherers learn about \nbecause the diplomatic considerations frequently supersede treaty \nenforcement. Recall, for example, the phased-array radar station at \nKrasnoyarsk, in the then-Soviet Union, which violated the Anti-\nBallistic Missile Treaty. Our intelligence reports were effectively \nignored so as not to force the United States to take action against the \nSoviet Union for violating the treaty. We thought the higher priority \nwas to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union, which would have \nbecome strained if we used our intelligence to expose that nation's \nviolations. Russian violations of the Biological Weapons Convention, \nmoreover, are noted each year in ACDA's Pell report on arms-control \ncompliance, yet nothing is ever done to make Russia comply. \nIntelligence can be helpful until it reveals treaty violations, then it \nbecomes submerged and subordinated to diplomatic considerations.\n\n\n             CHEMICAL INDUSTRY NOT HARMED BY REJECTING CWC\n\n  The third claim made by CWC proponents--based largely on the \nrecommendations of the Chemical Manufacturers Association--is that \nthere is financial harm in not ratifying this agreement. But the CMA's \nargument that we have to get on board this train or we will miss out, \nis just not true.\n  The initial estimate from CMA claims that if the Senate fails to \nconsent to ratification of the CWC, U.S. chemical companies will be \nsubject to trade restrictions, which will place $600 million of annual \nchemical trade at risk. On the surface, CMA appears to have maintained \na consistent estimate of the CWC's impact on U.S. chemical trade since \nthe Senate first considered the treaty last September. Close \nexamination of the facts, however, reveals that CMA's estimate has \nshrunk considerably over time and appears to overstate any potential \nnegative impact of nonratification.\n  CMA's initial estimate stated that $600 million of annual U.S. \nchemical exports would be placed at risk.\n  When the President of the association met with me in February, he \nexplained that CMA had refined its initial estimate and now believed \n$600 million in two-way trade would be affected, with only $281 million \nin annual exports of Schedule 2 chemicals placed at risk.\n  In a letter to me on March 10, CMA revised its figures yet again, \nstating that the upper-bound estimate now indicated $227 million in \nannual U.S. Schedule 2 chemical exports would be jeopardized by \nnonratification.\n  The $227 million represents about 0.38 percent of total U.S. chemical \nexports, indicating that if we accept CMA's figures at face value, over \n99.6 percent of U.S. chemical exports will be unaffected by failure to \nratify the CWC. Even CMA's revised estimate appears to greatly \noverstate the impact of nonratification.\n  More than half of CMA's export estimate is based on exports of one \nchemical--amiton. Amiton is a pesticide ingredient that is banned in \nthe United States, Europe, Japan, and Canada--America's principal \nchemical export markets--but is widely exported to African states, a \nlarge number of which are not CWC signatories. While we may not be able \nto ascertain the exact percentage of U.S. amiton trade to non-CWC \nsignatories, such trade likely constitutes the bulk of the overall \namiton market and would be unaffected by CWC sanctions.\n\n  CMA's upper-bound estimate that $426 million in U.S. chemical imports \nwill be affected is also suspect. Over 50 percent of the import \nestimate is based on trade in one group of chemicals which CMA admits \n``may reflect broader chemical families,'' implying the estimate may \ninclude trade in related chemicals not restricted by the CWC. In \naddition, the U.S. has the most advanced chemical industry in the \nworld. Although short term disruptions might occur if United States \nfirms were unable to import certain chemicals, American industry would \nalmost certainly be capable of producing the same chemicals currently \npurchased from abroad.\n  In preparing its estimate, CMA used U.S. Government data on chemical \ntrade and a complex methodology which includes estimates of growth in \nU.S. trade and worldwide GNP, as well\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\nas other factors. CMA did not ask its own member companies--which \ncollectively produce about 90 percent of all chemicals manufactured in \nthe United States--to provide figures on chemical imports and exports. \nThis would have given us a simple, reliable estimate of the actual \nimpact of CWC nonratification. CMA claims its members consider this \ndata to be confidential and would not provide it, although far more \ndetailed accounting will be required under the CWC.\n  Although CMA has publicly discussed possible business losses from \nnonratification, none of its member companies have informed their \nstockholders of any potential adverse impact.\n  Since the administration pulled the treaty from Senate consideration \nin September 1996 none of the CMA's 193 members have filed an 8-K form \nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC], notifying their \nstockholders of this potential adverse impact and none have discussed \nit in their annual 10-K filings.\n  An 8-K filing is required to ``* * * report the occurrence of any \nmaterial events or corporate changes which are of importance to \ninvestors or security holders and previously have not been reported by \nthe registrant.''\n  Form 10-K is the annual report most companies file with the SEC and \nprovides a comprehensive overview of the firm's business.\n  CMA claims none of its companies are legally required to file such \nforms due to uncertainty over whether the CWC will be ratified and \nsince none of the firms will have more than 10 percent of its sales \naffected by nonratification. The SEC defines material changes as those \nthat affect at least 10 percent of a company's sales. This admission \nfurther undermines their position that nonratification will be \nextremely detrimental to U.S. chemical companies.\n\n  Finally, CMA has not determined the costs to its members for CWC \nimplementation. The increased costs of complying with the treaty's \nreporting requirements and preparing for inspections are substantial. \nAs I mentioned earlier, one Phoenix company estimates it will cost \n$70,000 per year to comply with the treaty's reporting requirements. In \naddition, companies will incur substantial costs to host inspections. \nThe Department of Defense has estimated that the cost of hosting \ninspections of facilities engaged in highly proprietary activities like \nthe production of advanced composite materials ``could be as high as \n$200,000 to $500,000.''\n  When we add up the costs of complying with the CWC's regulatory \nburden, the costs of hosting inspections, the costs from the potential \nloss of confidential business information, and the loss of \nconstitutional protections, its clear that the costs far outweigh the \nbenefits of this treaty.\n\n\n             FOREIGN AND DEFENSE POLICIES HARMED BY THE CWC\n\n  To review, then, all three advantages claimed for this treaty--\nstigmatizing chemical weapons all across the globe, increased \nintelligence, maintaining our competitive advantage in the chemical \ntrade--are either nonexistent or so slight they hardly matter \nconsidering the serious negative consequences of ratifying this treaty. \nI would now like to briefly address the harm to our foreign and defense \npostures were we to accept this agreement in its current form.\n\n\n               The CWC Creates a False Sense of Security\n\n  I believe that we run the risk of reducing the priority of U.S. \nchemical defense programs if we sign on to a weighty moral statement \nand a complicated--but ineffective--effort to outlaw these \nobjectionable weapons. The Department of Defense allocates less than 1 \npercent of its budget to chemical and biological weapons defense \nactivities, and yet annual funding for this area has decreased in real \nterms by over 22 percent since the Persian Gulf conflict, from $792 \nmillion in fiscal year 1992 to $619 million requested for fiscal year \n1998. With chemical weapons defense programs already underfunded, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, \nrecommended in February 1996 that chemical and biological defense \nprograms be slashed by over $1.5 billion through 2003. This \nrecommendation was made only weeks before General Shalikashvili \ntestified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the \nDepartment of Defense [DOD] was committed to a robust chemical defense \nprogram. This is the kind of false sense of security induced by signing \ntreaties such as the CWC.\n\n  It should seem obvious that ratifying this treaty does not mean we \nwill not face a chemical threat. Because of the proliferation of covert \nchemical capabilities, U.S. combat operations may expose military \nforces to lethal chemicals in the future. Any deficiencies in U.S. \nchemical protective, reconnaissance, and decontamination capabilities \nwill exacerbate the likely casualties.\n  This is not a theoretical problem. A 1996 GAO study found that \ndeficiencies in U.S. chemical and biological defense training and \nequipment identified during Operation Desert Storm still remain.\n  In testimony before the House Committee on National Security \nCommittee, the GAO stated, ``The primary cause for deficiencies in \nchemical and biological weapons preparedness is a lack of emphasis up \nand down the line of command in DOD.'' The situation results from the \n``generally lower priority DOD--especially the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nand the war-fighting Commanders-in-Chief--assigns chemical and \nbiological defense as evidenced by limited funding, staffing, and \nmission priority chemical and biological defense activities receive.''\n  If history is any guide, we may well see those vulnerabilities \nincrease. After the Biological Weapons Convention came into force in \n1972, the U.S. biological defense program withered, with funding cut by \n50 percent--not because defenses were outlawed by that treaty, but \nbecause of constant criticism by arms-control advocates who saw them as \ncontrary to the spirit, although not the letter, of the Biological \nWeapons Convention.\n  Given the administration's demonstrated lack of emphasis to chemical \ndefenses, we can expect that when financial cuts are required to meet \ndeclining budgets, funds for hedging against violations of an allegedly \ncomprehensive treaty will make an attractive target.\n\n\n          Treaty Undermines Existing International Instruments\n\n  Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons not only in 1988 against the \nKurds, but earlier in the decade against the Iranian population in the \nIran-Iraq war. It was in the wake of confirmation of Iraq's use of \nchemical agents in 1984 that the Australia Group was formed, to try to \nstop the military use of these substances. The Australia Group regime \nwill be undercut by the more lenient CWC, as I have already indicated. \nAnd that is not the only international instrument that will be undercut \nby this treaty.\n\n\n              U.S.-Russian Bilateral Destruction Agreement\n\n  The U.S. approach to the problem posed by Russia--which does not \nbelong to the Australia Group--has been to hammer out a bilateral \nagreement with that nation. The Bilateral Destruction Agreement of 1990 \nrequires both the United States and Russia to stop producing chemical \nweapons and to reduce their active stockpiles to no more than 5,000 \nmetric tonnes. The United States has begun to destroy its chemical \nweapons. Political turmoil in Russia has made ensuring Russian \ncompliance difficult at best. Moscow has not even begun to reduce its \nstockpile, which is the largest in the world.\n\n  Russia has signed the CWC but not yet ratified. Russian officials can \nnow dangle before United States officials the possibility that the Duma \nwill ratify the CWC some day, and in this way justify Moscow's current \ninaction. Indeed, there are indications that our push to ratify the CWC \nhas moved the Russians toward outright renunciation of the BDA.\n  Compliance with the BDA begins, of course, with truthful and complete \ndeclarations of chemical weapons data. ACDA's 1995 Pell report noted \nthat Russia has refused to accept the BDA's key provisions and has \n``taken a minimalist approach to declaration requirements and \nverification costs of CW production facilities that is inconsistent \nwith the CWC.'' To comply with the 1989 memorandum of understanding \nwith us which led up to the BDA, Russia declared 40,000 metric tonnes \nof agent. This declaration has prompted\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\nchallenges of the veracity of Russian reporting.\n  CIA Director James Woolsey said in June 23, 1994 testimony before the \nForeign Relations Committee that the United States had ``serious \nconcerns over apparent incompleteness, inconsistency and contradictory \naspects of the data'' submitted by Russia under the memorandum of \nunderstanding. On August 27, 1993, Adm. William Studeman, acting CIA \nDirector, wrote to Senator Glenn that ``We cannot confirm that the \nRussian declaration of 40,000 mt is accurate. In addition, we cannot \nconfirm that the total stockpile is stored only at the seven sites \ndeclared by the Soviets.''\n  Reports in the Washington Times (11-8-89) and Washington Post (11-9-\n89) cite Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that the Soviet/Russian \nstockpile could be as large as 75,000 tons.\n  Even more troubling are public reports in the Washington Times and \nWall Street Journal that Russia has developed highly lethal binary \nchemical weapons. Dr. Vil Mirzayanov, former chief of \ncounterintelligence at Russia's State Union Scientific Research \nInstitute for Organic Chemistry and Technology, also published his \nobservations in the October 1995 Stimson Center Report No. 17. Dr. \nMirzayanov reported that Russia has produced a new class of binary \nnerve agents many times more lethal than any other known chemical \nagents: the so-called novichok agents made from chemicals not covered \nby the CWC which are used for industrial or agricultural purposes. He \nfurther reported that Russia continued development of these highly \nlethal binary weapons despite signing the BDA in 1990.\n\n  Dr. Mirzayanov states:\n\n       First, I witnessed the duplicity of Soviet officials during \n     the CWC negotiations. Although the United States stopped \n     producing and testing chemical weapons and signed an \n     agreement with the Soviet Union to that effect in June 1990, \n     the USSR did not stop work.\n\n  In a recent letter to me, Dr. Mirzayanov indicated that, to the best \nof his knowledge, as many as six novichok CW agents may have been \ndeveloped. Dr. Mirzayanov feels so strongly about the threat from these \nnew agents that he supports the CWC under the mistaken impression that \nthe treaty will eliminate these weapons. Unfortunately, the chemicals \nused to make novichok agents are not controlled by the CWC, Russia has \nnot ratified the treaty, and it's unlikely we would be able to detect \nillicit production of the component chemicals of these agents. Our \nintelligence community described this problem in a May 1995 national \nintelligence estimate which concluded that the production of new binary \nagents like the novichok chemicals, ``would be difficult to detect and \nconfirm as a CWC-prohibited activity.''\n  Clinton administration claims that the chemicals used to produce the \nnovichok agents will simply be added to the CWC's list of controlled \nsubstances understate the danger and difficulty of this proposition.\n  Should the United States learn the composition of such agents, it is \nunlikely we would seek to add these chemicals to the CWC annex since \nadding the compounds means making public the chemical structure of the \nagent, thereby undermining efforts to limit the spread of CW expertise \nand knowledge to rogue states.\n  In addition, adding a chemical to the CWC annex is a long, convoluted \nprocess which could take up to 2 years and require the concurrence of \ntwo-thirds of CWC states parties.\n  Finally, the component chemicals of the novichok agents may be so \nwidely used for commercial purposes--like phosgene, which was used as a \nCW agent in World War I--that it may not be practical to add them to \nthe lists of controlled chemicals.\n  The actions of key Russian personnel highlight Russia's lack of \ncommitment to the CWC itself. Lt. Gen. Anatoly Kuntsevich, former \nchairman of the Russian President's Committee on Conventional Problems \nof Chemical and Biological Weapons, was arrested on charges of selling \nmilitary chemicals to Middle East terrorists. Col. Gen. S.V. Petrov \nopenly alluded to the desirability of maintaining a chemical weapons \ncapability in a Russian military journal entitled ``Military Thought.'' \nBoth individuals are high-ranking military signatories to the ``U.S.-\nRussian Work Plan for the Destruction of Russia's Chemical Weapons.''\n\n  With that as our background, we should be very cautious about \nexpecting Russia, even if its legislature should ratify the CWC, to \ntake a new multilateral commitment on chemical weapons seriously.\n\n\n              Proliferation Among Participants in the CWC\n\n  The CWC's potential to facilitate proliferation is not limited to its \npernicious effects on Australia Group controls. It may also undermine \nexisting unilateral United States sanctions against Iran and Cuba. \nChemical exports to Iran were embargoed by the Reagan administration on \nMarch 30, 1984. That embargo is still in force, as is the embargo \nagainst Fidel Castro declared in 1962. The United States imposed \nsecondary sanctions last year on foreign companies that aid the oil \nindustries of Iran or Libya.\n  These kinds of embargoes and sanctions are prohibited among the \nfamily of nations that decide to join this convention. Article XI of \nthe treaty provides that state parties shall:\n\n     Not maintain among themselves any restrictions, including \n     those in any international agreements, incompatible with the \n     obligations undertaken under this Convention, which would \n     restrict or impede trade and the development and promotion of \n     scientific and technological knowledge in the field of \n     chemistry for industrial, agricultural, research, medical, \n     pharmaceutical or other peaceful purposes.\n\n  In other words, if the United States and Iran were to ratify the \nconvention--as Cuba has already done--Teheran would have a powerful \nclaim to override American-led restrictions in the chemical field.\n  Article XI further specifies that states parties shall:\n\n       Undertake to facilitate, and have the right to participate \n     in, the fullest possible exchange of chemicals, equipment and \n     scientific and technical information relating to the \n     development and application of chemistry for purposes not \n     prohibited under this Convention.\n\n  This provision repeats the mistake made in the Nuclear \nNonproliferation Treaty--the so-called Atoms for Peace initiative--\nunder which ostensibly peaceful technology has been provided to nations \nwho then diverted it to proscribed military purposes. Neither a United \nStates trade embargo, nor legislation like the Helms-Burton bill, nor \nthe Australia Group export control regime, nor any other arrangement \ncan interfere with Teheran's or Havana's right to demand access to \nstate-of-the-art chemical manufacturing capabilities.\n  To those who ask, what's the harm of approving this treaty? I think \nit is now clear that the answer is, plenty. It does not erect a barrier \nagainst CW proliferation; in fact, as just noted, it increases the \nlikelihood of proliferation. In this and all of the other ways I have \ndescribed, the convention would be very detrimental to the interests of \nUnited States and its citizens--especially when compared to the anemic \nbenefits of ratification.\n\n\n                       IF NOT THE CWC, THEN WHAT?\n\n  Opponents of the CWC are committed to meaningful efforts to prevent \nthe use of chemical weapons. We should start with first principles.\n\n\n                   Enforcing the 1925 Geneva Protocol\n\n  An effective treaty should be global and verifiable. The 1925 Geneva \nProtocol is both: it covers all nations of concern to the United States \nand, because it outlaws the lethal use of chemical weapons, it is \ninherently verifiable. Victims of use have every reason to expose \ntreaty violations, as the Iranians and the Kurds did. By definition, \noutlawing use is a more realistic goal than the CWC's goal of outlawing \npossession of these common substances. What is necessary--for both \ntreaties--is effective enforcement. In World War II, the enforcement of \nthe Geneva Protocol was the allied leaders' threat to retaliate in kind \nto any chemical attack. The Geneva Protocol was effective during that \nconflict. But it has not been well enforced outside of the context of a \nthreat of retaliation in kind. Such threats fade in effectiveness as \ncivilized nations grow more and more reluctant to contemplate ever \nusing these abhorrent weapons.\n  To make the Protocol more than a ``no first use'' agreement--in other \nwords, to free it of its dependence on a credible threat of retaliation \nin kind--would require states that are party to\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\nit impose strong sanction to any and all violations. This did not \nhappen when Iraq used chemical weapons in the mid-1980's and later in \nthe decade. Diplomats met in 1989 to address the gassing of the Kurds \nand, faced with incontrovertible proof of an abrogation of the Geneva \nProtocol, did not sanction Iraq. Many experts believe that the most \nproductive measure to counteract chemical weapons is to develop \nmeaningful international sanctions that could be added to the Geneva \nProtocol to give it teeth. Had a Geneva Protocol enforcement mechanism \nbeen in place and acted upon when Iraq first used its CW arsenal, \nIraq's further refinement of a chemical war-fighting capability may \nhave been slowed or even halted before Saddam threatened U.S. soldiers \nwith these same weapons during the gulf war.\n  This approach offers a significant advantage: it would resolve the \nverification issue. It is relatively easy to detect use as opposed to \npossession. It is likely that a nation on the receiving end of a \nchemical attack would welcome international inspectors to confirm that \na violation has occurred and to garner worldwide condemnation of the \nperpetrator. The second advantage is that, as I earlier indicated, \nseveral of the nations we are most worried about--that have not \nratified the CWC--have already ratified the Geneva Protocol. I am \nspeaking of Cuba, Iraq, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union.\n\n\n           Pressing Russia to Uphold its Existing Commitments\n\n  In addition, the United States must make a high priority holding \nRussia to its commitments under the 1989 memorandum of understanding \nand the 1990 bilateral agreement to destroy chemical weapons. The \ncurrent administration has not been forceful in making clear we expect \ncompliance. Progress made between the two countries on this issue need \nnot be wasted, if we really mean to do something about chemical \nwarfare.\n\n\n Implementing the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act \n                                (S.495)\n\n  Finally, there are additional steps we can, and should, take. The \nSenate passed on March 20 the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat \nReduction Act (S. 495). This legislation provides a comprehensive \npackage of domestic and international measures aimed at reducing \nchemical, as well as biological, weapons threats to the United States, \nits citizens, its armed forces and those of our allies. It sets forth \npractical and realistic steps to achieve this objective.\n  The act fills important gaps in U.S. law by outlawing the entire \nrange of chemical and biological weapons activities. Quite remarkably, \nthe possession of chemical weapons is not today a criminal offense. S. \n495 corrects that untenable situation, and sets out still criminal, \ncivil, and other penalties the spectrum of chemical and biological \nweapons related activities.\n  The act will also strengthen and reinforce deterrence against the use \nof chemical and biological weapons. Strong controls on trade in these \nweapons, as called for in the legislation, will make it more difficult \nand raise the costs for rogue nations to acquire offensive chemical and \nbiological weapons capabilities. Improvements in U.S. and allied \nchemical and biological defenses, also mandated by the act, will serve \nto devalue the potential political and military utility of these \nweapons by would-be opponents. And the requirement that tough sanctions \nbe imposed against any nation that uses poison gas should reduce the \nchance that such weapons would be used in the first place.\n  S. 495 recognizes that we can't go it alone when it comes to dealing \nwith chemical and biological weapons threats. True, some things we can \nand should do on a unilateral basis. But sensible international action, \nfocused on concrete and achievable measures, must likewise be an \nessential component of our strategy. The legislation encourages our \nallies and potential coalition partners to match our efforts and \nimprove their military capabilities against chemical and biological \nweapons. The legislation also seeks multilateral agreement on \nenforcement mechanisms for the 1925 Geneva Protocol.\n\n  The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act thus \nprovides a sensible and effective plan that CWC critics and proponents \nalike should support. By enacting and implementing the act, the United \nStates will lead by example, and will underscore its commitment to \nbringing together like-minded friends and allies to make unthinkable \nthe resort to chemical or biological weapons.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Arms-control treaties, at the end of the day, are not a substitute \nfor defense preparedness. A treaty as flawed as the Chemical Weapons \nConvention is worth less to our country than the unilateral actions the \nUnited States can and must take to ensure the protection and the \nsurvival of its citizens. The entry into force of the CWC--with or \nwithout American participation--will not bring us a world in which \nthese terrible weapons are no longer manufactured or stockpiled. Nor \ncan we say they will never be used. When words, diplomacy, and \ninternational documents signed with the best of intentions fail to \nprotect populations from the threat of attack with these inhuman \nweapons, every nation falls back upon its ability to preempt or repel \nsuch an attack. It would be irresponsible to let down our guard in this \nrespect, for history has shown us that treaties--even well-crafted \nones--cannot replace the political and military will that are necessary \nto oppose acts of aggression.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3919-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF OWEN WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, too often, it seems good deeds \nand public service go unrecognized while it is precisely the \nproprietors of these acts who hold our communities together. I would \nlike to take a moment to recognize one of these proprietors who I call \nunsung heroes. On Saturday, March 1 of this year, a dear friend and \ncolleague of mine, Owen Williams, and his son, Alfredo, were tragically \nkilled by a drunk driver in my home State of Georgia.\n  Owen was a true hero in my eyes--bright, devout, and committed to his \nwife Carolyn and eight children. A former Vietnam combat veteran, Owen \nwas dedicated to his community, his country, and his God.\n  When I issued a call to action for Georgians to help reduce the \nrising tide of teen drug use, Owen was one of the first to answer. He \nserved in a volunteer capacity as chairman of the Bibb County Operation \nDrug Free Georgia Committee and was making great strides in his \ncommunity with the program.\n  This Saturday, at our second annual statewide drug summit, which is \ndedicated to the memory of Owen and Alfredo, I will present the First \nAmerican Hero Award to Owen's family for the great contributions he \nmade to those around him. It has been said that the mark of a great man \nis that his deeds touch the lives of others even after he is gone. I \nknow this will be true of Owen. This is a tragic loss, particularly for \nme, but the work that Owen has done will continue to serve as an \ninspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3926-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3926-S3927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDES SECURITY (CHIPS) ACT\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, tomorrow, May 2, we will dedicate a \nmemorial on the Tidal Basin in West Potomac Park to one of America's \ngreatest Presidents, a towering figure in the history of the 20th \ncentury, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n  A memorial to FDR was first proposed in the Congress as early as \n1946. The FDR Memorial Commission was finally established, by law, in \n1955. It has taken 42 years to complete this effort. I am proud to have \nserved on the Memorial Commission. Tomorrow, will be a great day for \nAmericans, a day to look back and remember FDR, his enormous \ncontribution to all of our lives and the contribution of the generation \nof Americans who struggled through the depression and valiantly \ndefeated fascism; a day to admire the beauty and to be inspired by the \nart of this great new addition to our capital city's memorials; and a \nday to contemplate America's future and the contribution that this \nmemorial will make to the understanding that future generations will \nhave of one of the most critical eras of our history.\n  This memorial is a expression of what America is all about. It is \nwhat America can do to overcome challenges of depression and war. \nRoosevelt imbued hope and he instilled optimism in a people who were \ndown and out in a depression and then attacked when we were down, by \nJapan at Pearl Harbor.\n  Franklin Roosevelt was an inspirational leader because of his \noptimism in the face of the long odds our Nation faced. He was our \nvoice. He reflected our hopes. He continues to inspire us today because \nhe showed what we can do when we pull together as a people. And, this \nnew memorial will help to keep FDR's legacy inspiring Americans for the \ncenturies ahead.\n  Roosevelt saw the positive role of Government in the economy, pulling \nus out of the depression and in times of a world war, when we had to \npull together. But he was also willing to experiment. He was not \nsomebody who would hang onto a program if it wasn't working. He \nbelieved that Government programs could make a positive difference. And \nthey did for millions. But he also believed that if Government programs \nwere not working that we\n\n[[Page S3928]]\n\nshould either make them work or drop them. This is a model we would do \nwell to keep in mind in the weeks, and the years ahead as Congress \ngrapples with the difficult problems of balancing the needs of people, \nand the role of Government in addressing those needs with the demands \nof fiscal responsibility.\n  The memorial will also honor the memory and contributions of the \nFirst Lady who as the eyes and ears of the President traveled hundreds \nof thousands of miles visiting Americans in every walk of life.\n  Mr. President, I want to mention a few of my own memories of F.D.R. \nDuring the Roosevelt years, I was a young boy, but I can clearly \nremember the strength of his voice in those fireside chats. And I \nremember the conversation around the family's dinner table about what a \ngreat leader he was.\n  I remember scouting the streets for discarded empty cigarette packs. \nThis was something kids did. We stripped off the tin foil linings and \nbrought them to school where they were rolled together to create large \nballs of the metal, which could be recycled for the war effort. This \ngave us an enormous sense of being a part of the effort and of \nresponding to Roosevelt's call for participation.\n  And, I remember his dog, Fala. Especially for a young boy Fala was a \nbig part of the Roosevelt persona. That's why, when I noted the fact \nthat his dog, which meant so much to him and to the Nation, which was \nsuch a symbol of his warmth and humanity, was left out of the monument, \nI suggested Fala be represented in the memorial and the commission \nagreed. So, tomorrow as the statues of Franklin and of Eleanor are \nunveiled, a little statue of Fala, recognizing his historic role, will \nalso be there as well, helping to connect FDR to future generations of \nvisitors, especially our kids and grandkids.\n  Mr. President, now I would like to honor the memory of this great \nAmerican President by reading some of the anecdotes and sentiments of \npeople from Michigan, where he is well remembered by seniors and \nveterans, and even by many who know him only from film and audio tape, \nbut remembered with reverence and often with at least one tear in the \neye.\n  I have asked my constituents in Michigan to send to me some of their \nremembrances of FDR. I have received many moving and inspiring stories. \nI want to share some of those with my colleagues in the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3927-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3928-S3929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       Michigan Remembers F.D.R.\n\n       Back in the 1920's, my father Alfred Angeli and a number of \n     his friends came over to this country to escape the Fascism \n     and Communism in Italy. They found a new life here in America \n     and they adored Franklin Delano Roosevelt. They had great \n     respect for him for the job he did in creating jobs and \n     putting everybody back to work.\n       My father and about eight of his friends were very serious \n     in their respect for FDR, and honored him by naming their \n     hunting camp 'Campobello'. It was a very sad day when the \n     great man died. * * * My parents, who are now gone, would be \n     very proud to know they are taking part in this tribute to \n     Mr. Roosevelt.--Mike Angeli, Marquette, Michigan.\n       About ten years ago, I appeared before the county board to \n     obtain approval for a grant to fund a senior citizens feeding \n     program. The chairman of the board got very upset calling me \n     something like ``a big spending-liberal-government interferer \n     * * * (like FDR)''. I told him I'm not old enough to have \n     served with President Roosevelt, but that he is an idol of \n     mine and that I was extremely honored to have been put in the \n     same category.--Ron Calery, Chippewa-Mackinac-Luce Community, \n     Action Agency Director, Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.\n       When FDR ran, the stock market had crashed and times were \n     tough. There were no jobs and no money. Hoover ran on a \n     platform of ``a chicken in every pot'', but people wanted a \n     job. Roosevelt won in a landslide, after he said he would put \n     people back to work. He did just that.\n       Everyone had bills, and few people had the money to pay \n     them. So a situation was created where people could work off \n     their bills. If you had to go to the hospital while on \n     welfare, you worked the bill off with the city by sweeping \n     streets or picking up trash or cleaning the parks. Each time \n     you worked, you would reduce your bill. Though there were \n     years we didn't have two nickels to rub together, we \n     survived.--Arthur Carron, Bark River, Michigan.\n       FDR literally transformed the country from a feeling of \n     overwhelming despair to hope and confidence. When Roosevelt \n     was elected I was approaching my 16th birthday. On the west \n     side of Detroit in a neighborhood of autoworkers practically \n     everyone was jobless. The giant Ford Rouge plant was working \n     at 25 percent of capacity. Other auto companies and all of \n     the auto supplier companies were in a similar situation. My \n     father and the fathers of all my boyhood friends were \n     unemployed. Men who were really willing and anxious to work. \n     There was a feeling of desperation and hopelessness. Most \n     important of all they lost their sense of dignity when they \n     could not provide for their families. Roosevelt, through the \n     various governmental programs, gave these men hope and a \n     sense of well being they had not experienced for some time.--\n     Doug Fraser, Professor of Labor Studies, Wayne State U., \n     Former President of U.A.W., Northville, Michigan.\n       Oliver Wendell Holmes once said, ``A man's mind stretched \n     by a new idea, will never return to its former dimension.'' I \n     was one of those fortunate unemployed young men who joined \n     with over three million other destitute kids and signed up \n     with the Civilian Conservation Corps.\n       It seems that FDR scratched out his C.C.C. idea on a \n     restaurant napkin. This vision was an unprecedented gamble in \n     bringing a bankrupt nation back on its feet. I was one of \n     those three million who was lifted from the depths of \n     despair, each given a chance to earn self-respect, dignity \n     and self-esteem. How does a nation measure a dimension such \n     as that? Just consider the families that these men \n     represented, grateful for the monthly $25.00 and the succor \n     it supplied.\n       I can testify to that. Sixty-four years ago when men's \n     spirits were tested by want and deprivation, it seems like \n     only yesterday that I walked into that welfare office. I was \n     not afraid of the hunger, but the indignity it caused. I felt \n     not a pain in my stomach, but an ache in my heart. . .I was \n     sworn into the C.C.C. Now, I was accepted, now I could say, \n     ``Hello to tomorrow''. I became a member of an idea whose \n     time had come. Roosevelt's tree army.--Rev. Bill Fraser, \n     First V.P. National Assoc. of C.C.C. Alumni, Grayling, \n     Michigan.\n       My mother named me Franklin Delano Garrison in his honor. \n     From the time I was a small child I took a great pride in \n     being named for someone who was a hero to everyone I knew, \n     even though at first I wasn't really sure why. Then I came to \n     understand that my family was eating only because the New \n     Deal was providing some food assistance, and my father was \n     working only because the Works Progress Administration was \n     providing jobs. I came to see for myself the hardships that \n     the Depression had brought to the old, the hungry and the \n     deserted--and to realize that one man had led the nation in \n     providing not only sustenance but also hope where both had \n     been lost.--Franklin Delano Garrison, President, Michigan \n     State AFL-CIO, Lansing, Michigan.\n       I am very happy that President Roosevelt is finally having \n     a memorial dedicated in his honor. I am 83 years old and \n     lived through the Depression, and know how bad times were. \n     Before the election of President Roosevelt, I worked on \n     welfare for $2.00 a day for an eight hour shift.\n       With President Roosevelt's election times got better. With \n     the New Deal of the WPA, I got $22.00 a week for a four day \n     six hour shift. I will always be grateful to President \n     Roosevelt for social security, unemployment benefits and \n     being able to unionize for better wages and benefits and to \n     protect jobs. President Roosevelt will always be my idol.--\n     Rudy Gregorich, Painesdale, Michigan.\n       We members of the Eighth Armored Division had been on the \n     march, without a break, around the clock, for days--sometimes \n     unopposed, in other places, held up by the familiar and \n     bitter last-ditch Nazi resistance.\n       At last, late one morning, a halt was signaled. We \n     dropped--dirty, hungry, and almost unconscious--and slept, \n     some in the ditches along the road, others stretched out on \n     the rear decks of their tanks, others where they sat in tank \n     turrets, in half tracks, or on truck seats.\n       Then a startling message started down the line from the \n     lead vehicle, which had a short-wave radio. Men, as they \n     heard it, shook the next man awake and passed it on: \n     President Roosevelt was dead.\n       In a sense, President Roosevelt was a soldier in that \n     fight--just like us. And like us, this good man was \n     exhausted. He was a casualty of the war. But he had the \n     satisfaction of knowing that he left the field with the \n     battle well in hand.--Jack R. Hendrickson, Ph.D., Birmingham, \n     Michigan.\n       The year may have been 1932, or 1934, and my mother a widow \n     of some 60 years had been left well-provided for by my father \n     at his death in 1931. But the Great Depression struck the USA \n     and its economy was stagnant, mired down, seemingly unable to \n     extricate itself from the doldrums it found itself caught in \n     . . .\n       It was a time of calamity, of no one knowing quite what to \n     do. Mother had never experienced this type of emergency in \n     her long life. There was little or no relief in sight. Radio \n     broadcasts were discouraging and gave no hint of the end of \n     the Depression in sight. My sister, married with three little \n     ones, recalls walking three or more miles to obtain \n     government free food and carrying it home, walking as she had \n     come.\n       The one light on the horizon in the midst of this gloom was \n     the radio program when President Delano Roosevelt, elected a \n     few months previously, would address the people in his famous \n     fireside chats. His voice soothing, deep-textured, commanding \n     confidence as he spoke words of optimism were most welcome by \n     the bewildered public. ``We have nothing to fear, except fear \n     itself,'' he said on one momentous occasion. How the people\n\n[[Page S3929]]\n\n     clung to his words bearing hope that this President of the \n     United States instilled over the air. As someone noted sixty \n     years later, FDR could not raise himself from a chair, but by \n     moral strength was able to lift a great nation out of the \n     Depression in the Thirties! All America hung onto his words, \n     hung on to the confidence he instilled, in their government, \n     in their country, awaiting with patience for the clouds of \n     Depression to lift!--Dr. Marie Heyda, O.P., Grand Rapids \n     Dominicans, Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n       My younger sister was in the wars and had the honor of \n     meeting President Roosevelt at his summer home.\n       I feel that FDR was one of the greatest presidents that \n     ever lived. Even though he was so educated, he still was for \n     the average person. He did so much for the people while in \n     office.--Kathryn V. Holden, Saginaw, Michigan.\n       * * * 1940. I was pregnant * * * and Newman, my husband, \n     was working for Labor's Nonpartisan League in the office of \n     the Philadelphia Joint Board, Amalgamated Clothing Workers of \n     America, 2000 South Street.\n       Since I was not working and had no child care needs, I was \n     a volunteer in the office, handing out literature at rallies \n     and some house to house visiting in North Philly, in the \n     Kensington area and a bit in South Philly.\n       Our work culminated in a huge rally for the President in \n     the stadium, shortly before the election. It was raining and \n     my husband and friends did not think I should go. But I did, \n     and it was the most impressive, exciting and largest rally I \n     ever participated in.\n       My labor came early, and daughter Sharon was born at St. \n     Luke's Hospital November 3, the election was the next day * * \n     * Since I had made no plans for an absentee ballot and there \n     was no way I could get one of those days, I missed my \n     opportunity to vote for the third term of FDR. The only time \n     in my life I have failed to vote in an election either \n     primary or general.--Mildred Jeffrey, Detroit, Michigan.\n       When the 73rd Congress opened * * * FDR bombarded Congress \n     with bills to stimulate the economy. During his first month \n     in office, he used his authority * * * to establish the \n     Public Works Administration which helped my father while laid \n     off from the railroad for about a year.--Leonard Klemm, \n     Saginaw, Michigan.\n       President Roosevelt really left a great impact upon our \n     country. He came into office at the time of the Great \n     Depression and did much to relieve the suffering of the \n     people and to restore confidence in our banking system and \n     the Government in general. He won great respect through his \n     fireside chats, radio connection and as the first President \n     to address the nation on national television.--B.L. Little, \n     Saginaw, Michigan.\n       I had only one personal encounter with President Roosevelt, \n     but it is one I can recall quite vividly even today. * * * \n     FDR had been campaigning for reelection that day in New \n     England, but the end of the day had brought him to New York. \n     By chance we saw his motorcade, which couldn't have been more \n     than two or three cars.\n       He rode in an open car, and I can still see him waving his \n     hat and smiling as he passed by. He was an inspiration to me \n     then and he continues to inspire me today.--William G. \n     Milliken, Former Michigan Governor, Traverse City, Michigan.\n       I became aware that President Roosevelt was planning to \n     recruit thousands of youths between ages 18 and 25 to serve \n     in forestry camps throughout the nation to perform tasks, \n     such as planting trees, building roads, erosion control, \n     fighting forest fires, miles of fire trails and telephone \n     lines strung, and other conservation related work.\n       I had just turned 18 when I heard about the program, and at \n     the time was a barber's apprentice in Cascade, Michigan * * * \n     The Civilian Conservation Corps sounded like the answer to my \n     situation, and I immediately made myself available. * * *\n       After leaving the C.C.C. camps, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy \n     * * *  While assigned to the Sick Officer's Ward, I was \n     attendant to then Secretary of the Navy, Claude Swanson. \n     During that time President Roosevelt visited Swanson twice * \n     * *  This was a great honor for me to have the opportunity to \n     stand close to the President of the United States.\n       * * * Following a military career, I became involved in \n     organizing a civilian conservation corps alumni group here in \n     Grand Rapids, Michigan. * * *  with the support of the C.C.C. \n     Alumni veterans, was able to convince Governor Blanchard, and \n     the state legislature, to establish a Michigan Civilian \n     Conservation Corps patterned after Roosevelt's depression era \n     C.C.C. program.--Frank Munger, Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n       My uncle, Billy Rogers, living in Chicago, was one of the \n     many. No job, no money and dependent on the small income of \n     his mother gave him little hope for the future. Thank God for \n     the C.C.C.! They took him in--fed and clothed him, taught him \n     the value of manual labor and gave him a sense of pride. \n     Friendships made in camp endured for many years.\n       Diligent work and a cheerful attitude earned him the most \n     coveted job in camp: truck driver! After completing his \n     enrollment, he returned to Chicago. Due to his experience, he \n     was eligible to join the Teamsters Union and continued \n     working as an over-the-road truck driver until he retired. \n     All this due to the vision and persistence of one man--\n     F.D.R.!--William Oberschmidt, Saginaw, Michigan.\n       * * * on April 12, 1945. I was 13 years old at the time and \n     I remember the nuns grieving at school and how sad everyone \n     felt. It's about all anyone talked about or what you heard on \n     the radio.\n       I don't think I understood the full impact of what \n     Roosevelt had accomplished until I was stationed in the \n     Pacific during the Korean War. I spent time on many of the \n     Pacific Islands where the war took place and it made me \n     realize what he had done to guide us through the second World \n     War * * *--Jack Salter, Royal Oak, Michigan.\n       As a public official, I have given a lot of thought to the \n     question of leadership. What is leadership and how does it \n     manifest itself in public life? Although the answer to that \n     question is far from clear or simple, it seems to be embodied \n     in the memory of the person I consider our nation's greatest \n     president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n       My father was one of the millions who found themselves out \n     of work after the Crash of 1929. He directly benefited from \n     President Roosevelt's policies, taking part in the Civilian \n     Conservation Corps. That program helped my dad get back on \n     his feet, giving him, along with millions of others, hope and \n     purpose at a time when both seemed in short supply.\n       Years later, facing another crisis--World War II--President \n     Roosevelt came to my hometown, Warren, to visit the tank \n     plant that was then producing Sherman Tanks by the thousands. \n     Moved by the sacrifice, commitment and ingenuity of the \n     people of southeast Michigan working to ensure that Naziism \n     was defeated, he dubbed that plant the ``Arsenal of \n     Democracy.''\n       Now we in Warren are trying to follow his example, as we \n     work to transform the recently abandoned tank plant into a \n     new kind of arsenal: an arsenal for economic growth. As I go \n     to work each day, I frequently ask myself what President \n     Roosevelt would have done with today's issues. Looking at the \n     future of his Arsenal for Democracy, I believe that FDR would \n     be pleased.--Mark A. Steenbergh, Mayor, City of Warren, \n     Warren, Michigan.\n       My father subscribed to the Chicago Tribune during the \n     depression since it was the cheapest paper in town at two \n     cents a copy. The Tribune had cartoonist by the name of \n     `Orr'. His cartoon appeared on the front page of the Tribune \n     and more often than not, his work of art was a slam against \n     President Roosevelt. As it turned out, the subscription was a \n     bad deal for my father, because my mother, being a staunch \n     Democrat and a supporter of FDR, would wait for the mailman \n     and promptly put the paper in the stove.--James F. Sodergren, \n     Marquette County Treasurer, Ishpeming, Michigan.\n       I was a high school teacher during the Great Depression. \n     According to my memory, the American people had great faith \n     and believed that our President would do what was best for \n     the ``common good.'' We listened carefully and with pride to \n     his fireside chats. * * *\n       And today, as we drive over miles of paved roads in \n     northern Michigan, we marvel at the lines of majestic \n     evergreens --so beautiful in summer and effective snow-\n     barriers in winter! I relate with pride the work of the \n     C.C.C., that group of younger men who earned their livelihood \n     at that time by beautifying and preserving Michigan's natural \n     environment. Roosevelt's foresight has kept Michigan a \n     wonderful state!--Sister Agnes Thiel, O.P., Grand Rapids \n     Dominicans, Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/01/senate-section/article/S3928-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENTS OF JACKIE ROBINSON\n\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 29, \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Inouye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 29) to direct the Secretary \n     of the Interior to design and construct a permanent addition \n     to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial in Washington, \n     D.C., and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the joint resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, at the request of President Clinton, I \nrise to introduce legislation which directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to plan for the design and construction of a permanent \naddition to the Franklin Delano Roosevelt [FDR] Memorial.\n  The FDR Memorial Commission was organized in 1955 for the purpose of \nconsidering and formulating plans for the design, construction, and \nlocation of a permanent memorial to President Roosevelt. I have had the \ndistinct pleasure of serving on the Commission for 27 years along with \nour former colleague, Senator Mark O. Hatfield.\n  The FDR Memorial will be dedicated on Friday, May 2, 1997. This \nmemorial represents a plan and design that has undergone extensive \nreview and study by the Commission of Fine Arts, the National Park \nService, the Department of the Interior, and the Congress. After 23 \nyears, and three design competitions, one of which bestowed a $50,000 \naward, the final design for the memorial was approved in 1978.\n  Approximately 2 years ago, after all design plans were approved, all \nfunding appropriated by the Congress, and the construction of the \nmemorial was well underway, the disabled community made a demand that \nthe Commission add another statue of FDR in a wheelchair. In the early \ndays, the children of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt made it clear they \nwanted no statue showing President Roosevelt in a wheelchair. I might \nadd that during the approval process no member of the disabled \ncommunity came forth to request the Commission amend the design plans \nfor the memorial.\n  However, in an effort to be sensitive to their concerns yet \nhistorically accurate, the Commission agreed to display an exact \nreplica of one of President Roosevelt's wheelchairs in the entry \nbuilding of the memorial. It was determined that existing wheelchairs \nare too fragile to be loaned to the memorial. Consequently, Senator \nHatfield and I instructed the National Park Service to prepare for \ndisplay an exact replica of one of President Roosevelt's wheelchairs. A \ncabinetmaker is building the chair and other wooden parts, a wheelmaker \nis producing 18-inch rims and tires and a metalsmith is assembling the \ncompleted chair.\n  In addition, in the memorial's entry building there will be a display \nof mounted photographs of President Roosevelt, including one of the two \nknown photographs of him in a wheelchair. The photograph to be \ndisplayed will be 12 inches tall and 9 inches wide. Also included in \nthe memorial is a time line of the major events of FDR's life, carved \nin granite, which states: ``1921 stricken with poliomyelitis--he never \nagain walked unaided.''\n  The Commission tried its best to ensure that the initial wishes of \nthe Roosevelt family were carried out, along with the design plans \napproved by the Commission of Fine Arts. The Commission has also tried \nto be sensitive to the concerns of those citizens having to spend their \nlives in a wheelchair. It is true that the depiction of President \nRoosevelt in a wheelchair will inspire the tragically afflicted. It may \nvery well be a more honest way to depict President Roosevelt.\n  Accordingly, at President Clinton's request, I am pleased to \nintroduce this legislation which directs the Secretary of the Interior \nto plan for the design and construction of a permanent addition to the \nFDR Memorial, and I thank my colleagues for their support and in the \nSenate acting expeditiously.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with my good \nfriend and colleague Senator Inouye in introducing legislation \nsubmitted by the Clinton administration to require the addition of a \nstatue portraying FDR and his disability. This is an important measure \nthat I hope will be quickly approved.\n  I have always said that it took a disabled President to lead a \ndisabled nation. President Clinton has taken the right step in \nimproving the FDR Memorial by allowing Americans to view a more \ncomplete picture of one of our Nation's greatest Presidents.\n  I look forward to the long-awaited dedication of the FDR Memorial \nthis Friday. I have long thought this very important new memorial \nshould include a statue depicting FDR in a wheelchair. Contrary to \npopular belief, President Roosevelt did at times purposely display his \ndisability to inspire wounded veterans, persons with polio, and other \ngroups of Americans. A statue portraying his disability will stand as a \nreminder to current and future generations of Americans that disability \nis a natural part of the human experience that in no way diminishes the \nability of a person to fully participate in all aspects of American \nlife.\n  As the author of the Americans With Disabilities Act, I was proud to \nbe joined by leaders of the disability community, former Presidents \nBush, Carter, and Ford, a number of Roosevelt's descendants, and many \nother Americans in calling for a permanent depiction of FDR with his \ndisability at the memorial. Our challenge now is to take the necessary \nsteps to make this additional statue part of the FDR Memorial as soon \nas possible.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the joint \nresolution be considered read a third time and passed, the preamble be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the joint resolution appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 29) was deemed read the third time \nand passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The joint resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 29\n\n       Whereas President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, after \n     contracting poliomyelitis, required the use of a wheelchair \n     for mobility and lived with this condition while leading the \n     United States through some of its most difficult times; and\n       Whereas President Roosevelt's courage, leadership, and \n     success should serve as an example and inspiration for all \n     Americans: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
