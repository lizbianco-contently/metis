Therefore, I am advising the \nCongress that the national emergency declared on November 14, 1994, and \nextended on November 14, 1995 and November 14, 1996, must continue in \neffect beyond November 14, 1997. Accordingly, I have extended the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 12938 and have sent the \nattached notice of extension to the Federal Register for publication.\n  The following report is made pursuant to section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and \nsection 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), \nregarding activities taken and money spent pursuant to the emergency \ndeclaration. Additional information on nuclear, missile, and/or \nchemical and biological weapons [CBW] nonproliferation efforts is \ncontained in the most recent annual Report on the Proliferation of \nMissiles and Essential Components of Nuclear, Biological and Chemical \nWeapons, provided to the Congress pursuant to section 1097 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993 \n(Public Law 102-190), also known as the ``Nonproliferation Report,'' \nand the most recent annual report provided to the Congress pursuant to \nsection 308 of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare \nElimination Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-182), also known as the ``CBW \nReport.''\n\n\n                    Chemical and biological weapons\n\n  The three export control regulations issued under the Enhanced \nProliferation Control Initiatives [EPCI] remained fully in force and \ncontinue to be applied in order to control the export of items with \npotential used in chemical or biological weapons or unmanned delivery \nsystems for weapons of mass destruction.\n  Chemical weapons continue to pose a very serious threat to our \nsecurity and that of countries friendly to us. On April 29, 1997, the \nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction (the \n``Chemical Weapons Convention'' or [CWC]) entered into force with 87 of \nthe CWC's 165 signatories as original States Parties. The United States \nwas among their number, having deposited its instrument of ratification \non April 25. As of November 5, 104 countries had become States Parties.\n  Russia did not complete its legislative approval process in time to \nbe among the original CWC States Parties. In our March meeting in \nHelsinki, President Yeltsin did, however, assure me of his \nunderstanding of the importance of the CWC to Russia's own security. On \nOctober 31, 1997, the Russian Duma (lower house) approved ratification \nof the CWC. On November 5, 1997, the Russian Federation Council \nunanimously approved the CWC and the Russian government deposited its \ninstrument of ratification. Russia's ratification makes it possible for \nRussia to join the United States in playing a leadership role in \nensuring that all of the Convention's benefits are realized.\n  Given Russia's financial situation during this difficult period of \ntransition to a market economy, serious concerns have been raised about \nthe high costs of environmentally sound destruction of the large stocks \nof chemical weapons Russia inherited from the former Soviet Union. \nThrough the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, we are working with \nRussia to help address these complex problems, and we will continue to \ndo so now that Russia has ratified the CWC.\n  The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW] has \nbeen established to achieve the object and purpose of the CWC, to \nensure the implementation of its provisions and provide a forum for \nconsultation and cooperation among States Parties. The executive organ \nof the OPCW, the Executive Council, has met five times since May to \noversee decisions related to inter alia data declarations, inspections, \nand organizational issues. The United States plays an active role in \nensuring effective implementation of the Convention.\n  The CWC is an ambitious undertaking by the world community to ban an\n\n[[Page S12505]]\n\nentire class of weapons of mass destruction. Its members have committed \nthemselves to totally eliminating chemical weapons stocks and \nproduction facilities, prohibiting chemical weapons-related activities, \nbanning assistance for such activities and restricting trade with non-\nParties in certain relevant chemicals. Destruction of U.S. chemical \nweapons stocks is moving forward. Other CWC States Parties have now \ntaken on a similar task, and we are working hard with the other members \nof the CWC to make membership in this treaty universal.\n  The United States is determined to ensure full implementation of the \nconcrete measures in the CWC that will raise the costs and the risks \nfor any state or terrorist attempting to engage in chemical weapons-\nrelated activities. The CWC's declaration requirements will improve our \nknowledge of possible chemical weapons activities, whether conducted by \ncountries or terrorists. Its inspection provisions provide for access \nto declared and undeclared facilities and locations, thus making \nclandestine chemical weapons production and stockpiling more difficult, \nmore risky, and more expensive.\n  Countries that refuse to join the CWC will be politically isolated \nand banned from trading with States Parties in certain key chemicals. \nThe relevant Treaty provision is specifically designed to penalize in a \nconcrete way countries that refuse to join the rest of the world in \neliminating the threat of chemical weapons.\n  The United States also continues to play a leading role in the \ninternational effort to reduce the threat from biological weapons. We \nare an active participant in the Ad Hoc Group striving to create a \nlegally binding protocol to strengthen and enhance compliance with the \nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and \nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on \nTheir Destruction (the ``Biological Weapons Convention'' or (BWC)). \nThis Ad Hoc Group was mandated by the September 1994 BWC Special \nConference. The Fourth BWC Review Conference, held in November 1996, \ncommended the work done by the Ad Hoc Group and urged it to complete \nthe protocol as soon as possible but not later than the next Review \nConference to be held in 2001. A draft rolling text was introduced by \nthe Chairman at the July Ad Hoc Group session. Work is progressing on \ninsertion of national views and clarification of existing text, largely \ndrawn from the consultative phase of Ad Hoc Group work since 1994. \nThree-week sessions are scheduled for January, July, and September of \n1998. Another 2-week session will be scheduled for either March or \nDecember of 1998. Early completion of an effective BWC protocol is high \non our list of nonproliferation goals.\n  The United States continues to be a leader in the Australia Group \n[AG] chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation regime. Last \nyear, the United States supported the entry into the AG of the Republic \nof Korea, which became the group's 30th member in time for the October \n1996 plenary.\n\n  The United States attended this year's annual AG plenary session from \nOctober 6-9, 1997, during which the Group continued to focus on \nstrengthening AG export controls and sharing information to address the \nthreat of CBW terrorism. At the behest of the United States, the AG \nfirst began in-depth political-level discussion of CBW terrorism during \nthe 1995 plenary session following the Tokyo subway nerve gas attack \nearlier that year. At the 1996 plenary, the United States urged AG \nmembers to exchange national points of contact for AG terrorism \nmatters. At the 1997 plenary, the AG accepted a U.S. proposal to survey \nall AG members on efforts each has taken to counter this threat.\n  The Group also reaffirmed the members' collective belief that full \nadherence to the CWC and the BWC is the best way to achieve permanent \nglobal elimination of CBW, and that all states adhering to these \nConventions have an obligation to ensure that their national activities \nsupport this goal.\n  AG participants continue to seek to ensure that all relevant national \nmeasures promote the object and purposes of the BWC and CWC. The AG \nnations reaffirmed their belief that existing national export licensing \npolicies and chemical weapons-related items fulfill the obligation \nestablished under Article I of the CWC that States Parties never \nassist, in any way, the acquisition of chemical weapons. Given this \nunderstanding, the AG members also reaffirmed their commitment to \ncontinuing the Group's activities now that the CWC has entered into \nforce.\n  The AG also reaffirmed its commitment to continue to provide \nbriefings for non-AG countries, and to promote regional consultations \non export controls and nonproliferation to further awareness and \nunderstanding of national policies in these areas.\n  During the last 6 months, we continued to examine closely \nintelligence and other reports of trade in chemical weapons-related \nmaterial and technology that might require action, including evaluating \nwhether sanctions under the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and \nWarfare Elimination Act of 1991 were warranted. In May 1997, we imposed \nsanctions on seven Chinese entities and one Hong Kong company for \nknowingly and materially contributing to Iran's CW program through the \nexport of dual-use chemical precursors and/or chemical production \nequipment and technology. In September 1997, we imposed sanctions on a \nGerman citizen and a German company determined to have been involved in \nthe export of chemical production equipment to Libya's CW program.\n  The United States continues to cooperate with its AG partners in \nstopping shipments of proliferation concern. By sharing information \nthrough diplomatic and other channels, we and our AG partners have been \nsuccessful in interdicting various shipments destined to CBW programs.\n\n\n           missiles for weapons of mass destruction delivery\n\n  During the reporting period, the United States carefully controlled \nexports that could contribute to unmanned delivery systems for weapons \nof mass destruction and closely monitored activities of potential \nmissile proliferation concern. We also continued to implement U.S. \nmissile sanctions law, in cases where sanctionable activity was \ndetermined to have occurred. In August 1997, we imposed sanctions \nagainst two North Korean entities determined to have engaged in missile \nproliferation activities. Similar sanctions imposed in May 1996 remain \nin effect against two entities in Iran and one entity in North Korea \nfor transfers involving Category II Missile Technology Control Regime \n[MTCR] Annex items.\n  During this reporting period, MTCR Partners continued to share \ninformation about proliferation problems with each other and with other \npotential supplier, consumer, and transshipment states. Partners also \nemphasized the need for implementing effective export control systems. \nThis cooperation has resulted in the interdiction of missile-related \nmaterials intended for use in missile programs of concern.\n\n  The United States was an active participant in the MTCR's June 1997 \nReinforced Point of Contact Meeting [RPOC]. At the RPOC, MTCR Parnters \nengaged in useful discussions of regional missile proliferation \nconcerns, as well as steps the Partners could take to increase \ntransparency and outreach to nonmembers.\n  In July 1997, the United States also played a leading role at the \nSwiss-hosted MTCR workshop on the licensing and enforcement aspects of \ntransshipment. The workshop was successful in focusing attention on the \nenforcement problems raised by proliferators' misuse of transshipment \nand fostered a productive exchange of ideas on how countries can better \naddress such activity.\n  The United States worked unilaterally and in coordination with its \nMTCR Partners to combat missile proliferation and to encourage \nnonmembers to export responsibly and to adhere to the MTCR Guidelines. \nSince the last report, we have continued our missile nonproliferation \ndialogue with China, the Republic of Korea [ROK], North Korea [DPRK], \nand Ukraine. In the course of normal diplomatic relations, we also have \npursued such discussions with other countries in Central Europe, the \nMiddle East, and Asia.\n  In June 1997, the United States and the DPRK held a second round of \nmissile talks, aimed at freezing the DPRK's indigenous missile \ndevelopment program and curtailing its missile-related export \nactivities. The\n\n[[Page S12506]]\n\nDPRK appeared willing to consider limits on its missile-related \nexports, in return for sanctions-easing measures, but did not engage in \ndiscussion of limits on its missile development program. We intend to \npursue further missile talks with the DPRK.\n  In July 1997, we held another round of nonproliferation talks with \nthe ROK. These talks were productive and made progress toward \nfacilitating ROK membership in the MTCR.\n  In response to reports that Iran had acquired sensitive items from \nRussian entities for use in Iran's missile development program, the \nUnited States intensified its high-level dialogue with Russia on this \nissue. We held a number of productive discussions with senior Russian \nofficials aimed at finding ways the United States and Russia can work \ntogether to prevent Iran's ballistic missile development program from \nacquiring Russian technology and equipment. This process is continuing.\n\n\n                            Nuclear Weapons\n\n  In a truly historic landmark in our efforts to curb the spread of \nnuclear weapons, the 50th U.N. General Assembly on September 10, 1996, \nadopted and called for signature of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban \nTreaty [CTBT], negotiated over the previous 2\\1/2\\ years in the \nConference on Disarmament in Geneva. The overwhelming passage of this \nU.N. resolution (158-3-5) demonstrates the CTBT's strong international \nsupport and marks a major success for United States foreign policy. On \nSeptember 24, 1996, I and other international leaders signed the CTBT \nin New York.\n  During 1997, CTBT signatories have conducted numerous meetings of the \nPreparatory Commission in Vienna, seeking to promote rapid completion \nof the International Monitoring System established by the Treaty. On \nSeptember 23, I transmitted the CTBT to the Senate, requesting prompt \nadvice and consent to ratification.\n  The CTBT will serve several United States national security interests \nin banning all nuclear explosions. It will constrain the development \nand qualitative improvement of nuclear weapons; end the development of \nadvanced new types; contribute to the prevention of nuclear \nproliferation and the process of nuclear disarmament; and strengthen \ninternational peace and security. The CTBT marks an historic milestone \nin our drive to reduce the nuclear threat and to build a safer world.\n\n  Formal preparations for the year 2000 Review Conference for the \nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [NPT] began in 1997 \nwith the first of three annual Preparatory Committee meetings of the \nParties to the Treaty. The United States is committed to working to \nensure that the 2000 NPT review Conference will further strengthen the \nNPT and reinforce global nuclear nonproliferation objectives. Since the \n1995 NPT Conference, eight additional states have joined the NPT, \nleaving only five states worldwide currently outside the NPT regime. \nThe NPT Exporters (Zangger) Committee added China to its membership in \n1997.\n  The Nuclear Suppliers Group [NSG] continued its efforts to upgrade \ncontrol lists and export control procedures. NSG members confirmed \ntheir agreement to clarifications to the nuclear trigger list to accord \nwith trigger list changes agreed to by the members of the NPT Exporters \n(Zangger) Committee, and the International Atomic Energy Agency \npublished these understandings on September 16, 1997. The NSG also is \nactively pursuing steps to enhance the transparency of the export \nregime in accordance with the call in Principles 16 and 17 of the 1995 \nNPT Review and Extension Conference.\n  The NSG held an export control seminar in Vienna on October 8 and 9, \n1997, which described and explained the role of th NSG (and the Zangger \nCommittee) in preventing nuclear proliferation. The NSG also continued \nefforts to enhance information sharing among members regarding the \nnuclear programs of proliferant countries by (1) ``officially'' linking \nthe NSG members through a dedicated computer network allowing for real-\ntime distribution of license denial information, and by (2) creating a \nseparate session for exchange of information on the margins of the NSG \nplenary meeting.\n  NSG membership will increase to 35 with the acceptance of Latvia. The \nultimate goal of the NSG is to obtain the agreement of all suppliers, \nincluding nations not members of the regime, to control nuclear and \nnuclear-related exports in accordance with the NSG guidelines.\n\n\n                                Expenses\n\n  Pursuant to section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. \n1641(c)), I report that there were no expenses directly attributable to \nthe exercise of authorities conferred by the declaration of the \nnational emergency in Executive Order 12938 during the semiannual \nreporting period.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to provide \nassistance to rural cooperatives; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                       The Rural Cooperative Act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Rural \nCooperative Act, a measure proposed by the administration. Under \ncurrent law, the Rural Business--Cooperative Services within the Rural \nDevelopment Administration provides a wide variety of services for farm \ncooperatives. They conduct economic analysis, provide advice on how to \nform and best operate cooperatives and a wide variety of other services \nfor farm cooperatives, including how to deal with the complex laws \nunder which cooperatives operate.\n  Farm cooperatives are very important in rural America. They allow \nfarmers to come together to purchase goods, to sell their products, and \nto process their agricultural commodities under farmer ownership. Some \ncooperatives only perform one of those functions. Some do two or three \nof them. In all cases, they allow farmers to come together and more \neffectively bargain for a fair price.\n  Funding for cooperative services within the Department of Agriculture \nhas been under considerable constraint in recent years and it is now \ndifficult for the Department to provide the full range of services \nallowed by law to farm cooperatives. I do not want to see those \nservices reduced. But, I do agree with the administration, that \ncooperative services should also be available to those in rural areas, \nin addition to farmers who want to form cooperatives. Therefore, I am \nintroducing the administration-proposed bill to broaden the \nresponsibilities of the Department in this area. I do so, requesting \nthat the administration increase its request for funding to carry out \nthese additional responsibilities and will be urging that the \nAppropriations Committee appropriately increase funding in this area.\n  The bill provides that rural residents who are considering forming a \ncooperative for one of a number of purposes or who have formed a \ncooperative may receive a variety of kinds of assistance from USDA.\n  The types of cooperatives that would benefit would include those \npurchasing consumer goods, business products or services, health care, \nutilities, communications, child and day care, housing, credit, \ninsurance, or other goods or services. It would also include \ncooperatives that market goods made by members or goods made by the \ncooperative.\n  The Department could provide advice for such cooperatives including \nconducting economic surveys and analysis of proposed cooperative \nactivities. It would also conduct surveys of cooperatives and issue \nreports about them as well as promote rural cooperative principles and \npractices.\n  The bill authorizes such sums as might be necessary to carry out the \npurposes of the act.\n  I urge that the Congress consider and pass this bill in the coming \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1523. A bill to allow for the investment of joint Federal and \nState funds from the civil settlement of damages from the Exxon Valdez \noilspill; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         INVESTMENT OF ``EXXON VALDEZ'' TRUST FUNDS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill allow more sensible investment of the funds jointly received by \nthe Federal Government and the State of Alaska from the civil \nsettlement of damages arising from the Exxon Valdez oilspill.\n  The settlement provided for Exxon to pay the Federal and State \ngovernments a total of $900 million over a 10-year period ending in \n2001. Approximately $280 million remains to be paid under this \nagreement. Under the consent decree, the money is to be used for the \nrecovery of damaged resources, and is to be managed as a joint Federal-\nState trust fund, administered by the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee \nCouncil, which includes representatives of three Federal and three \nState agencies. Under the consent decree, moneys not immediately \nexpended are to be placed with the U.S. District Court, Fifth Circuit \nCourt Registry Investment System.\n  Recently, the trustees requested that Congress adopt measures to \nallow them to invest this money outside the Court Registry Investment \nSystem, in which earnings are limited to approximately 5 percent, and \nare further reduced by fees of 10 percent of the earnings. In the \nopinion of the trustees, even extremely conservative investment outside \nthe court registry could yield an additional $20 to $30 million by \n2002, which could greatly enhance continuing restoration projects.\n  This bill responds to the trustees' request. It will allow investment \noutside the court registry system. Let me emphasize, however, that this \nauthority is entirely discretionary. The trustees may use it to \nreinvest settlement moneys or not, as they deem appropriate. Further, \nMr. President, as an added protection, the district court must approve \nany reinvestment.\n  The bill also directs that the earnings on the new investment be used \nfor marine research and monitoring, and for community and fishing \nindustry economic restoration. This provision is needed to ensure \nattention to these important areas.\n  Here again, let me make sure I am absolutely clear. The bill I am \noffering does not prevent the purchase of land or easements. It simply \ndirects that the earnings--and only the earnings--on new investment go \nto other, equally valid purposes.\n  The trustee council has already spent a large part of the money \nreceived from Exxon on land acquisition and easements that limit the \nuse of land it has not purchased outright. To date, the total is about \n424,000 acres, and the trustees' intention is to purchase or restrict \nas much as 750,000 acres.\n  The Federal Government already owns 248 million acres of Alaska--more \nthan the eastern seaboard from Maine to Florida, which is home to one-\nthird of the entire population of the United States. Inside the spill \narea, there already are 20 different parcels of protected State and \nFederal lands, including the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, Katmai \nNational Park and Preserve, and the Chugach National Forest and Copper \nRiver Delta Critical Habitat Area.\n  Many of the trustees' additional land acquisitions have been for the \npurpose of habitat protection, and are valuable to the trustees' \nrestoration mission, but some have included the purchase of land that \nhas already been logged or land on which public access is restricted \ndespite being purchased by public funds. These purchases are not so \neasy to justify.\n  The trustees have already published plans to spend almost all of the \n$900 million. By the time Exxon makes its last payment, the only money \nnot already spent will be the 12 percent the council is tucking away in \na restoration reserve.\n  After inflation-proofing, interest on this account could provide \nabout $2.1 million annually for long-term research and economic \nreconstruction projects--or could vanish in more land acquisitions.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my bill also provides for the new investment \nauthority to sunset in 2002 unless the trustees bring to Congress their \nthoughts on how an independent board might be created to administer the \nfunds remaining after 2002. Personally, I'd like to see them recommend \nan independent, scientifically-oriented group to guide a long-term \nresearch program--a board that would call for proposals, arrange for \nscientific peer review, publish findings, and so forth, without the \nappearance of conflict that exists when the trustees are funding \nprojects in which their own agencies are involved.\n  This is a responsible approach to a difficult issue. It gives the \ntrustees the additional investment authority they want without \nprohibiting them from spending principal or the earnings from \ninvestments that remain in the court registry system however they \nchoose, including more land acquisition. It does, however, encourage \nthem to look at some areas that are equally important to the task of \nonce again making whole both the resources and the people affected by \nthe oil spill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the text of the bill to be \nprinted in the Record. I hope that we can take it up early next year, \nand urge my colleagues' support.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S12508]]\n\n                                S. 1523\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the joint \n     motion of the United States and the State of Alaska and the \n     issuance of an appropriate order by the United States \n     District Court for the District of Alaska, the joint trust \n     funds or any portion thereof, including any interest accrued \n     thereon, previously received or to be received by the United \n     States and the State of Alaska pursuant to the Agreement and \n     consent decree issued in United States v.

A bill require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nconduct an ongoing study of the health consequences of nuclear weapons \ntests; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE HEALTH STUDY LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill requiring \nstudies of the health effects of nuclear weapons testing. This would \nbuild upon the study by the National Cancer Institute that was released \nOctober 1 of this year.\n  On October 1, following some major news coverage, the NCI testified \nbefore the Senate Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee \non their efforts to connect nuclear weapons testing with thyroid \ncancer. The NCI testimony and the report released that day were \nstartling. Atomic bomb tests in Nevada during the 1950's exposed \nmillions of Americans--particularly children--to large amounts of \nradioactive iodine-131. The levels of radioactive iodine exposure is \nfar worse than previously reported by the Government. Hot spots where \nthe iodine-131 fallout was greatest includes many counties far away \nfrom Nevada, including New York, Massachusetts, and Iowa.\n  Hot spots were identified as receiving as high as 5-16 rads of \nexposure of iodine-131, with children being exposed to a risk up to 10 \ntimes higher. Iodine-131, which accumulates in the thyroid gland, has \nbeen linked to thyroid cancer. To give some understanding of the \nenormity of the U.S. atomic tests in Nevada, 116 million curies of \niodine-131 were released in the United States above ground tests. This \ncompares to 7.3 million from Chernobyl disaster the former Soviet \nUnion. The NCI report clearly shows that the U.S. atomic tests exposed \na lot of people to risks now considered unacceptable.\n  The topic hits very close to home for me. During the 1950's, I was \nliving in the small town of Cumming located in south-central Iowa. \nAlong with many Iowans, I lived in the hot spots detailed by the NCI \nstudy. Further, like many of my neighbors, I drank milk from the cows \nkept on our farm. This increased the risk faced by myself and my family \nbecause radioactive iodine accumulates in milk.\n  The NCI report has attracted a lot of attention. Much of this stems \nfrom the history of nuclear weapons testing. As we all know, the U.S. \nGovernment was fairly cavalier with its nuclear weapons program during \nthe early days of the cold war. Historians can argue about the reasons, \nbut most people recognize the terrible toll suffered by the American \npublic because of our nuclear weapons program. Only recently has the \nextent of exposure to radiation and other hazards to the ``down \nwinders'' living near nuclear weapons sites such as the Nevada test \nsite, Hanford in Washington State, and the Marshall Islanders in the \nSouth Pacific.\n  So it is no surprise that a report detailing exposure to millions of \nAmericans would attract attention. However, we need to continue the \nresearch into the health impact of nuclear weapons testing. That is why \nI am introducing this bill to require further study by the Department \nof Health and Human Services.\n  The HHS study will build upon the NCI study. There is strong evidence \nthat exposure to other radioactive isotopes that were spread by nuclear \nweapons tests such as strontium 90, cesium 137 and barium 140 could \nlead to bone cancer, leukemia, higher infant mortality, and a host of \nother illnesses. This needs to be examined. So do the nuclear weapons \ntests that took place not only at the Nevada test site, but at other \nplaces as well. For example, the NCI report did not examine the nuclear \nweapons testing conducted by the United States in Mississippi, Alaska, \nNew Mexico, Colorado, or the South Pacific. The studies should research \nnot only the United States nuclear weapons program, but also tests by \nforeign nations including the Soviet Union and its successor states, \nFrance, China, India, and Great Britain.\n  I also believe that such studies should be conducted in an open \nmanner. For example, this bill will require that the studies fall under \nthe review authority of the Advisory Committee on Energy Related \nStudies and other entities established by the Federal Government to \nensure public accountability over health related studies pertaining to \nnuclear weapon research, production, and testing. The bill also \nrequires that HHS report to Congress within 90 days of passage as to \nits plan for completing the studies, as well as report to Congress each \nyear on its progress.\n  This is a simple bill that seeks some understanding of the health \nconsequences of our nuclear weapons testing program. I would ask my \nfellow colleagues to review and support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I seek recognition today to join Senator \nBiden in introducing the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance \nAct of 1998. The purpose of this bill is to build on legislation we \npassed last Congress and provide education benefits to the families of \nslain or disabled State and local public safety officers.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents \nAssistance Act. This law provides for the education of the spouse and \ndependent children of Federal law enforcement officers who die or are \ntotally disabled in the line of duty.\n  I was moved to introduce last year's legislation after meeting with \nthe widow of Mr. Bill Degan, the U.S. marshal who was killed in the \ntragic incident at Ruby Ridge. Mrs. Karen Degan, his widow, brought to \nmy attention the fact that the families of slain Federal law \nenforcement officers were not eligible to receive the educational \nbenefits which the Government gives to the families of slain soldiers \nin our armed services. My legislation eliminated this disparity.\n  The program we created last year, however, is only available to the \nchildren of Federal law enforcement officers. Yet the idea behind the \nlaw applies equally to all public safety officers, Federal, State, or \nlocal. When someone gives his or her life protecting the safety and \nwell-being of the general public, it is the very least we can do to \nensure that the officer's children and/or spouse can continue on the \neducational path they would have followed had their parent or spouse \nnot been killed in the line of duty.\n  Today we seek to remedy this disparity between Federal and non-\nFederal officers by introducing the Public Safety Officers Educational \nAssistance Act of 1998. This legislation will extend these same \neducational benefits to the dependents of all public safety officers--\nFederal, State, county and local law enforcement officers, correctional \nofficers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given their lives in \nthe line of duty.\n  Under this bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which \nwill provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year \ncollege. This is the same amount of educational assistance the Federal \nGovernment provides to the dependents of slain or disabled veterans and \nFederal law enforcement officers. I would note that this program is \nsubject to appropriations and does not constitute an entitlement.\n  I would prefer that we did not have to worry about death and \ndisabling injuries for public safety officials, but it is a fact of \nlife that every year there are tragic losses. We are obligated to \nremember the families of those officers who have paid the ultimate \nprice to keep our streets and homes safe.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last year the Senate passed the Federal Law \nEnforcement Dependents Assistance Act. A law which provides for the \neducation of the spouse and dependent children of Federal law \nenforcement officers who die or are totally disabled in the line of \nduty.\n  The purpose of the legislation was to remove a significant financial \nburden from the families of these deceased officers and to allow them \nto continue on the educational path they would have followed had their \nparent or spouse not been killed in the line of duty.\n  This fall, several young men and women were able to go to college \nunder this program. Unfortunately, this program is only available to \nthe children of Federal law enforcement officers.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Public Safety Officers \nEducational Assistance Act of 1998. This legislation will extend these \nsame educational benefits to the dependents of all public safety \nofficers--Federal, State, county, and local law enforcement officers, \ncorrectional officers, and fire and rescue personnel--who have given \ntheir lives in the line of duty.\n  Under my bill, the Attorney General will administer a program which \nwill provide up to $4,485 per child, per year to attend a 4-year \ncollege. This is the same amount of educational assistance the Federal \nGovernment provides to veterans.\n  It is critical that we remember the families of those officers who \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our streets and homes safe. \nThis bill is intended to allow the dependents of public safety officers \nto continue with their education as they would have been able to do had \ntheir parent not been killed or totally disabled in the line of duty.\n  I have long been concerned about the plight of families of public \nsafety officers killed in the line of duty--this summer, I introduced \nan amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Act which provides for the \nfavorable tax treatment of survivor death benefits paid to the families \nof fallen officers. In that vein, this legislation offers assurance to \nthose in the public safety profession--and even to those considering \nservice as public safety officers--that their loved ones will be able \nto attain their educational goals in their absence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

I had the honor \nof knowing Fred both as a partner and a friend. He will be remembered \nas much for his professional accomplishments as for his humor.\n  Fred began his memorable career after passing the bar in 1962. He \nserved as a Rutland County grand juror and was the first assistant \nclerk for the Vermont House of Representatives from 1963 until 1968. \nFred then filled a seat on the board of aldermen until 1978, during \nwhich time he served as board president for 7 years. After his tenure \nas an alderman, he opened a law practice, at which I had the great \npleasure of having him as a partner.\n  Among his many interests, Fred was a member and governor of the \nRutland Moose Lodge, for which he was awarded the order's highest \ndegree in 1985. True to his nature, Fred gave a great deal back to his \ncommunity. He worked with the Salvation Army, Knights of Columbus, and \nthe Masonic Temple, among many others.\n  Fred had a marvelous wit and a wonderful sense of humor. He loved to \ntell stories and always thought the best of everyone.\n  Fred Carbine had many friends, and I consider myself lucky to be one \nof them. He was a brilliant lawyer and a wonderful man. I would like to \nextend my condolences to the family and friends of Fred \nCarbine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/12/senate-section/article/S12510-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12510-S12511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE CHILDREN'S INN\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nChildren's Inn of Sioux Falls, SD, and to pay tribute to two women, \nConnie Kolbrek and Marlene Weires, whose dedicated service\n\n[[Page S12511]]\n\nhas enlightened the lives of many South Dakota women and children.\n  This fall, the Children's Inn is celebrating its 20th anniversary of \nproviding emergency outreach services to women and children in the \ngreater Sioux Falls community. When the Children's Inn first opened its \ndoors in an unfurnished two-bedroom bungalow, its primary directive was \nto provide emergency shelter for children who are victims of abuse and \nneglect. Staff members realized that an unsafe environment for children \nwas also unsafe for adult victims of abuse, and the inn extended its \noutreach to all victims of domestic violence. Shortly thereafter, it \nbecame apparent that the inn's services were in high demand, and the \ninn moved to larger facilities and expanded its staff. Currently, the \ninn serves as many as 3,000 people annually and employs 39 staffers. \nWhile the inn continues to function under its founding purpose, it has \nexpanded its services to include a crisis phone line, drop-in \ncounseling, support groups for women and children, parenting classes, \nand classes for abusers.\n  Mr. President, the Children's Inn clearly has filled a significant \nvoid in the lives of many Sioux Falls women and children, and the 20th \nanniversary is a true milestone. However, none of its success would be \nrealized today if it were not for the tireless work of Connie Kolbrek \nand Marlene Weires. Connie served as the first executive director from \n1977 to 1984. Her dedication and commitment to children helped to \ntransform the inn from a simple idea on paper to a mainstay in the \nSioux Falls nonprofit community. Marlene has served as the inn's \nexecutive director from 1985 until present, and her selfless service \nhas produced many of the extension services which are available to the \npublic today. Although Marlene is planning her retirement, I am \nconfident that she will maintain her peripheral support. The Children's \nInn and the women and children of Sioux Falls were blessed with her \nmany years of service.\n  Again, I applaud the Children's Inn on its 20th anniversary, and \nrecognize the selfless work of the staff. Mr. President, I yield the \nfloor today, knowing that the Children's Inn is a beacon of hope for \nmany victims of abuse and neglect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/12/senate-section/article/S12510-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AWARD DINNER HONORING ORVILLE AND RUTH MERILLAT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

As founder of Carris Reels, a nationally \nrecognized enterprise, Henry was the epitome of everything that is good \nabout business.\n  He understood the importance of appreciating his good fortune and \ngiving something back to the community. Henry was an active advocate \nfor improved educational opportunities in the Rutland area. \nAccordingly, he served on the Rutland School Board and was instrumental \nin developing the Rutland Area Art Association.\n  In addition, Henry was a member of the board for Rutland's Regional \nMedical Center and was selected to act as president for the local \nchamber of commerce. In light of his outstanding achievements and \ndedication to the people of Vermont, Henry was named ``Man of the \nYear'' for Rutland and ``Citizen of the Year'' for the State.\n  At a ceremony recognizing his achievements, he stressed the \nimportance of family and friends.

Mr. President, on Sunday evening, the \nSenate completed its work on H.R. 2607, a bill providing appropriations \nfor the District of Columbia for fiscal year 1998.\n  I have serious concerns with several provisions of this bill--\nprovisions which I, in good conscience, cannot support.\n  Perhaps these problems could have been resolved had this bill been \nconsidered early and passed on time. There is a time to debate, \nhowever, and a time to act. This session of the 105th Congress is \nnearing a close, and that fact means that we must enact a D.C. funding \nbill--now.\n  One of my concerns centers on a provision included in the bill that \nwill grant permanent residence to almost 250,000 nationals of Central \nAmerica and Eastern Europe. Those covered by the provisions, including \nNicaraguans, Cubans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans, fled to the United \nStates and sought haven during the civil wars in Central America in the \n1980's. These individuals have been allowed to remain here temporarily \nunder various Government immigration programs and court settlements.\n  The 1996 Immigration Act, however, denied recourse to permanent \nresidency for most of this class. This provision grants permanent \nresidence to these nationals on a case-by-case basis if their return \nwould pose unusual hardship.\n  While I support this provision, I must once again state for the \nrecord my strong objections to the decision by the conferees to exclude \napproximately 18,000 Haitian refugees from this provision. This \nexclusion was not only patently unfair, but suggests almost a tin ear \non the racial implications of this action. In the absence of a good \nreason for this exclusion, I can see no other justification for denying \nthese individuals equal relief. I am certain that this is not the \nsignal this body intended to send.\n  I am heartened, however, that an agreement has been reached with the \nJustice Department that will allow \n\n[[Page S12512]]\n\nthese Haitians to remain in the country until this matter is resolved \nlegislatively. I am also encouraged by the commitment made by \ncongressional leadership to take up this issue during the next session \nof Congress. I encourage all of my colleagues to support legislation \nthat I have cosponsored, along with Senators Graham, Mack, Abraham, and \nKennedy that would resolve this issue.\n  I am also troubled by a provision in this bill that would prohibit \nthe District of Columbia from using local revenues to fund full \nreproductive health services for women.\n  Clearly it is within the jurisdiction of Congress to restrict Federal \nfunds for abortion services. That decision was upheld in 1980 by the \nSupreme Court in the Harris versus McRea decision. In that same ruling, \nhowever, the Court clearly asserted that decisions on abortion services \nfor poor women, financed with State funds, were within the authority of \nthe States.\n  Unfortunately for the people of the District of Columbia the Court \nhas provided no such protection. The people of this city, therefore, \ncannot make decisions regarding the use of locally raised revenue, for \nabortion services or any other purpose.\n  The result is that the District is used as a guinea pig for Congress' \nsocial experiments. In this instance, opponents of full access to \nreproductive health services, including abortion, for poor women are \nfurthering their agenda at the expense of democracy.\n  Again, I would have liked to have these matters resolved before the \nvote, however, I am hopeful that we can rectify them in the next \nsession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/12/senate-section/article/S12511-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE 50-STATE CIRCULATING QUARTER\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senate has approved unanimously \na bill I introduced with Senator D'Amato which will permit each State \nto design the back of the circulating quarter dollar. I would like to \nexpress my gratitude to Senator D'Amato for his work to ensure passage \nof this proposal before adjournment and to the long list of colleagues \nwho cosponsored this bill.\n  As we all know, the circulating quarters in use today are Washington/\nEagle quarters. They have a bust of George Washington on the ``head'' \nside and an eagle on the ``tail'' side. Under this legislation, \nbeginning in 1999, the mint will strike only statehood quarters until \nall 50 States are represented. Only the design on the back of quarters \nwill change. There will be no changes whatsoever to the size, weight, \nor other specifications of quarters. This uniformity is necessary to \nensure that these new quarters will continue to work in vending \nmachines, telephones, parking meters, and for other similar \ntransactions.\n  This program will operate for 10 years, with the mint producing five \ndifferent statehood coins per year. The order in which States will be \nrepresented is based on the order in which States ratified the \nConstitution and joined the Union.\n  Some might ask what the purpose of this proposal is; why not leave \nwell enough alone. It is my hope that this proposal will spark interest \nin every State across our Nation about its unique history. I hope that \nschool children begin to study the history of their States in search of \nan appropriate individual or emblem to represent their States on the \nreverse side of these quarters. I hope that artists, coin collectors, \nhistorians, and scholars debate and ultimately join together to suggest \nan appropriate representation for their State.\n  I know that there are a wide range of appealing options for my own \nState of Rhode Island. Of course, there is the founder of Rhode Island, \nRoger Williams or Anne Hutchinson, who, like Roger Williams, dedicated \nher life to the principles of religious freedom and tolerance. There is \nthe Anchor of Hope, which is our State motto and is shown on our flag. \nRhode Island is the Ocean State, so a seascape would be interesting \nproposal, as would be a lighthouse or a gull.\n  As the coins are minted, I hope that school children as well as \nadults will collect these coins, and, in doing so, will become curious \nabout the places these coins represent. This modest proposal could lead \nto a greater interest in geography and history.\n  The final design for each State will be selected by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury in consultation with the appropriate Governor, the \nCommission on Fine Arts, and the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory \nCommittee. Each State will nominate a design to the Secretary.\n  Last year, legislation was enacted which instructed the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to study the feasibility of a circulating commemorative \ncoin. That study found that there is considerable public interest in \nthe circulating commemorative quarter and that collecting such coins \nwould produce significant earnings. The bill that the Senate approved \ntoday will implement this program. Identical legislation has been \napproved by the House, and I urge the President to sign it into law \nwhen it reaches his desk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/12/senate-section/article/S12512-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GERALD T. LLOYD\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngood friend and great Vermonter, Gerald T. ``Giggy'' Lloyd. After 40 \nyears of dedicated service as fire chief for Rutland, VT, Giggy retired \nthis summer.\n  Giggy's memorable career has been spent protecting the people of \nVermont against fires. However, his concern about safety extends beyond \nthe people he protects. He is also concerned about the safety of the \npeople in his department. After 13 years as fire chief, Giggy has \naccomplished many remarkable tasks. When he first became fire chief in \n1985, his first concern was for the members of his department. He set \nout to improve their equipment and better train the employees to \nprotect them against harm, and he has accomplished that task. Since \nGiggy has been fire chief, there have been no serious injuries within \nthe department. Giggy's dedication and concern for others is an \noutstanding example for everyone to follow.\n  Giggy has extended himself beyond being fire chief as well. He became \nthe city's fire prevention officer in 1976 and worked tenaciously to \nincrease the use of safety features such as smoke alarms and fire \nresistant doors.\n  Giggy Lloyd has courageously committed his life to protecting the \npeople of Vermont, and he is the finest example of Vermont 's \ncommitment to excellence. Once again, I would like to extend my best \nwishes on Giggy Lloyd's retirement and congratulate him on a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/12/senate-section/article/S12512-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12512]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1997\n\n  Mr. COATS.
